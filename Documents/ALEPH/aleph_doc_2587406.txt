1    Key information
1.1    Our Company
We are BHP Billiton, a leading global resources company.
We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical and energy coal, conventional and unconventional oil and
gas, copper, aluminium, manganese, uranium, nickel and silver.
As at 30 June 2013, we had a market capitalisation of approximately US$147.1 billion. For FY2013, we reported net operating cash flow of US$18.3 billion,
revenue of US$66.0 billion and profit attributable to shareholders of US$10.9 billion. Throughout FY2013, our workforce comprised of approximately 128,800
employees and contractors working at 141 locations in 26 countries.
1.1.1    Our Charter
Our BHP Billiton Charter is the single most important means by which we communicate who we are, what we do and what we stand for. It is through Our
Charter we articulate our purpose, our strategy, the values we uphold and how we measure success. Our Charter is the foundation for our decision-making,
actions and behaviours.
Our Charter makes it clear that as we strive for success we must remain forthright in the things we value: Sustainability, Integrity, Respect, Performance,
Simplicity and Accountability. By working in a way that is consistent with Our Charter, we will continue to build on our success both today and for the long
term.
1.1.2    Our Operating Model
In FY2013, following the appointment of Andrew Mackenzie as Chief Executive Officer, organisational changes were made to consolidate our previous
Customer Sector Groups into five Businesses.
Our Operating Model sets out the relationship between the Businesses, Group Functions and Marketing and defines how we work, how we are organised
and how we measure performance.
Our Businesses
Our assets, operations and interests are separated into five business units. These Businesses are: Petroleum and Potash; Copper; Iron Ore; Coal; and
Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel. The Operating Model has been designed to ensure that decision-making remains as close to the Businesses as
possible.
Group Functions
Our Group Functions support the Businesses and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Group Management Committee (GMC).
Our Group Functions are primarily located in Melbourne, London and Singapore.
Marketing
Marketing is responsible for selling our products and for the purchase of all major raw materials; owning the supply chain from assets to markets and raw
materials from suppliers to assets; achieving market clearing prices for the Group’s products and managing price risk; and developing a single Company
view of the markets.
The core principles of the Operating Model include mandatory performance requirements; common organisational design; common systems and processes;
and common planning and reporting.
Table of Contents

1.3    Chairman’s Review
Dear Shareholder
In a volatile and uncertain year for global economies, I am pleased to report that your Company continued to perform well. BHP Billiton reported an
Attributable profit, excluding exceptional items, of US$11.8 billion, and the full-year dividend was increased by four per cent to 116 US cents per share.
These solid financial results were underpinned by strong operating performance and a key focus on productivity.
Over the last decade, industrialisation and urbanisation in emerging economies underpinned strong commodities consumption. We maintain a positive
outlook over the long term as the fundamentals of wealth creation, demographics and urbanisation continue to create demand for commodities across Asia
and other markets.
Table of Contents
5
Increased supply has, however, exerted downward pressure on many commodity markets more recently and we expect this trend to continue over the short
term. While lower rates of investment across the industry will ultimately lead to more balanced markets, all resources companies will need to improve
productivity and be flexible enough to adapt to change in this more challenging environment.
Against that backdrop, we will continue to focus on two constants that have guided us through our 150-year history. The first is the significance of what we
do. Rising living standards depend on economic growth, and we aim to safely, reliably and profitably supply the resources required to support economic
growth. This helps improve the living standards of millions of people around the world every day. The second is how we operate. This is outlined in Our BHP
Billiton Charter, which defines our values. Health and safety always come first. While our overall safety performance continued to improve, sadly, three
colleagues lost their lives at work. On behalf of the Board, I offer our sincere condolences to their families and friends. These tragic incidents highlight the
importance of remaining focused on providing a workplace where all of our people return home fit and well at the end of each day.
As part of Our Charter value of Sustainability, we strive to be an integral part of our communities, making a positive difference at the local, regional and
national level. We allocate one per cent of our pre-tax profits to community programs, which in 2013 was US$245.8 million. These funds support community
initiatives, such as the Colombia Resilience Project to alleviate poverty and hardship for vulnerable populations; the Royal Flying Doctor Service’s On the
Road initiative for people living, working and travelling in remote areas of Western Australia; the socio-economic component of our Black Economic
Empowerment programs in South Africa.
Our community programs are in addition to the US$11.6 billion in taxes and royalties we paid to governments and our broader economic contribution in terms
of jobs, capital investment and support of local businesses.
Looking ahead, we expect further volume growth at a lower unit cost as we continue to invest in our key commodities and major basins that provide the
foundations for shareholder value creation. We also announced a further US$2.6 billion investment in our Jansen Potash Project. A growing population and
improving incomes in emerging economies means the longer-term outlook for potash, a fertiliser that improves the yield and quality of agricultural production,
is strong. Over many years, the Group’s strategy has delivered significant value for shareholders, and we can expect a more productive and capital efficient
organisation to build on that track record.
This year, we also announced the retirement of Marius Kloppers and the appointment of Andrew Mackenzie as Chief Executive Officer of BHP Billiton.
Marius made BHP Billiton a safer and financially stronger company, and we thank him for his leadership. Andrew brings a unique combination of deep
industry knowledge and global management skills to the role, with more than 30 years’ experience in the oil and gas, petrochemicals and minerals
industries.
Andrew and his new senior management team are off to a great start. Together with our 128,800 employees and contractors in more than 140 operations
across the globe, they have delivered the record production and substantial productivity gains that underpinned our robust financial results. As the global
economy continues to strengthen, the talents and efforts of all our people and our low-cost, upstream strategy and diversification ensure we are well
positioned. Your Board is confident in the outlook for BHP Billiton and we thank you for your continued support of our Company.

1.4    Chief Executive Officer’s Report
6
I am honoured to deliver my first annual results as Chief Executive Officer of BHP Billiton and report that our Company’s enduring strategy and high-quality,
diversified portfolio delivered robust financial results in FY2013.
Our results reflect record production and substantial productivity gains offset by lower commodity prices. In FY2013, we achieved a thirteenth consecutive
annual production record at Western Australia Iron Ore and a 28 per cent increase in copper production at Escondida, Chile. In addition, liquids production at
our Onshore US operations increased by 76 per cent and our Queensland Coal operations in Australia returned to full supply chain capacity during the
period.
I took over the leadership of the Company in May from Marius Kloppers to whom I am very grateful for his comprehensive handover and leadership. Soon
after my appointment, changes were made to our Group Management Committee structure that effectively removed a layer of management and consolidated
our Businesses into five. This is part of our continuing efforts to simplify the organisation and bring our strategic and operational leadership closer to attain
our goal of becoming more productive and efficient than we are today.
Guided by Our BHP Billiton Charter and consistent strategy, our priorities in the near term are to protect our people and improve the health and safety of our
operations, create a more productive organisation, actively manage our portfolio, maintain a disciplined approach to capital management and support
sustainable development of our host communities.
Sadly, during FY2013, three of our colleagues lost their lives at work. This is clearly unacceptable. Eliminating risk is a critical, continual focus of everyone at
BHP Billiton. We continue to improve the process for effective management of the critical controls of our material health and safety risks. The health, safety
and wellbeing of our people is our primary responsibility. In FY2013, our total recordable injury frequency was 4.6 per million hours worked, a two per cent
improvement on FY2012.
In the absence of higher commodity prices, we have sharpened our focus on the Company’s productivity. We continue to find ways of working smarter to
obtain the most from our assets, orebodies, plant and machinery. We aim to create the right culture and supporting processes for our people so they are
engaged with our Company’s efforts to become more competitive.
We continue to actively manage our portfolio and have increased our focus on our major Businesses: Iron Ore, Petroleum, Copper and Coal, which, together
with Potash, provide optimum diversification. Divestments totalling US$6.5 billion were either announced or completed during FY2013, representing a
premium over average market valuations.
We believe that to maintain our position as one of the world’s leading companies, we must commit to high ethical business practices and governance
standards. We are committed to Our Charter value of Integrity, doing what is right and doing what we say we will do. This is evident in our anti-corruption
standards and the BHP Billiton Code of Business Conduct, which prohibits bribery and corruption in all our business dealings. All our leaders have the
responsibility for ensuring the requirements of the Code of Business Conduct are embedded across BHP Billiton.
Sustainability and supporting our host communities is central to Our Charter values. In FY2013, our community contributions amounted to US$245.8 million,
and we continue to strive to have a long-lasting positive impact on the quality of life for people in our host communities.
This is a challenging yet very rewarding time to be at the helm of the world’s leading diversified resources company. We believe our proven strategy, when
combined with our great orebodies and operational focus on productivity, will deliver stronger margins throughout the economic cycle, a simpler and more
capital efficient structure, a substantial increase in free cash flow and growth in shareholder value.

I would like to thank all our people, suppliers, customers, host communities and shareholders for their continued support over the past year. We could not
achieve our success without all of your support. The hard-working, disciplined and talented people at BHP Billiton are, and will always be, central to our
ongoing success. I look forward to leading you as we resource the future.

Chief Executive Officer
1.5    Our strategy and business model
1.5.1    Our consistent strategy
Our purpose
Our purpose is to create long-term shareholder value through the discovery, acquisition, development and marketing of natural resources.
Our strategy
Our strategy is to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity, geography and market.
We sell into globally integrated markets and aim to produce at full capacity throughout the economic cycle. Our leading position in the resources industry is
due to our unique, proven and consistent strategy. In line with our strategy, we pursue growth opportunities consistent with our core skills of:
•
evaluating, developing and extracting our resources in our Businesses;
•
•
distributing and selling our products, and managing financial risk associated with the revenue line through Marketing;
through our Group Functions, defining and governing world-class functional standards, which are implemented Group-wide.
This strategy means more predictable company performance over time which, in turn, underpins the creation of long-term sustainable value for our
shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate. We aim to deliver long-term sustainable value rather than being focused on
short-term returns.
Our values
In pursuing our strategy through all stages of the economic and commodity cycle, we are guided by Our Charter values of Sustainability; Integrity; Respect;
Performance; Simplicity; and Accountability.
Our overriding commitment is ensuring the safety of our people, and respecting our environment and the communities in which we work. This commitment
informs everything we do and influences every aspect of our work.
Operational capability is fundamental to our strategy and is reflected in Our Charter. In particular, our values of Performance – achieving superior business
results by stretching our capabilities, and Simplicity – focusing our efforts on the things that matter most.
Our success factors
We are successful when our people start each day with a sense of purpose and end the day with a sense of accomplishment; our communities, customers
and suppliers value their relationships with us; our asset portfolio

is world-class and sustainably developed; our operational discipline and financial strength enables our future growth; and our shareholders receive a
superior return on their investment.
1.5.2    Our business model
Exploration and evaluation

•
discovery through brownfield and greenfield exploring
acquiring and divesting
evaluating our portfolio
Over the past five years, brownfield exploration has increased our resource base around our portfolio of existing assets in large resource basins, which now
provides us with significant growth opportunities. This has allowed us to reduce brownfield exploration expenditure and rationalise our greenfield exploration
program to focus on copper in Chile and Peru and conventional oil and gas predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia.
We evaluate the results of our brownfield and greenfield exploration to identify future growth projects consistent with our strategy to own and operate large,
long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets. We also continually evaluate our portfolio and consider acquisition and divestment opportunities.
Development
•
evaluating and developing projects
The evaluation and development of large-scale resource projects generates significant value for BHP Billiton. We have a number of high-quality growth
projects currently under development. We also have a large number of growth opportunities in our project pipeline in varying stages of evaluation. In our
development process, these projects progress through feasibility to execution only after external approvals and rigorous internal review.
Potential expansion projects must compete for capital in BHP Billiton and are only approved if they meet our strict criteria for investment.
Extraction, processing and transportation

•
open-pit and underground mining

processing and refining
Across our global operations, the diversification of our portfolio of assets by commodity, geography and market continues to be one of our differentiating
features. Our goal is to safely operate all of our assets at capacity through mining, extracting, processing and transporting commodities.
We continue to set production records at a number of assets. Through the development and use of standard operating practices and technology, we are
driving efficiencies through improved capital intensity, labour productivity and increased utilisation of plant and machinery.
Our extraction and processing activities apply our ongoing sustainability obligations, including rehabilitation at the end of the asset life.

In order to develop customer and market-focused solutions, we have divided our marketing organisation between mineral marketing, centralised in
Singapore and petroleum product marketing, based in Houston, United States. Marketing manages the Group’s product sales and the purchase of all major
raw materials. It achieves market clearing prices for our products and is responsible for managing our credit and price risks.
Marketing also manages the supply chain of our products from assets to markets and the raw materials from suppliers to assets. This includes managing our
in-house freight requirements so as to procure high-quality, cost-effective shipping.
1.5.3    External factors and trends
Global economy
Economic conditions during the second half of FY2013 were affected by lower than expected growth in emerging economies. Weaker trade and soft
manufacturing activity pulled growth rates slightly below expectations in China. However, with employment conditions and income growth remaining
resilient, the Chinese Government has room to pursue reforms that support its agenda of stable, long-term growth.
Significant cuts in government spending affected growth in the United States, however this was offset by improved private sector demand, leading to modest
rates of economic growth overall. Housing and stock market prices have also strengthened household balance sheets over the past year. As a result, we are
confident the recovery will continue, although risks remain regarding the unwinding of monetary policy stimulus.
The renewed policy push in Japan is also positive for medium-term growth expectations, if the government can achieve its stated objectives. Europe
remained relatively stable during FY2013; however, we do not anticipate a strong or rapid recovery while fundamental structural problems remain.
Overall, we expect more balanced global growth over the long term as China continues to develop its economy and large developed economies, such as the
United States, grow despite fiscal challenges. We expect the rebalancing of the Chinese economy to be significant in terms of the nature of domestic
demand, as well as the types of goods and services the economy will produce. We expect these changes to take place gradually, particularly in relation to
savings behaviour and levels of fixed asset investment. We also see India and South East Asia as significant sources of economic growth in the long term.
Commodity prices
During FY2013, commodity markets were impacted by a slower pace of growth in China that was balanced in part by increased stability in European
sovereign debt markets and an improved private sector performance in the United States. In the case of most steelmaking raw materials, demand growth
rates outside China decreased, and combined with robust supply growth from seaborne sources, resulted in lower raw material prices than the previous year.
The metals commodities attracted lower prices than the previous year as a result of supply growing faster than demand. Conversely for energy commodities,
geopolitical tensions and United States economic improvements provided price support for crude oil, while the US gas prices increased due to increased
seasonal demand in the residential and commercial sector and decreased storage inventories from the previous year.
Exchange rates
We are exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to foreign currency sales and purchases as well as in relation to foreign currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities, including debt. We believe that active
Table of Contents
10
currency hedging does not provide long-term benefits to our shareholders. Because a majority of our sales are denominated in US dollars, and the US dollar
plays an important role in our organisation, we borrow and hold surplus cash predominantly in US dollars to provide a natural hedge. Operating costs and
costs of locally sourced equipment are influenced by fluctuations in local currencies, primarily the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Chilean peso and South
African rand. Foreign exchange gains and losses reflected in operating costs owing to fluctuations in the local currencies relative to the US dollar may
potentially offset one another. In addition, exchange rate markets often provide a theoretical natural hedge against movements in commodity prices. Volatility
increased during the year, with a strengthening of the US dollar in the last quarter of FY2013. Overall, the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and South African
rand ended FY2013 weaker against the US dollar, while the Chilean peso strengthened.
1.5.4    Our strategic priorities
Our senior management team has sharpened its focus on the following strategic priorities in order to execute the Company’s strategy and deliver sustainable
improvement in productivity.
Protect our people and improve the health and safety of our operations
The health, safety and wellbeing of our people are central to the success of our organisation. Regardless of where our people are located or the type of work
they undertake, we strive to create a working environment that is free from occupational illness or injury. Identifying and managing material risk is a critical
component of our management approach. By understanding and managing our risks, we provide greater protection for our people, communities and assets.
Create a more productive organisation
We continue to simplify our business in order to become more productive and a more capital efficient organisation. We recently implemented a new
organisational structure and we removed a layer of management to create a direct line of communication between our Chief Executive Officer and our
Businesses.
We are pursuing productivity improvements to sustain our competitiveness and capitalise on growth opportunities. We view productivity as a way of
operating that maximises the value for our shareholders, of our people, capital and assets. The inputs to productivity are capital intensity, labour productivity
and the utilisation of our plant and machinery. The outputs of productivity are unit revenues and costs that give us a superior margin.
Productivity will be enabled by our people being engaged in our drive to become more competitive by having our plant and machinery assets work harder
and our people work smarter. We seek to have a culture that fosters productivity and to make sure our people have the right skills and approach to do their
jobs better each day.
Active management of our portfolio
We have concentrated our efforts on those world-class basins where we enjoy economies of scale and a competitive advantage. Our focus on four major
Businesses of Iron Ore, Petroleum, Copper and Coal, together with Potash, provides optimum diversification.
Of the 18 major projects in execution at 30 June 2013, approximately 70 per cent are expected to deliver first production by the end of CY2014. The majority
of our development projects are brownfield in nature, which are inherently lower risk.
Table of Contents
11
We executed a targeted divestment program, with major transactions totalling US$6.5 billion announced or completed during the period. In these
transactions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
we sold our diamonds business, comprising our interests in the EKATI Diamond Mine and Diamonds Marketing operations, to Dominion Diamond
Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation);
we sold our non-operating interest in South African-based Richards Bay Minerals to Rio Tinto;
we sold our Yeelirrie uranium deposit in Western Australia to Cameco Corporation;
we announced the sale of Pinto Valley mining operation and the associated San Manuel Arizona Railroad Company to Capstone Mining Corp;
we sold our interest in the East and West Browse Petroleum joint ventures located offshore Western Australia to PetroChina International Investment
(Australia) Pty Ltd;
we extended our Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) long-term joint venture relationship with ITOCHU and Mitsui to include Jimblebar. This was
completed in July 2013 and aligns our interests across the WAIO supply chain, as well as driving simplicity and flexibility.
An operational review and temporary cessation of production at our BMA open-cut Gregory metallurgical coal mine in Queensland, Australia, also took place
in FY2013. We continue to evaluate the performance of all of our operations.
For further information on these events, refer to section 5.3 of this Annual Report.
Disciplined approach to capital management
The Group’s priorities for capital management remain unchanged: firstly, to invest in high-return growth opportunities throughout the economic cycle;
secondly, to maintain a solid ‘A’ credit rating and to grow our progressive dividend; and finally, to return excess capital to shareholders.
We have announced a reduction in capital and exploration expenditure from US$21.7 billion in FY2013 to US$16.2 billion in FY2014 (excluding deferred
stripping). By reducing annual capital expenditure and increasing competition for capital within the Group, we expect to achieve more sustainable, high
margin growth at a higher average rate of return on incremental investment.
The combination of a disciplined approach to capital expenditure and the continued success of the divestment program has strengthened the financial
position of the Company. This financial strength has allowed for a reduction in gearing in the second half of FY2013 and continued commitment to maintain a
solid ‘A’ credit rating. In addition, this approach underpins our progressive dividend policy, which has been demonstrated by an increase of the dividend for
FY2013 to 116 US cents per share, a four per cent increase year on year.
Support sustainable development of our host communities
The long-term nature of our operations allows us to establish long-term relationships with our host communities. We aim to make a positive contribution to
the lives of people who live near our operations and to society more generally.
As part of this commitment, we voluntarily invest one per cent of our pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in
community programs that aim to have a long-lasting, positive impact on the quality of life for people in our host communities. This includes implementing new
and supporting existing community projects.

The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc after deduction of the weighted average
number of shares held by the Billiton share repurchase scheme and the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Bonus Equity
Plan Trust and adjusting for the BHP Billiton Limited bonus share issue. Included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share are shares
contingently issuable under Employee Share Ownership Plans.
Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any exceptional items. Underlying EBIT is not an IFRS measure of profitability,
financial performance, or liquidity and may be defined and used in differing ways by different entities. Underlying EBIT is included in the FY2013
Consolidated Financial Statements as required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. We believe that Underlying EBIT provides useful information, but
should not be considered as an indication of, or alternative to, Attributable profit as an indicator of operating performance. See section 3.6.2 for more
information about this measure, including a reconciliation to profit from operations.
Underlying EBIT margin excludes third party product.
Underlying EBIT margin and Return on capital employed are non-IFRS measures. We believe that Underlying EBIT margin and Return on capital
employed provide useful information, but should not be

considered as an indication of, or alternative to, Attributable profit as an indicator of operating performance. See section 3.3 for more information
about this measure.
On 1 July 2010, the Group adopted the policy of classifying exploration cash flows which are not recognised as assets as Net operating cash flows. Previously such cash flows were
classified as net investing cash flows. The change in policy arose from amendments to IAS7/AASB7 ‘Cash Flows’. Comparative figures have been restated.
1.7    Our management of risk
1.7.1    Risk factors
We believe that because of the international scope of our operations and the industries in which we are engaged, there are numerous factors that may have
an effect on our results and operations. The following describes the material risks that could affect the BHP Billiton Group.
External risks
Fluctuations in commodity prices and impacts of ongoing global economic volatility may negatively affect our results, including cash flows and
asset values
The prices we obtain for our oil, gas and minerals are determined by, or linked to, prices in world markets, which have historically been subject to substantial
volatility. Our usual policy is to sell our products at the prevailing market prices. The diversity provided by our relatively broad portfolio of commodities does
not insulate the effects of price changes. Fluctuations in commodity prices can occur due to sustained price shifts reflecting underlying global economic and
geopolitical factors, industry demand and supply balances, product substitution and national tariffs. See section 3.4.1 for summaries of pricing trends for our
most significant commodities. The ongoing global economic volatility has negatively affected commodity market prices and demand. The ongoing
uncertainty and impact on global economic growth, particularly in the developed economies, may continue to adversely affect future demand and prices for
commodities. The impact of potential longer-term sustained price shifts and shorter-term price volatility, including the effects of unwinding the sustained
monetary stimulus in the United States, creates the risk that our financial and operating results including cash flows and asset values, will be materially and
adversely affected by unforeseen declines in the prevailing prices of our products.
Our financial results may be negatively affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations
Our assets, earnings and cash flows are influenced by a wide variety of currencies due to the geographic diversity of the countries in which we operate.
Fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies may have a significant impact on our financial results. The US dollar is the currency in which the
majority of our sales are denominated. Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our mines and processing plants are
located and also by those currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are determined. The Australian dollar, South African rand,
Chilean peso, Brazilian real and US dollar are the most important currencies influencing our operating costs. Over recent years, the level of exchange of
currencies in which the majority of our operating costs are incurred (in particular the Australian dollar, if sustained relative to US dollar denominated
commodity prices) has and may continue to adversely impact our profit margins. Given the dominant role of the US currency in our affairs, the US dollar is the
currency in which we present financial performance. We do not generally believe that active currency hedging provides long-term benefits to our
shareholders. From time to time, we consider currency protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances, subject to strict limits
established by our Board. Therefore, in any particular year, our financial results may be negatively affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Reduction in Chinese demand may negatively impact our results
The Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing over the past decade. Sales into China generated US$19.4 billion (FY2012:
US$21.6 billion), or 29.4 per cent (FY2012: 29.9 per cent), of our revenue
Table of Contents
15
in the year ended 30 June 2013. The FY2013 sales into China by Business included 58.8 per cent Iron Ore, 19.4 per cent Copper, 8.4 per cent Coal and
4.5 per cent Petroleum. A slowing in China’s economic growth could result in lower prices and demand for our products and negatively impact our results
including cash flows.
In response to its increased demand for commodities, China is increasingly seeking strategic self-sufficiency in key commodities, including investments in
existing businesses or new developments in other countries. These investments may adversely impact future commodity demand and supply balances and
prices.
Actions by governments or political events in the countries in which we operate could have a negative impact on our business
We have operations in many countries around the globe, which have varying degrees of political and commercial stability. We operate in emerging markets,
which may involve additional risks that could have an adverse impact upon the profitability of an operation. These risks could include terrorism, civil unrest,
nationalisation, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, leases, permits or other agreements, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital and
changes in laws and policy, as well as other unforeseeable risks. Risks relating to bribery and corruption, including possible delays or disruption resulting
from a refusal to make so-called facilitation payments, may be prevalent in some of the countries in which we operate. If any of our major operations are
affected by one or more of these risks, it could have a negative effect on the operations in those countries, as well as the Group’s overall operating results
and financial condition.
Our operations are based on material long-term investments that are dependent on long-term fiscal stability and could be adversely impacted by changes in
fiscal legislation. The mining industry has been identified as a source of tax revenue and can also be impacted by broader fiscal measures applying to
business generally.
Our business could be adversely affected by new government regulations, such as controls on imports, exports and prices. Increasing requirements relating
to regulatory, environmental and social approvals can potentially result in significant delays in construction and may adversely affect the economics of new
mining and oil and gas projects, the expansion of existing operations and results of our operations. We have oil and gas operations located in the Gulf of
Mexico region of the United States. A six-month moratorium on drilling was issued in June 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Even though the
moratorium has been lifted, the industry now faces more stringent permitting requirements. Delays or additional costs may occur in receiving future permits
for deepwater drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico.
Infrastructure, such as rail, ports, power and water, is critical to our business operations. We have operations or potential development projects in countries
where government provided infrastructure or regulatory regimes for access to infrastructure, including our own privately operated infrastructure, may be
inadequate or uncertain or subject to legislative change. These may adversely impact the efficient operations and expansion of our Businesses.
We operate in several countries where ownership of land is uncertain and where disputes may arise in relation to ownership. In Australia, the Native Title Act
1993 provides for the establishment and recognition of native title under certain circumstances. In South Africa, the Extension of Security of Tenure Act
(1997) and the Restitution of Land Rights Act (1994) provide for various landholding rights. Such legislation could negatively affect new or existing projects.
These regulations are complex, difficult to predict and outside of our control and could negatively affect our Company and results.

Business risks
16
Failure to discover new reserves, maintain or enhance existing reserves or develop new operations could negatively affect our future results and
financial condition
The demand for our products and production from our operations results in existing reserves being depleted over time. As our revenues and profits are
derived from our oil and gas and minerals operations, our results and financial condition are directly related to the success of our exploration and acquisition
efforts, and our ability to replace existing reserves. Exploration activity occurs adjacent to established operations and in new regions, in developed and less
developed countries. These activities may increase land tenure, infrastructure and related political risks. A failure in our ability to discover new reserves,
enhance existing reserves or develop new operations in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow the current level of our reserves could negatively affect our
results, financial condition and prospects.
Future deterioration in commodities pricing may make drilling some acreage and existing reserves uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future
drilling budget will depend on drilling results, commodity prices, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease
expirations, gathering systems, transportation pipelines and other infrastructure constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore and oil and gas reserves, and geological, technical and economic assumptions that are valid at
the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. The uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic
assumptions related to reserve recovery and require reserve restatements. Reserve restatements could negatively affect our results and prospects.
Potential changes to our portfolio of assets through acquisitions and divestments may have a material adverse effect on our future results and
financial condition
We regularly review the composition of our asset portfolio and from time to time may add assets to the portfolio or divest assets from the portfolio. There are a
number of risks associated with such divestments or acquisitions. These include adverse market reaction to such changes or the timing or terms on which
such changes are made, the imposition of adverse regulatory conditions and obligations, commercial objectives not being achieved as expected, unforeseen
liabilities arising from such changes to the portfolio, sales revenues and operational performance not meeting our expectations, anticipated synergies or cost
savings being delayed or not being achieved, inability to retain key staff and transaction-related costs being more than anticipated. These factors could
negatively affect our reputation, future results and financial condition.
Increased costs and schedule delays may adversely affect our development projects
Although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review process, many of our development projects are highly
complex and rely on factors that are outside our control, which may cause us to underestimate the cost or time required to complete a project. In addition, we
may fail to manage projects as effectively as we anticipate and unforeseen challenges may emerge.
Any of these may result in increased capital costs and schedule delays at our development projects, adversely affecting our development projects and
impacting anticipated financial returns.
Financial risks
If our liquidity and cash flow deteriorate significantly it could adversely affect our ability to fund our major capital programs
We seek to maintain a solid ‘A’ credit rating as part of our strategy; however, fluctuations in commodity prices and the ongoing global economic volatility may
continue to adversely impact our future cash flows and ability to
Table of Contents
17
access capital from financial markets at acceptable pricing. If our key financial ratios and solid ‘A’ credit rating are not maintained, our liquidity and cash
reserves, interest rate costs on borrowed debt, future access to financial capital markets and the ability to fund current and future major capital programs
could be adversely affected.
We may not recover our investments in mining, oil and gas assets, which may require financial write-downs
One or more of our assets may be impacted by changed market or industry structures, commodity prices, technical operating difficulties, inability to recover
our mineral, oil or gas reserves and increased operating cost levels. These may cause us to fail to recover all or a portion of our investment in mining and oil
and gas assets and may require financial write-downs adversely impacting our financial results.
The commercial counterparties we transact with may not meet their obligations which may negatively impact our results
We contract with a large number of commercial and financial counterparties, including customers, suppliers and financial institutions. The ongoing global
economic volatility has placed strains on global financial markets, reduced liquidity and adversely affected business conditions generally. We maintain a
‘one book’ approach with commercial counterparties to ensure that all credit exposures are quantified. Our existing counterparty credit controls may not
prevent a material loss due to credit exposure to a major customer or financial counterparty. In addition, customers, suppliers, contractors or joint venture
partners may fail to perform against existing contracts and obligations. Non-supply of key inputs, such as tyres, mining and mobile equipment and other key
consumables, may unfavourably impact costs and production at our operations. These factors could negatively affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
Operational risks
Cost pressures and reduced productivity could negatively impact our operating margins and expansion plans
Cost pressures may continue to occur across the resources industry. As the prices for our products are determined by the global commodity markets in which
we operate, we do not generally have the ability to offset these cost pressures through corresponding price increases, which can adversely affect our
operating margins. Notwithstanding our efforts to reduce costs and a number of key cost inputs being commodity price-linked, the inability to reduce costs
and a timing lag may adversely impact our operating margins for an extended period.
Our Australian-based operations may continue to be affected by the Australian Fair Work Act 2009 as labour agreements expire and businesses are required
to collectively bargain with unions. In some instances labour unions are pursuing wage claims in the bargaining process, and/or claims about union access
and involvement in operational decision-making. These claims may adversely affect workplace flexibility, productivity and costs. Industrial action in pursuit of
claims associated with the bargaining process has occurred in some Businesses, and is likely to continue to occur as unions press for new claims as part of
the bargaining process.
A number of our operations, such as aluminium and copper, are energy or water intensive and, as a result, the Group’s costs and earnings could be
adversely affected by rising costs or by supply interruptions. These could include the unavailability of energy, fuel or water due to a variety of reasons,
including fluctuations in climate, significant increases in costs, inadequate infrastructure capacity, interruptions in supply due to equipment failure or other
causes and the inability to extend supply contracts on economical terms.
These factors could lead to increased operating costs at existing operations and could negatively impact our operating margins and expansion plans.

Unexpected natural and operational catastrophes may adversely impact our operations
We operate extractive, processing and logistical operations in many geographic locations both onshore and offshore. Our key port facilities are located at
Port Hedland and Hay Point in Australia. We have 12 underground mines, including seven underground coal mines. Our operational processes may be
subject to operational accidents such as port and shipping incidents, underground mine and processing plant fire and explosion, open-cut pit wall failures,
loss of power supply, railroad incidents, loss of well control, environmental pollution and mechanical critical equipment failures. Our operations may also be
subject to unexpected natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, flood, hurricanes and tsunamis. Our northwest Western Australia iron ore, Queensland coal
and Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operations are located in areas subject to cyclones or hurricanes. Our Chilean copper operations are located in a known
earthquake and tsunami zone. Based on our claims, insurance premiums and loss experience, our risk management approach is not to purchase insurance
for property damage, business interruption and construction-related risk and primary liability exposures. Existing business continuity plans may not provide
protection for all of the costs that arise from such events. The impact of these events could lead to disruptions in production, increased costs and loss of
facilities more than offsetting premiums saved, which would adversely affect our financial results and prospects. Third party claims arising from these events
may exceed the limit of liability insurance policies we have in place.
Our non-controlled assets may not comply with our standards
Some of our assets are controlled and managed by joint venture partners or by other companies. Management of our non-controlled assets may not comply
with our management and operating standards, controls and procedures, including our health, safety, environment and community (HSEC) standards.
Failure to adopt equivalent standards, controls and procedures at these assets could lead to higher costs and reduced production and adversely impact our
results and reputation.
Breaches in our information technology security processes may adversely impact the conduct of our business activities
We maintain global information technology (IT) infrastructure, applications and communications networks to support our business activities. These systems
could be subject to security breaches resulting in theft, disclosure or corruption of information, including information relating to acquisitions and divestments,
strategic decision-making, investment market communications or commercially sensitive information relating to major contracts. Security breaches could also
result in misappropriation of funds or disruptions to our business operations.
Sustainability risks
HSEC impacts, incidents or accidents and related regulations may adversely affect our people, operations and reputation or licence to operate
Due to the nature of our operations, HSEC incidents or accidents and related regulations may adversely affect our reputation or licence to operate.
Safety
Potential safety events that may have a material adverse impact on our operations include fire, explosion or rock fall incidents in underground mining
operations, personnel conveyance equipment failures in underground operations, aircraft incidents, incidents involving light vehicles and mining mobile
equipment, ground control failures, well blowouts, explosions or gas leaks, isolation working from heights or lifting operations.
Table of Contents
Environment
19
Environmental incidents that have the potential to create a material impact include uncontrolled tailings containment breaches, subsidence from mining
activities, escape of polluting substances and uncontrolled releases of hydrocarbons.
Our operations by their nature have the potential to impact biodiversity, water resources and related ecosystem services. Changes in scientific understanding
of these impacts, regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations may prevent or delay project approvals and result in increased costs for mitigation,
offsets or compensatory actions.
We provide for operational closure and site rehabilitation. Our operating and closed facilities are required to have closure plans. Changes in regulatory or
community expectations may result in the relevant plans not being adequate. This may impact financial provisioning and costs at the affected operations.
Community
We contribute to the communities in which we operate by providing skilled employment opportunities, salaries and wages, taxes and royalties and
community development programs, including a commitment to one per cent of pre-tax profits invested in community programs. Notwithstanding these actions,
local communities may become dissatisfied with the impact of our operations or oppose our new development projects, including through litigation,
potentially affecting costs and production, and in extreme cases viability. Community related risks may include community protests or civil unrest, delays to
proposed developments and inadvertent breaches of human rights or other international laws or conventions.
Health
Health risks faced include fatigue and occupational exposure to noise, silica, manganese, diesel exhaust particulate, fluorides, coal tar pitch, nickel and
sulphuric acid mist. Longer-term health impacts may arise due to unanticipated workplace exposures or historical exposures of our workforce to hazardous
substances. These effects may create future financial compensation obligations.
We invest in workplace and community health programs, where indicated by risk assessment. However, infectious diseases such as HIV and malaria may
have a material adverse impact upon our workers or on our communities, primarily in Africa. Because we operate globally, we may be affected by potential
pandemic influenza outbreaks, such as A(H1N1) and avian flu, in any of the regions in which we operate.
HSEC legislation
The nature of the industries in which we operate means that many of our activities are highly regulated by health, safety and environmental laws. As
regulatory standards and expectations are constantly developing, we may be exposed to increased litigation, compliance costs and unforeseen
environmental rehabilitation expenses.
Legislation requiring manufacturers, importers and downstream users of chemical substances, including metals and minerals, to establish that the
substances can be used without negatively affecting health or the environment may impact our operations and markets. These potential compliance costs,
litigation expenses, regulatory delays, rehabilitation expenses and operational costs could negatively affect our financial results.
Hydraulic fracturing
Our Onshore US operations involve hydraulic fracturing, an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry to stimulate production of natural gas
and oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and a small amount of chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-
bearing rock formation, to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in our drilling and completion
programs.
Table of Contents
20
Attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.
Increased regulation could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. The
hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by relevant state regulatory bodies. Some states in the United States are considering changes to
regulations in relation to permitting, public disclosure, and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing and related operations. Arkansas,
Louisiana and Texas have adopted various laws, regulations or issued regulatory guidance concerning hydraulic fracturing.
Several US federal agencies are reviewing or advancing regulatory proposals concerning hydraulic fracturing and related operations. The US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) commenced a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water resources and issued a non-
determinative Progress Report in December 2012. The EPA is expected to issue a final report for peer review in CY2014. The US Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) issued a revised proposed rule that would impose new requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations conducted on federal lands,
including the disclosure of chemical additives used. Activity at the federal level, including the ongoing EPA study, BLM rules and other analysis by federal
and state agencies to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing could spur additional legislative or regulatory actions.
While we have not yet realised a material delay or substantially higher operating costs as a result of current regulatory requirements in our Onshore US
operations, we cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted and what such actions would require or prohibit.
Additional legislation or regulation could subject our operations to delays and increased costs, or prohibit certain activities, which could adversely affect the
financial performance of our Onshore US operations.
Climate change and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets
Carbon-based energy is a significant input in a number of the Group’s mining and processing operations and we have significant sales of carbon-based
energy products.
A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response to the impacts of climate change.
Under the December 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed countries established individual greenhouse gas targets and developing countries established
national mitigation actions. The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which came into effect on 1 January 2005, has had an impact on
greenhouse gas and energy-intensive businesses based in the EU. Our Petroleum Assets in the United Kingdom are currently subject to the EU ETS, as are
our EU-based customers. Elsewhere, there is current and emerging climate change regulation that will affect energy prices, demand and margins for carbon-
intensive products. The Australian Government’s response has included the introduction in 2001 of a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by the year
2020, and a carbon pricing scheme which commenced with a fixed price on 1 July 2012. From a medium to long-term perspective, we are likely to see some
changes in the cost position of our greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries where we
operate. These proposed regulatory mechanisms may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our suppliers and customers. Inconsistency of
regulations, particularly between developed and developing countries, may also change the competitive position of some of our assets. Assessments of the
potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the many countries where we
operate. The South African Government plans to introduce a carbon tax beginning in 2015; however the details are not yet finalised. Carbon pricing has also
been discussed as part of a broader tax reform package in Chile.
The physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include
changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased storm intensities and higher temperatures. These effects may adversely impact the
productivity and financial performance of our operations.

A breach of our governance processes may lead to regulatory penalties and loss of reputation
We operate in a global environment straddling multiple jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks. Our governance and compliance processes, which
include the review of internal control over financial reporting and specific internal controls in relation to offers of things of value to government officials and
representatives of state-owned enterprises, may not prevent future potential breaches of law, accounting or governance practice. The BHP Billiton Code of
Business Conduct, together with our mandatory policies, such as the anti-corruption and the competition policies, may not prevent instances of fraudulent
behaviour and dishonesty nor guarantee compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. This may lead to regulatory fines, disgorgement of profits,
litigation, loss of operating licences or reputational damage.
1.7.2    Approach to risk management
We believe that the identification and management of risk is central to achieving our corporate purpose of creating long-term shareholder value.
Risk will manifest itself in many forms and has the potential to impact our health and safety, environment, community, reputation, regulatory, market and
financial performance and, thereby, the achievement of our corporate purpose.
By understanding and managing risk, we provide greater certainty and confidence for our shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and for the
communities in which we operate. Successful risk management can be a source of competitive advantage.
Our risks are managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The natural diversification in our portfolio of commodities, geographies, currencies, assets and liabilities
is a key element in our risk management approach.
Risk management is embedded in our critical business activities, functions and processes. Materiality and our tolerance for risk are key considerations in our
decision-making.
Risk issues are identified, analysed and assessed in a consistent manner. Performance requirements exist for the identification, assessment, control and
monitoring of material risk issues that could threaten our corporate purpose and business plans. These include:
•
•
•
The potential for impacts on the achievement of our corporate purpose and business plans is identified through risk assessments using approved
materiality and tolerability criteria. The severity of any risk event is assessed according to a matrix that describes the degree of harm, injury or loss from
the most severe impact associated with that risk event, assuming reasonable effectiveness of controls.
A risk assessment (risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation) is conducted for material risk issues.
Risk controls are designed, implemented, operated and assessed to produce a residual risk that is tolerable. Performance standards are established
for critical controls over material risks with supporting monitoring and verification processes.
We have established processes that apply when entering or commencing new activities in higher governance risk countries. Risk assessments and a
supporting risk management plan are required to ensure that potential reputation, legal, business conduct and corruption-related exposures are tolerable and
legislative compliance is maintained, including relevant anti-corruption legislation and the application of any sanctions or trade embargos.
Our risk management governance approach is described in sections 5.13.1 and 5.14.

1.7.3    Management of principal risks
The scope of our operations and the number of industries in which we operate and engage mean that a range of factors may impact our results. Material risks
that could negatively affect our results and performance are described in section 1.7.1 of this Annual Report. Our approach to managing these risks is
outlined below.
Principal risk area
External risks
Risks arise from fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates,
demand changes in major markets (such as China or Europe) or actions by
governments and political events that impact long-term fiscal stability.
Business risks
Executing our business strategy creates risks related to identifying and proving
reserves, adding and divesting assets and managing our capital development
projects.
Risk management approach
The diversification of our portfolio of commodities, geographies and
currencies is a key strategy for reducing volatility. Section 3.4 describes
external factors and trends affecting our results and note 29 ‘Financial
risk management’ to the financial statements outlines the Group’s
financial risk management strategy, including market, commodity, and
currency risk. The Financial Risk Management Committee oversees
these, as described in section 5.15. We engage with governments and
other key stakeholders to ensure the potential impacts of proposed fiscal,
tax, resource investment, infrastructure access and regulatory changes
are understood and where possible mitigated.
We support our business strategy through minerals and petroleum
exploration programs. The Group Resource and Business Optimisation
function provides governance and technical leadership for Mineral
Resource development and Ore Reserves reporting as described in
section 2.13.2 and section 2.6. Our governance over reporting of
Petroleum reserves is described in section 2.13.1.
We have established investment approval processes that apply to all
major capital projects and asset divestment and acquisitions. The
Investment Committee oversees these as described in section 5.15. The
Group Project Management function additionally ensures that the
optimum framework and capabilities are in place to deliver safe,
predictable and competitive projects. Additionally we have established
project hubs as operating centres for the study and execution of a
Table of Contents
pipeline of major capital projects using a program management
approach.
23
Principal risk area
Financial risks
Continued volatility in global financial markets may adversely impact future
cash flows, the ability to adequately access and source capital from financial
markets and our credit rating. This may impact planned expenditures, as well as
the ability to recover investments in mining and oil and gas projects. In addition,
the commercial counterparties (customers, suppliers and financial institutions)
we transact with may, due to adverse market conditions, not meet their
obligations.
Operational risks
Operating cost pressures and reduced productivity could negatively impact
operating margins and expansion plans. Non-controlled assets may not comply
with our standards. Unexpected natural and operational catastrophes may
adversely impact our operations. Breaches in IT security processes may
adversely impact the conduct of our business activities.
Risk management approach
We seek to maintain a solid ‘A’ credit rating, supported by our portfolio
risk management strategy. As part of this strategy, commodity prices and
currency exchange rates are not hedged, and wherever possible we take
the prevailing market price, which serves to mitigate counterparty
performance risk. We use Cash Flow at Risk analysis to monitor
volatilities and key financial ratios. Credit limits and review processes are
established for all customers and financial counterparties. The Financial
Risk Management Committee oversees these as described in section
5.15. Note 29 ‘Financial risk management’ to the financial statements
outlines our financial risk management strategy.
We seek to ensure that adequate operating margins are maintained
through our strategy to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost and
expandable upstream assets.
The Group’s concentrated effort to reduce operating costs and drive
productivity improvements has realised tangible results, with a reduction
in controllable costs.
The capability to sustain productivity improvements is being further
enhanced through continued refinements to our Operating Model. The
Operating Model is designed to deliver a simple and scalable
organisation, providing a competitive advantage through defining work,
organisation and performance measurement. Defined global business
processes, including 1SAP, provide a standardised way of working
across the organisation. Common processes generate reliable data and
improve operating discipline. Global sourcing arrangements have been
established to ensure continuity of supply and competitive costs for key
supply inputs. We seek to influence the application of our standards to
non-controlled assets.
Through the application of our risk management processes, we identify
material catastrophic operational risks and implement the critical controls
and performance requirements to maintain control effectiveness.
Business continuity plans are required to be established to mitigate
consequences. Consistent with our portfolio risk management approach,
we continue to be largely self-insured for losses arising from property
damage, business interruption and construction.
24
Risk management approach
IT security controls to protect IT infrastructure, applications and
communication networks and respond to security incidents are in place
and subject to regular monitoring and assessment. To maintain adequate
levels of protection, we also continue to monitor the development of
threats in the external environment and assess potential responses to
those threats.
Our approach to sustainability risks is reflected in Our Charter and
described in section 2.8. A comprehensive set of Group Level Documents
(GLD) set out Group-wide HSEC-related performance requirements to
ensure effective management control of these risks.
Our Code of Business Conduct sets out requirements related to working

Sustainability risks
HSEC incidents or accidents and related regulations may adversely affect our
people, operations and reputation or licence to operate. The potential physical
impacts and related government regulatory responses to climate change and
greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets. Given
that we operate in a challenging global environment straddling multiple
jurisdictions, a breach of our governance processes may lead to regulatory
penalties and loss of reputation.
with integrity, including dealings with government officials and third
parties. Processes and controls are in place for the financial control over
financial reporting, including under Sarbanes-Oxley. We have
established anti-corruption and antitrust related performance
requirements overseen by the Legal and Compliance function. The
Disclosure Committee oversees our compliance with securities dealing
obligations and continuous and periodic disclosure obligations.

2.2    Business overview
2.2.1    Petroleum and Potash Business
Petroleum
Our Petroleum Business includes exploration, development, production and marketing activities in more than 12 countries around the globe. We have
production operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Onshore US and Australia, as well as in the United Kingdom, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and
Pakistan. We produce crude oil and condensate, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Our headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, United States.
The Petroleum portfolio was expanded in 2011, when we made a significant investment in the unconventional shale business with the acquisition of the
Fayetteville shale area in the US state of Arkansas, from Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Later that same year, we purchased Petrohawk Energy
Corporation, which held acreages in the US states of Texas and Louisiana. Together these acquisitions now form our Onshore US operations.
Our overall production for FY2013 was 235.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). This was mainly attributable to our US and Australian operations,
which produced 129.8 MMboe and 79.9 MMboe, respectively, with the majority of US production coming from Onshore US, which produced 99.2 MMboe.
Operations outside Australia and the United States delivered the remaining production volumes. Information relating to our oil and gas reserves is set out in
section 2.13.1.
During FY2013, we completed the sale of our 8.33 per cent interest in the East Browse Joint Venture and 20 per cent interest in the West Browse Joint
Venture, located offshore Western Australia, to PetroChina International Investment (Australia) Pty Ltd for US$1.7 billion, inclusive of customary purchase
price adjustments.
Table of Contents
Our production operations include:
United States
Gulf of Mexico
27
We operate two fields in the Gulf of Mexico (Shenzi with a 44 per cent interest and Neptune with a 35 per cent interest) and hold non-operating interests in
three other fields (Atlantis with a 44 per cent interest, Mad Dog with a 23.9 per cent interest, and Genesis with a 4.95 per cent interest). All the fields are
located 155–210 kilometres offshore of Louisiana, United States. We also own 25 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, of the companies that own and
operate the Caesar oil pipeline and the Cleopatra gas pipeline. These pipelines transport oil and gas from the Green Canyon area, where all of our fields are
located, to connecting pipelines that transport product onshore. Our oil production is delivered to refineries along the Gulf Coast of the United States.
Onshore US
We produce oil, NGLs and natural gas in four shale areas: Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville. The Eagle Ford area has two fields, Black
Hawk and Hawkville. The Permian area consists of the Delaware and South Midland basins.
Our combined leasehold acreage onshore in the United States is approximately 1.5 million net acres. Our ownership interests in those leases range from
less than one per cent to 100 per cent. At 30 June 2013, we held an interest in approximately 7,200 gross wells and approximately 2,300 net wells. We acted
as joint venture operator for approximately 33 per cent of our gross wells. Production in FY2013 was 99.2 MMboe up from 85.6 MMboe in FY2012.
Onshore US shale areas
Shale reservoirs are characterised by low permeability, so it is necessary to stimulate the reservoir to create additional permeability and, therefore, the flow of
liquids and gas to the wellbore. Extracting oil and gas from shale involves hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process developed to efficiently
access supplies of oil and natural gas locked inside dense subsurface rock formations, such as shale. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and a
small amount of chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the well to produce commercial volumes.
The development phase of an onshore shale operation requires an extensive drilling and completion program, which may include associated gas
compression and treatment facilities and connecting pipelines. Much of our
Table of Contents
28
development of the shale reservoirs utilises horizontal drilling with average lateral lengths between 1,200 and 1,500 metres. We enter into service contracts
with third parties to provide drilling and completion services at our operated sites. At the end of FY2013, we had 40 drilling rigs in operation.
The Eagle Ford and Permian areas are focused on hydrocarbon liquids. The Eagle Ford area is located in south Texas, where our leasehold acreage
comprises 0.3 million net acres. The Permian area is located in west Texas, where our leasehold acreage comprises 0.5 million net acres. During FY2013,
we continued to drill and evaluate the Permian area. Production volume from the Permian area was 1 MMboe. The combined production in FY2013 from our
liquids-focused Eagle Ford and Permian areas was 33.4 MMboe, with a production mix of 42 per cent natural gas, 23 per cent NGLs and 35 per cent crude
oil and condensate.
The Haynesville and Fayetteville areas are focused on natural gas. The Haynesville area is located in northwest Louisiana and east Texas, where our
leasehold acreage comprises 0.2 million net acres. The Fayetteville field is located in north central Arkansas, where our leasehold acreage comprises
0.4 million net acres. The Haynesville and Fayetteville areas had combined production in FY2013 of 65.8 MMboe of natural gas.
Oil and gas production is sold domestically in the United States, with connections to intrastate and interstate pipelines. Prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas
are based on US regional price indices; including West Texas Intermediate prices for oil, Henry Hub prices for natural gas and Mont Belvieu prices for NGLs.
Australia
Bass Strait
Together with our 50-50 joint venture partner, Esso Australia (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil), we have been producing oil and gas from Bass Strait for over 40
years, having participated in the original discovery of hydrocarbons in 1965. The Bass Strait operations are located between 25 and 80 kilometres off the
southeastern coast of Australia. We sell the majority of our Bass Strait crude oil and condensate production to refineries along the east coast of Australia
under 12-month term contracts. The contract price is based on the average Dated Brent price. Gas is piped onshore to the joint venture’s Longford
processing facility, from which we sell our share of production to domestic distributors under contracts with periodic price reviews.
Minerva
We are the operator of Minerva (90 per cent interest), a gas field located 11 kilometres south-southwest of Port Campbell in western Victoria. The operation
consists of two subsea wells, with gas piped onshore to a processing plant. After processing, the gas is delivered into a pipeline and sold domestically on
long-term contracts.
North West Shelf
We are a joint venture participant in the North West Shelf Project, located approximately 125 kilometres northwest of Dampier in Western Australia. The
North West Shelf Project was developed in phases: the domestic gas phase supplies gas to the Western Australian domestic market, mainly under long-term
contracts, and a series of liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion phases supplying LNG to buyers in Japan, Korea and China under a series of long-term
contracts. Gas is piped to the Karratha Gas Plant for processing. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), condensate and LNG are transported to market by ship,
while domestic gas is transported by the Natural Gas and Pilbara Energy pipelines. We are also a joint venture participant in four nearby oil fields. All the
North West Shelf gas and oil joint ventures are operated by Woodside.
Pyrenees
We operate three oil fields in Pyrenees, which are located offshore approximately 23 kilometres northwest of Northwest Cape, Western Australia. We had an
effective 62 per cent interest in the fields as at 30 June 2013,
Table of Contents
29
based on inception to date production from two permits in which we have interests of 71.43 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. This percentage fluctuates
depending on the proportion of production from the various fields. The project uses a Floating, Production, Storage and Off-take (FPSO) facility. The crude oil
produced is sold internationally on the spot market.
Stybarrow
We operate an oil field (50 per cent interest) in Stybarrow, which is located 55 kilometres west-northwest of Exmouth, Western Australia. The project uses a
FPSO facility. The crude oil produced is sold internationally on the spot market.
Other production operations
Algeria
Our Algerian operations comprise an effective 38 per cent interest in the ROD Integrated Development, which consists of six satellite oil fields that pump oil
back to a dedicated processing train and is sold on a spot basis to international markets. Our interest in ROD is subject to a contractual determination to
ensure interest from participating association leases is accurately reflected. Future redetermination of our interest may be possible under certain conditions.
United Kingdom
We hold a 16 per cent non-operating interest in the Bruce oil and gas field in the North Sea and operate the Keith oil and gas field (31.83 per cent share), a
subsea tie-back, which is processed via the Bruce platform facilities.
We are also the operator of Liverpool Bay, United Kingdom (46.1 per cent interest). The integrated development consists of five producing offshore oil and
gas fields in the Irish Sea, located approximately 10 kilometres off the northwest coast of England, the Point of Ayr onshore processing plant in North Wales
and associated infrastructure. We deliver the Liverpool Bay gas by pipeline to E.ON’s Connah’s Quay power station. The crude oil produced is sold
internationally on the spot market.
Trinidad and Tobago
We operate the Greater Angostura field (45 per cent interest in the production sharing contract), an integrated oil and gas development, located offshore, 40
kilometres east of Trinidad. The crude oil is sold on a spot basis to international markets, while the gas is sold domestically on term contracts.
Pakistan
We operate the Zamzama gas project (38.5 per cent interest) in Sindh province of Pakistan. Both gas and condensate are sold domestically on term
contracts in accordance with the Pakistan Government pricing policies.

Shenzi Water Injection
36
The Shenzi Water Injection program includes drilling and completion of five water injection wells and provides facilities to inject up to 125 thousand barrels
per day (Mbbl/d) of water at 7,000 pounds per square inch (psi). The program was approved as part of the original sanctioned Shenzi project, which began
production in 2009 to supplement aquifer pressure for additional recovery. To date, Water Injector (WI) #1 and WI #2 have been drilled and completed. As of
30 June 2013, drilling of WI #3 was underway and is expected to be completed in CY2013. US$344 million of costs had been incurred as of 30 June 2013.
We are the operator with a 44 per cent interest and Repsol and Hess Corporation each hold a 28 per cent interest.
Atlantis South Water Injection
The Atlantis South Water Injection project is in the execution phase and involves drilling four subsea water injectors, tying them into the existing
infrastructure and commissioning the 75 Mbbl/d of water injection facilities. This water injection project mitigates natural production decline due to low aquifer
pressure. Our share of development costs is approximately US$246 million, of which US$237 million was incurred as of 30 June 2013. BP is the operator
and we hold a 44 per cent working interest.
Onshore US
BHP Billiton’s Onshore US drilling and development expenditure in FY2013 was US$4.8 billion, with US$3.9 billion spent in the liquids-focused areas of
Eagle Ford and Permian, and US$0.9 billion in the gas-focused areas of Haynesville and Fayetteville. The expenditure primarily related to drilling and
completion activities at all four areas. Our onshore drilling activity in FY2013 resulted in 365 net development wells completed primarily in the Eagle Ford
and Permian areas.
Of the US$4.8 billion, approximately US$500 million was spent on the installation of over 400 kilometres of pipeline infrastructure and additional gas
processing facilities, primarily in our Eagle Ford and Permian areas.
Due to low US natural gas prices in FY2013, the majority of drilling and completion activity in Onshore US was directed towards the liquids-focused Eagle
Ford and Permian areas to capitalise on the stronger liquid prices. At the end of FY2013, over 80 per cent of drilling activity was focused on these areas.
Our Onshore US capital expenditure is expected to decline to US$3.9 billion in FY2014, as we continue to optimise our drilling program. This includes a
forecast reduction in our operated rig count to an average of 25 for the period. Approximately 75 per cent of operated drilling activity will be focused on our
liquids-rich acreage in the Eagle Ford area. The remaining activity will occur in the Haynesville area and the Permian area, where we are continuing to
evaluate our most prospective acreage. Our operated drilling program in the Fayetteville area has been temporarily suspended; however, we will continue to
invest in wells operated by third parties where we see value.
Australia
Macedon
Macedon is a domestic gas development that includes a gas field located offshore approximately 75 kilometres west of Onslow, Western Australia, and a gas
processing facility onshore near Onslow. The project consists of a 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) stand-alone gas plant, four subsea production
wells, a 90-kilometre, 20-inch wet gas pipeline and a 67-kilometre, 20-inch sales gas pipeline. In August 2010, the project was approved at an investment
level of US$1.1 billion (BHP Billiton share), with US$1.2 billion incurred as of 30 June 2013. First gas production was achieved in the third quarter of
CY2013. We are the operator with a 71.43 per cent interest, and Apache PVG holds the remaining 28.57 per cent interest.

Bass Strait Kipper gas field development
37
Initial development of the Kipper gas field in the Gippsland Basin, located offshore Victoria, was approved by the Board in December 2007. A supplemental
approval of the development was granted in January 2011. The first phase of the project included two new subsea wells, three new pipelines and platform
modifications to supply 10 Mbbl/d of condensate and 80 MMcf/d of gas. Facilities were completed in September 2012, and first production will commence
once the mercury removal project is complete. This is expected to occur in CY2016, subject to appropriate approvals for this work. Preliminary engineering
work to design the mercury removal facilities has started and will continue through CY2013, with a final decision expected in FY2014.
Our share of development costs incurred through 30 June 2013 was US$905 million, against a budget of US$900 million. Gas and liquids will be processed
via the existing Gippsland Basin Joint Venture facilities. The Kipper gas field development is comprised of the Kipper Unit Joint Venture and the Gippsland
Basin Joint Venture. We own a 32.5 per cent interest in the Kipper Unit Joint Venture, with Esso Australia and Santos owning the remaining 67.5 per cent.
We own a 50 per cent interest in the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, with Esso Australia owning the remaining 50 per cent.
Bass Strait Turrum field development
Further expansion of the Gippsland Basin facilities is underway following approval by the Board in July 2008 of the full field development of the Turrum oil
and gas field. A supplemental approval of the development was obtained in January 2011. The project consists of four production and two injection wells
and a new platform, Marlin B, linked by a bridge to the existing Marlin A platform. The Turrum field, which has a capacity of 11 Mbbl/d of oil and 200 MMcf/d
of gas, is located 42 kilometres from shore in approximately 60 metres of water. Our share of development costs is approximately US$1.4 billion, of which
US$1.2 billion was incurred as of 30 June 2013. The Turrum field development operates under the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, in which we own a 50 per
cent interest, with Esso Australia owning the remaining 50 per cent. Initial production of low carbon dioxide gas through the Turrum facilities occurred in June
2013. Additional high carbon dioxide production from the Turrum reservoir will come online with completion of the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant in
CY2016.
Longford
The Longford Gas Conditioning Plant (LGCP) Project was approved by the Board in December 2012 to enable the production of Turrum reserves plus the
production of Kipper and other undeveloped high carbon dioxide content hydrocarbons. The project scope includes a carbon dioxide extraction facility,
brownfield tie-ins, an electrical upgrade and multiple supporting utilities. Our share of development costs is approximately US$520 million, of which US$26
million was incurred as of 30 June 2013. First gas production is expected in CY2016. Esso Australia is the operator of LGCP, owning a 50 per cent interest
and BHP Billiton owns the remaining 50 per cent.
North West Shelf North Rankin gas compression project
The North West Shelf gas compression project was approved by the Board in March 2008 to recover remaining lower pressure gas from the North Rankin
and Perseus gas fields. The project consists of a new gas compression platform, North Rankin B, capable of processing 2,500 MMcf/d of gas, which will be
constructed adjacent to the existing North Rankin A platform, 135 kilometres offshore from Karratha on the northwest coast of Western Australia. The two
platforms will be connected by a 100-metre long bridge and operate as a single facility. We own a 16.67 per cent share in the project and our development
costs are approximately US$850 million, of which US$619 million was incurred as of 30 June 2013. First gas production is expected later in CY2013. This
project is operated by Woodside, with an equally shared interest between Woodside, BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron, MIMI and Shell.

North West Shelf Greater Western Flank–A
38
The North West Shelf Greater Western Flank–A (GWF-A) gas project was approved by the Board in November 2011 to recover gas from the near field
Goodwyn H and Tidepole fields. The project consists of a five well subsea tie-back of the Goodwyn H and Tidepole fields to the Goodwyn A platform. The
Goodwyn A platform is located in 130 metres of water, approximately 130 kilometres offshore from Karratha on the northwest coast of Australia. Our share of
development costs is approximately US$400 million, of which US$107 million was incurred as of 30 June 2013. First gas production is expected in CY2016.
Woodside is the operator and we own a 16.67 per cent share.
Significant evaluation activities
We perform development evaluation activities to determine the technical feasibility and commercial viability of prospective projects after exploration and
appraisal.
United States
Mad Dog Phase 2
In April 2012, we announced approval for US$708 million (BHP Billiton share) in pre-commitment funding for the Mad Dog Phase 2 project. The Mad Dog
Phase 2 project is in response to the successful Mad Dog South appraisal well, which confirmed significant hydrocarbons in the southern portion of the Mad
Dog field. However, the project has been sent back to the study phase. Discussions are ongoing with the operator to potentially modify the development
plan. BP is the operator and we hold a 23.90 per cent working interest.
Stampede (formerly known as Knotty Head)
Development planning for the Stampede project is in progress. The development assumptions for this project consist of a joint wet tree tension leg platform
(TLP) development, production and water injection wells. Hess is the operator and we hold a 20 per cent working interest.
Australia
Scarborough
Development planning for the large Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia is in progress. We continue to evaluate development options. Esso is
the operator of the WA-1-R lease and we hold a 50 per cent working interest. We are the operator and have a 100 per cent working interest in the adjacent
Thebe discovery and the WA-346-P block.
North West Shelf Other – (Persephone/Greater Western Flank ‘2’)
Planning is underway for the development of the Persephone field and Greater Western Flank ‘2’. The Persephone field is located near existing North West
Shelf infrastructure, approximately eight kilometres northeast of the North Rankin A platform. Greater Western Flank ‘2’ represents the second phase of
development of the core Greater Western Flank fields, behind the GWF-A development, and is located to the southwest of the existing Goodwyn A platform.
Woodside is the operator and we own a 16.67 per cent share of both Persephone and Greater Western Flank ‘2’.
Exploration and appraisal
We focus on capturing and operating large acreage positions primarily in areas that are in proven hydrocarbon basins. While the majority of our expenditure
occurs in our two principal areas of activity, the Gulf of Mexico
Table of Contents
39
and Western Australia, we also have exploration activities in the Caribbean, Brazil, South Africa, South East Asia and India. During FY2013, our gross
expenditure on exploration was US$675 million, of which US$522 million was expensed.
Access
In FY2013, we gained access to new acreage in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (26 leases covering 618 square kilometres), Trinidad and Tobago (four
deepwater blocks covering 4,111 square kilometres) and India (NELP IX offshore block covering 7,963 square kilometres). Additionally, in the fourth quarter
of FY2013, we were notified that we were the high bidder for two blocks off the northeast Atlantic coast of Brazil (covering 3,069 square kilometres). We
expect to finalise the award of these blocks in the fourth quarter of FY2014.
Exploration program expenditure details
In Western Australia, BHP Billiton drilled the Homevale well and has a 60 per cent interest. The well partially fulfilled the commitment on WA-475P. The well
was spud in April 2013 and subsequently plugged and abandoned as a dry hole in June 2013. Also in Western Australia, we participated in the non-
operated Goodwyn North near field exploration well (BHP Billiton 16.7 per cent interest, Woodside operator), which spud in January 2013 and was plugged,
abandoned and expensed as a dry hole in February 2013.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we participated in four wells during FY2013. In our core Green Canyon area, The Ness Deep exploration well (BHP Billiton 50 per cent
working interest and operator) was spud in June 2012, with a subsequent sidetrack beginning in October 2012. The well encountered non-commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons and was subsequently plugged, abandoned and expensed in December 2012. We participated in the non-operated Atlantis East
appraisal well (BHP Billiton 44 per cent working interest, BP operator), which was spud in April 2012 and subsequently plugged, abandoned and expensed
as a dry hole in November 2012. The Gunflint-3 appraisal well was completed in the first quarter of FY2013. We subsequently exited this prospect, selling
our interest to existing partners in the Gunflint joint venture.
Extending our Gulf of Mexico footprint to Desoto Canyon, we spud the Raptor exploration well in January 2013 (BHP Billiton 50 per cent working interest,
Anadarko operator) and subsequently sidetracked in May 2013. Drilling of the sidetrack was in progress at 30 June 2013 and completed in July 2013. The
well encountered approximately 150 net feet of oil; further evaluation is ongoing.
In South Africa, we own and operate a 90 per cent interest in block 3B/4B. During the year, we fulfilled our minimum work obligation for the current phase by
acquiring a 10,075 square kilometre 3D seismic survey. Processing of the survey will commence in early FY2014.
In India, we hold interests in and operate ten offshore blocks acquired during the NELP VII and VIII licensing rounds. We are currently in discussions with the
Government of India as we seek to obtain unencumbered access to these blocks to allow for petroleum exploration and production. Until the access is
obtained, the blocks remain in force majeure. In India, we also have a 50 per cent non-operated interest (BG operator) in a deepwater block acquired during
the NELP IX licensing round. As this block has not been impacted by the access issue, we participated in the acquisition of 2,000 square kilometres of 2D
seismic data.
In the Philippines, we operate the SC55 block with a 60 per cent working interest. While we are committed to fulfilling our commitment to drill the Cinco
prospect, as of 30 June we were waiting on the regulatory approvals required to drill the well. To preserve the licence, the joint venture has suspended SC55
under force majeure until regulatory approval of the well can be obtained.

We have delivery commitments of natural gas and LNG of approximately 3,221 billion cubic feet through to 2032 (61 per cent Australia, 17 per cent US and
22 per cent Other) and crude, condensate and NGL commitments of 12 million barrels through to 2023 (44 per cent United States, 41 per cent Australia and
15 per cent Other). We have sufficient proved reserves and production capacity to fulfil these delivery commitments. Further information on reserves can be
found in section 2.13.1.
Potash
Our Potash strategy is to build a material industry position over the long term.
We have acquired exploration permits, issued by the Government of Saskatchewan, covering over 14,000 square kilometres of mineral rights in the Province
of Saskatchewan in Canada. The permits are a result of our acquisitions, primarily of Anglo Potash Ltd in CY2008 and Athabasca Potash Inc in CY2010. Our
existing exploration permits are expected to convert to lease between CY2013 and CY2016 in accordance with our planned lease conversion strategy. Our
existing government mineral leases expire in CY2033 and CY2034 unless renewed for further terms.
We continue advancing our Jansen Project, a greenfield potash project, located approximately 146 kilometres east of Saskatoon, in south Saskatchewan.
Jansen is currently being designed to ultimately produce almost 10 Mtpa of agricultural grade potash for more than 50 years.
Jansen progressed into the feasibility study phase (an advanced stage of our project approvals process) in February 2011. On 20 August 2013, an additional
US$2.6 billion investment was announced for Jansen, bringing total approved spending to US$3.8 billion. This represents pre-commitment spending to fund
the excavation and lining of the Jansen Potash Project production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and
utilities. Completion of both shafts is expected during CY2016, while the associated works program will extend into CY2017.
The investment will be spread over a number of years, with annual instalments of approximately US$800 million. We are looking at the introduction of one or
more minority partners, consistent with our approach for certain of our other resource operations.
We are continuing to execute a ground freezing program, in which the ground is frozen using a closed system of refrigeration pipes through which brine is
circulated to allow for the sinking of the service and production shafts. Shaft collars were completed in December 2012 and shaft sinking began at the end of
CY2012. The eventual depth of the service and production shafts will be approximately one kilometre.

We are continuing to study other potential projects in the Saskatchewan potash basin, including Young, Boulder and Melville, and are progressing these
projects. We are also conducting a potash exploration program in the same basin, including 3D seismic survey and drilling programs.
2.2.2    Copper Business
Our Copper Business is one of the world’s premier producers of copper, silver, lead and uranium, and a leading producer of zinc. Our portfolio of large, long-
life mining operations includes the Escondida mine in Chile, the world’s largest single producer of copper, and Olympic Dam in South Australia, a major
producer of copper and uranium, with potential for expansion.
Our total copper production in FY2013 was 1.2 million tonnes (Mt). Our concentrate production, which represents 52 per cent of total production, comes from
flotation of sulphide ores mined at our Escondida, Antamina and Pinto Valley mines. Oxide ores and sulphide ores amenable to leaching are mined and
processed into copper cathode, using conventional heap leaching, followed by solvent extraction and electrowinning processes at Escondida, Cerro
Colorado, Spence and Pinto Valley. Copper cathode is also produced at Olympic Dam, our only copper underground operation, where sulphide ores are
processed through conventional flotation and the resulting concentrate is further transformed into cathodes through a smelting and refining process.
In addition to conventional mine development, we have a small number of focused, technology development projects, at different stages of maturity, that we
expect will transform our assets into the next generation of mining, addressing resource extraction, productivity, costs and sustainability drivers. An example
of this is leaching of low-grade chalcopyrite ores, currently being validated at large scale at Escondida, which has the potential to recover copper from ores
previously considered uneconomical.
We market five primary products: copper concentrates, copper cathodes, uranium oxide, lead concentrates and zinc concentrates.
We sell most of our copper, lead and zinc concentrates to smelters, located in China, Chile, Japan, India and South Korea, under long-term volume contracts
at prices based on the London Metal Exchange (LME) price for the contained metal. Prices are typically set three or four months after shipment, less
treatment charges and refining charges (collectively referred to as TCRCs) that are negotiated with counterparties on a variety of tenors. Some of the ores we
mine contain quantities of silver and gold, which remain in the base metal concentrates we sell. We receive payment credits for the silver and gold recovered
by our customers in the smelting and refining process.
We sell most of our copper cathode production to wire rod mills, brass mills and casting plants around the world under annual contracts with prices at
premiums to LME prices set at the month after shipment. We sell uranium oxide to electricity generating utilities, principally in western Europe, North America
and east Asia. Uranium is typically sold under a mix of longer-term and shorter-term contracts. A portion of our uranium production is sold into fixed price
contracts, although increasingly sales are based on flexible pricing terms.
We have the following six assets in the Americas and Australia:
Americas
Escondida
Our 57.5 per cent owned and operated Escondida mine is the largest producer of copper in the world. Located in the Atacama Desert in the north of Chile,
Escondida employs approximately 12,000 operational employees and contractors and has the capacity to move in excess of 1.3 Mt of material per day. Its
two open-cut pits feed two concentrator plants, which use grinding and flotation technologies to produce copper concentrate, as well as two leaching
operations (oxide and sulphide). In FY2013, our share of Escondida production was 478.1 kilotonnes (kt) of payable copper in concentrate and 171.3 kt of
copper cathode. Escondida has a reserve life of 54 years.
Table of Contents
42
The availability of key inputs like power and water at competitive prices is an important focus for the Copper Business. Escondida’s power demand of
approximately 450 megawatts (MW) is currently covered by four contracts: one of which provides 340 MW until 2029; and the balance of which provide 252
MW until 2016. As part of the longer-term power supply strategy, we are currently undergoing an international tendering process for the development of the
licensed Kelar Power Plant site at Mejillones in order to secure the future power needs for Escondida and Pampa Norte.
To address limitations on the availability of water, we desalinate sea water and carefully manage our use and re-use of available water. The recently
approved Escondida Water Supply (EWS) project will reduce our reliance on the region’s aquifers and help us meet our environmental commitments. The
EWS project is expected to be commissioned in 2017.
Pampa Norte
Pampa Norte consists of two operations – Spence and Cerro Colorado. Copper cathode is produced at both operations following a leaching, solvent
extraction and electrowinning process.
Our wholly owned Spence copper mine is located in the Atacama Desert, 162 kilometres northeast of Antofagasta in Chile. During FY2013, Spence
produced 161.1 kt of copper cathode. Spence has a reserve life of 10 years.
Our wholly owned Cerro Colorado mine, located in the Atacama Desert, 120 kilometres east of Iquique in Chile, remains a significant producer of copper
cathode, although production levels have declined in recent years as grades have declined. Production in FY2013 was 71.5 kt of copper cathode. Cerro
Colorado has a reserve life of nine years.
Antamina
We own 33.75 per cent of Antamina, a large, low-cost, long-life copper and zinc mine in Peru. Our share of Antamina’s FY2013 production was 139.7 kt of
copper in concentrate and 71.9 kt of zinc in concentrate. Antamina also produces molybdenum and lead/bismuth concentrate together with smaller amounts
of silver in the form of by-products. Antamina has a reserve life of 14 years.
In FY2013, Antamina completed execution of an expansion project, increasing milling capacity by 38 per cent to 130 kt per day.
Pinto Valley
In April 2013, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our wholly owned Pinto Valley Operation located in Arizona, United States, and the associated San
Manuel Arizona Railroad Company to Capstone Mining Corp. for an aggregate cash consideration of US$650 million. Ownership is expected to transfer to
Capstone in the first half of FY2014 subject to the successful transfer of the operational permits.
During FY2013, sulphide mining resumed at Pinto Valley with production for FY2013 of 16.6 kt of copper concentrate and 4.9 kt of copper cathode.
Australia
Cannington
Our wholly owned Cannington mine is one of the world’s largest producers of silver and lead. Located in northwest Queensland, Australia, the underground
mine feeds a beneficiation processing facility that extracts silver/lead and zinc concentrates from sulphide ore. In FY2013, Cannington produced
concentrates containing 213.4 kt of lead, 56.3 kt of zinc and approximately 31.1 million ounces of silver. Cannington has a reserve life of 11 years.
Table of Contents
Olympic Dam
43
Our wholly owned Olympic Dam mine is a producer of copper cathode and uranium oxide and a refiner of gold and silver bullion. The site includes an
underground mine, where the primary method of ore extraction is long-hole open stoping with cemented aggregate fill, and an integrated metallurgical
processing plant.
The underground mine extracts copper uranium ore and hauls the ore by an automated train and trucking network feeding underground crushing, storage
and ore hoisting facilities. The processing plant consists of two grinding circuits in which high-quality copper concentrate is extracted from sulphide ore
through a flotation extraction process. The operation includes a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit,
hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, copper refinery and a recovery circuit for precious
metals.
In FY2013, Olympic Dam produced 166.2 kt of copper cathode, 4.1 kt of uranium oxide, 113.2 kilo-ounces (koz) of refined gold and 880 koz of refined silver.
Olympic Dam has a reserve life of 56 years.

Development projects
Americas
Escondida
Organic Growth Project 1 (OGP1), which is the replacement of the Los Colorados concentrator with a new 152 kt per day plant, is currently in execution. The
project provides additional processing capacity and allows access to higher-grade ore. The OGP1 project was approved in February 2012 with budgeted
expenditure of US$3.8 billion (US$2.2 billion BHP Billiton share). Project completion is targeted for the first half of CY2015. Work on the OGP1 project was
41 per cent complete at 30 June 2013.
The Oxide Leach Area Project (OLAP), also in execution, involves the creation of a new dynamic leaching pad and mineral handling system that will include
several overland conveyors. The new pad is expected to maintain oxide leaching capacity at current levels following the exhaustion of the existing heap
leach in CY2014. OLAP was approved in February 2012 with budgeted expenditure of US$721 million (US$414 million BHP Billiton share). Work on the
project was 61 per cent complete at 30 June 2013, and is on track for commissioning in the first half of CY2014.
The Escondida Water Supply project (EWS) was approved by BHP Billiton in July 2013 and consists of a new 2,500 litre per second sea water desalination
facility. This project will provide an alternative water supply to Escondida, as water usage increases upon completion of the 152 kt per day OGP1 copper
concentrator. Construction of the new desalination facility commenced in July 2013 and will include the development of two pipelines, four high-pressure
pump stations, a reservoir at the mine site and high-voltage infrastructure to support the system. The new facility is expected to be commissioned in 2017 at a
cost of US$3.4 billion (US$2.0 billion BHP Billiton share). Prior to completion of the EWS project, water supply for the OGP1 copper concentrator will be
sourced from existing aquifers.
Antamina
In FY2013, Antamina completed execution of its expansion project, increasing milling capacity by 38 per cent to 130 kt per day. The project was approved in
FY2010 and included a new SAG mill, a 55-kilometre transmission power line, an expanded truck shop facility and upgrades to the crushing and tailing
systems, flotation circuit and port capacity. The project was delivered at a total cost of US$1.5 billion (US$511 million BHP Billiton share).
Olympic Dam
An Identification Phase study is being conducted into the proposed expansion of Olympic Dam. The objective of the study is to identify the full range of
development path alternatives for Olympic Dam by investigating all possible mining methods and less capital intensive designs, including new technologies
to substantially improve the economics of any expansion.
Resolution Copper
We hold a 45 per cent interest in the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, United States, operated by Rio Tinto (55 per cent interest). Resolution Copper is
undertaking a pre-feasibility study into a substantial underground copper mine and processing facility.
In FY2013, Resolution Copper continued to advance the sinking of the No. 10 Shaft in order to gain access to the ore deposit for characterisation work of
mineralisation and geotechnical conditions. Work is continuing towards gaining approval from the US Congress for a federal land exchange to access the
ore deposit and advance the project.

Yeelirrie

On 27 August 2012, we announced we had signed an agreement to sell our wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit in Western Australia to Cameco
Corporation for US$430 million. The sale was settled on 19 December 2012.
2.2.3    Iron Ore Business
Our Iron Ore Business is one of the leading iron ore producers in the world. We sell lump and fines products produced in Australia and pellets from our
operations in Brazil.
Our two assets consist of the following:
Western Australia Iron Ore
Operations at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) involve an integrated system of mines and more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure and port facilities
in the Pilbara region of northern Western Australia, with the headquarters located in Perth. Our strategy is to maximise output utilising available infrastructure
at our disposal. Our priorities are to continue our growth projects currently in execution, as well as maintaining our options for future growth.
Our WAIO operations consist of four joint ventures: Mt Newman, Yandi, Mt Goldsworthy and Jimblebar. Our interest in Mt Newman, Yandi and Mt
Goldsworthy Joint Ventures is 85 per cent. Mitsui and ITOCHU own the remaining 15 per cent. On 10 July 2013, our ownership in Jimblebar Joint Venture
reduced to 85 per cent following the issuing of equity in a subsidiary company, for which BHP Billiton received total consideration of US$1.5 billion in shares
and loans of the subsidiary.
The Mt Newman Joint Venture (JV) consists of a number of ore bodies joined by conveyors and spur lines to a mining hub at Mt Whaleback. Ore is crushed,
beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create the Mt Newman blend for lump and fines. The ore is then transported to port using Mt Newman JV-
owned rail facilities. Ore produced by Yandi JV is processed at the Yandi mine and transported by rail on the Newman main line. The Mt Goldsworthy JV
consists of the Area C mine in the central Pilbara and Yarrie mine in northern Pilbara.
All ore is transported by rail on the Mt Newman and Mt Goldsworthy rail lines to port facilities. A typical train configuration consists of two locomotives per 124
ore cars, called a rake, with two rakes per train. Each individual ore car carries approximately 128 tonnes of iron ore. Our rail operations are controlled from
Perth via our integrated remote operations centre which co-locates rail control, port production control, mine dispatch control and mine fixed plant control.
Our port facilities are located on both sides of the harbour at Port Hedland, consisting of Nelson Point, owned by the Mt Newman JV, and Finucane Island,
owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV. The port facilities include five ore car dumpers, three screening plants, nine stackers, five reclaimers, stock and blending
yards, and eight ship loaders. Vessels depart the harbour via a dredged channel that is approximately 45 kilometres long and has a width of 300 metres.
Lump and fines products are sold to steel mills in China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Switzerland and Australia, under long-term
and short-term contracts. Contract prices are generally linked to market indices.
After the acquisition of HWE Mining Subsidiaries from Leighton Holdings on 30 September 2011, we now operate all mines except for Wheelarra and
Orebody 18, as noted in the table below.
Table of Contents
50
Along with the other joint venture participants, we have entered into marketing agreements in the form of joint ventures with certain customers. These
customer joint ventures, JW4, Wheelarra and POSMAC, involve subleases of part of WAIO’s existing mineral leases, with ore being sold to the existing joint
ventures with contractual terms applying to the customers’ share. As a consequence, we are entitled to 85 per cent of production from these subleases and
the customer joint ventures are accounted for as marketing arrangements rather than as jointly controlled assets.
We have been expanding our WAIO operations in response to increasing demand for iron ore. Since 2001, we have completed six expansion projects and
are undertaking a further two projects to increase our mine, rail and port capacity from 67 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) to an expected minimum capacity
of 220 Mtpa (100 per cent basis). Our share of FY2013 production was 158.9 Mt of ore. We now have additional projects in various stages of the project life
cycle (including construction) to further increase system capacity (see Development projects below).
Our Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing us to plan our development around a series of integrated mining hubs joined to the orebodies
by conveyors or spur lines. This approach enables us to maximise the value of installed infrastructure by using the same processing plant and rail
infrastructure for a number of orebodies.
The reserve life of our Western Australia mines is 17 years.
WAIO Mineral Reserves reported in FY2013 have been changed to a Pilbara basis by ore type, to align with our future strategy for a Pilbara lump product.
This also reflects our single logistics chain and associated management system.
Samarco
We are a 50–50 joint venture partner with Vale at the Samarco operation in Brazil. Samarco is currently comprised of a mine and two concentrators, located
in the State of Minas Gerais, and three pellet plants and a port, located in the State of Espirito Santo. Two 396-kilometre pipelines connect the mine site to
the pelletising facilities.
Samarco’s main product is iron ore pellets. Extraction and beneficiation of iron ore is conducted at the Germano facilities in the municipalities of Mariana and
Ouro Preto. Conveyor systems are used to extract the ore and convey it from the mines. Ore beneficiation then occurs in concentrators, where crushing,
milling, desliming and flotation processes produce iron concentrate. The concentrate leaves the concentrators as slurry and is pumped through the slurry
pipelines from the Germano facilities to the pellet plants in Ubu, where the slurry is processed into pellets. The iron ore pellets are then heat treated.
The pellet output is stored in a stockpile yard before being shipped out of the Samarco owned Port of Ubu in Anchieta. Pellets are independently marketed
by Samarco and sold to steelmakers in 25 countries in the Americas, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, with prices generally linked to market indices.
In FY2013, our share of production was 11 Mt of pellets. The reserve life of Samarco is 40 years.

In March 2011, we announced approval of an additional US$7.4 billion (BHP Billiton share US$6.6 billion) of capital expenditure to continue production
growth in our WAIO operations. This investment is the final approval of projects initiated in 2010, with pre-commitment funding of US$2.3 billion (BHP Billiton
share US$2.1 billion). It is expected to deliver an integrated operation with a minimum capacity of 220 Mtpa (100 per cent basis), with first production
expected from Jimblebar in the December 2013 quarter.
This additional investment includes:
•
•
•
US$3.4 billion (BHP Billiton share US$3.3 billion) Jimblebar Mine Expansion project to develop the Jimblebar mine and rail links, and procure mining
equipment and rolling stock to deliver an initial capacity of 35 Mtpa, expandable to 55 Mtpa. Work on this project is on schedule for first production in
the December 2013 quarter and will broadly match mine and port capacity at 220 Mtpa (100 per cent basis). The overall project was 89 per cent
complete at 30 June 2013. The original investment amount has been increased by US$354 million (BHP Billiton share US$340 million) as a result of
appreciation of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar. In addition, as a result of the issue of equity by a BHP Billiton subsidiary on
10 July 2013, BHP Billiton share has reduced to US$3.2 billion;
US$2.3 billion (BHP Billiton share US$1.9 billion) to further develop Port Hedland, including two additional berths and ship loaders, a car dumper,
connecting conveyor routes, and associated rail works and rolling stock. The first production was achieved following the commissioning of the fifth car
dumper at Finucane Island in the December 2012 quarter. The car dumper is the last major piece of infrastructure required to increase the port capacity
from the December 2012 quarter annualised rate of 188 Mtpa to 220 Mtpa (100 per cent basis). Work on this project was 92 per cent complete at
30 June 2013;
US$1.7 billion (BHP Billiton share US$1.4 billion) for port blending facilities and rail yards to enable ore blending, expand resource life and prepare for
the anticipated growth of the business beyond the Inner Harbour. In FY2013, a decision was made to prioritise capital efficient growth in the Inner
Harbour. This resulted in the construction of port blending and rail yard facilities at the South Stockyard being taken out of scope and reduced the
project spend by US$470 million (BHP Billiton share US$400 million). Work on this project is on schedule and budget. The overall project was 86 per
cent complete at 30 June 2013.
Port Hedland Harbour Strategy
In February 2012, we announced approval of US$917 million (BHP Billiton share US$779 million) in pre-commitment funding for the construction of an Outer
Harbour facility associated with our WAIO operations.
On 24 August 2012, we announced that Western Australia’s Minister for Transport and the Port Hedland Port Authority had granted WAIO the right to
develop two additional berths in the Inner Harbour, subject to the state approvals processes. On 20 February 2013, we announced a decision to defer the
Outer Harbour development beyond the five-year planning horizon as our focus has shifted to maximising our potential capacity from the Inner Harbour and
capitalising on infrastructure from previous investment.
Western Australia Iron Ore – Orebody 24 mine
In November 2011, we announced approval of a US$822 million (BHP Billiton share US$698 million) investment for the development of the Orebody 24
mine, located approximately 10 kilometres northeast of Newman, Western Australia. Orebody 24 is a sustaining mine to maintain iron ore production output
from the Mt Newman JV operations. Orebody 24 is expected to have a capacity of 17 Mtpa and will include the construction of an ore crushing plant, train
loadout facility, rail spur and other associated support facilities. First production was achieved in the December 2012 quarter and work on the overall project
was 88 per cent complete at 30 June 2013.
Table of Contents
Samarco
57
During FY2011, Samarco shareholders approved a US$3.5 billion (BHP Billiton share US$1.75 billion) expansion project consisting of a fourth pellet plant,
a new concentrator and a third slurry pipeline. The Fourth Pellet Plant Project (P4P) is expected to expand Samarco’s iron ore pellet production capacity
from 22.3 Mtpa to 30.5 Mtpa. First pellet production is expected in the first half of CY2014. The project was 90 per cent complete as at 30 June 2013.
Exploration activities
Western Australia
WAIO has a substantial existing reserve base supported by considerable additional mineralisation all within a 250-kilometre radius of our existing
infrastructure. This concentration of orebodies also gives WAIO the flexibility to add growth tonnes to existing hub infrastructure and link Greenfield
developments to our existing mainline rail and port facilities. The total area covered by exploration and mining tenure amounts to 5,308 square kilometres.
This excludes miscellaneous and general purpose licences, which are used for infrastructure space and access.
The majority of deposits are located on five main lease areas held by BHP Billiton and our joint venture partners, as appropriate. Iron ore mineralised
materials fall mainly within the Hamersley Ranges of the Pilbara district, with a minor component of the inventory lying within the Pilbara Craton of northwest
Western Australia.
There are four main material types for the deposits:
•
•
•
•
Brockman Iron Formation;
Marra Mamba Iron;
Channel Iron Deposits;
Nimingarra Iron Formation.
In FY2013, exploration activity was completed over multiple project areas and deposits. The total drilling carried out amounts to 453,000 metres composed of
RC (reverse circulation) of 392,000 metres, DD (diamond drilling) of 43,000 metres and Hyd (hydrology drilling) of 18,000 metres consisting of approximately
4,000 drill holes. Total exploration expenditure amounted to US$214 million.
Guinea Iron Ore
BHP Billiton currently has a 41.3 per cent interest in a joint venture that holds the Nimba Mining Concession and four iron ore prospecting permits in
southeast Guinea. The joint venture is continuing to undertake a pre-feasibility study for the development of the Concession and associated transport
infrastructure.
Liberia Iron Ore
BHP Billiton currently has a 100 per cent interest in a Mineral Development Agreement with the Government of Liberia. This enables the further exploration
and development of our Liberian iron ore mineral leases. Exploration and development of these leases continues, with drilling conducted on select targets.
2.2.4    Coal Business
Metallurgical Coal
Our Coal Business is the world’s largest supplier of seaborne metallurgical coal. Metallurgical coal, along with iron ore and manganese, is a key input in the
production of steel. Total Metallurgical Coal production in FY2013 was 37.7 Mt.
58
Table of Contents
Metallurgical Coal comprises the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) and BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal (BMC) Assets in the Bowen Basin in Central
Queensland, Australia, and the Illawarra Coal Asset in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.
The Bowen Basin is well positioned to supply the seaborne market because of its high-quality metallurgical coals, which are ideally suited to efficient blast
furnace operations, and its geographical proximity to Asian customers. We also have access to key infrastructure in the Bowen Basin, including a modern,
integrated electric rail network and our own coal loading terminal at Hay Point, Mackay.
The Hay Point terminal currently consists of coal inloading dump stations, stacker reclaimers and two ship loaders, capable of loading 44 Mtpa of coal. The
terminal is currently undergoing expansion to increase its capacity to 55 Mtpa through the addition of a third shiploader. This infrastructure enables us to
maximise throughput and blending of products from multiple mines of BMA and BMC, to optimise the value of our production and to satisfy customer
requirements.
Our Metallurgical Coal Assets are comprised of both open-cut and underground mines. At our open-cut mines, overburden is removed after blasting using
either draglines or truck and shovel. Coal is then extracted using excavators or loaders and loaded onto trucks to be taken to stockpiles. At our underground
mines, coal is extracted by either longwall or continuous miner. The coal is then transported to the surface by conveyor to stockpiles. Coal from stockpiles is
then crushed, washed and processed through the coal preparation plant. Export coal is transported to the port via trucks or trains. The majority of sales to
domestic customers are transported by truck.
Our export customers are steel producers around the world, principally in China, India, Japan and Europe. In FY2013, the majority of our contracts were
based on annual or longer-term volumes, with prices largely negotiated on a monthly, quarterly or spot basis.
Our Metallurgical Coal Assets are:
BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance
BMA comprises two unincorporated joint ventures – Central Queensland Coal Associates Joint Venture (CQCA) and Gregory Joint Venture. We share 50–
50 ownership with Mitsubishi Development.
BMA operates the Goonyella Riverside, Peak Downs, Saraji, Norwich Park (production ceased), Blackwater, Broadmeadow, Daunia and Gregory Crinum
(open-cut production ceased) mines, together with the Hay Point Coal terminal. In May 2012, production ceased at Norwich Park mine indefinitely, following
a review of the mine’s viability. In October 2012, production also ceased at Gregory open-cut mine, part of the Gregory Crinum complex. Production
commenced at Daunia in March 2013.
Our share of total production in FY2013 was 22.6 Mt. Production figures for BMA include some energy coal (less than two per cent). The reserve lives of our
mines range from three years at Gregory Crinum to 39 years at Saraji. The reserve life for each mine is set out in section 2.13.2.
BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal
BMC is a subsidiary company owned by BHP Billiton (80 per cent) and Mitsui and Co (20 per cent). BMC operates South Walker Creek and Poitrel mines.
The reserve lives of our mines are 13 years at Poitrel and 21 years at South Walker Creek. Total production in FY2013 was 7.1 Mt.
Table of Contents
Illawarra Coal
59
Illawarra Coal owns and operates three underground coal mines, these being Appin, West Cliff and Dendrobium, in the Illawarra region of New South Wales,
Australia, which supply metallurgical coal to the nearby BlueScope Port Kembla steelworks, and other domestic and export markets. Coal is exported via
Port Kembla Coal terminal, in which we own a 16.67 per cent share. Total production in FY2013 was 7.9 Mt. The reserve lives of our mines range from three
years at West Cliff to 26 years at Appin. The reserve life for each mine is set out in section 2.13.2.
Production figures for Illawarra Coal include some energy coal (less than 17 per cent).

Development projects
BMA Expansions
63
In November 2011, approval was given for the development of the Caval Ridge mine project and expansion of the Peak Downs mine in the Bowen Basin in
Central Queensland, Australia, with an investment of US$2.1 billion (BHP Billiton share). The Caval Ridge mine will be an open-cut dragline and truck and
shovel operation, with coal railed to the BMA Hay Point Coal terminal.
In response to the challenging environment, we have chosen to delay indefinitely the 2.5 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) expansion of Peak Downs that is
associated with the Caval Ridge mine development. The revised investment is US$1.9 billion (BHP Billiton share) for the Caval Ridge mine project. The 5.5
Mtpa capacity (100 per cent basis) Caval Ridge mine was 71 per cent complete at 30 June 2013 and remains on schedule to deliver first production in
CY2014.
In March 2011, approval was given for three key metallurgical coal projects located in the Bowen Basin, with a total investment of US$2.5 billion (BHP
Billiton share). These projects have contributed 4.9 Mt of annual mine capacity (100 per cent basis) through development of the Daunia mine and a new
mining area at Broadmeadow, known as the Broadmeadow Life Extension project. The third project is the expansion of the BMA Hay Point Coal terminal,
delivering an additional 11 Mt of annual port capacity (100 per cent basis).
The new mining area at Broadmeadow was completed in FY2013 with first coal in March 2013. First coal from Daunia mine also occurred in March 2013 and
the project was 97 per cent complete at 30 June 2013. The project was completed in the September quarter of CY2013. First shipment from the expanded
Hay Point Coal terminal was expected in CY2014; however, a review of both schedule and budget was undertaken during FY2013. The investment has now
been revised from US$1.25 billion to US$1.5 billion (BHP Billiton share) and first shipment is now expected in CY2015. The project was 66 per cent
complete at 30 June 2013.
Appin Area 9 Project
In June 2012, approval was given to invest US$845 million to sustain operations at Illawarra Coal, in southern New South Wales, Australia, by establishing a
replacement mining area at Appin mine. The replacement area will have a production capacity of 3.5 Mtpa and will sustain Illawarra Coal’s production
capacity at 9 Mtpa. The Appin Area 9 project was 44 per cent complete at 30 June 2013 and is expected to be operational in CY2016, whereupon it will
replace production at the West Cliff mine. The project includes roadway development, new ventilation infrastructure, new and reconfigured conveyors and
other mine services.
IndoMet Coal Project
IndoMet Coal comprises seven coal contracts of work (CCoWs) covering a large metallurgical coal resource in Kalimantan, Indonesia, which was discovered
by BHP Billiton in the 1990s. Following an assessment of the importance of local participation in developing the project in FY2010, we sold a 25 per cent
interest in the project to a subsidiary of PT Adaro Energy TBK. We retain 75 per cent of the project and hold management responsibility.
Early work on infrastructure development for the project is underway. IndoMet remains a valuable future option for our Coal Business.
Energy Coal
Our Coal Business is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of export energy coal (also known as thermal or steaming coal) and is a domestic
supplier to the electricity generation industry in Australia, South Africa and the United States. Our domestic sales are generally made to nearby power
stations under long-term
Table of Contents
64
fixed price or cost plus arrangements. Our export sales are delivered to power generators and some industrial users in Asia, Europe and the United States,
under contracts that are generally index linked. Energy Coal produced approximately 72.9 Mt in FY2013.
Our Energy Coal Assets comprise both open-cut and underground mines. At our open-cut mines, overburden is removed after blasting, using either draglines
or truck and shovel. Coal is then extracted using excavators or loaders and loaded onto trucks to be taken to stockpiles. At our underground mines, coal is
extracted by either longwall or continuous miner. The coal is then transported to the surface by conveyor to stockpiles. Coal from stockpiles is crushed and,
for a number of the operations, washed and processed. Domestic coal is then transported to the nearby customer via conveyor, truck or rail. Export coal is
loaded onto trains and transported to port.
Energy Coal South Africa
Energy Coal South Africa (known as BECSA) operates four coal mines, being Khutala, Klipspruit, Middelburg and Wolvekrans, in the Witbank region in the
province of Mpumalanga, South Africa. Production in FY2013 was 31.6 Mt. The Khutala and Klipspruit mines both have a reserve life of seven years, while
Middelburg and Wolvekrans have a reserve life of 24 years and 22 years, respectively.
In FY2013, approximately 56 per cent of BECSA’s sales were to Eskom, the government-owned electricity utility in South Africa. The remaining production
was exported, predominantly to China and India, via the Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT), in which we own a 22 per cent share.
The conversion of BECSA’s old order mining rights to new order mining rights underpins BECSA’s licence to operate. In order to achieve this, during
FY2013, BECSA finalised an empowerment transaction with a Black-owned consortium, led by Pembani Group Proprietary Limited, transferring an eight per
cent equity interest in BECSA.
The shareholders of BECSA also approved the implementation of an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) in which participating employees will hold a
beneficial interest of two per cent equity in BECSA for a vested period. The ESOP and empowerment transaction were implemented in January and May
2013, respectively, and reduced our ownership interest in BECSA to 90 per cent.
New Mexico Coal
We own and operate the Navajo mine, located on Navajo Nation land in New Mexico, United States, and the nearby San Juan mine located in the state of
New Mexico. Each mine transports its production directly to a nearby power station. The reserve lives of our mines are three years at Navajo mine and five
years at San Juan Mine, which is the life of the current customer contracts. New Mexico Coal produced 13.2 Mt in FY2013.
New Mexico Coal and the Navajo Nation have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to pursue discussions to transition full ownership of the Navajo
Coal Company to the Navajo Nation. Binding agreements are expected to be signed during FY2014. The Navajo Nation has formed the Navajo Transitional
Energy Company (NTEC) to acquire Navajo Mine. A subsidiary of New Mexico Coal and NTEC expect to enter into a Mine Management Agreement where
we expect the subsidiary to continue as mine manager until the end of CY2016.
New South Wales Energy Coal
New South Wales Energy Coal’s operating asset is the Mt Arthur Coal open-cut mine in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, Australia. New South
Wales Energy Coal produced 18.0 Mt in FY2013 and has a reserve life of 40 years. In FY2013, we delivered approximately six per cent of Mt Arthur’s
production to a local power station and exported the rest, predominantly to Japan and China, via the port of Newcastle.
65
Table of Contents
We are a 35.5 per cent shareholder in Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, a jointly controlled entity that is operating the Newcastle Third Port export coal
loading facility and currently has a project in execution (see Development projects below). We also have a 1.75 per cent interest in Port Waratah Coal
Services Limited, which operates two coal loading facilities at the Port of Newcastle.
Cerrejón
We have a one-third interest in Cerrejón Coal Company, which owns and operates, one of the largest open-cut export coal mines in the world in the La
Guajira province of Colombia. Cerrejón also owns and operates integrated rail and port facilities through which the majority of production is exported to
European, Middle Eastern, North American and Asian customers. In FY2013, our share of Cerrejón production was approximately 10.0 Mt. Cerrejón has a
reserve life of 19 years.
In FY2012, Cerrejón commenced an expansion project (P40), which is expected to increase our share of production from 10.7 Mtpa to 13.3 Mtpa (see
Development projects below).

Development projects
Cerrejón P40 Project
On 18 August 2011, we announced a US$437 million (BHP Billiton share) investment in the expansion of Cerrejón, known as the P40 Project, which will
enable Cerrejón’s thermal coal production to increase by 8 Mtpa to approximately 40 Mtpa. The expansion project is expected to increase our share of
production from 10.7 Mtpa to 13.3 Mtpa. Construction commenced in CY2011 with completion expected in CY2013. At 30 June 2013 the project was 71 per
cent complete. The project scope includes a second berth and dual quadrant ship loader at Cerrejón’s 100 per cent owned and operated Puerto Bolivar,
along with necessary mine, rail and associated supply chain infrastructure.
Newcastle Port Third Phase Expansion
On 31 August 2011, we announced a US$367 million (BHP Billiton share) investment in the third stage development of the Newcastle Coal Infrastructure
Group’s coal handling facility in Newcastle, Australia. The port expansion project is expected to increase total capacity at the coal terminal from 53 Mtpa to
66 Mtpa. This is expected to increase New South Wales Energy Coal’s allocation by a further 4.6 Mtpa to 19.2 Mtpa. First coal on ship, being the first ship
loading through the new facility, was achieved in June 2013, ahead of schedule. At 30 June 2013, the project was 76 per cent complete.
2.2.5    Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business
Aluminium
Our Aluminium Business has a portfolio of assets in three stages of the aluminium value chain: mining bauxite, refining bauxite into alumina and smelting
alumina into aluminium metal. We are a major producer of aluminium, with total production in FY2013 of 1.2 Mt. We also produced 4.9 Mt of alumina.
During FY2013, we consumed 33 per cent of our alumina production in our aluminium smelters and sold the balance to third party smelters. Our alumina and
aluminium customers are located principally in western Europe and Asia. Our alumina sales are a mixture of legacy long-term contract sales at LME-linked
prices and, increasingly, long-term contracts priced from an alumina index or spot negotiated prices. Prices for our aluminium sales are generally linked to
prevailing LME prices. We have a diversified customer portfolio, with demand driven by end-use consumption in transportation, packaging, construction and
household items.
Our Aluminium Assets include the following operations:
Boddington/Worsley
Boddington/Worsley is an integrated bauxite mining/alumina refining operation located in Western Australia. The Boddington bauxite mine supplies bauxite
ore to the Worsley alumina refinery via a 62-kilometre long conveying system. We own 86 per cent of the mine and the refinery. It is our sole integrated
bauxite, mining/alumina refining asset, and one of the largest and lowest-cost refineries in the world. Worsley is near completion of a ramp-up of production
from the Efficiency and Growth project that will increase the capacity of the refinery to 4.6 Mtpa (100 per cent) of alumina. Completion is expected by the end
of CY2013. Our share of Worsley’s FY2013 production was 3.7 Mt of alumina. Worsley’s export customers include our own Hillside, Bayside and Mozal
smelters in southern Africa. Boddington has a reserve life of 17 years.
Mineração Rio do Norte
We own a 14.8 per cent investment in Mineração Rio do Norte (MRN), which owns and operates a large bauxite mine, located at Porto Trombetas in the
province of Pará, Brazil.
Table of Contents
Alumar
70
Alumar is an integrated alumina refinery/aluminium smelter. We own 36 per cent of the Alumar refinery and 40 per cent of the smelter. Alcoa operates both
facilities. The operations, and their integrated port facility, are located at São Luís in the Maranhão province of Brazil. Alumar sources the majority of its
bauxite from MRN. During FY2013, approximately 25 per cent of Alumar’s alumina production was used to feed the smelter, while the remainder was
exported. Our share of Alumar’s FY2013 saleable production was 1,205 kt of alumina and 154 kt of aluminium.
Hillside and Bayside
Our wholly owned Hillside and Bayside smelters are located at Richards Bay, South Africa. Hillside is the largest aluminium smelter in the southern
hemisphere. In 2009, Bayside reduced smelting capacity to approximately 97 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) in support of a national energy conservation
scheme. Hillside imports alumina from our Worsley refinery and Alcoa, while Bayside imports all of its alumina from Worsley. Both Hillside and Bayside
source power from Eskom, the South African state utility, under long-term contracts, with prices linked to the LME price of aluminium (except for Hillside
Potline 3, the price of which is linked to the South African and US producer price indices). Potline capacity at Hillside returned to normal during FY2013 after
a major unplanned outage in the March 2012 quarter. Production in FY2013 for Hillside was 665 kt and Bayside was 96 kt.
Mozal
We own 47.1 per cent of and operate the Mozal aluminium smelter located near Maputo, Mozambique. Mozal sources power generated by Hydro Cahora
Basa via Motraco, a transmission joint venture between Eskom and the national electricity utilities of Mozambique and Swaziland. Our share of Mozal’s
FY2013 production was 264 kt.

Development projects
Worsley Efficiency and Growth project
In May 2008, we announced the Board’s approval of an expansion project to increase the capacity of the Worsley refinery from 3.5 Mtpa of alumina to 4.6
Mtpa (100 per cent capacity) through expanded mining operations at Boddington, additional refinery capacity and upgraded port facilities. The expansion
project achieved first production in March 2012 and continued to ramp-up throughout FY2013, achieving record production for the asset. Full production is on
track to be achieved by the end of CY2013. As at 30 June 2013, total capital expenditure was US$3.1 billion.
Guinea Alumina
On 9 July 2013, we completed the sale of our one-third interest in a joint venture that was undertaking a feasibility study into the construction of a 10 Mtpa
bauxite mine, an alumina refinery with processing capacity exceeding 3.3 Mtpa and associated infrastructure, located approximately 110 kilometres from the
port of Kamsar in Guinea.
Manganese
Our Manganese Business produces a combination of ores and alloys from sites in South Africa and Australia. We are the world’s largest producer of
manganese ore and one of the top global producers of manganese alloy. Manganese alloy is a key input into the steelmaking process. Manganese high-
grade ore is particularly valuable to alloy producers because of the value in use differential over low-grade ore. The value in use differential is the degree to
which high-grade ore is proportionately more efficient than low-grade ore to process in the production of alloy.
Our strategy is to focus on upstream resource assets. Manganese alloy smelters are a key conduit of manganese alloy and ore into steelmaking and enable
us to access markets with an optimal mix of ore and alloy, optimise production to best suit market conditions and give us technical insight into the
performance of our ores in smelters.
Approximately 80 per cent of our ore production is sold directly to external customers, predominantly located in China, South Korea and India, and the
remainder is used as feedstock in our alloy smelters. Manganese alloy is sold to steel mills, mainly in Europe and North America. Manganese ore and alloy
are increasingly sold on short-term or spot contracts, with prices linked to published indices. Neither commodity is exchange traded, and prices are largely
determined by supply and demand balances. Ore is priced per dry metric tonne unit and referenced to a benchmark ore of 43 per cent manganese grade cost
insurance freight (CIF) China. Alloy is priced per tonne, typically on a delivered basis (DDP). Manganese production in FY2013 was 8,517 kt of ore and 608
kt of alloy.
We own and manage all of our manganese mining operations and alloy plants through the Samancor Manganese joint ventures with Anglo American. In
South Africa, we own 60 per cent of Samancor Manganese (Proprietary) Ltd, which operates the Metalloys division. Samancor Manganese owns 74 per cent
of Hotazel Manganese Mines (Pty) Ltd (HMM), which gives us an effective interest of 44.4 per cent in HMM. The remaining 26 per cent of HMM is owned
under the terms of the South African Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) legislation, which reflects our commitment to economic transformation in South
Africa. In Australia, we own 60 per cent of Groote Eylandt Mining Company Pty Ltd (GEMCO) and we have an effective interest of 60 per cent in GEMCO’s
wholly owned subsidiary, Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty Ltd (TEMCO).
Our Manganese Assets, Manganese Australia and Manganese South Africa, comprise the following:
Mines
HMM
HMM owns the Mamatwan open-cut mine and the Wessels underground mine. Manganese high-grade ore from these mines is particularly valuable to alloy
producers because of the value in use differential over low-grade ore.
Table of Contents
75
Mined ore is processed into a saleable product through a crushing and wet screening operation, with some ore undergoing further processing in the form of
dense media separation and sintering. More than 25 per cent of the ore mined is beneficiated into alloy at Metalloys, with the rest being exported via road
and rail through Port Elizabeth (approximately 950 kilometres) and Durban (approximately 1,100 kilometres). In FY2013, the total manganese ore production
was 3,490 kt. Wessels has a reserve life of 48 years and Mamatwan has a reserve life of 20 years.
GEMCO
As a result of its location, 16 kilometres from our port facilities at Milner Bay, and its simple, open-cut mining operation, GEMCO is one of the world’s lowest-
cost manganese ore producers. These operations, consisting of crushing, screening, washing and dense media separation, combined with its high-grade ore
and relative proximity to Asian export markets, make GEMCO unique among the world’s manganese mines. FY2013 production of manganese ore was
5,027 kt. GEMCO has a reserve life of 12 years.
Alloy Plants
Metalloys
The Samancor Manganese Metalloys alloy plant is one of the largest manganese alloy producers in the world. Due to its size and access to high-quality
feedstock from HMM operations, it is also one of the lowest-cost alloy producers of ferromanganese. Metalloys only produces high- and medium-carbon
ferromanganese, after silicomanganese production ceased due to the permanent closure of the energy-intensive Metalloys South plant in January 2012. The
high-carbon ferromanganese furnace M14 at the Metalloys West Plant was completed in March 2013. This furnace has added an additional 130 ktpa
capacity of high-carbon ferromanganese, but replaces the now-closed 120 ktpa silicomanganese South Plant, taking Metalloys capacity to 500 ktpa. The
M14 furnace contributes to power efficiency at the Metalloys site as it adds to the site’s own generation capacity, utilising the furnace off-gases.
TEMCO
TEMCO is a medium-sized producer of high-carbon ferromanganese, silicomanganese and sinter using ore shipped from GEMCO, primarily using
hydroelectric power.

Development projects
GEMCO expansion
The US$279 million GEMCO Expansion Project (GEEP2) (US$167 million BHP Billiton share), approved in July 2011, is nearing completion and is
expected to be commissioned during the latter half of CY2013. GEEP2 is expected to increase GEMCO’s capacity from 4.2 Mtpa to 4.8 Mtpa through the
introduction of a dense media circuit by-pass facility. The expansion is also expected to address key infrastructure constraints by increasing road and port
capacity to 5.9 Mtpa, creating 1.1 Mtpa of additional capacity for future expansions.
HMM
The central block development project at the Wessels underground mine is being progressed in two phases. The first phase is to ensure key ventilation
infrastructure is put in place to maintain current production levels, while the second phase will complete infrastructure required to expand the mine to 1.5
Mtpa. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in FY2014 at a cost of US$106 million (US$63.6 million BHP Billiton share), and will
comprise the construction of the ventilation shaft and development of the associated underground ventilation network. Phase 2 of the project is currently
undergoing a feasibility study, and will comprise the completion of the underground crusher and mobile workshops.
Metalloys
The high-carbon M14 furnace at the Metalloys West Plant was completed in March 2013 with a total cost of US$99 million (US$59.4 million BHP Billiton
share).
Samancor Gabon Manganese project
During 2013, we withdrew from the Samancor Gabon Manganese project following the completion of the feasibility study.
Nickel
Our Nickel Business primarily supplies customers in the stainless steel industry, principally in northern Asia and western Europe. Nickel is an important
component of the most commonly used types of stainless steel. We also supply nickel to other markets, including the specialty alloy, foundry, chemicals and
refractory material industries. We are a major producer of nickel with total production in FY2013 of 154 kt of contained nickel. We sell our nickel products at
various stages including concentrate, matte and metal under a mix of long-term, medium-term and spot volume contracts, with prices linked to the LME nickel
price.
Our Nickel Assets include the following operations:
Nickel West
Our wholly owned Western Australian Nickel Asset, Nickel West, consists of an integrated system of mines, concentrators, a smelter and a refinery. We mine
nickel-bearing sulphide ore at our Mt Keith, Leinster and Cliffs Operations north of Kalgoorlie. We operate concentrator plants at Mt Keith and at Leinster,
which also concentrate ore from Cliffs. Leinster and Mt Keith have reserve lives of eight and 12 years, respectively; both have options for further expansion.
Cliffs is a high-grade underground mine with a reserve life of four years.
We also operate the Kambalda concentrator south of Kalgoorlie, where we source ore through tolling and concentrate purchase arrangements with third
parties in the Kambalda region. We also have purchase agreements in place for the direct purchase of concentrate, which we re-pulp, dry and blend with
other concentrate processed at Kambalda.
Ore from our Mt Keith mine is concentrated at Mt Keith and then transported by road approximately 110 kilometres to Leinster for drying. Ore from Cliffs and
Leinster mines is concentrated and dried at Leinster. Dry

nickel concentrate is then transported via road and rail approximately 375 kilometres to our Kalgoorlie smelter. Concentrate from Kambalda is transported via
rail approximately 60 kilometres to our Kalgoorlie smelter. Small volumes of concentrate are sold into the external market; however, the majority of volumes
are processed into nickel matte, containing approximately 68 per cent nickel. In FY2013, we exported approximately 34 per cent of our nickel matte
production. The remaining nickel matte is transported, principally by rail, to our Kwinana nickel refinery, a distance of approximately 650 kilometres. The
nickel matte is processed into nickel metal in the form of LME grade briquettes and nickel powder, together with a range of saleable by-products.
Nickel West production in FY2013 was 103 kt of contained nickel.
Cerro Matoso
Cerro Matoso, our 99.94 per cent owned Nickel Asset in Colombia, combines a lateritic nickel ore deposit with a ferronickel smelter. Cerro Matoso is one of
the largest producers of ferronickel and is one of the lowest-cost producers of ferronickel. The smelter produces high-purity, low-carbon ferronickel granules.
Cerro Matoso has an estimated reserve life of 28 years. Production in FY2013 was 50.8 kt of nickel in ferronickel form.
During FY2013, Cerro Matoso successfully extended its mining concessions with the Colombian Government until 2029, with a conditional extension until
2044. The agreement includes an increase in the royalty rate from 12 per cent to 13 per cent. The extension of the contract term to 2044 is conditional on
Cerro Matoso increasing processing capacity by 50 per cent by 2022.

Development projects
The Nickel Business had no active development projects in FY2013.
2.2.6    Divested businesses
During FY2013, we sold our interests in the diamonds business and the titanium minerals business and exited these industries.
Diamonds
Our diamonds business comprised the EKATI Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Our interest in EKATI consisted of an 80 per cent
operated interest in the Core Zone Joint Venture, comprising existing operations and a 58.8 per cent interest in the Buffer Zone Joint Venture, that primarily
focused on exploration targets. On 10 April 2013 we sold our 80 per cent operated interest in EKATI to the Dominion Diamond Corporation for US$553
million after adjustments.
In FY2012, sales from EKATI (100 per cent terms) represented approximately two per cent of current world rough diamond supply by weight and
approximately six per cent by value. During FY2013, up until the date of sale, EKATI produced approximately 972 thousand carats of rough diamonds (BHP
Billiton share).
Titanium minerals
Our interest in titanium minerals consisted of a 37.76 per cent non-operated interest in Richards Bay Minerals (RBM). RBM is a major producer of titania slag,
high-purity pig iron, rutile and zircon from mineral sands.
In February 2012, we announced that we had exercised an option to sell our non-operated interest in RBM to the operator of RBM, Rio Tinto. The sale was
completed on 7 September 2012, for proceeds of US$1.7 billion after adjustments.

2.4    Marketing
BHP Billiton’s Marketing network manages the Group’s revenue line and is responsible for:
•
•
selling our products and managing the Marketing supply chain;
purchasing of all major raw materials;
•
•
•
managing credit and price risk associated with the revenue line;
achieving market clearing prices for the Group’s products;
defining our view of long-term market fundamentals.
Our responsibilities require an active presence in the various commodities markets and the global freight market, through which we oversee the management
of the supply chain for our various products, extending from our assets to markets and, for raw materials, from suppliers to our assets. We also work to
manage credit and price risk by assessing customers for creditworthiness and ensuring that the Group’s revenue is determined predominantly on an index or
floating price basis.
Our market insight is strengthened by the multi-commodity nature of the Group, our proximity to our customers and the easy flow of information in our
centralised marketing structure. We study the fundamentals of demand and the supply cycles and integrate these to form a long-term view of the market,
through interaction with customers, forums and analysts. This allows us to better assess and respond to shifts in long-term pricing and demand and address
trends across commodity markets.
The global hub for our marketing activities for all commodities, except oil and gas, is centralised in Singapore. The global hub for our marketing activities for
oil and gas is centralised in Houston, United States.
During FY2013, the Marketing hub office in The Hague, Netherlands, was closed and most activities moved to Singapore, reflecting the continued
predominance of sales in Asia.
The two marketing hub offices incorporate all the functions required to manage product marketing and distribution from our assets to final customers. In
addition, we have marketers located in regional offices in 14 cities around the world.
Within the Singapore Marketing hub, we have a centralised ocean freight business that manages our in-house freight requirements. The primary purpose of
the freight business is to create a competitive advantage for our shipments through the procurement and operation of quality, cost-effective shipping.
2.5    Minerals exploration
Our minerals exploration program is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on discovering and acquiring operating interests in mineral deposits with
the potential to support large, long-life, low-cost, expandable upstream assets, diversified by commodity, geography and market.
Our greenfield (new sites) activities allow us to explore some of the most geologically prospective terrains in a number of countries and operating
environments. Greenfield minerals exploration is focused on advancing targets within Chile and Peru, and is organised through our Copper Business.
Greenfield activities include opportunity identification, application for and acquisition of mineral title, early reconnaissance operations and multi-million dollar
delineation drilling programs.
Table of Contents
91
In addition to our activities focused on finding new world-class deposits, several of our Businesses undertake brownfield (developments on existing sites)
exploration, principally aimed at delineating and categorising mineral deposits near existing operations, and advancing projects through the development
pipeline.
Our expenditure on minerals exploration over the last three years was:

2.6    Group Resource and Business Optimisation
Group Resource and Business Optimisation (RBO) provides governance and functional leadership for resource planning and development and Ore Reserve
reporting. RBO is focused on ensuring optimal value recovery from our resources. The team includes functional experts in mineral resource evaluation,
exploration, planning, research and development, work management, production processes, mine engineering and mineral process engineering.
RBO engages directly with assets to deliver guidance and assess compliance in resource development and Ore Reserve reporting. It provides the Group
Management Committee with performance reports and portfolio analysis. RBO also provides functional expertise to audits and to investment review
programs conducted by other Group Functions.
RBO’s accountabilities include governance for all resource and reserve estimation and Ore Reserve reporting.
2.7    Government regulations
Government regulations touch all aspects of our operations. However, the geographical diversity of our operations reduces the risk that any one set of
government regulations would have a material effect on our business, taken as a whole.
The ability to extract minerals, oil and natural gas is fundamental to BHP Billiton. In most jurisdictions, the rights to undeveloped mineral or petroleum
deposits are owned by the state. In those jurisdictions, we rely upon the rights granted to us by the government that owns the mineral, oil or natural gas.
These rights usually take the form of a lease or licence, which gives us the right to access the land and extract the product. The terms of the lease or licence,
including the time period for which it is effective, are specific to the laws of the relevant government. Generally, we own the product we extract and royalties
or similar taxes are payable to the government. In certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Trinidad and Tobago, a production sharing contract
(PSC) governs the relationship between the government and companies concerning how much of the oil and gas extracted from the country each will
receive. In production sharing contracts the government awards rights for the execution of exploration, development and production activities to the company.
The company bears the financial risk of the initiative, and explores, develops and ultimately produces the field as required. When successful, the company is
permitted to use the money from a certain set percentage of produced oil and gas to recover capital and operational expenditures, known as ‘cost oil’. The
remaining production is known as ‘profit oil’ and is split between the government and the company at a rate determined by the government and set out in the
PSC.
Related to the ability to extract is the ability to process the minerals, oil or natural gas. Again, we rely upon the relevant government to grant the rights
necessary to transport and treat the extracted material in order to ready it for sale.
Table of Contents
92
Underlying our business of extracting and processing natural resources is the ability to explore for those natural resources. Typically, the rights to explore for
minerals, oil and natural gas are granted to us by the government that owns those natural resources that we wish to explore. Usually, the right to explore
carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration or to undertake particular exploration activities.
Although onshore oil and gas rights in the United States can be derived from government (state and federal) mineral rights, they are primarily derived from
private ownership of the rights, which is the case for our onshore oil and gas rights. Oil and gas rights primarily take the form of a lease, but also can be
owned onshore outright in fee. If the rights granted are by lease, we are afforded the rights to access, explore, extract, produce and market the oil and gas for
a period of years and then generally so long thereafter as there is oil or gas production or operations on the leased lands.
Governments also impose obligations on us in respect of environmental protection, land rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, and native land title
with which we must comply in order to continue to enjoy the right to conduct our operations within that jurisdiction. These obligations often require us to make
substantial expenditures to minimise or remediate the environmental impact of our operations, to ensure the safety of our employees and contractors and the
like. Environmental protection, land rehabilitation and occupational health and safety onshore in the United States are principally regulated by the
government and to a lesser degree, if applicable, by the lease contract with the landowner. For further information on these types of obligations, refer to
section 2.8 of this Annual Report.
Of particular note are the following regulatory regimes:
2.7.1    Uranium production in Australia
To mine, process, transport and sell uranium from within Australia, we are required to hold possession and export permissions, which are also subject to
regulation by the Australian Government or bodies that report to the Australian Government.
To possess nuclear material, such as uranium, in Australia, a Permit to Possess Nuclear Materials (Possession Permit) must be held pursuant to the
Australian Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 (Non-Proliferation Act). A Possession Permit is issued by the Australian Safeguards and Non-
Proliferation Office, an office established under the Non-Proliferation Act, which administers Australia’s domestic nuclear safeguards requirements and
reports to the Australian Government.
To export uranium from Australia, a Permit to Export Natural Uranium (Export Permit) must be held pursuant to the Australian Customs (Prohibited Exports)
Regulations 1958. The Export Permit is issued by the Minister for Resources and Energy.
A special transport permit is required under the Non-Proliferation Act by a party that transports nuclear material from one specified location to another
specified location. As we engage service providers to transport uranium, those service providers are required to hold a special transport permit.
2.7.2    Exchange controls and shareholding limits
BHP Billiton Plc
There are no laws or regulations currently in force in the United Kingdom that restrict the export or import of capital or the remittance of dividends to non-
resident holders of BHP Billiton Plc’s shares, although the Group does operate in some other jurisdictions where remittances of funds could be affected as
they are subject to exchange control approvals. There are certain sanctions adopted by the UK Government which implement
Table of Contents
93
resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) against certain countries, entities and
individuals and may restrict the export or import of capital or the remittance of dividends to certain non-resident holders of BHP Billiton Plc’s shares. Any
enforcement of financial sanctions by the UK Government would be initiated by HM Treasury. Such sanctions may be in force from time to time and include
those against:
(i) certain entities and/or individuals associated with Afghanistan, Belarus, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, the Republic of Guinea, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Lebanon, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,
Tunisia, Zimbabwe and the previous regimes of Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia;
(ii) individuals indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia;
(iii) entities and individuals linked with the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations.
There are no restrictions under BHP Billiton Plc’s Articles of Association or (subject to the effect of any sanctions) under English law that limit the right of non-
resident or foreign owners to hold or vote BHP Billiton Plc’s shares.
There are certain restrictions on shareholding levels under BHP Billiton Plc’s Articles of Association described under the heading ‘BHP Billiton Limited’
below.
BHP Billiton Limited
From time to time, the United Nations Security Council and the Australian Government impose international sanctions on certain countries and
organisations. The countries and organisations that are currently subject to United Nations sanctions are certain individuals or entities linked with the
Taliban, Al-Qaeda and associated individuals and entities, other designated individuals and entities associated with terrorism, certain entities and
individuals associated with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Eritrea, Guinea-
Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Sudan and Somalia. The countries currently subject to the Australian Government’s autonomous sanctions are
Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Fiji, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Iran, Libya, Syria and Zimbabwe. The
controls impose certain approval and reporting requirements on transactions involving such countries, entities and individuals and/or assets controlled or
owned by them. Transfers into or out of Australia of amounts greater than A$10,000 in any currency are also subject to reporting requirements. In addition,
under the Australian Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959, the Reserve Bank of Australia may impose restrictions on certain financial transactions
and require the consent of the Reserve Bank of Australia for the movement of funds into and out of Australia. No such restrictions are currently in place.
Remittances of any dividends, interest or other payments by BHP Billiton Limited to non-resident holders of BHP Billiton Limited’s securities are not
restricted by exchange controls or other limitations, save that in certain circumstances, BHP Billiton may be required to withhold Australian taxes.
There are no limitations, either under the laws of Australia or under the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited, on the right of non-residents to hold or vote BHP
Billiton Limited ordinary shares other than as set out below.
The Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA) restricts certain acquisitions of interests in shares in BHP Billiton. Generally, under
the FATA, the prior approval of the Australian Treasurer must be obtained for proposals by a foreign person (either alone or together with associates) to
acquire control of 15 per cent or more of the voting power or issued shares in BHP Billiton Limited.
The FATA also empowers the Treasurer to make certain orders prohibiting acquisitions by foreign persons in BHP Billiton Limited (and requiring divestiture
if the acquisition has occurred) where he considers the acquisition to be contrary to the national interest and the 15 per cent threshold referred to above
would be exceeded as a result. Such orders may also be made in respect of acquisitions by foreign persons where two or more foreign persons (and their
associates) in aggregate already control 40 per cent or more of the issued shares or voting power in BHP Billiton Limited.
Table of Contents
94
There are certain other statutory restrictions, and restrictions under BHP Billiton Limited’s Constitution and BHP Billiton Plc’s Articles of Association, that
apply generally to acquisitions of shares in BHP Billiton (i.e. the restrictions are not targeted at foreign persons only). These include restrictions on a person
(and associates) breaching a voting power threshold of:
•
•
•
•
20 per cent in relation to BHP Billiton Limited on a ‘stand-alone’ basis, i.e. calculated as if there were no Special Voting Share and only counting BHP
Billiton Limited’s ordinary shares.
30 per cent of BHP Billiton Plc. This is the threshold for a mandatory offer under Rule 9 of the UK takeover code and this threshold applies to all voting
rights of BHP Billiton Plc (therefore including voting rights attached to the BHP Billiton Plc Special Voting Share).
30 per cent in relation to BHP Billiton Plc on a ‘stand-alone’ basis, i.e. calculated as if there were no Special Voting Share and only counting BHP
Billiton Plc’s ordinary shares.
20 per cent in relation to the BHP Billiton Group, calculated having regard to all the voting power on a joint electorate basis, i.e. calculated on the
aggregate of BHP Billiton Limited’s and BHP Billiton Plc’s ordinary shares.
Under BHP Billiton Limited’s Constitution and BHP Billiton Plc’s Articles of Association, sanctions for breach of any of these thresholds, other than by means
of certain ‘permitted acquisitions’, include withholding of dividends, voting restrictions and compulsory divestment of shares to the extent a shareholder and
its associates exceed the relevant threshold.
2.8    Sustainability
Our BHP Billiton Charter value of Sustainability reflects our priority of putting health and safety first, being environmentally responsible and supporting our
communities.
Our ability to operate globally is dependent upon gaining access to natural resources and maintaining our licence to operate. Sustainable development is
core to our strategy; we integrate health, safety, environmental, social and economic factors into our key decision-making. The sustainability dimensions that
we report on include the health and safety of our people; governance and risk management processes; how we contribute to improved standards of living
and self-sustaining communities; our impact on the environment and approach to resource conservation and biodiversity; and how we ensure the broader
economic contributions of our operations benefit the regions in which we operate.
The information contained in this section covers assets that have been wholly owned and operated by BHP Billiton or that have been operated by BHP
Billiton in a joint venture operation (controlled assets) for FY2013. Additional information relating to our sustainability performance for FY2013 is available in
our Sustainability Report 2013 and is available online at www.bhpbilliton.com.
2.8.1    Governance and sustainability
The Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in oversight of health, safety, environment and community (HSEC) matters. This includes
overseeing areas relating to HSEC risk, compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and overall HSEC performance of the Group.
More specifically, management is accountable for the design and implementation of sustainability-related processes and performance necessary to comply
with our suite of HSEC Group Level Documents (GLDs). GLDs describe the mandatory minimum performance requirements and accountabilities for
definitive business obligations, processes, functions and activities across BHP Billiton. They are the foundation for developing and implementing
management systems at our operations. Internal audits are required to be conducted annually to test compliance with the requirements of the HSEC GLDs.
Audit results are used by management to create action
Table of Contents
95
plans where the Businesses have not yet achieved full compliance with the GLD requirements. Key findings are reported to senior management; and
summary reports are considered by the Sustainability Committee of the Board and, where appropriate, by the Risk and Audit Committee of the Board.
2.8.2    Identifying and managing our material risks
We identify risks we consider material to our organisation and take into consideration the potential health, safety, environmental, social, reputational, legal
and financial impacts. The severity of any particular risk is assessed according to the degree of harm, injury or loss from the most severe impact associated
with a specific risk. The objectives of the risk management process are to understand the nature and tolerance of the material risks for the Group and to
ensure they are managed through the verification and effectiveness testing of critical controls. Information relating to the material risks for the Group,
including sustainability risks, is available in section 1.7 in this Annual Report. Our risk management processes are consistent with the hierarchy of controls
described in Article 6 of International Labour Organization Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176).
2.8.3    Identifying our sustainability issues
We identified the sustainability issues included in this Annual Report and the Sustainability Report 2013 through a three-step materiality process. Step one
of the process identified issues by reviewing our internal risk registers, enquiries from our shareholders and investors and daily print media coverage. Step
two involved rating the significance of these issues from our stakeholders’ perspective and the potential impact on our organisation as low, medium or high.
The third step was to review the issues and seek feedback from key stakeholders. A number of material issues are discussed in the following sections:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Operating with integrity and conducting business transparently.
Keeping our people and operations safe.
Focusing on the health and wellbeing of our people.
Developing our people.
Climate change and energy.
Biodiversity and land management.
Water management.
Supporting and engaging with our communities.
Respecting human rights.
Making a positive contribution to society.
Informing our thinking through the Forum on Corporate Responsibility
Established in 1999, the Forum on Corporate Responsibility (the Forum) is an advisory body, comprising nine highly respected civil society leaders who
engage with our executive team on the Group’s material sustainability issues. The Forum is a key component of our stakeholder engagement program,
contributing significant insight into society’s current and future priorities and providing an opportunity to understand and debate issues from multiple
viewpoints.
BHP Billiton representatives benefit from engaging directly with a group of civil society leaders who represent different perspectives on current and emerging
sustainability issues. The Forum helps to ensure societal implications are understood and considered in important Company decisions.
Table of Contents
96
Our Chief Executive Officer chairs the meetings, which were held twice during FY2013. Sustainability topics discussed in the past financial year included
emerging global social and environmental trends; climate change scenarios and adaptation; issues facing Indigenous peoples, including free, prior and
informed consent; sustainability reporting; and transparency.
2.8.4    Operating with integrity and conducting business transparently
Wherever we operate in the world, we strive to work with integrity – doing what is right and doing what we say we will do. We care as much about how
results are achieved as we do about the results themselves. We believe that to maintain our position as one of the world’s leading companies, we must
commit to high ethical business practices and governance standards in all our dealings. We strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary
ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.
Regardless of the country or culture within which our people work, our Anti-corruption GLD and the BHP Billiton Code of Business Conduct prohibit bribery
and corruption in all our business dealings. Particulars in relation to the Code of Business Conduct and anti-corruption are referred to in section 5.16 in this
Annual Report. Specific discussion on legal proceedings is available in section 8 in this Annual Report.
Product Stewardship
As our primary activities are in the extraction (and, in some cases, processing) stages of a product’s life cycle, the majority of the life cycles of our products
occur after the products have left our control. Through our membership of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we commit to implementing
the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework, which requires that we facilitate and encourage responsible design, use, reuse, recycling and disposal of
our products along the supply chain. We recognise there is strong business merit in implementing product stewardship programs with other participants
involved in the life cycles of our products.
In FY2013, we engaged in a number of product stewardship initiatives, related to the International Manganese Institute, Steel Stewardship Forum,
International Aluminium Institute, and Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. For other commodities, including copper and nickel, we
participate in the stewardship programs also incorporated within their industry associations.
For uranium, we practice and follow the product stewardship principles established by the World Nuclear Association, of which we are a member. These
principles include supporting the safe and peaceful use of nuclear technology and promoting sustainable development for the whole industry. Product
stewardship activities involving BHP Billiton range from participation in national and international programs to the transparency of allowing customers to
physically audit our HSEC activities.
A number of our coal operations have also participated in initiatives relevant to product stewardship, including consideration of international certifications, as
well as internal and external audits, with a view to providing transparency of the HSEC activities undertaken by our operations.
Many of our products are required to have a specific safety data sheet (SDS). These SDSs outline the relevant health, safety and environmental aspects of
our products and are available to customers and the transporters of our products.
Working with our contractors and suppliers
Our globally managed contractors and suppliers have requirements in their contracts consistent with Our Charter, Code of Business Conduct, the Anti-
corruption GLD and HSEC GLDs. Additionally, in our Supply ‘Source to Contract’ GLD, we specify that our suppliers align with our zero tolerance of a
number of human rights infringements, including child labour, inhumane treatment of employees and forced or compulsory labour.
Table of Contents
97
Contracted suppliers are categorised depending on their HSEC and business conduct risk and our level of commercial dependency. A procedure to engage
with each supplier is developed appropriate to the level of risk.
Closure Planning
Closure planning is a key consideration in the planning and development of our projects and operations. Operations are required to maintain Closure Plans,
which describe the proposed methods to rehabilitate and remediate following resource development and also address closure obligations. The Closure
Plans provide the basis for estimating the closure costs and the associated accounting for closure and rehabilitation provisions. Detailed closure planning
requirements, including the issues to be addressed, accuracy of cost estimates and risks to be assessed are described in our Corporation Alignment
Planning GLD. Information on our closure and rehabilitation provisions can be found in note 18, ‘Provisions’, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this
Annual Report. In addition to our projects and operating assets, we are also responsible for a number of legacy operations that are in various stages of
decommissioning, rehabilitation or post-closure care and maintenance.
Transparently reporting our taxes
Through our membership of the ICMM, we support the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is a global initiative to improve
governance in resource-rich countries through the verification and full publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.
We are committed to supporting and cooperating in the implementation of country-level EITI Work Plans as our host countries progress the initiative.
In line with our support for the EITI, we have reported in the Sustainability Report 2013 payments of taxes and royalties derived from resource developments
on a country-by-country basis. We have presented the data as the taxes and royalties that we pay as BHP Billiton (such as corporate income taxes and
royalties) and also those that we collect on behalf of employees.
2.8.5    Keeping our people and operations safe
The safety and health of our people is core to every aspect of our business. Having our people return home safe and well at the end of every working day
and enabling them to end their working life fit and healthy are central to everything we do. This is reflected in the processes and controls we have in place
throughout our organisation.
Our safety performance
We remain vigilant in our focus on material safety risks, ensuring we have the appropriate controls in place to address these risks and that our people are
appropriately trained. During FY2013, we increased our focus on assessing the effectiveness of controls for material risks, which required us to assess
whether the critical controls were being deployed as designed and to the standard required. To monitor the effectiveness of these critical controls, they are
established and then tracked through business systems, such as 1SAP and internal audit processes. The ability to monitor the effectiveness of critical
controls prior to a potential event occurring provides the organisation with a leading indicator for the control of these risks.
The FY2013 total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) performance of 4.6 per million hours worked improved by two per cent compared with 4.7 in FY2012.
While we continue to see year-on-year improvement, we recognise that TRIF is principally an indicator in highlighting broad personal injury trends, and we
are reminded by the three work-related fatalities suffered in FY2013 that lower injury rates alone will not prevent fatalities. It also reinforces our efforts to
improve the identification and management of material HSEC risks.

Aviation is a significant material safety risk, as we move over 450,000 people each year by chartered aircraft. We use two key assurance processes for the
selection and use of contracted aircraft operators: the Basic Aviation Risk Standard (BARS) audit program managed by the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) to
verify design effectiveness and our own operational reviews to validate operating effectiveness, which are undertaken by our aviation specialists. The
continued use of this approach, combined with the review of BHP Billiton and industry incidents, provides the basis for continued improvement of the control
and management of our aviation risks.
After experiencing three pressurisation incidents since May 2011, we worked with the FSF and industry colleagues through the BARS program to increase
industry standards. As an added control, pressurised aircraft are now required to adopt aural cabin pressure warnings (when available for the aircraft type) to
help eliminate incidents related to pressurisation failure.
Responsibly undertaking deepwater drilling
Deepwater oil and gas exploration is an important aspect of our worldwide business. Our skilled drilling professionals use comprehensive and proven
processes and systems to conduct deepwater drilling operations in a safe manner that complies with the regulations where we operate and our own strict
requirements. We maintain common worldwide standards, cultivate a culture of continuous improvement and focus on reducing risk in all of our offshore oil
and gas drilling operations.
2.8.6    Focusing on the health and wellbeing of our people
The acute and immediate nature of serious accidents can make them an obvious health and safety focus. However, the life-altering disabilities that can result
from chronic exposure to health risks are equally serious. Health risks faced by our people include fatigue and occupational exposure to noise, silica,
manganese, diesel exhaust particulate, fluorides, coal tar pitch, nickel and sulphuric acid mist. It is important that our people are fit for work; and we require
our operations to have systems in place to minimise the risk of exposures, incidents and injuries. We are continuously working to reduce the potential for
chronic exposure to health risks that can lead to life-altering disabilities.
Since FY2011, we have seen an increase in the reporting of musculoskeletal illnesses and a decrease in noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) case reporting.
This change in reported cases has largely been driven by improved application of the United States Government Occupational Safety and Health
Administration reporting guidelines.

From FY2013 onwards, incidence of occupational illness is calculated on the average number of employees. This has been applied retrospectively to prior reporting years.
Managing our occupational exposures
Our priority is to control occupational exposures at their source, and we are focused on improving our occupational exposure controls to offer
greater protection and further improve our performance. In those situations where we cannot control the source, a range of measures are
employed, including the provision of
Table of Contents
99
personal protective equipment (PPE) to safeguard our people. Operations are required to establish, understand and maintain an exposure risk
profile to harmful agents for employees and contractors and to identify the need for exposure controls and medical surveillance programs. We
establish our own occupational exposure limits (OELs) when we believe local regulatory limits do not provide adequate protection for workers’
health. If a potential exposure to harmful agents exceeds 50 per cent of the OEL, medical surveillance is required to be implemented to identify
potential illness or health effects at an early stage and to provide feedback as to whether the exposure controls we have in place are functioning
as designed.
In FY2013, we set a target to reduce potential occupational exposure to carcinogens and airborne contaminants by 10 per cent by FY2017. This
reduction is for exposures that exceed our baseline occupational exposure limits if not for the use of PPE. In FY2013, we had a 5.7 per cent
decrease in the number of potential exposures to carcinogens and airborne contaminants (data for the divested EKATI Diamond Mine Asset was
not included). This decrease was driven by the successful implementation of exposure reduction initiatives at two of our coal operations. It was
also influenced by a reduction in head count at our copper operations and by small reductions in exposures at our nickel operations in Australia.
Exposures could therefore rise again if our head count increases or if the small changes in nickel exposure are not sustainable. The overall
decrease in exposures was adversely impacted by an increase in dust exposures at our aluminium operations in South Africa primarily due to
major maintenance work following an unplanned potline outage dating from the March 2012 quarter.
2.8.7    Developing our people
Employing and developing talented and motivated people who share Our Charter values is critical to our long-term success. Each individual
brings unique skills, experience and perspectives; and we recognise that we are strengthened by diversity. We are committed to providing a work
environment in which everyone is treated fairly and with respect and has the opportunity to maximise their potential.
Recruitment is managed on a local basis by each area of our organisation, and employment is offered on merit. Every person applying for a job is
evaluated according to their job-related skills, qualifications, abilities, aptitudes and alignment with Our Charter values. In some jurisdictions,
targeted affirmative action through programs such as Indigenous employment and training and Black Economic Empowerment may be required
to address historical imbalances and past discrimination.
Additional information relating to diversity, and employee policies and involvement at BHP Billiton is available in sections 5.17 and 7.8 in this
Annual Report.
2.8.8    Climate change and energy
As a global organisation operating in an energy-intensive industry, we are actively managing risks associated with climate change, which are
discussed in section 1.7 of this Annual Report.
Managing the potential impacts of climate change
Potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations may include changes in precipitation patterns, increased storm intensities and
higher average temperatures, which may adversely affect the productivity and financial performance of our operations.
Regulations to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can impact operational costs, particularly for more GHG-intensive assets, as well as
impacting demand for fossil fuel products such as coal and gas. In the medium and long term, we are likely to see changes in the costs associated
with our GHG-intensive assets as a result of regulatory requirements in a number of the countries where we operate, which may also have
implications for our suppliers and customers. Inconsistency of regulations, particularly between developed and developing countries, could affect
the investment attractiveness of assets in different jurisdictions.

Engaging in policy development
100
The issues associated with climate change continue to be a challenge for governments, communities and industries around the world; and it
seems a global solution to climate change is some time away. Until then, nations are likely to continue to pursue their domestic GHG emissions
reduction efforts to establish low-carbon economies, balancing their needs to ensure a reliable energy supply and sustainable economic growth.
We engage with policy makers on climate change policies in the key regions where we operate, including Australia, South Africa and South
America. In FY2013, we engaged with Australian policy makers on the implementation of the Australian Government’s carbon price legislation.
Governments globally are considering a variety of legislative and regulatory options to mitigate GHG emissions. In our view, assessing these
options requires an understanding of their likely effectiveness, scale and cost, as well as their implications for economic growth and quality of life.
Our position is that any policy response should be broad-based and use a portfolio of complementary measures to deliver abatement. We believe
the diversity of our portfolio, combined with actions focused on emissions abatement, will position us well to manage future policy developments.
We have developed six principles to outline what we think any climate change policy should encompass to best tackle carbon emissions
reduction: clear price signal; revenue neutral; trade friendly; broad-based; predictable and gradual; simple and effective.
We continue to hold the view that a price on carbon is just one of the potential policy measures that governments can adopt to address climate
change. Independently, we maintain a Carbon Pricing Protocol, an internal mechanism for pricing carbon and determining carbon price impacts
on our greenfield and brownfield developments and on mergers and acquisitions. Our Carbon Pricing Protocol is updated annually to reflect
internal and external carbon price modelling and the proposed treatment of carbon permits in countries where we operate.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
We strive to continually improve energy and GHG management. At our operations where emissions exceed or are anticipated to exceed 50,000
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) per annum, we require an Energy and GHG Management Plan to be implemented and maintained. In
FY2013, over 90 per cent of our operations had emissions above this limit and they were required to identify, evaluate and implement energy
efficiency and GHG-reduction projects.
We are committed to delivering emissions abatement opportunities and transparent public reporting of our emissions. In FY2013, we set an
ambitious target to maintain our FY2017 GHG emissions below FY2006 baseline levels, while we continue to grow our business. The FY2006
baseline is adjusted for material acquisitions and divestments based on asset GHG emissions at the time of transaction. In order to achieve our
target, we intend to focus on the continued implementation of identified abatement opportunities by our Businesses. Without this focus, we
forecast that our absolute emissions would exceed the FY2006 baseline as a result of growth across our organisation.
In FY2013, our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have increased by 6.5 million tonnes (Mt) to 46.7 Mt, predominantly due to increases across our
Aluminium and Onshore US operations. Maintenance downtime due to torrential rain caused supply interruptions of hydropower to our Mozal
aluminium smelter. This resulted in a GHG emissions increase of 3.6 Mt as the operation switched to coal-fired power supply. Continued
development of the Onshore US unconventional oil and gas operations increased emissions by 1.3 Mt. We remain in line with our FY2017 target,
with emissions lower than our FY2006 baseline. Of the assets that committed to implementing abatement projects in FY2013, 64 per cent did not
achieve this due to resource and other constraints. This was partially offset by strong performance at three of our Copper operations, which
exceeded their GHG abatement targets this year.

Supplying, accessing and efficiently using energy
Accessing a secure supply of energy is necessary for our continued growth. Many factors influence our ability to access energy, including
increased global demand, issues related to local generation, transmission of power, and political and regulatory uncertainties. We are addressing
these risks and securing energy supply through improving the energy efficiency of our operations, negotiating long-term contracts with energy
providers and using diverse power sources.
Our total energy consumption was up 10.2 per cent on FY2012, largely driven by increased production at our Worsley and Onshore US
operations. Within Australia, in compliance with the national Energy Efficiency Opportunities (EEO) Act 2006, we progressed a number of energy
efficiency measures. The results of our participation in the EEO program for FY2013 will be available online in December 2013 at
www.bhpbilliton.com.
2.8.9    Biodiversity and land management
Securing access to land and managing it effectively are essential components of our commitment to operate in a responsible and sustainable
manner. We depend upon biodiversity and the related benefits derived from ecosystems such as food, air and water.
Biodiversity, land and our organisation
We acknowledge the importance of preserving biodiversity and the challenge this presents to all land users. Host governments and communities
are seeking a greater demonstration of effective land stewardship as a critical component in their decision to grant land access. Competition for
land is growing, whether it is from mining, agriculture, forestry, water supply or biodiversity conservation. Consequently, this requires broader
consideration of how we manage land use and biodiversity at our operations and how this is balanced with other societal needs. Obtaining
community support is most challenging when there is strong competition for the use of the land, such as the competition between resource
development and agriculture.
We draw on the resources of the World Database on Protected Areas to identify whether our operations are in or adjacent to protected areas. We
also have explicit requirements in our Environment GLD relating to areas of high environmental sensitivity and also in relation to threatened
species. This GLD mandates the assessment, planning and management of the potential land and biodiversity impacts of our operations
throughout their life cycle. Our operations are required to have Land and Biodiversity Management Plans that incorporate baseline and impact
assessments, controls designed to mitigate impacts on biodiversity, land use and water resources, and monitoring programs to verify
effectiveness of controls. Commonly described as a mitigation hierarchy, we aim to avoid land disturbance and, where this is not possible, to
minimise our impacts, including rehabilitating land (both during operations and closure). Where unacceptable impacts remain, we look to
undertake compensatory actions, such as biodiversity offsets.
Managing land access and rehabilitation
Our approach to land access is undertaken on a case-by-case basis and takes into account potential environmental, societal, economic or
cultural impacts. We consider what land we need and seek to identify the uses of the land and the stakeholders who may be affected by our
activities. We then look at our possible short-term and long-term impacts on that land, including the effects that our use may have on biodiversity,
water resources, air and communities.
The rehabilitation of land no longer required for our activities continues to be a central part of our approach to managing our effects on land. We
are required to rehabilitate disturbed areas consistent with the pre-disturbance land use or alternative land uses developed in consultation with
stakeholders.
Table of Contents
102
Enhancing biodiversity and contributing to conservation
In FY2013, we introduced new biodiversity and conservation targets. The first target focuses on a core business requirement to develop Land and
Biodiversity Management Plans that include controls to prevent, minimise, rehabilitate and offset impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services,
which has been achieved by all our operations. We also introduced a new conservation target to finance the conservation and continuing
management of areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem value that are of national and international conservation significance. To date, the Five
Rivers Conservation Project, in Australia, and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve Conservation Project, in Chile, have been established.
2.8.10    Water management
The sustainability of our operations relies on our ability to obtain the appropriate quality and quantity of water and to use this resource
responsibly.
Addressing water risks across our operations
The range of potential water-related risks and their possible impacts on water resources, biodiversity and communities makes managing water a
complex task for our Businesses. Water risks and impacts experienced by our operations vary from region to region and from site to site, with
some sites facing multiple and varying risks. Some are located in water scarce environments; others have to manage water excess, water quality
or water discharge issues. At the same time, we anticipate climate change is likely to make the patterns and cycles of water flow less predictable,
requiring our operations to have adaptive responses.
To address issues related to water availability and stakeholder expectations, our operations are required to develop a Water Management Plan.
The plan takes into consideration the baseline quantity and quality of water potentially affected by our operations and requires the operation to
quantify the acceptable level of impact to water resources, taking into account regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. Our
operations also consider cumulative effects on water resources when multiple operations are active within a region. Preventive and mitigating
controls necessary to achieve the acceptable level of impact are detailed in the plan, and each operation is required to implement a monitoring
and review program that verifies the effectiveness of these controls.
To manage for potential risks, we set a target in FY2013 that required operations with water-related material risks, including volume and quality
considerations, to set targets and to implement projects to reduce their impacts on water resources. This target recognises the local and regional
context of water, and allows operations to annually review and define the necessary projects that will best address their material water risks. Our
operations identified 80 projects that were expected to be completed during FY2013, of which 54 were implemented. The reasons projects were
not implemented included a need to defer the project due to changing Business priorities, projects were found to not be viable after initial
investigation or not likely to achieve the original benefits, or they were replaced with new projects to address the current needs of our Businesses.
Water reporting
Unlike the more established accounting approach to GHG emissions, there is no internationally consistent approach to water accounting and
reporting. However, during FY2013, we aligned our water reporting across our global operations with the Minerals Council of Australia’s Water
Accounting Framework. The framework aims to improve data integrity, allow more meaningful analysis on which to base policy-making and
deliver improved outcomes for industry and communities. In adopting the Minerals Council of Australia Water Accounting Framework across our
operations globally, we have refined the way we publicly report our water usage so as to incorporate water inputs by source and quality, and water
output by quality and destination.
Table of Contents
Managing waste
103
Mining and minerals processing operations produce large quantities of mineral waste, including waste rock, tailings and slag, which need to be
effectively managed. Our operations are required to implement and maintain Waste Management Plans, which address waste minimisation,
storage, transportation and disposal in a manner that controls the risk of adverse impacts on the environment and communities.
Tailings dams are operated, monitored and assessed to manage material risks, including the risk of failure. We are required to analyse mineral
wastes and identify potential impacts arising from erosion, acid rock drainage, salinity, radioactivity and metal leaching. Our Environment GLD
prohibits the disposal of tailings or waste rock into river or marine environments.
Safely managing our unconventional oil and gas resources
Following our entry into the onshore shale business in CY2011, we established our North America Shale Operating Principles to guide how we
operate. Public concerns have been raised about risks related to hydraulic fracturing fluids, groundwater contamination, seismicity, land
resources, GHG emissions and increased vehicular traffic. We work to understand these risks and what can be done to reduce or eliminate any
potential impacts associated with our operations. Our North America Shale Operating Principles highlight our commitment to be the safest
company in the industry; protect the land where we operate; safeguard and manage our water resources; minimise air emissions from our
operations; and to be a good neighbour to our communities.
Producing gas from shale involves injecting water, sand and a small amount of chemicals under high pressure into the shale rock. This process is
known as hydraulic fracturing. Typically, this occurs hundreds of metres below the water table, with protective rock between the groundwater
aquifers and the shale gas formation. The hydraulic fracturing process enables hydrocarbons to be released into the wells, which are lined with
protective steel casings and cemented across the groundwater intervals and water-producing formations to form continuous barriers between the
well and any groundwater.
We do not drill or conduct hydraulic fracturing operations in an area without having confidence that water resources are protected. Our goal is to
minimise our impact on surface water and groundwater and protect local resources. We have introduced an initiative to reduce water usage
across our operations and are evaluating technologies to improve the re-use and recycling of water.
The water produced from the wells, including the hydraulic fracturing fluids, is disposed of in accordance with applicable oil and gas industry
regulations and BHP Billiton operating standards. The composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, including chemicals, is publicly disclosed in the
hydraulic fracturing Chemical Disclosure Registry, FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org).
2.8.11    Supporting and engaging with our communities
With operations across the globe, we interact with a wide range of stakeholders who represent our host communities, regions and nations. We
take their views and concerns into account in our decision-making and always strive for mutually beneficial outcomes.
We define stakeholders as those who are potentially affected by our operations or who have an interest in or influence what we do. Our operations
are required to establish platforms for dialogue and to consider stakeholder expectations and concerns for activities throughout the life cycle of
an operation.
Effectively engaging with communities
We seek to build trust with stakeholders at the earliest possible stage of a project’s life. Our Community GLD requires that a Stakeholder
Engagement Management Plan be in place from the development phase of a project and be reviewed annually. The plans identify the interests and
relationships of stakeholders and contain a range of culturally and socially inclusive engagement activities to encourage open communication.
Table of Contents
104
Engagement activities vary from monthly meetings to open public forums, with topics ranging from town amenity and housing to impacts of
growth and expansion projects, contractor management, security, cultural issues and socio-economic development. Our responses to concerns
or complaints are recorded, as are any commitments we may make.
Our operations are required to measure the effectiveness of their stakeholder engagement by conducting community perception surveys every
three years. These surveys provide a valuable external perspective on the quality of our engagement and whether our stakeholders believe we are
effectively addressing the key concerns of their communities.
Addressing community concerns
Our operations are required to have local processes to accept, assess and resolve community concerns, complaints and grievances about the
performance or behaviour of BHP Billiton and our people. The processes reflect the country context and associated risks and are transparent,
culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the community. As part of the resolution process, all complaints and grievances
are required to be acknowledged, documented and investigated internally. As required, appropriate actions are implemented and complainants
are advised of the outcome.
Free Prior and Informed Consent
We have worked with the ICMM to develop a progressive position statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining. This statement, which comes into
effect in May 2015, specifically addresses the issue of Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). As a member of ICMM, we will work to incorporate
these elements in our internal standards, engage with government and potentially impacted Indigenous peoples and endeavour to obtain the
relevant consent for our new projects in accordance with the statement.
The statement describes FPIC as a process based on good faith negotiation through which Indigenous peoples can give or withhold their
consent using processes consistent with their traditional decision-making practices. Supporting commitments address understanding their rights
and interests, building cross-cultural understanding, and agreeing on appropriate engagement processes and participation in decision-making.
A number of related commitments address how ICMM members should engage where government is responsible for managing Indigenous
peoples’ interests and how to move forward when differences of opinion arise. The ICMM’s position recognises the right of governments to
ultimately make decisions on development of resources and that, in most countries, neither Indigenous peoples nor other groups have a right to
veto projects. Where consent cannot be reached, a host government may decide to proceed with a project after balancing the rights and interests
of Indigenous peoples with the wider population. In these circumstances, it will be up to ICMM member companies to determine whether they
remain involved with the project.
Acknowledging customary rights
At a very early stage in a project, we seek to identify landowners, occupiers and users who may be affected by our activities. Knowing who is
connected to and uses the land is critical to establishing an effective community consultation and engagement program. It helps to ensure people
potentially affected by our operations are fully aware of our activities and have an opportunity to express their concerns and aspirations. Arising
from this engagement, the operational work plan may be amended to reduce potential impacts on landowners and users.
Surveys are commissioned to identify the customary owners and how the land is being used to ensure these uses are taken into account in our
development plans. In instances where land may be used for customary purposes and no formal land title has been issued, information is
requested from relevant organisations, including government authorities with responsibilities for customary land uses and Indigenous people’s
representative organisations, such as land and tribal councils. Further enquiries are also made directly with the people in the area to help identify
those with connections to the land.
Table of Contents
2.8.12    Respecting human rights
105
We have a responsibility to understand our potential impacts on human rights and to mitigate or eliminate them. We are committed to operating in
accordance with the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the
UN Global Compact Principles, Our Charter and Code of Business Conduct, and the performance requirements detailed in our GLDs support this
commitment.
Our human rights due diligence process
Our human rights due diligence process requires our operations to identify and document key potential human rights risks by completing a
human rights impact assessment (HRIA). We require each HRIA to be verified and validated through an engagement process with stakeholders,
and by a qualified specialist every three years and must be internally reviewed on an annual basis. Where a HRIA identifies a material risk, we
require that a Human Rights Management Plan be developed and implemented. Selected employees and contractors receive training on how to
comply with BHP Billiton’s human rights commitments.
Security and country risk
Our Security and Emergency Management GLD requires all our operations to identify security-related material risks to our people and property
and engage relevant stakeholders to develop and manage security programs that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. The nature
and global reach of our organisation can result in our people working in countries where there is potential exposure to personal and business
risk. We require an assessment of each country for the degree of risk associated with visiting, exploring and operating within it; and appropriate
controls are developed to mitigate identified risks. The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) assist organisations to maintain
the safety and security of their operations through the provision of an operating framework.
We use both public and private security providers to protect our people and assets. Our Security and Emergency Management GLD requires
private security providers engaged by BHP Billiton to be signatories to, or agree in writing to align with, the International Code of Conduct for
Private Security Providers. In addition to this, written advice is given to security providers outlining our commitment to the VPs and our
expectations. Occasionally, it is necessary to provide armed security protection for the safety of our people. Firearms are only deployed under a
set of approved rules of engagement and when it can be demonstrated that no other options exist to protect a human life, to carry out stewardship
requirements (such as injured livestock management) or as a means of last resort when threatened by dangerous wildlife. Criteria for the use of
firearms and rules of engagement must comply with the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, ‘Firearms and the Use of Force’
(Report number 320, Revision 2).
2.8.13    Making a positive contribution to society
We believe we have an economic and social responsibility to make a positive contribution to the development of communities, regions and
countries where we operate.
Our broad socio-economic contribution
At a Group level, we are an active participant in industry and sustainable development forums, such as the ICMM. We seek to understand our
socio-economic impact on local communities and host regions through our participation in the ICMM’s Mining: Partnerships for Development
initiative. This global initiative builds on the ICMM’s Resource Endowment initiative and seeks to enhance mining’s contribution to development
and poverty reduction through multi-stakeholder partnerships.
Table of Contents
106
We engage with governments on a range of policy issues and also play a role in advocating transparent and ethical governance, through our own
actions and in discussion with opinion leaders. Nationally and regionally, we contribute taxes and royalties to governments that in turn provide
infrastructure and services to their constituents. Additionally, we often develop infrastructure that provides local communities and businesses
with benefits such as airports, roads, community childcare centres and medical clinics.
Training and employing local people is important to us. However, our ability to have a significant impact on unemployment is limited by the nature
of our operations, as typically we require highly skilled people with relevant industry and technical experience. We make a broader economic
contribution through indirect employment, where we focus on building the capacity of local businesses to provide us with a diverse range of
services and products. In FY2013, 63 per cent of our Group spend was with local and regional suppliers. Local and regional spend, in this context,
refers to spend within the communities in which we operate and the regions, such as states and provinces, where our operations are located.
We voluntarily invest one per cent of our pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community
programs that aim to have a long-lasting positive impact on people’s quality of life. This includes implementing new and supporting existing
community projects.
Investing in the community
Our community development programs are focused on improving the quality of life for people in our host communities. Each community
development project is required to be linked to a Community Development Management Plan. The plans are developed in consultation with local
stakeholders and formulated from data gathered from an impacts and opportunities assessment and a social baseline study that identifies key
quality-of-life indicators. We will monitor progress by tracking changes against these indicators every three years.
Community development projects are selected on the basis of their capacity to have a positive impact on quality-of-life indicators for the relevant
community and to support the Group’s licence to operate. Projects are required to have documented objectives specifically linked to the
achievement of long-term, sustainable outcomes and improvements in indicators identified in the social baseline study. Prior to approval,
community projects are required to be assessed in relation to anti-corruption requirements, and are implemented in accordance with our Code of
Business Conduct.
During FY2013, our voluntary community investment totalled US$245.8 million, comprising US$121 million cash, US$18.8 million for in-kind
support and administrative costs and a US$106 million contribution to the BHP Billiton Foundation. The BHP Billiton Foundation was established
in FY2013 to identify and support large sustainable development projects in countries and regions of interest to BHP Billiton to complement the
local programs managed by our assets. This builds on contributions that have previously been made to the BHP Billiton Sustainable
Communities charitable organisation in the United Kingdom. During FY2013, BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities’ expenditure was US$17
million, which included major projects, support for disaster relief efforts and donations to not-for-profit organisations as part of the Company’s
Matched Giving Program. At the end of June 2013, BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities and the BHP Billiton Foundation had a total of US$277.4
million in funds available for future sustainable development projects.

The US$121 million cash component of our investment supported: community programs; the Group’s charitable foundations (excluding the BHP
Billiton Foundation); and the enterprise and socio-economic development components of our broad-based Black Economic Empowerment
programs in South Africa. Of the US$121 million in cash expenditure during FY2013, 37 per cent was invested in local communities; 41 per cent
was invested regionally and the remaining 22 per cent was invested in national or international programs in countries where we operate.
Supporting employee contributions through matched giving
In addition to the social programs directly supported by the Group, many of our employees make a valuable contribution to their local
communities by giving donations and their personal time and expertise to a range of activities. One of the most significant ways we support the
efforts of our employees engaged in community activities is through our global Matched Giving Program, whereby employee volunteering hours
and donation contributions are matched. The program aims to strengthen local communities by supporting and encouraging employees who
volunteer or donate to not-for-profit organisations. In FY2013, more than 5,700 employees participated in the Matched Giving Program,
volunteering a total of approximately 56,800 hours of their own time to community activities important to them. Employee contributions benefited
more than 1,500 not-for-profit organisations, which received US$7.5 million as part of the program.

The BHP Billiton Group consists of the BHP Billiton Limited Group and the BHP Billiton Plc Group as a combined enterprise, following the
completion of the DLC merger in June 2001. Refer to note 26 ‘Subsidiaries’ to the financial statements for a list of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP
Billiton Plc significant subsidiaries.
The BHP Billiton DLC merger was designed to place shareholders of both companies in a position where they effectively have an interest in a
single group that combines the assets, and is subject to the liabilities, of both companies. BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have each
retained their separate corporate identities and maintain separate stock exchange listings, but they are operated and managed as if they are a
single unified economic entity, with their boards and senior executive management comprising the same people.
2.10.2    DLC structure
The principles of the BHP Billiton DLC are reflected in the BHP Billiton Sharing Agreement and include the following:
•
the two companies are to operate as if they are a single unified economic entity, through Boards of Directors that comprise the same individuals and a
unified senior executive management;
Table of Contents
109
•
•
the Directors of both companies will, in addition to their duties to the company concerned, have regard to the interests of BHP Billiton Limited
shareholders and BHP Billiton Plc shareholders as if the two companies were a single unified economic entity and, for that purpose, the Directors of
each company take into account in the exercise of their powers the interests of the shareholders of the other;
certain DLC equalisation principles must be observed. These are designed to ensure that for so long as the Equalisation Ratio between a BHP Billiton
Limited share and a BHP Billiton Plc share is 1:1, the economic and voting interests in the combined BHP Billiton Group resulting from the holding of
one BHP Billiton Limited share are equivalent to that resulting from one BHP Billiton Plc share. Further details are set out in the sub-section
‘Equalisation of economic and voting rights’ below.
Additional documents that affect the DLC include:
•
•
BHP Billiton Limited Constitution
BHP Billiton Plc Articles of Association
•
•
•
BHP Billiton Special Voting Shares Deed
BHP Billiton Limited Deed Poll Guarantee
BHP Billiton Plc Deed Poll Guarantee.
Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) conditions
The Treasurer of Australia approved the DLC merger subject to certain conditions, the effect of which was to require that, among other things,
BHP Billiton Limited continues to:
•
•
be an Australian company, which is managed from Australia;
ultimately manage and control the companies conducting the business that was conducted by it at the time of the merger for as long as those
businesses form part of the BHP Billiton Group.
The conditions have effect indefinitely, subject to amendment of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 or any revocation or
amendment by the Treasurer of Australia. If BHP Billiton Limited no longer wishes to comply with these conditions, it must obtain the prior
approval of the Treasurer. Failure to comply with the conditions attracts substantial penalties under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act
1975.
Equalisation of economic and voting rights
BHP Billiton Limited shareholders and BHP Billiton Plc shareholders have economic and voting interests in the combined BHP Billiton Group.
The economic and voting interests represented by a share in one company relative to the economic and voting interests of a share in the other
company are determined by reference to a ratio known as the Equalisation Ratio. Presently, the economic and voting interests attached to each
BHP Billiton Limited share and each BHP Billiton Plc share are the same, since the Equalisation Ratio is 1:1. The Equalisation Ratio would change
if either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc returned value to only its shareholders and no matching action was taken.
This means that the amount of any cash dividend paid by BHP Billiton Limited in respect of each BHP Billiton Limited share is normally matched
by an equivalent cash dividend by BHP Billiton Plc in respect of each BHP Billiton Plc share, and vice versa. If one company has insufficient
profits or is otherwise unable to pay the agreed dividend, BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc will, as far as practicable, enter into such
transactions as are necessary to enable both companies to pay the agreed amount of pre-tax dividends per share.
Joint Electorate Actions
Under the terms of the DLC agreements, the BHP Billiton Limited Constitution and the BHP Billiton Plc Articles of Association have implemented
special voting arrangements so that the shareholders of both companies vote
Table of Contents
110
together as a single decision-making body on matters affecting the shareholders of each company in similar ways (such matters are referred to as
Joint Electorate Actions). For so long as the Equalisation Ratio remains 1:1, each BHP Billiton Limited share will effectively have the same voting
rights as each BHP Billiton Plc share on Joint Electorate Actions.
A Joint Electorate Action requires approval by ordinary resolution (or special resolution if required by statute, regulation, applicable listing rules
or other applicable requirements) of BHP Billiton Limited and also of BHP Billiton Plc. Both the BHP Billiton Limited ordinary shareholders and the
holder of the BHP Billiton Limited Special Voting Share vote as a single class and, in the case of BHP Billiton Plc, the BHP Billiton Plc ordinary
shareholders and the holder of the BHP Billiton Plc Special Voting Share vote as a single class.
Class Rights Actions
In the case of certain actions in relation to which the two bodies of shareholders may have divergent interests (referred to as Class Rights
Actions), the company wishing to carry out the Class Rights Action requires the prior approval of the shareholders in the other company voting
separately and, where appropriate, the approval of its own shareholders voting separately. Depending on the type of Class Rights Action
undertaken, the approval required is either an ordinary or special resolution of the relevant company.
These voting arrangements are secured through the constitutional documents of the two companies, the BHP Billiton Sharing Agreement, the
BHP Billiton Special Voting Shares Deed and rights attaching to a specially created Special Voting Share issued by each company and held in
each case by a Special Voting Company. The shares in the Special Voting Companies are held legally and beneficially by Law Debenture Trust
Corporation Plc.
Cross guarantees
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have each executed a Deed Poll Guarantee, pursuant to which creditors entitled to the benefit of the BHP
Billiton Limited Deed Poll Guarantee and the BHP Billiton Plc Deed Poll Guarantee will, to the extent possible, be placed in the same position as if
the relevant debts were owed by both BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc on a combined basis.
Restrictions on takeovers of one company only
The BHP Billiton Limited Constitution and the BHP Billiton Plc Articles of Association have been drafted to ensure that, except with the consent of
the Board, a person cannot gain control of one company without having made an equivalent offer to the shareholders of both companies on
equivalent terms. Sanctions for breach of these provisions would include withholding of dividends, voting restrictions and the compulsory
divestment of shares to the extent a shareholder and its associates exceed the relevant threshold.
2.11    Material contracts
DLC agreements
On 29 June 2001, BHP Billiton Limited (then known as BHP Limited) and BHP Billiton Plc (then known as Billiton Plc) merged by way of a DLC
structure. To effect the DLC, BHP Limited and Billiton Plc (as they were then known) entered into the following agreements designed to place the
shareholders of both companies in a position where they effectively have an interest in a single group that combines the assets, and is subject to
all the liabilities, of both companies:
•
•
•
•
BHP Billiton Sharing Agreement
BHP Billiton Special Voting Shares Deed

The effect of each of these agreements and the manner in which they operate are described in section 2.10 of this Annual Report.
2.12    Constitution
The following text summarises the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc. The effect of the
Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc is, so far as possible, identical. Where the term ‘BHP
Billiton’ is used in this description of the Constitution and Articles of Association, it can be read to mean either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton
Plc.
Certain provisions of the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc can only be amended where such
amendment is approved by special resolution either:
•
•
by approval as a Class Rights Action, where the amendment results in a change to an ‘Entrenched Provision’; or
otherwise, as a Joint Electorate Action.
A description of Joint Electorate Actions and Class Rights Actions is contained under the heading ‘Equalisation of economic and voting rights’ in
section 2.10.2 of this Annual Report.
2.12.1    Directors
The management and control of the business and affairs of BHP Billiton are vested in the Board of Directors, which may exercise all powers of
BHP Billiton, other than those which are required to be exercised or done by BHP Billiton in a general meeting.
2.12.2    Power to issue securities
BHP Billiton may, pursuant to the Constitution and Articles of Association, issue any shares or other securities (including redeemable shares)
with preferred, deferred or other special rights, obligations or restrictions as and when the Directors may determine and on any other terms the
Directors consider appropriate, provided that:
•
•
•
any such issue does not affect any special rights conferred on the holders of any shares;
any such issue is subject to the provisions regarding shareholder approval in the Constitution and Articles of Association;
the rights attaching to a class other than ordinary shares are expressed at the date of issue.
2.12.3    Restrictions on voting by Directors
A Director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or any other proposal in which he or she has a material personal interest. A
Director shall not be counted in the quorum at a meeting in relation to any resolution on which he or she is not entitled to vote.
In addition, under the UK Companies Act 2006, a Director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has (or can have) a direct or indirect
interest that conflicts (or may conflict) with the interests of the company. The duty is not infringed, if among other things, the situation is
authorised by non-interested Directors. The Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc enable the Board to authorise a matter that might otherwise
involve a Director breaching his or her duty to avoid conflicts of interest. An interested Director may not vote or be counted towards a quorum for
a resolution authorising such a situation. Where the Board gives such authorisation, the Board may prohibit, or may establish regulations which
prohibit, the relevant Director from voting on any matter relating to the conflict. The Board has adopted procedures to manage these voting
restrictions.
Table of Contents
112
Subject to applicable laws, a Director is entitled to vote, and be counted in the quorum, in respect of any resolution concerning any of the
following matters, namely where the material personal interest:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
arises because the Director is a shareholder of BHP Billiton and is held in common with the other shareholders of BHP Billiton;
arises in relation to the Director’s remuneration as a Director of BHP Billiton;
relates to a contract BHP Billiton is proposing to enter into that is subject to approval by the shareholders and will not impose any obligation on BHP
Billiton if it is not approved by the shareholders;
arises merely because the Director is a guarantor or has given an indemnity or security for all or part of a loan, or proposed loan, to BHP Billiton;
arises merely because the Director has a right of subrogation in relation to a guarantee or indemnity referred to above;
relates to a contract that insures, or would insure, the Director against liabilities the Director incurs as an officer of BHP Billiton, but only if the contract
does not make BHP Billiton or a related body corporate the insurer;
relates to any payment by BHP Billiton or a related body corporate in respect of an indemnity permitted by law, or any contract relating to such an
indemnity; or
is in a contract, or proposed contract with, or for the benefit of, or on behalf of, a related body corporate and arises merely because the Director is a
director of a related body corporate.
2.12.4    Loans by Directors
Any Director may lend money to BHP Billiton at interest with or without security or may, for a commission or profit, guarantee the repayment of
any money borrowed by BHP Billiton and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares or securities of BHP Billiton or of any corporation in
which BHP Billiton may be interested without being disqualified as a Director and without being liable to account to BHP Billiton for any
commission or profit.
2.12.5    Retirement of Directors
In 2011, the Board adopted a policy consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, under which all Directors must, if they wish to remain on
the Board, seek re-election by shareholders annually. This policy took effect at the 2011 Annual General Meetings, and replaced the previous
system, as set out in the Constitution and Articles of Association, under which Directors were required to submit themselves to shareholders for
re-election at least every three years.
2.12.6    Rights attaching to shares
Dividend rights
Under English law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits available for distribution. Under Australian law, dividends on shares may
only be paid out of net assets, provided that the payment is fair and reasonable to the company’s shareholders as a whole and the payment of the
dividend does not materially prejudice the company’s ability to pay its creditors. The Constitution and Articles of Association provide that
payment of any dividend may be made in any manner, by any means and in any currency determined by the Board.
All unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of whichever of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc
declared that dividend, until claimed or, in the case of BHP Billiton Limited, otherwise disposed of according to law. In the case of BHP Billiton Plc,
any dividend unclaimed after a period of 12 years from the date on which such dividend was declared or became due for payment shall be
forfeited and shall revert to BHP Billiton Plc.

Voting rights
113
Voting at any general meeting of BHP Billiton Limited shareholders can, in the first instance, be conducted by a show of hands unless a poll is
demanded by any of the following (except in relation to the election of a chairman of a meeting or, unless the Chairman otherwise determines, the
adjournment of a meeting), or is otherwise required (as outlined below):
•
•
•
the Chairman;
any shareholder under the law; or
the holder of the BHP Billiton Limited Special Voting Share.
Voting at any general meeting of BHP Billiton Plc can, in the first instance, be conducted by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by any of
the following, (except in relation to the election of a chairman of a meeting or, unless the Chairman otherwise determines, the adjournment of a
meeting), or is otherwise required (as outlined below):
•
•
•
•
the Chairman;
not less than five members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote;
a member or members present in person or by proxy and representing not less than five per cent of the total voting rights of all the members having the
right to vote at the meeting; or
the holder of the BHP Billiton Plc Special Voting Share.
As described under the heading ‘Equalisation of economic and voting rights’ in section 2.10.2 of this Annual Report, certain matters may be
decided as Joint Electorate Actions or Class Rights Actions. Any matter considered by shareholders at an Annual General Meeting of BHP Billiton
Limited or BHP Billiton Plc constitutes a Joint Electorate Action and shall therefore be decided on a poll. Therefore, in practice, generally all items
of business at Annual General Meetings proceed directly to poll.
In addition, at any general meeting a resolution, other than a procedural resolution, put to the vote of the meeting on which the holder of the
relevant BHP Billiton Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided on a poll.
For the purposes of determining which shareholders are entitled to attend or vote at a meeting of BHP Billiton Plc or BHP Billiton Limited, and how
many votes such shareholder may cast, the relevant company will specify in any notice of meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time
fixed for the meeting, by which a shareholder must be entered on the Register of Shareholders in order to have the right to attend or vote at the
relevant meeting.
Shareholders who wish to appoint a proxy to attend, vote or speak at a meeting of BHP Billiton Plc or BHP Billiton Limited (as appropriate) on their
behalf, must deposit the relevant form appointing a proxy in accordance with the instructions contained in any notice of meeting, so as to be
received in the specified manner not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting to which the appointment of a proxy
relates.

Any surplus remaining after payment of the distributions above shall be payable to the holders of the BHP Billiton Plc ordinary shares in equal
amounts per BHP Billiton Plc ordinary share.
2.12.7    Right on a return of assets on liquidation
On a return of assets on liquidation of BHP Billiton Limited, the assets of BHP Billiton Limited remaining available for distribution among
shareholders, after giving effect to the payment of all prior ranking amounts owed to all creditors and holders of preference shares, and to all prior
ranking statutory entitlements, shall be applied in paying to the holders of the BHP Billiton Limited Special Voting Share and the Equalisation
Share (if any) an amount of up to A$2.00 on each such share, on an equal priority with any amount paid to the holders of BHP Billiton Limited
ordinary shares, and any surplus remaining shall be applied in making payments solely to the holders of BHP Billiton Limited ordinary shares in

cumulative preference shares held by them and accrual, if any, of the Preferential Dividend, whether such dividend has been earned or declared or
not, calculated up to the date of commencement of the winding-up.
To the holders of the BHP Billiton Plc ordinary shares and to the holders of the BHP Billiton Plc Special Voting Share and the Equalisation Share, the
payment out of surplus, if any, remaining after the distribution above of an equal amount for each BHP Billiton Plc ordinary share, the BHP Billiton Plc
Special Voting Share and the Equalisation Share, if issued, subject to a maximum in the case of the BHP Billiton Plc Special Voting Share and the
Equalisation Share of the nominal capital paid up on such shares.
Table of Contents
2.12.8    Redemption of preference shares
115
If BHP Billiton Limited at any time proposes to create and issue any preference shares, the preference shares may be issued on the terms that
they are to be redeemed or, at the option of either or both BHP Billiton Limited and the holder, are liable to be redeemed, whether out of share
capital, profits or otherwise.
The preference shares confer on the holders the right to convert the preference shares into ordinary shares if, and on the basis, the Board
determines at the time of issue of the preference shares.
The preference shares are to confer on the holders:
•
the right (on redemption and on a winding up) to payment in cash in priority to any other class of shares of (i) the amount paid or agreed to be
considered as paid on each of the preference shares; (ii) the amount, if any, equal to the aggregate of any dividends accrued but unpaid and of any
arrears of dividends; and
•
the right, in priority to any payment of dividend on any other class of shares, to the preferential dividend.
There is no equivalent provision in the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc although as noted in section 2.12.2 above, BHP Billiton can
issue preference shares which are subject to a right of redemption on terms the Board considers appropriate.
2.12.9    Capital calls
Subject to the terms on which any shares may have been issued, the Board may make calls on the shareholders in respect of all monies unpaid
on their shares. BHP Billiton has a lien on every partly paid share for all amounts payable in respect of that share. Each shareholder is liable to
pay the amount of each call in the manner, at the time and at the place specified by the Board (subject to receiving at least 14 days’ notice
specifying the time and place for payment). A call is considered to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the
call was passed.
2.12.10    Borrowing powers
Subject to relevant law, the Directors may exercise all powers of BHP Billiton to borrow money, and to mortgage or charge its undertaking,
property, assets (both present and future) and all uncalled capital or any part or parts thereof and to issue debentures and other securities,
whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of BHP Billiton or of any third party.
2.12.11    Changes to rights of shareholders
Rights attached to any class of shares issued by either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc can only be varied (whether as a Joint Electorate
Action or a Class Rights Action) where such variation is approved both:
•
•
by the Company that issued the relevant shares, as a special resolution; and
by the holders of the issued shares of the affected class, either by a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares
of the class affected, or with the written consent of members with at least 75 per cent of the votes of that class.
2.12.12    Conditions governing general meetings
All provisions relating to general meetings apply with any necessary modifications to any special meeting of any class of shareholders that may
be held. Therefore, the following information relates equally to general meetings and any special meeting of any class of shareholders.
The Board may and shall on requisition in accordance with applicable laws call a general meeting of the shareholders at the time and place or
places and in the manner determined by the Board. No shareholder may

convene a general meeting of BHP Billiton except where entitled under law to do so. Any Director may convene a general meeting whenever the
Director thinks fit. General meetings can also be cancelled, postponed or adjourned, where permitted by law or the Constitution or Articles of

2.13    Reserves
2.13.1    Petroleum reserves
Reserves and production
BHP Billiton Petroleum proved reserves are estimated and reported according to SEC standards. For FY2013, proved oil and gas reserves have
been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids (NGL), which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods,
operating contracts and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain,
estimates of economically producible reserves reflect only the period before the contracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must
have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence within a reasonable time. Developed oil and gas reserves are
reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, and
Table of Contents
117
through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving
a well. As specified in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X, oil and gas prices are taken as the unweighted average of the corresponding first day of the
month prices for the 12 months prior to the ending date of the period covered.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to future revision. Accordingly,
financial and accounting measures (such as the standardised measure of discounted cash flows, depreciation, depletion and amortisation
charges, the assessment of impairments and the assessment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets) that are based on reserve
estimates are also subject to change.
Proved reserves were estimated by reference to available well and reservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data, core
data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data and, in some cases, to similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs. A wide
range of engineering and geoscience methods, including performance analysis, well analogues and geologic studies were used to estimate high
confidence proved developed and undeveloped reserves in accordance with SEC regulations. For our conventional assets, performance of
producing wells was based on rate and pressure decline methods, including material balance, and was supplemented by reservoir simulation
where appropriate. In our Onshore US shale assets, performance of producing wells was based on rate decline and pressure normalised decline
curve analysis methods. For wells that lacked sufficient production history, reserves were estimated using performance-based type curves and
offset location analogues with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. When assessing proved undeveloped locations, a combination of
geologic and engineering data, and where appropriate, statistical analysis was used to support the assignment of proved undeveloped reserves.
Performance data, along with log and core data, was used to delineate consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in core areas of the
development. Proved undeveloped locations were included in core areas between known data and adjacent to productive wells. Locations where
a high degree of certainty could not be demonstrated using the above technologies and techniques, were not categorised as proved.
Proved reserve estimates were attributed to future development projects only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and
execution, and for which applicable government and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured.
Furthermore, estimates of proved reserves include only volumes for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty. All proved
reserve estimates are subject to revision, either upward or downward, based on new information, such as from development drilling and
production activities, or from changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development plans.
The Petroleum Reserves Group (PRG) is a dedicated group that provides oversight of the reserves’ assessment and reporting processes. It is
independent of the various asset teams directly responsible for development and production activities. The PRG is staffed by individuals
averaging over 30 years’ experience in the oil and gas industry. The manager of the PRG is a full-time employee of BHP Billiton and is the
individual responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and compiling the information for inclusion in this Annual Report.
He has an advanced degree in engineering and over 30 years of diversified industry experience in reservoir engineering, reserves assessment,
field development and technical management and is a 30-year member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). He has also served on the
Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. The PRG manager has reviewed and agrees with the information included in
section 2.13.1 of this Annual Report. No part of the individual compensation for members of the PRG is dependent on reported reserves.
Petroleum’s reserves are estimated as of 30 June 2013. Reserve assessments for all Petroleum properties were conducted by technical staff
within the operating organisation. These individuals meet the professional qualifications outlined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, are
trained in the fundamentals of SEC reserves reporting and the reserves processes and are endorsed by the PRG. Each reserve assessment is
reviewed annually by the PRG to ensure technical quality, adherence to internally published Petroleum business guidelines and
Table of Contents
118
compliance with SEC reporting requirements. Once endorsed by the PRG, all reserves receive final endorsement by senior management and the
Risk and Audit Committee prior to public reporting. Our internal Group Risk Assessment and Assurance provides secondary assurance of the oil
and gas reserve reporting processes through annual audits.
Production for FY2013 totalled 236 million barrels of oil equivalent (1) (MMboe) in sales, which is an increase of 14 MMboe over FY2012. There was
an additional 5 MMboe in non-sales production, primarily for fuel consumed in our Petroleum operations. During FY2013, Petroleum added a total
of 246 MMboe of proved oil and gas reserves. Excluding net purchases and sales of negative 2 MMboe, proved additions of 248 MMboe replaced
103 per cent of production sales through extensions, discoveries, revisions and improved recovery. At 30 June 2013, approximately 48 per cent of
our proved reserves were in conventional assets, while approximately 52 per cent were in unconventional assets.
New additions from extensions and discoveries totalled 501 MMboe, primarily for new liquids-focused development projects in the Eagle Ford
area, located onshore in the United States. Improved recovery additions were 14 MMboe and are associated with a water injection project at the
Shenzi field in the Gulf of Mexico. Revisions were negative 267 MMboe and are primarily related to deferral of drilling in undeveloped areas of the
Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Fayetteville areas that contain relatively dry gas with little or no associated liquids.
Our proved reserves for conventional assets decreased by 7 MMboe in FY2013. The Mad Dog Phase 2 project accounted for 65 MMboe of this
reduction and was due to a partial sale of interest (2 MMboe) and the decision to send the project back to the study phase in view of higher
projected costs for the originally approved development. Partially offsetting this were the noted Shenzi improved recovery additions, extensions
of 6 MMboe in fields in the North West Shelf area of Australia and Atlantis in the Gulf of Mexico along with 38 MMboe of revisions in several other
fields.
In the North American shale fields, proved reserves increased by 253 MMboe. Net developed reserve extensions due to drilling were 144 MMboe
while conversions from undeveloped to developed reserves totalled 44 MMboe. Field performance added an additional 28 MMboe to proved
reserves. During FY2013, forward drilling plans were directed towards liquids-focused areas having higher value, and allowed 350 MMboe of
proved undeveloped reserves to be added as extensions. Proved undeveloped well locations that are now planned to be drilled in more than five
years’ time, as a result of refocused drilling plans, have been reclassified out of proved undeveloped and resulted in a reduction of 269 MMboe.
These results are summarised in the tables below, which detail estimated oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas reserves at 30 June 2013, 30 June
2012 and 30 June 2011, with a reconciliation of the changes in each year. Reserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and
represent net interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalty. Reserves of 66 MMboe are in two production and risk-sharing arrangements
that involve the Group in upstream risks and rewards without transfer of ownership of the products. At 30 June 2013, approximately two per cent
of the proved reserves are attributable to those arrangements.

Total boe conversion is based on the following: 6000 scf of natural gas equals 1 boe.

Proved undeveloped reserves
123
At 30 June 2013, Petroleum had 1,072 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves, as compared to 1,363 MMboe at 30 June 2012. The successful
completion of development activities and commissioning of both the North Rankin B compression platform and the Macedon gas project on the
North West Shelf in Australia converted approximately 242 MMboe of proved undeveloped to developed reserves and was the primary reason for
the reduction from FY2012.
Proved undeveloped reserves were removed from Mad Dog Phase 2 as previously noted. The 343 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves in the
conventional fields are located in large offshore projects. These reserves require significant capital expenditures and multi-year lead times before
initial production can be achieved. Based on the current project schedule, 99 per cent of the 1,072 MMboe currently classified as undeveloped is
in currently producing fields or fields being actively pursued, which are scheduled to start producing within the next five years. In currently
producing fields, the proved undeveloped reserves will be developed and brought on stream in a phased manner to best optimise the use of
production facilities and to meet long-term gas supply contracts.
The majority of proved undeveloped reserves at 30 June 2013 were in the North American shale fields, accounting for 729 MMboe. In these fields,
approximately half of this volume is in the Eagle Ford area, which is where we are increasing the focus of our drilling to develop and produce
higher value, liquids-rich gas. Management plans anticipate drilling all of these proved undeveloped reserves in the North American shale fields in
the next five years. None of these proved undeveloped reserves will be more than five years old at the time they are drilled.
Petroleum has an established track record of progressing large proved undeveloped reserves to developed, as evidenced by the conversion of
301 MMboe to developed in FY2013. Over the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped to developed has averaged 153 MMboe per
year. This is twice the average conversion rate reported in FY2012. During FY2013, Petroleum spent US$7.2 billion progressing development of
undeveloped reserves worldwide.
2.13.2     Ore Reserves
Ore Reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted and processed from our mining properties. In
order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades,
production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates. Estimating
the quantity and/or grade of Ore Reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as
drilling samples. Because the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period and because additional geological
and operational data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period. All of the Ore Reserve
figures presented are reported in 100 per cent terms and represent estimates at 30 June 2013 (unless otherwise stated). All tonnes and grade
information has been rounded, hence small differences may be present in the totals. Tonnes are reported as dry metric tonnes unless otherwise
stated.
Our mineral leases are of sufficient duration (or convey a legal right to renew for sufficient duration) to enable all Ore Reserves on the leased
properties to be mined in accordance with current production schedules. Our Ore Reserves may include areas where some additional approvals
remain outstanding but where, based on the technical investigations we carry out as part of our mine planning process and our knowledge and
experience of the approvals process, we expect that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the
timeframe required by the current life of mine schedule.
The reported Ore Reserves contained in this Annual Report do not exceed the quantities that we estimate could be extracted economically if
future prices for each commodity were equal to the average historical prices for the
Table of Contents
124
three years to 31 December 2012, using current operating costs. However, we do not use a bauxite, aluminium or alumina price to determine
bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the captive alumina refinery. In
addition to these specifications a number of modifying factors are used to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralised material. For our
Hotazel Manganese Mines, geological stratigraphic controls, cut-off grade and plant feed requirements are used to determine reserves.
Also, in some cases where commodities are produced as by-products (or co-products) with other metals, we use the three-year average historical
prices for the combination of commodities produced at the relevant mine in order to verify that each ore reserve is economic. The three-year
historical average prices used for each traded commodity to test for impairment of the Ore Reserves contained in this Annual Report are as
follows:
Commodity Price      US$
Copper      3.68/lb
Gold      1,488/oz
Nickel      9.42/lb
Silver      28.84/oz
Lead      1.00/lb
Zinc      0.95/lb
Uranium      50.36/lb
Iron Ore – Fines   2.246/dmtu
Iron Ore – Lump
2.427/dmtu
Metallurgical Hard Coking Coal      199.9/t
Thermal Coal Newcastle (1)      104.7/t
Thermal Coal Colombia (1)      90.6/t
(1)
Thermal coal prices reported are sourced from the McCloskey Report FOB by region. Newcastle 6000 kcal/tonne Net As Received and Colombia 11,300 British Thermal Units Gross
As Received. These are comparable to realised prices used to test for impairment. The realised price for South African Coal used to test for impairment is not aligned with the
McCloskey Report price and is not disclosed in this table due to contractual commercial sensitivity.
The reported reserves may differ in some respects from the reserves we report in our home jurisdictions of Australia and the UK. Those
jurisdictions require the use of the Australasian Code for reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012
(the JORC Code), which contemplates the use of reasonable investment assumptions in calculating reserve estimates.

Cerro Colorado – The decrease in reserves was due to changes in economic parameters.
Spence – Increase in reserves was due to a combination of additional drilling information and the addition of mixed Sulphide and Oxide ores and
Oxide Low Solubility ores previously considered waste.
Pinto Valley – Mining resumed in November 2012. Pinto Valley is being divested with the transaction completion anticipated in FY2014.
Antamina – Mo now reported as ppm, previously reported as %.
Cannington – The increase in reserves was primarily due to increased confidence as a result of drilling which allowed for mineralisation to be
converted to reserves.

(4)  WAIO metallurgical recovery was 100%, except for BKM Bene-Brockman Beneficiated Ore, where recovery was 74% (tonnage basis), Samarco JV
recovery was 82% (metal basis).
(5)  The reserves grades listed refer to in situ mass percentage on a dry weight basis. WAIO tonnages represent wet tonnes based on the following moisture
contents: BKM – Brockman 3%, BKM Bene – 3%, MM – Marra Mamba 4%, CID – Channel Iron Deposits 8%, NIM – Nimingarra 3.5%. For Samarco JV,
the reserve tonnages also represent wet tonnes based on a moisture content of 6.5% for ROM. Iron ore is marketed as Lump (direct blast furnace feed)
and Fines (sinter plant feed) (WAIO) and as Fines (sinter plant feed), direct reduction and blast furnace pellets (Samarco JV).
(6)  Cut-off grades – WAIO: 50 – 58% Fe for all material types; Samarco JV: Fe ³ 22%, Pc £ 0.097% (phosphorous in concentrate) and PPCc £ 7.7% (LOI in
concentrate).
(7)  Ore delivered to process plant.

(8)  WAIO reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine, except Cattle Gorge and Callawa (part of Mt
Goldsworthy JV Northern), which reside on standard Western Australian mining leases. Across WAIO, we are required to obtain certain State
Government approvals (including environmental and heritage clearances) before we commence mining operations in a particular area. We have
included in our Ore Reserves areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding but where, based on the technical investigations we carry out as
part of our mine planning process and our knowledge and experience of the approvals process, we expect that such approvals will be obtained as part
of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.
(9)  WAIO – Decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increase in nominated production from 170Mtpa in FY2012 to 207Mtpa in FY2013.
(10)  WAIO – Decrease in BKM Bene reserves was due to revision of economic assumptions used in the mine planning process.
(11)  WAIO – Reserves tonnage increase was due to revision of economic assumptions used in the mine planning process.
(12)  Jimblebar JV – Following completion of the ITOCHU and Mitsui transaction in July 2013, whereby ITOCHU and Mitsui have agreed to increase capital
contributions to the project, BHP Billiton’s economic interest in the Jimblebar JV was reduced to 85%.
(13)  Samarco JV – Increase in reserves was due to a model update incorporating additional drilling and a lower cut-off grade.

(3)  Total Coal Reserves are at the moisture content when mined (BHP Billiton Mitsui at 4% Moisture Content). Total Marketable Coal Reserves (tonnes) are
the tonnage of coal available, at moisture content (9% CQCA JV, Gregory JV, BHP Billiton Mitsui; 9% Appin, West Cliff; 13.5% Dendrobium Met; 7%
Dendrobium Th) and air-dried quality, for sale after the beneficiation of the Total Coal Reserves. Note that where the coal will not be beneficiated, the
tonnes of Total Coal Reserves are the tonnes of Total Marketable Coal Reserves, with moisture adjustment where applicable.
(4)  Cut-off criteria applied were – Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow, Peak Downs, Norwich Park, Blackwater and South Walker Creek: ³0.5m seam
thickness; Daunia, Gregory Crinum and Poitrel-Winchester: ³0.3m seam thickness; Saraji: ³0.3m seam thickness and ³20% yield; Appin, Westcliff,
Dendrobium: ³1.8m seam thickness.
(5)  Coal delivered to wash plant.
(6) Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow – The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increase in the nominated production rate from 21 Mtpa in FY2012 to 23 Mtpa in FY2013.
(7)  Daunia – The increase in Reserve Life was due to a decrease in the nominated production rate from 5.6 Mtpa in FY2012 to 4.5 Mtpa in FY2013.

(8) Gregory Crinum – Decrease in Coal Reserves was due to revised economic parameters.
(9)
South Walker Creek – Coal type previously called Met/Th is now called Met based on product specifications. A new geological model incorporating additional structural and analytical
data resulted in processing recovery being reduced from 75% in FY2012 to 72% in FY2013. The decrease in Coal Reserves was due to the processing recovery downgrade and
economic factors.
(10) Poitrel-Winchester – A new geological model incorporating additional structural and analytical data resulted in processing recovery being reduced from 74% in FY2012 to 67% in FY2013.
(11) Appin – Increase in Coal Reserves was due to the inclusion of an additional mining domain that is contiguous with the current operations and is covered by an existing mining tenement.
The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increase in the nominated production rate from 3.9 Mtpa in FY2012 to 6.1 Mtpa in FY2013.
(12) West Cliff – Decrease in Coal Reserves was due to exclusion of a thin low quality seam.
(13) Dendrobium – Decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increased nominated production rate from 3.2 Mtpa in FY2012 to 5 Mtpa in FY2013.

San Juan and Navajo – Coal Reserves were reduced to align with current sales contracts.
(7) Navajo – Divestment is in progress with binding agreements anticipated in FY2014.
(8)
South Africa – BHP Billiton interest has decreased from 100% to 90% in FY2013 due to the divestment of 8% shareholding in BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa (BECSA) to a
Black Economic Empowerment consortium and 2% shareholding to BECSA employees through a share ownership plan.
(9)
Khutala – The decrease in Marketable Coal Reserves was due to application of a crusher recovery factor.
(10) Wolvekrans – The decrease in Coal Reserves and Marketable Coal Reserves was due to additional drilling and remodelling, revised extraction factors for remaining underground pillar
reserves on some coal seams and the exclusion of devolatilised coal.
(11) Middelburg – The decrease in Coal Reserves and Marketable Coal Reserves was due to a lower ash cut-off (58% reduced to 45%) as a result of economic constraints, the exclusion of
environmentally sensitive areas and losses due to devolatilised coal.
(12) Klipspruit – The decrease in Coal Reserves was due to additional drilling and remodeling. Devolatilised coal was also excluded around a major intrusive dyke.
(13) Mt Arthur Coal – The increase in Marketable Coal Reserves was due to an increase in total moisture content, inclusion of an additional pit in the Life of Asset plan and increased product
yield assumptions. The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increase in the nominated production rate from 23.5 Mtpa in FY2012 to 26 Mtpa in FY2013.

3    Operating and financial review and prospects
3.1    Introduction
This section is intended to convey management’s perspective on the BHP Billiton Group’s recent operational and financial performance. We
intend this disclosure to assist readers to understand and interpret the financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) included in this Annual Report. The basis of preparation of the financial statements is set out in note 1 ‘Accounting
policies’ to the financial statements. The Operating and financial review and prospects should be read in conjunction with the financial statements,
together with the accompanying notes.
We are the world’s largest diversified natural resources company, with a combined market capitalisation of approximately US$147.1 billion as at
30 June 2013. We generated Revenue of US$66.0 billion and Profit attributable to shareholders of US$10.9 billion for FY2013.
We extract and process minerals, oil and gas from our production operations located primarily in Australia, the Americas and southern Africa. We
sell our products globally with sales and marketing taking place principally through our hubs in Singapore and Houston.
The following table shows the revenue by location of our customers.

During FY2013, we implemented a new organisational structure, removing a layer of management to create a more direct line of communication
with our operations. We consolidated and renamed our previous Customer Sector Groups (CSGs) into five Businesses. We now operate these five
Businesses aligned with the commodities that we extract and market, reflecting the structure used by management to assess the performance of
the Group.
The Group completed the following organisational changes during FY2013:
•
Following the sale of our diamonds business and interests in Richards Bay Minerals, we consolidated our Potash development activity with the
Petroleum CSG to form the Petroleum and Potash Business. In view of the new management structure, this Business is now considered to be a single
reportable segment. There were no inter-segment transactions between the Petroleum CSG and Potash business, and therefore the comparative
amounts reported for the new Petroleum and Potash segment for FY2012 and FY2011 are an aggregation of Petroleum and Potash. The remaining
amounts reported previously for the Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG have been included in Group and unallocated items.

138
The Base Metals CSG was renamed the Copper Business.
We consolidated the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs to form the Coal Business. In view of the new management structure, this Business is
now considered to be a single reportable segment. There were no inter-segment transactions between the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs
and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Coal segment for FY2012 and FY2011 are an aggregation of previously reported
amounts.
We consolidated the Aluminium, Manganese and Stainless Steel Materials CSGs to form the Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business. In view of
the new management structure, this Business is now considered to be a single reportable segment. There were no inter-segment transactions
between the Stainless Steel Materials, Aluminium and Manganese CSGs, and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Aluminium,
Manganese and Nickel segment for FY2012 and FY2011 are an aggregation of previously reported amounts.

3.2    Our strategy
Our strategy is to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity, geography and market.
Further information about our strategic drivers can be found in section 1.5 ‘Our strategy and business model’ and in section 3.4 ‘External factors
and trends affecting our results’ below.
3.3    Key measures
Our management and Board monitor a range of financial and operational performance indicators, reported on a monthly basis, to measure
performance over time.

Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any exceptional items. Underlying EBIT is included in the FY2013 financial statements as required by IFRS 8
‘Operating Segments’. Our use of Underlying EBIT is explained in section 3.6.2.
Not an IFRS measure and may be defined and used in differing ways by different entities. We believe that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information, but should not be
considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity. Non-IFRS measures have not been subject to audit or review.
Net operating cash flows are after net interest and taxation.
Underlying EBIT margin comprises Underlying EBIT, excluding third party EBIT, divided by revenue, excluding third party product revenue.

3.4    External factors and trends affecting our results
The following section describes some of the external factors and trends that have had a material impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. We operate our business in a dynamic and changing environment and with information that is rarely complete and exact. We primarily
manage the risks discussed in this section under our portfolio risk management approach, which relies on the effects of diversification, rather
than individual risk management programs. Details of our risk factors may be found in section 1.7.1 ‘Risk factors’. Details of our financial risk
management strategies and financial instruments outstanding at 30 June 2013 may be found in section 1.7.3 ‘Management of principal risks’ and
in note 29 ‘Financial risk management’ to the financial statements.
Management monitors particular trends arising from external factors with a view to managing the potential impact on our future financial condition
and results of operations. The following external factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and areas where we make decisions
on the basis of information that is incomplete or uncertain.

During FY2013, commodity markets were impacted by a slower pace of growth in China that was balanced in part by increased stability in
European sovereign debt markets and an improved private sector performance in the United States. In the case of most steelmaking raw
materials, demand growth rates outside China decreased, and combined with robust supply growth from seaborne sources, resulted in lower raw
material prices than the previous year. The metals commodities attracted lower prices than the previous year as a result of supply growing faster
than demand. For energy commodities, geopolitical tensions and United States economic improvements provided price support for crude oil,
while the US gas prices increased due to increased seasonal demand in the residential and commercial sector and decreased storage inventories
from the previous year.
The following summarises the pricing trends, based on the year-end prices, of our most significant commodities for FY2013.
Crude oil: The Platts Dated Brent crude price increased by eight per cent during FY2013, driven by Chinese demand growth in the first half of the
year followed by moderate improvements in macroeconomics in the United States in the second half. Middle East political tensions provided price
support, which offset negative drivers, including ongoing Eurozone concerns and a two per cent increase in US crude oil inventories.
Gas: The Platts US Henry Hub natural gas price increased by 33 per cent during FY2013. The Henry Hub price increase was driven by increased
seasonal demand in the residential and commercial sector in the United States. The Asian liquefied natural gas spot price increased by three per
cent during FY2013. This increase was supported by sustained demand from Japan to replace suspended nuclear capacity and growth in
emerging Asian markets and Latin America.
Natural gas liquids: A barrel of natural gas liquids consists mainly of ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (propane and butane). The Mont Belvieu
ethane price decreased by 19 per cent in FY2013 due to increases in supply, while Mont Belvieu propane prices increased by three per cent due to
increased exports. Mont Belvieu butane prices decreased by three per cent due to lower gasoline demand.
Copper: The London Metal Exchange (LME) copper cash settlement price decreased by 11 per cent during FY2013 driven by supply growing
faster than demand. Copper mine production recovered strongly in FY2013 from a constrained level, which was caused by disruptions in FY2012.
Consumption remained flat during the first half of FY2013, but increased in the second half, as Chinese end-use demand increased by seven per
cent.
Iron ore: The Platts 62 per cent iron ore CFR China price decreased by 14 per cent during FY2013 due to increased iron ore seaborne supply and
inventory destocking at Chinese steel mills. Prices fluctuated between US$88.5 per dry metric tonne (dmt) and US$160/dmt, as movements in iron
ore inventories caused volatility. Seaborne imports to China increased, as Australian supply growth more than offset the decrease in Brazilian and
Indian exports. Global demand for iron ore was primarily driven by China’s record pig iron production, which recovered strongly in the second
half of the financial year, after a seasonal decrease in the first half.

Table of Contents
Metallurgical coal: The Platts Low-Vol hard coking coal Index decreased by 41 per cent during FY2013, driven by decreased growth rates of global
pig iron production. Pig iron production decreased in Europe, which historically accounts for a large share of hard coking coal import demand.
Supply increased during the year, particularly from Australia and Canada.
Energy coal: The Global Coal Newcastle FOB price decreased by 12 per cent during FY2013. Seaborne demand growth was driven by China and
India, where volumes reached all-time record levels. Prices decreased as Indonesian, Australian and US exports increased simultaneously.
Aluminium: The LME aluminium cash settlement price decreased by six per cent during FY2013. Demand growth slowed, while simultaneously
new supply continued to be added, which contributed to an increasing market surplus. During this period, LME stocks reached record levels,
driven by the attractiveness of warehouse financing deals to investors.
Alumina: The Platts FOB Australia price increased by four per cent during FY2013, with price support coming from increasing demand and supply
disruptions during the year. The market remained balanced, with refinery production continuing to grow in China.
Manganese: The CRU China ore import price increased by 10 per cent during FY2013. Rising ore prices in the second half of FY2013 were
supported by record Chinese steel output, while supply from South Africa, Australia and Gabon increased to meet the higher demand. The US
spot high-carbon ferromanganese alloy price decreased 15 per cent during FY2013. Declining alloy prices were driven by oversupply in a weak
export market due to lower steel production in the developed economies of Europe and the United States
Nickel: The LME cash settlement nickel price decreased by 17 per cent during FY2013. Demand for nickel continued to grow, but at a lower rate
compared with the previous year. The price decreased as a result of the demand growth being outpaced by increasing supply tonnages, coming
mainly from Chinese nickel pig iron, as well as new production from greenfield projects.
3.4.2    Exchange rates
We are exposed to exchange rate transaction risk on foreign currency sales and purchases, as we believe that active currency hedging does not
provide long-term benefits to our shareholders. Because a majority of our sales are denominated in US dollars, and the US dollar plays a
dominant role in our business, we borrow and hold surplus cash predominantly in US dollars to provide a natural hedge. Operating costs and
costs of locally sourced equipment are influenced by fluctuations in local currencies, primarily the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Chilean peso
and South African rand. Foreign exchange gains and losses reflected in operating costs owing to fluctuations in the local currencies relative to
the US dollar may potentially offset one another. Volatility increased during the year, with a strengthening of the US dollar in the last quarter of
FY2013. Overall the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and South African rand ended the financial year weaker against the US dollar, while the Chilean
peso strengthened.
We are also exposed to exchange rate translation risk in relation to net monetary liabilities, being our foreign currency denominated monetary
assets and liabilities, including debt and other long-term liabilities. Details of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations are contained within
note 29 ‘Financial risk management’ to the financial statements.
3.4.3    Changes in product demand and supply
Global demand and supply for the commodities we produce is a key driver of commodity prices, and fluctuations in product demand and supply
affect our results, including cash flows and asset values.

Economic conditions over the second half of FY2013 were affected by lower than expected growth in emerging economies. Weaker trade and soft
manufacturing activity pulled growth rates slightly below expectations in China. However, with employment conditions and income growth
remaining resilient, the Chinese Government has room to pursue reforms that support its agenda of stable, long-term growth.
Significant cuts in government spending affected growth in the United States; however, this was offset by improved private sector demand,
leading to modest rates of economic growth overall. Housing and stock market prices have also strengthened household balance sheets over the
past year. As a result, we believe the recovery will continue, although risks remain regarding the unwinding of monetary policy stimulus.
The renewed policy push in Japan is also positive for medium-term growth expectations if the government can achieve its stated objectives.
Europe remained relatively stable during the period; however, we do not anticipate a strong or rapid recovery while fundamental structural
problems remain.
Overall, we expect more balanced global growth over the long term as China continues to develop its economy and large developed economies,
such as the United States, grow despite fiscal challenges. We expect the rebalancing of the Chinese economy to be significant in terms of the
nature of domestic demand, as well as the types of goods and services the economy will produce. These changes will take place gradually,
particularly in relation to savings behaviour and levels of fixed asset investment. We also see India and South East Asia as significant sources of
economic growth in the long term.
Prices responded to changes in the underlying fundamentals of several major commodities during FY2013. Increased demand in the United
States supported natural gas markets, while record steel production rates in Asia underpinned strong demand for steelmaking raw materials.
However, supply of iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper more than kept pace with increased demand, leading to a reduction in prices over the
period.
In the short term, increased supply is expected to exert downward pressure on prices, although a lower rate of investment growth across the
industry should, in time, lead to more balanced supply and demand. The growth rates for steel demand in Asia are expected to moderate, as the
Chinese economy gradually rebalances. This rebalancing should support growth in demand for other industrial metals, energy and agricultural
products.
We expect overcapacity in the aluminium and nickel industries to persist, while robust near-term supply in copper and US domestic gas should,
over time, give way to market conditions more influenced by resource decline.

3.4.4    Operating costs
146
As the prices for our products are determined by the global commodity markets in which we operate, we do not generally have the ability to offset
cost pressures through corresponding price increases; therefore, controlling our operating costs is a key driver of our results. Operating costs
for the last three years are set out below.

Includes exceptional items of US$5,284 million (2012: US$3,663 million; 2011: US$ nil).
Includes exceptional items of US$158 million relating to the decrease in the rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the Newcastle steelworks (2012: US$ nil;
2011: US$150 million).
We focus on operating costs excluding exceptional items because they represent a component of Underlying EBIT. Our operating costs
excluding exceptional items have increased at an average rate of 10.7 per cent per annum over the past three years. During FY2013, total
operating costs excluding exceptional items have remained stable, as reductions in various costs were offset by higher non-cash costs and one-
off items.
Our focus on curtailing operating costs was demonstrated by a decrease of external services costs of US$1.9 billion, a decrease of third party
commodity purchases of US$739 million, reduced government royalties of US$372 million and a reduction of exploration and evaluation
expenditure of US$580 million.
These savings were predominantly offset by higher impairment charges of US$1.8 billion, higher depreciation and amortisation charges of
US$537 million, lower foreign exchange gains of US$239 million and an unfavourable variance in fair value change on derivatives of US$222
million.

Our capital and exploration expenditure increased significantly from FY2011 to FY2012, growing 76.5 per cent from US$12.9 billion to US$22.7
billion. This reflected increased investment in our project pipeline, particularly in Petroleum, Iron Ore, Coal and Copper. In FY2013, we focused on
controlling capital and exploration expenditure. Total capital expenditure increased by US$659 million from FY2012 to US$20.9 billion in FY2013,
whereas exploration expenditure decreased by US$1.1 billion to US$1.3 billion. Increases in capital expenditure, primarily in Onshore US (increase
of US$1.5 billion) and Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) (increase of US$509 million) outweighed decreases, primarily in Copper and Aluminium,
Manganese and Nickel. Exploration expenditure decreased across all Businesses, with the largest decrease of US$811 million in Petroleum and
Potash.

No major growth projects and only one major project were approved during FY2013. At the end of FY2013, we had 18 major projects in execution,
of which approximately 70 per cent were expected to deliver first production by the end of CY2014.
A detailed discussion of our project pipeline (including projects approved after 30 June 2013) is located in section 3.7.2.
We expect our capital and exploration expenditure for FY2014, excluding deferred stripping, to be approximately US$16.2 billion, which includes
exploration expenditure of US$1.0 billion.
3.4.6    Exploration and development
Exploration expense represents that portion of exploration expenditure that is not capitalised in accordance with our accounting policies, as set

Includes US$102 million (2012: US$144 million, 2011: US$73 million) exploration expense previously capitalised, written off as impaired.
Exploration expense increased significantly between FY2011 and FY2012, growing by US$692 million from US$1,054 million to US$1,746 million
reflecting increased exploration for oil, gas and minerals. Petroleum exploration was focused on offshore Western Australia, the Gulf of Mexico,
South East Asia and our Onshore US Asset. Minerals exploration was focused on greenfield copper targets in South America and iron ore and
potash targets globally.
In FY2013, the quality, scale and diversification of our existing assets have allowed us to substantially reduce our exploration. Total exploration
expense declined by 36 per cent to US$1.1 billion in FY2013, with a sharpened focus on greenfield copper porphyry targets in Chile and Peru, and
oil and gas prospects in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Western Australia.
We expect exploration expenditure for FY2014 to be approximately US$1.0 billion, of which approximately US$600 million is expected to be for
offshore oil and gas, and the balance related primarily to exploration for copper.
3.4.7    Interest rates
We are exposed to interest rate risk on our outstanding borrowings and investments. Our policy on interest rate exposure is for interest on our
borrowings to be on a US dollar floating interest rate basis. Deviation from our policy requires the prior approval of our Financial Risk
Management Committee and is managed within our Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) framework, which is described in note 29 ‘Financial risk
management’ to the financial
Table of Contents
149
statements. When required under this strategy, we use interest rate swaps, including cross currency interest rate swaps, to convert a fixed rate
exposure to a floating rate exposure, as well as using swaptions to manage the fixed interest rate exposure. As at 30 June 2013, the Group held
US$5.4 billion (2012: US$4.3 billion) of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings, as well as US$4.4 billion (2012: US$4.0 billion) of other
fixed interest rate borrowings, that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, primarily arising from debt raised during FY2012 and FY2013,
debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
Our earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Group’s net borrowings. Based on the net
debt position as at 30 June 2013, taking into account interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions, it is estimated that a
one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Group’s equity and profit after taxation by US$136 million (2012:
decrease of US$103 million). This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the
fixed/floating mix and balances are constant over the year. However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant
over the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
3.4.8    Health, safety, environment and community
We are subject to extensive regulation surrounding the health and safety of our people and the environment. We make every effort to comply with
the regulations and, where less stringent than our standards, we aim to exceed applicable legal and other requirements. However, regulatory
standards and community expectations are constantly evolving. As a result, we may be exposed to increased litigation, compliance costs and
unforeseen environmental rehabilitation expenses, despite our best efforts to work with governments, community groups and scientists to keep
pace with regulations, law and public expectations.
Further information about our compliance with HSEC regulations can be found in section 2.8 ‘Sustainability’.
3.4.9    Insurance
During FY2013, we maintained an insurance program encompassing property damage, business interruption, sabotage and terrorism, marine
cargo, construction, directors’ and officers’ liability and public and certain other liabilities. The program includes a combination of self-insurance
via subsidiary captive insurance companies, industry mutuals and external market reinsurance. Mandates are established as to risk retention
levels, policy cover and, where applicable, reinsurance counter parties. As part of our portfolio risk management approach, we regularly conduct
an assessment of maximum foreseeable loss potential, cash flow at risk, loss experience, claims received and insurance premiums paid, and will
make adjustments to the balance of self-insurance and reinsurance as required.
The Group is largely self-insured for losses arising from property damage and business interruption, sabotage and terrorism, marine cargo,
construction and primary public liability. For these risks, we internally insure our operations (for wholly owned assets and for our share of joint
venture assets) via our captive insurance companies. Any losses incurred will consequently impact the financial statements as they arise.
3.5    Application of critical accounting policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the
periods presented therein. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgements in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent
liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors it
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and
conditions.

Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any exceptional items and includes the sale of third party product. Underlying EBIT is not an IFRS measure of
profitability, financial performance or liquidity and may be defined and used in differing ways by different entities. Underlying EBIT is included in the FY2013 financial statements as
required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. We believe that Underlying EBIT provides useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or alternative to,
Attributable profit as an indicator of operating performance. Our use of Underlying EBIT is explained in section 3.6.2.
3.6.1    Consolidated results
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Revenue in FY2013 was US$66.0 billion, a decrease of US$6.2 billion, or 8.7 per cent, from US$72.2 billion in the corresponding period. The
revenue decrease was primarily driven by the Iron Ore and Coal Businesses, with decreases of US$2.4 billion and US$2.9 billion, respectively, and
the loss of revenue due to the sale of assets previously reported in the former Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG, which represented a
reduction of US$879 million.
The decrease in revenue in Iron Ore was primarily due to lower realised prices of US$4.1 billion, partially offset by higher sales volumes of US$1.4
billion. The revenue decrease in Coal also reflected lower realised prices of US$3.7 billion, partially offset by higher sales volumes of US$416
million.
Underlying EBIT in FY2013 declined by 22.4 per cent, or US$6.1 billion, to US$21.1 billion. A substantial reduction in commodity prices reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$8.9 billion, which more than offset the US$546 million reduction in costs (rate and usage), the US$649 million reduction in
price-linked costs and the US$938 million reduction in exploration and business development costs achieved during the period. Consistently
strong operating performance across the Group contributed to a US$1.8 billion volume related increase in Underlying EBIT.
Further description of the changes in revenue is included in the analysis of Underlying EBIT for the Group in section 3.6.2 and for the Businesses
in section 3.6.6.
Attributable profit excluding exceptional items (comprising Profit after taxation attributable to members of BHP Billiton Group less exceptional
items as described in section 3.6.5) of US$11.8 billion was negatively affected by an increase in the Group’s effective tax rate from 34.8 per cent to
39.3 per cent (excluding exceptional items) and financing charges of US$280 million incurred managing interest rate exposure on recently issued
debt securities. Exceptional items of US$922 million (after tax) contributed to the 29.5 per cent decrease in Attributable profit to US$10.9 billion.
Exceptional items during FY2013 included a gain on sale of our wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit of US$420 million (after tax expense), a
gain on sale of our interest in Richards Bay Minerals of US$1.2 billion (after tax expense) and a gain on sale of our 8.33 per cent interest in the East
Browse Joint Venture, and 20 per cent interest in the West Browse Joint Venture of US$1.4 billion (after tax expense).
These gains were offset by an impairment charge of US$1.2 billion (after tax benefit) at Nickel West, an impairment charge of US$1.6 billion (after
tax benefit) at Worsley, an impairment charge of US$167 million (after tax benefit) of assets in the Permian Basin (United States), an impairment
charge of US$237 million (after tax expense) arising from the sale of our interests in the EKATI Diamond Mine and an impairment charge and other
restructuring costs of US$715 million (after tax benefit) arising from the capital project review. Finally, the Group recognised a decrease of US$158
million (before tax expense) to its rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the Newcastle steelworks (Australia).

Net operating cash flow of US$18.3 billion declined by 25.1 per cent from US$24.4 billion in FY2012; however, despite the challenging
environment, the Group’s Underlying EBIT margin remained in excess of 30 per cent, while Underlying return on capital was 13.5 per cent, down
from 23.0 per cent in FY2012.
Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
In FY2012, revenue was US$72.2 billion, an increase of US$487 million, or 0.7 per cent, from US$71.7 billion in the corresponding period. The
revenue increases of US$2.2 billion in both our Petroleum and Potash, and Iron Ore Businesses were partially offset by decreases in other
Businesses, in particular our Copper and Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Businesses of US$2.6 billion and US$1.6 billion, respectively.
The increase in revenue in Iron Ore related primarily to higher sales volumes of US$3.4 billion, offset by lower realised prices of US$1.2 billion.
Revenue increases in Petroleum and Potash related primarily to US$2.2 billion of revenue in Onshore US for FY2012, an increase of US$2.1 billion
from FY2011. The impact of higher realised prices in Petroleum’s conventional (primarily offshore) operations was largely offset by lower sales
volumes.
The revenue decrease in Copper reflected lower sales volumes of US$861 million and lower realised prices of US$1.5 billion. The decrease in
revenue in Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel of US$1.6 billion was primarily due to lower realised prices.
Further description on the changes in revenue is included in the analysis of Underlying EBIT for the Group in section 3.6.2 and for the Businesses
in section 3.6.6.
Our Attributable profit of US$15.4 billion in FY2012 represented a decrease of 34.8 per cent from US$23.6 billion in the corresponding period.
Attributable profit in FY2012 included a number of exceptional items: an impairment of the Fayetteville (United States) dry gas assets acquired
from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011 of US$1.8 billion (US$2.8 billion before tax); an impairment of the Nickel West (Australia) assets of US$355
million (US$449 million before tax) and a US$342 million (US$452 million before tax) charge for the suspension or early closure of operations and
the change in status of specific projects, which included an impairment of the Olympic Dam Project of US$242 million (US$346 million before tax).
Other exceptional items included the settlement of insurance claims at Queensland Coal (Australia) which resulted in other income of US$199
million (US$284 million before tax), while a US$637 million non-cash income tax credit was recognised following the passage of Australia’s
Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) and Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) extension into legislation in March 2012.
Attributable profit excluding exceptional items of US$17.1 billion represented a decrease of 21.1 per cent from US$21.7 billion in FY2011. The
US$4.6 billion decrease in Attributable profit excluding exceptional items primarily reflects the decrease in Underlying EBIT of US$4.8 billion.
The decrease in Underlying EBIT from the prior year is a result of weaknesses in the price of, and demand for, commodities and industry-wide
cost pressure. The rate of cost escalation was most severe in those Businesses that experienced disruptions, outages or grade-related issues.
The increased revenue for Onshore US, from US$107 million in FY2011 to US$2.2 billion in FY2012, did not result in additional EBIT due to the
impact of lower realised gas prices in the United States.
Net operating cash flow of US$24.4 billion declined by 18.9 per cent, while Underlying return on capital was 23.0 per cent. The value of the Group’s
diversified strategy was reflected in the Group’s Underlying EBIT margin, which remained at a robust 39.4 per cent.

3.6.2    Consolidated results – Underlying EBIT
In discussing the operating results of the Group, we focus on a financial measure we refer to as Underlying EBIT. Underlying EBIT is the key
measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our Businesses, make decisions on the allocation of resources and
assess operational management. Management uses this measure because financing structures and tax regimes differ across our assets and
substantial components of our tax and interest charges are levied at a Group rather than an operational level.
We exclude exceptional items from Underlying EBIT in order to enhance the comparability of the measure from period to period and provide
clarity into the underlying performance of our operations. Our management monitors exceptional items separately.
The following table reconciles Underlying EBIT to Profit from operations.

The following commentary describes the principal factors outlined in the table above for FY2013 and FY2012.
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Underlying EBIT for FY2013 was US$21.1 billion, compared with US$27.2 billion in the corresponding period, a decrease of 22.4 per cent.
Volumes
Strong operating performance across the Group’s major basins in FY2013 delivered an increase in total production volumes in a number of
Businesses. This was underpinned by a thirteenth consecutive annual production record at WAIO and a 28 per cent increase in copper
production at Escondida. This volume growth was supported by a significant recovery in production at Queensland Coal and a 76 per cent
increase in liquids production at our Onshore US Asset. This momentum is expected to continue in the medium term.
In this context, stronger sales volumes increased Underlying EBIT by US$1.8 billion in FY2013. Increased iron ore, copper and metallurgical coal
sales were the major contributors and together increased Underlying EBIT by US$2.2 billion. In contrast, natural field decline at our conventional
Australian oil and gas assets contributed to a US$266 million volume related reduction in Petroleum’s Underlying EBIT.
Prices
Substantially lower prices reduced Underlying EBIT by US$8.9 billion in FY2013. The major contributor to the decline was a 17 per cent reduction
in the average realised price of iron ore, which reduced Underlying EBIT by US$4.1 billion. The recovery in low-cost supply led to a significant
decline in metallurgical coal prices, which, together with softer energy coal prices, reduced Underlying EBIT by a further US$3.7 billion.
Overcapacity in the nickel and aluminium markets, and concerns of a near-term rebalancing in the copper market, also weighed on metals prices
and reduced Underlying EBIT by a combined US$1.0 billion.
A 17 per cent increase in the average realised price of US natural gas and a four per cent rise in the average realised price of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) benefited Underlying EBIT during the period; however, this was largely offset by a four per cent decrease in the average realised price of oil.
A reduction in price-linked costs increased Underlying EBIT by US$649 million during the period and primarily reflected lower price-linked royalty
charges in our Iron Ore and Metallurgical Coal Businesses.
Costs
The Group’s concentrated effort to reduce operating costs and drive productivity improvements realised tangible results. The total cost related
variance, which excludes exploration and business development expenditure, exceptional items, the impacts of inflation and exchange rate
volatility, increased Underlying EBIT by US$546 million during the period.
Increased labour productivity across the Group, and both a change in scope and renegotiation of terms for specific contracts at Queensland Coal,
contributed to a US$383 million reduction in costs. These savings were offset by payments associated with the finalisation of multi-year collective
labour agreements at each of our South American copper assets.
Mining related efficiencies contributed to a US$251 million reduction in costs. This largely reflected productivity gains at Escondida associated
with a 12 per cent improvement in concentrator throughput following a major maintenance campaign and a 24 per cent increase in the ore grade
mined during the period which increased Underlying EBIT by US$481 million. These savings were offset by lower grade and smelter availability at
Olympic Dam, which decreased Underlying EBIT by US$172 million.
Table of Contents
156
Depreciation, impairments and other non-cash costs increased by US$241 million, which reflected the recent completion of several projects
mainly in Copper and Iron Ore and impairments of project costs associated with the WAIO Tug Harbour and the Mad Dog Phase 2 (United States).
Exchange rates
A stronger US dollar against several producer currencies, in particular the South African rand, benefited our cost base during the period and
increased Underlying EBIT by US$480 million. This was partially offset by the revaluation of monetary items in the balance sheet with year-end
exchange rates, which reduced Underlying EBIT by US$90 million. In total, exchange rate volatility increased Underlying EBIT by US$390 million.
Average and closing exchange rates for FY2013 and FY2012 are detailed in note 1 ‘Accounting policies’ to the financial statements.
Inflation on costs
Inflation had an unfavourable impact on all Businesses and reduced Underlying EBIT by US$650 million in FY2013. This was most notable in
Australia and South Africa, which accounted for over 75 per cent of the total variance.
Asset sales
The divestments of Yeelirrie (Australia), Richards Bay Minerals (South Africa), the East and West Browse Joint Ventures (Australia) and our
diamonds business were completed during the period. The gains or losses arising from each sale were reported within exceptional items, and
therefore were not included in Underlying EBIT.
The contribution of asset sales to Underlying EBIT declined by US$66 million in FY2013. The variance was largely attributable to a post-closing
payment received during FY2012 that followed the divestment of our interests in Cascade and Chinook (United States).
Ceased and sold operations
Underlying EBIT from ceased and sold operations declined by US$847 million in FY2013. The decline largely reflected a reduced contribution
(decrease in Underlying EBIT of US$499 million) from both Richards Bay Minerals, following the sale of our 37.76 per cent non-operated effective
interest to Rio Tinto, which was completed on 7 September 2012; and EKATI (Canada), following the sale of our diamonds business to Dominion
Diamond Corporation, which was completed on 10 April 2013. Ceased and sold operations included a further reduction of Underlying EBIT of
US$126 million related to the sale of Pinto Valley mining operation (United States) and the associated San Manuel Arizona Railroad Company.
New and acquired operations
We classify assets as new and acquired operations until there is a full-year period for comparison. In FY2012, new and acquired operations
comprised the Onshore US Asset (Fayetteville acquired in March 2011 and Petrohawk acquired in August 2011) and HWE Mining (acquired in
September 2011). In FY2013, new and acquired operations comprised the former Petrohawk operations within Onshore US and HWE Mining.
New and acquired operations reduced Underlying EBIT by US$112 million in FY2013. This reflected a further loss on Petrohawk compared with
the corresponding period loss, which included a one-off gain of US$192 million associated with legacy US gas derivatives. The increase in
revenue in Onshore US from higher volumes and stronger prices was offset by higher depreciation and the impact of rig termination costs. A
discussion of our Onshore US Asset’s results is set out in section 3.6.6.
Table of Contents
157
This loss was partially offset by Iron Ore contribution of US$144 million, driven by the favourable contractor mining costs pertaining to the
removal of contractor margins included in mining rates prior to the HWE Mining acquisition.
Exploration and business development
Our increased focus on reducing our cost base in FY2013 and our confidence in the quality and longevity of our asset base led to a substantial
US$938 million reduction in the Group’s exploration and business development expenditure. Total exploration expenditure declined by 46 per
cent to US$1.3 billion in FY2013, with a focus on greenfield copper porphyry targets in Chile and Peru and oil and gas prospects in the Gulf of
Mexico (United States) and offshore Western Australia. The associated decline in the Group’s exploration expense increased Underlying EBIT by
US$594 million.
A general reduction in business development expenditure increased Underlying EBIT by a further US$344 million in FY2013, primarily in Iron Ore
for US$102 million and Coal for US$194 million.
Other
The largest contributor to a US$145 million increase in Underlying EBIT was a non-cash adjustment of our Angostura (Trinidad and Tobago)
Production Sharing Contract.
Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 was US$27.2 billion, compared with US$32.0 billion in the corresponding period, a decrease of 14.8 per cent.
Volumes
In FY2012, we achieved a twelfth consecutive annual production record at WAIO and record annual production at another nine operations. In
aggregate, volumes increased Underlying EBIT by US$308 million in the period.
WAIO shipments rose to a record annualised rate of 179 million tonnes (Mt) in the June 2012 quarter (100 per cent basis). The resultant 23 Mt (BHP
Billiton share) uplift in WAIO shipments increased Underlying EBIT by US$2.4 billion in FY2012.
Downtime at our non-operated facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and the North West Shelf (Australia) and natural field decline, particularly at Pyrenees
(Australia), were the major contributors to the volume related US$1.1 billion reduction in Underlying EBIT for the Petroleum and Potash Business.
The Atlantis and Mad Dog (both United States) facilities resumed production in August 2012. Annual copper production records were set at
Antamina and Spence (Chile) although lower grades and industrial action constrained performance at Escondida. An overall decline in Copper
volumes reduced Underlying EBIT by US$509 million in the period.
The impact on EBIT arising from the increase in volume relating to the acquisition of our Onshore US Asset is included under the heading ‘New
and acquired operations’.
Prices
Prices for many of BHP Billiton’s products declined during FY2012 as global economic growth slowed and concerns surrounding the economic
outlook increased. In total, lower average realised prices reduced Underlying EBIT by US$2.0 billion in FY2012, net of price-linked costs. The
impact was most apparent in our Copper and Iron Ore Businesses, where weaker prices reduced Underlying EBIT by US$1.6 billion and US$1.3
billion,
Table of Contents
158
respectively. No respite was provided for our Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business, where lower realised prices reduced Underlying EBIT
by a combined US$1.2 billion.
In Petroleum and Potash, a 19 per cent increase in the average realised price of oil and a 29 per cent rise in the average realised price of liquefied
natural gas contributed to a US$1.5 billion increase in Underlying EBIT in FY2012. In addition, stronger thermal and metallurgical coal realised
prices increased Underlying EBIT by a combined US$434 million, net of price-linked costs.
Costs
Industry-wide cost pressure resulted in a decline in Underlying EBIT of US$3.1 billion, particularly in Copper and in Coal, where industrial action at
Escondida and Queensland Coal created additional pressure on costs.
Higher costs, excluding the impacts of inflation, exchange rate volatility and non-cash items, reduced Underlying EBIT by US$2.7 billion in
FY2012. Labour and contractor cost increases and higher raw material costs accounted for more than half of this increase.
We were quick to respond to changes in the operating environment and acted decisively by closing energy-intensive silicomanganese alloy
production capacity in South Africa and by temporarily closing capacity at TEMCO. In addition, metallurgical coal production at Norwich Park was
suspended following a review of the mine’s profitability.
Non-cash items, which included foreign exchange rate related adjustments to the carrying value of inventory and higher depreciation associated
with the completion of major projects, reduced Underlying EBIT by a further US$435 million in FY2012.
Exchange rates
The cost related impact of the stronger Australian dollar reduced Underlying EBIT by US$565 million in FY2012. However, the positive restatement
of monetary items in the balance sheet that followed the general strengthening of the US dollar against a basket of currencies at the end of the
period resulted in a US$1.1 billion increase in Underlying EBIT. In total, exchange rate volatility increased Underlying EBIT by US$820 million.
Average and closing exchange rates for FY2012 and FY2011 are detailed in note 1 ‘Accounting policies’ to the financial statements.
Inflation on costs
Inflationary pressure had an unfavourable impact on all Businesses and reduced Underlying EBIT by US$764 million during FY2012. The
pressure was most notable in Australia and South Africa, which accounted for 75 per cent of the total impact.
Asset sales
The contribution of asset sales to Underlying EBIT increased by US$78 million from the corresponding period and primarily reflected the receipt
of a post-closing payment that followed the 2006 divestment of our interests in Cascade and Chinook.
Ceased and sold operations
A favourable foreign exchange related restatement and partial release of the Newcastle steelworks, Australia, rehabilitation provision accounted
for the majority of the US$347 million increase in Underlying EBIT.
Table of Contents
New and acquired operations
159
We classify assets as new and acquired operations until there is a full-year period for comparison. New and acquired operations reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$86 million in FY2012. Iron Ore’s acquisition of the HWE Mining business in Western Australia increased Underlying EBIT
by US$97 million, which was more than offset by a decrease in Underlying EBIT for the Onshore US Asset of US$183 million – being a loss of
US$140 million in FY2012 compared with a profit of US$43 million in FY2011.
The additional revenue of US$2.1 billion for Onshore US in FY2012 did not result in additional EBIT due to the impact of lower realised gas prices
in the United States.
Exploration and business development
Exploration expense increased by US$662 million to US$1.7 billion in FY2012. Within Minerals (US$928 million expense), greenfield exploration
was focused on copper targets in South America, nickel and copper targets in Australia, and iron ore and potash targets globally.
Petroleum exploration expense was US$818 million and included a US$144 million impairment of exploration previously capitalised. Our activities
focused on offshore Western Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, South East Asia and our recently acquired Onshore US Asset.
A general increase in the level of business development expenditure reduced Underlying EBIT by a further US$157 million in FY2012.
Other
The absence of specific provisions and non-cash charges that were reported in the Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel and Copper Businesses in
FY2011, largely accounted for a US$472 million increase in Underlying EBIT in the period.
3.6.3    Net finance costs
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Net finance costs increased to US$1.4 billion from US$730 million in the corresponding period. This was primarily attributable to an increase in net
interest expense on higher net debt and financing charges of US$280 million incurred managing interest rate exposure on recently issued debt
securities. The US$280 million was composed of realised fair value losses of US$97 million on non-hedging derivatives recognised in interest on
borrowings and unrealised fair value losses of US$183 million on similar instruments.
At 30 June 2013, net debt, comprising interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, was US$29.1 billion, which represented an
increase of US$5.5 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2012.
Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Net finance costs increased to US$730 million from US$561 million in the corresponding period. This was primarily driven by increased net
interest expense on higher net debt, partially offset by exchange rate variations on net debt.
At 30 June 2012, net debt, comprising interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, was US$23.6 billion, which represented an
increase of US$17.8 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2011.

3.6.4    Taxation expense
160
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Total taxation expense, including royalty-related taxation, exceptional items and exchange rate movements, was US$6.8 billion, representing an
effective tax rate of 38.0 per cent (2012: 32.5 per cent).
Exceptional items decreased taxation expense by US$980 million (2012: decrease of US$1.7 billion), predominately due to the income tax benefit
on impairments of US$1.4 billion, which more than offset the income tax expense associated with divestments of US$376 million, as detailed in
section 3.6.5. Excluding exceptional items, the Group’s effective tax rate was 39.3 per cent (2012: 34.8 per cent).
Government imposed royalty arrangements calculated by reference to profits are reported as royalty-related taxation. Royalty-related taxation,
excluding exceptional items, contributed US$1.2 billion to taxation expense representing an effective tax rate of 6.0 per cent (2012: US$889 million
and 3.4 per cent). The Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) came into effect in Australia on 1 July 2012 and the Group expensed US$454 million of
MRRT in FY2013. This was partially offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with the MRRT, which reduced taxation expense by
US$133 million.
Exchange rate movements increased taxation expense by US$315 million, representing an effective tax rate of 1.6 per cent (2012: increase of
US$250 million and 0.9 per cent).
Excluding the impacts of royalty-related taxation, exceptional items and exchange rate movements, taxation expense was US$6.3 billion,
representing an Underlying effective tax rate of 31.7 per cent (2012: 30.5 per cent). Underlying effective tax rate is not an IFRS measure and
comprises total taxation expense excluding royalty-related taxation, exceptional items and exchange rate movements included in taxation
expense divided by Profit before taxation and exceptional items.
Other royalty and excise arrangements, which are not profit based, are recognised as operating costs within Profit before taxation. These
amounted to US$2.7 billion during the period (2012: US$3.1 billion).
Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Total taxation expense, including royalty-related taxation, exceptional items and exchange rate movements, was US$7.5 billion, representing an
effective rate of 32.5 per cent (2011: 23.4 per cent).
Exchange rate movements increased taxation expense by US$250 million (2011: decrease of US$1.5 billion). The reduced impact compared with
FY2011 was predominantly due to eligible Australian entities electing to adopt a US dollar tax functional currency from 1 July 2011.
Exceptional items decreased taxation expense by US$1.7 billion (2011: decrease of US$2.1 billion), predominantly due to the recognition of tax
benefits of US$1.2 billion arising from the impairments of goodwill and other assets in relation to the Fayetteville shale gas assets, Nickel West and
the Olympic Dam expansion project, and the recognition of a net income tax benefit of US$637 million on enactment of the MRRT and PRRT
extension legislation in Australia.
Government imposed royalty arrangements calculated by reference to profits after adjustment for temporary differences are reported as royalty-
related taxation. Royalty-related taxation (excluding exceptional items) contributed US$889 million to taxation expense, representing an effective
tax rate of 3.9 per cent (2011: US$828 million and 2.6 per cent).
Other royalty and excise arrangements that did not have these characteristics are recognised as operating costs within Profit before taxation.
These amounted to US$3.1 billion during the period (2011: US$2.9 billion).

On 27 August 2012, the Group announced the sale of its wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit and the transaction was completed on
19 December 2012. A gain on sale of US$420 million was recognised in FY2013, while the associated tax expense was offset by the recognition of
deferred tax benefits on available tax losses of US$126 million.
On 7 September 2012, the Group announced it had completed the sale of its 37.76 per cent effective interest in Richards Bay Minerals. A gain on
sale of US$1.2 billion (after tax expense) was recognised in FY2013.
On 13 November 2012, the Group announced the sale of its diamonds business, comprising its interests in the EKATI Diamond Mine and Diamond
Marketing operations. The transaction was completed on 10 April 2013 for an aggregate cash consideration of US$553 million (after adjustments).
An impairment charge of US$237 million (after tax expense) was recognised based on the final consideration.
On 12 December 2012, the Group signed a definitive agreement to sell its 8.33 per cent interest in the East Browse Joint Venture and 20 per cent
interest in the West Browse Joint Venture. A gain on sale of US$1.5 billion was recognised in FY2013. The associated tax expense of US$462
million was partly offset by the recognition of deferred tax benefits on available tax losses of US$241 million and the derecognition of deferred tax
liabilities of US$33 million. The transaction was completed on 7 June 2013.
As a result of expected continued strength in the Australian dollar and weak nickel prices, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$1.2
billion (after tax benefit) at Nickel West in FY2013.
The Group recognised an impairment of assets at Worsley as a result of expected continued strength in the Australian dollar and weak alumina
prices. A total impairment charge of US$1.6 billion (after tax benefit) was recognised in FY2013.
An impairment charge of US$167 million (after tax benefit) was recognised as the performance of specific evaluation wells in certain areas of the
Permian Basin (United States) do not support economic development.
In FY2013, WAIO refocused its attention on the capital efficient expansion opportunity that exists within the Port Hedland Inner Harbour, and all
early works associated with the Outer Harbour development option were suspended. This revision to the WAIO development sequence and the
change in status of other minor capital projects across the Group resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of US$639 million (after tax
benefit)

162
and other restructuring costs of US$76 million (after tax benefit) in FY2013, of which US$580 million (after tax benefit) were related to WAIO.
The Group recognised a decrease of US$158 million (before tax expense) to its rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the
Newcastle steelworks (Australia). This followed the completion of the Hunter River Remediation Project and reaching agreement with the
Environment Protection Authority in March 2013 regarding the necessary scope of work to repeal the Environmental Classification at Steel River.
Exceptional items during FY2013 are classified by nature as follows.

As a result of the fall in United States domestic gas prices and the Company’s decision to adjust its development plans, the Group recognised
impairments of goodwill and other assets in relation to its Fayetteville shale gas assets. A total impairment charge of US$1.8 billion (after tax
benefit) was recognised in FY2012.
The Group recognised impairments of goodwill and other assets at Nickel West as a result of the continued downturn in the nickel price and
margin deterioration. A total impairment charge of US$355 million (after tax benefit) was recognised in FY2012.
As part of our regular portfolio review, various operations and projects around the Group were either suspended, closed early or changed in
status. These included: the change in status of the Olympic Dam expansion project; the temporary suspension of production at TEMCO and the
permanent closure of the Metalloys South Plant in South Africa; the indefinite cessation of production at Norwich Park; and the suspension of
other minor capital projects. As a result, impairment charges of US$338 million (after tax benefit), idle capacity costs and inventory write-down of
US$28 million (after tax benefit) and other restructuring costs of US$28 million (after tax benefit) were recognised in FY2012, of which US$242
million (after tax benefit) related to Olympic Dam.
During 2008, extreme weather across the central Queensland coalfields affected production from the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) and
BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal (BMC) operations. The Group settled insurance claims in respect of the lost production and insurance claim income of
US$210 million (after tax expense) was recognised in FY2012.
The Australian MRRT and PRRT extension legislation were enacted in March 2012. Under the legislation, the Group is entitled to a deduction
against future MRRT and PRRT liabilities based on the market value of its Coal, Iron Ore and Petroleum assets. A deferred tax asset, and an
associated net income tax benefit of US$637 million, was recognised in FY2012 to reflect the future deductibility of these market values for MRRT
and PRRT purposes, to the extent they were considered recoverable.

The Group withdrew its offer for PotashCorp on 15 November 2010, following the Board’s conclusion that the condition of the offer relating to
receipt of a net benefit, as determined by the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act, could not be satisfied. The Group incurred
fees associated with the US$45 billion debt facility (US$240 million), investment bankers’, lawyers’ and accountants’ fees, printing expenses and
other charges (US$74 million) in progressing this matter during the period up to the withdrawal of the offer, which were expensed as operating
costs in the year ended 30 June 2011.
The Group recognised a decrease of US$150 million (before tax expense) to its rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the
Newcastle steelworks (Australia) following a full review of the progress of the Hunter River Remediation Project and estimated costs to
completion.
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued amended assessments in prior years denying bad debt deductions arising from the investments in
Beenup and Boodarie Iron (both Australia) and the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project. The Group challenged
the assessments and was successful on all counts before the Full Federal Court. The ATO obtained special leave in September 2010 to appeal to
the High Court in respect of the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project. The Group’s position in respect of the capital
allowance claims on the Boodarie Iron project was confirmed by the High Court in June 2011. As a result of these appeals, US$138 million was
released from the Group’s income tax provision in September 2010 and US$580 million in June 2011.
Consistent with the functional currency of the Group’s operations, eligible Australian entities elected to adopt a US dollar tax functional currency
from 1 July 2011. As a result, the deferred tax liability (DTL) relating to certain US dollar denominated financial arrangements has been
derecognised, resulting in a credit to income tax expense of US$1.5 billion.

The discussion of results for our Businesses is set out below and focuses on Underlying EBIT, as defined in section 3.3. Underlying EBITDA is
Underlying EBIT before depreciation, impairments and amortisation. Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA are not IFRS measures of
profitability, financial performance or liquidity and may be defined and used in differing ways by different entities. We believe that Underlying EBIT
and Underlying EBITDA provide useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or alternative to, Attributable profit as an
indicator of operating performance. Our use of Underlying EBIT is explained in section 3.6.2.
For further information on our Business results, refer note 2 ‘Segment reporting’ to the financial statements.
Petroleum and Potash
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Petroleum production increased by six per cent in FY2013, to 236 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) (BHP Billiton share) and included
strong performance from Onshore US, which delivered 99 MMboe (BHP Billiton share). The Eagle Ford area contributed 33 per cent of total
Onshore US production to become Petroleum’s largest producing field at the end of the period.
Petroleum and Potash revenue increased by US$276 million to US$13.2 billion. Revenue for Onshore US grew by US$818 million to US$3.0 billion,
an increase of 37.7 per cent. The increase in revenue in Onshore US resulted from higher volumes, which grew by 15.9 per cent. The increase in
volume included a 76 per cent increase in higher value liquids production and a seven per cent increase in natural gas production. Increases in
revenue at Mad Dog of US$276 million, with recommencement of operations during the year, and an increase at North West Shelf (NWS)
(Australia) of US$203 million, due to higher LNG sales, were partially offset by reductions in our other assets, primarily due to natural field decline
at our operated Australian oil and gas assets.
The average realised price of natural gas across our portfolio increased by 11 per cent in FY2013 to US$3.76 per thousand standard cubic feet
(scf). This included a 17 per cent increase in the average realised price of US natural gas to US$3.29 per thousand scf. The average realised price
of LNG also increased during the period, rising by four per cent to US$14.82 per thousand scf. These gains were partially offset by a four per cent
decrease in the average realised price of oil to US$106 per barrel. The average realised price of natural gas liquids (NGLs) was US$45.70 per
barrel.
Petroleum and Potash Underlying EBIT for FY2013 declined by US$369 million to US$5.7 billion. Petroleum’s Underlying EBIT decreased by
US$363 million to US$6.0 billion. The natural field decline at our Australian assets contributed to a US$266 million volume related reduction in
Underlying EBIT. A series of one-off charges, which included Onshore US drill rig contract termination costs and an impairment that followed the
suspension of studies and re-evaluation of alternative development options associated with the Mad Dog Phase 2 project, reduced Underlying
EBIT by a further US$160 million. In contrast, a US$126 million reduction in exploration and business development expense reflected our
sharpened focus on high value oil and gas prospects in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Western Australia.
The Onshore US Underlying EBIT was a loss of US$287 million compared with a loss of US$140 million in FY2012. The FY2013 loss included a
one-off charge for the drill rig termination costs of US$77 million. The FY2012 loss included a one-off gain of US$192 million associated with
legacy US gas derivatives. Adjusting for the one-off gains and losses, the loss in Underlying EBIT reduced year-over-year. The reduced loss was
primarily due to increased volumes and prices partially offset by higher depreciation and amortisation of US$355 million and higher transportation
costs due to higher volumes.
Capital expenditure for our conventional and unconventional operations totalled US$7.1 billion in FY2013. This included US$4.8 billion in Onshore
US drilling and development expenditure, with over 80 per cent of drilling

activity directed towards the Eagle Ford and Permian areas, as planned. While still in its early stages, the Permian evaluation program continues to
deliver encouraging results, as demonstrated by the 1 MMboe produced in FY2013. The contribution of approximately 4 MMboe is expected in
FY2014.

Onshore US capital expenditure is expected to decline to US$3.9 billion in FY2014 as we continue to optimise our drilling program. This includes a
forecast reduction in our operated rig count to an average of 25 for the period. Approximately 75 per cent of operated drilling activity will be
focused on our liquids-rich acreage in the Eagle Ford area. The remaining activity will occur in the Haynesville and Permian areas, where we are
continuing to evaluate our most prospective acreage. Our operated drilling program in the Fayetteville area has been temporarily suspended;
however, we will continue to invest in wells operated by third parties where we see value.
Petroleum exploration expenditure for FY2013 was US$675 million, of which US$522 million was expensed. A US$600 million exploration program,
largely focused on the Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia, is planned for FY2014.
Petroleum production is forecast to increase to 250 MMboe (BHP Billiton share) in FY2014. This includes 114 MMboe (BHP Billiton share) from
Onshore US, underpinned by an anticipated 75 per cent increase in liquids production. Production from the conventional operations is expected
to remain stable, with new volumes from Macedon and increased production at Atlantis (United States) offset by expected natural field decline and
planned maintenance.
The Potash Business is not in production and had a loss, in Underlying EBIT terms, for FY2013 of US$334 million, which was largely unchanged
from the prior period. A reduction in our global potash exploration activity was offset by higher costs associated with the establishment of our
Potash Business in Saskatchewan (Canada). In August 2013, we announced our decision to invest a further US$2.6 billion, which brings the total
approved spending to US$3.8 billion, to finish the excavation and lining of the Jansen Potash Project production and service shafts, and to
continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities. Completion of both shafts is expected during CY2016, while the
associated works program will extend into CY2017.

Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
In combination with our worldwide conventional oil and gas operations, the integration of the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian operations
from the Petrohawk acquisition strengthened our operating position in the Onshore US and combined with the Fayetteville field contributed to a
40 per cent increase in Petroleum production to 222.3 MMboe for FY2012. Our total production averaged 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This achievement was realised despite extended downtime at our non-operated facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.
Petroleum and Potash revenue increased by US$2.2 billion to US$12.9 billion. This was primarily due to the additional revenue of US$2.1 billion for
Onshore US. Increases at other Assets were mainly offset by the downtime at the Mad Dog facilities.
Petroleum and Potash Underlying EBIT for FY2012 declined from US$6.2 billion to US$6.0 billion.
Petroleum’s contribution to Underlying EBIT for FY2012 was unchanged from the prior period at US$6.3 billion. This financial performance was
achieved despite natural field decline at Pyrenees and the substantial deferral of production due to extended downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and
the NWS. Higher prices for our offshore production increased Underlying EBIT by US$1.5 billion, largely as a result of a 19 per cent increase in the
average realised price of oil to US$110.66 per barrel and a 29 per cent rise in the average realised price of LNG to US$14.23 per thousand scf. For
US natural gas, our average realised price in FY2012 was US$2.82 per thousand scf, and for NGLs our average realised price in FY2012 was
US$54.85. The low natural gas price in the United States resulted in Onshore US having a loss of US$140 million compared with a profit of US$43
million in FY2011.
Capital expenditure across our offshore and onshore operations totalled US$5.8 billion in FY2012. Spending in major capital projects across our
conventional portfolio was US$2.5 billion and primarily included projects in Western Australia and the Gulf of Mexico.
Exploration and development expenditure specifically within our Onshore US Asset totalled US$3.7 billion in FY2012 and was expected to rise to
US$4.0 billion in FY2013. At the end of FY2012, over 80 per cent of the activity of our approximately 40 drilling rigs in the Onshore US Asset was
focused on the Eagle Ford and Permian areas.
We achieved success in our conventional exploration program in FY2012 as seven of 12 wells encountered hydrocarbons. The associated rise in
our level of activity resulted in a US$798 million increase in gross exploration spend for the period to US$1.4 billion. Capitalised exploration costs
increased from US$153 million in FY2011 to US$681 million in FY2012.
The strong liquids growth potential of our Onshore US Asset was demonstrated by the 60 per cent increase in LNG production, to more than
40,000 barrels per day over the 10-month period since the acquisition of Petrohawk.
Higher potash exploration and business development costs resulted in a loss in FY2012 Underlying EBIT of US$328 million.
Copper
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Copper production increased by 10 per cent in FY2013 to 1.2 Mt (BHP Billiton share). Escondida (Chile) copper production increased by 28 per
cent to 1.1 Mt (100 per cent basis) as the average copper grade mined rose to
Table of Contents
170
1.4 per cent and milling rates improved. Record annual copper production at Antamina (Peru) also contributed to the strong result having
benefited from a full-year contribution from the recently expanded concentrator.
Copper revenue increased by US$395 million to US$12.0 billion, largely driven by production increases at Escondida and Antamina, partially
offset by a five per cent decrease in average realised copper prices. Revenue for Escondida increased US$925 million to US$4.9 billion due to the
28 per cent increase in production, driven by higher average copper grades mined and improved milling rates partially offset by lower average
realised prices. The increase in revenue at Escondida was partially offset by decreases at Pampa Norte (Chile), Cannington and Olympic Dam
(both Australia) in line with lower production and lower average realised prices.
Underlying EBIT for FY2013 declined by US$343 million to US$3.6 billion. Increased sales volumes and cost savings associated with productivity
gains and broader economies of scale increased Underlying EBIT by US$428 million. In this context, strong production growth and a material
reduction in costs contributed towards a 15 per cent reduction in unit cash costs at Escondida. These savings were offset by payments
associated with the finalisation of multi-year collective labour agreements at each of our South American assets and major planned maintenance
programs at Escondida and Olympic Dam. The external influences of lower prices, inflation and foreign exchange variations reduced Underlying
EBIT by a further US$658 million.
Revenue for Olympic Dam decreased by US$273 million to US$1.9 billion, primarily due to lower prices and reduced volumes. Price, grade and
smelter availability contributed to the decrease in Underlying EBIT from US$214 million in FY2012 to an Underlying EBIT loss of US$4 million in
FY2013.
The average realised price of copper for the period declined by five per cent to US$3.41 per pound. At 30 June 2013, the Group had 283,753
tonnes of outstanding copper sales that were revalued at a weighted average price of US$3.08 per pound. The final price of these sales will be
determined in FY2014. In addition, 278,547 tonnes of copper sales from FY2012 were subject to a finalisation adjustment in FY2013. Provisional
pricing and finalisation adjustments decreased Underlying EBIT by US$224 million in FY2013 (FY2012: US$265 million loss).
During the period, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Pinto Valley mining operation and the associated San Manuel Arizona Railroad
Company to Capstone Mining Corp. for an aggregate cash consideration of US$650 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and
other customary conditions, and is expected to be completed in the second half of the CY2013.
Escondida production is forecast to remain steady at approximately 1.1 Mt (100 per cent basis) in FY2014, before increasing to approximately 1.3
Mt (100 per cent basis) in FY2015.
Copper production for FY2014 is expected to remain largely unchanged at approximately 1.2 Mt (BHP Billiton share excluding Pinto Valley
production). Production at Spence is expected to be weighted towards the second half of FY2014, as lower recoveries reduce output in the
September 2013 quarter. At Antamina, mining will transition from a copper to zinc rich ore zone in the second half of FY2014, consistent with the
mine plan.

We established strong momentum in our Copper Business in the June 2012 quarter. Escondida copper production increased by 22 per cent from
the March 2012 quarter as mining activities progressed towards higher-grade ore, while quarterly material mined, mill throughput and copper
production records at Antamina added to the strong finish to the year. Annual copper production, however, declined marginally in FY2012 as
lower grades and industrial action constrained performance at Escondida for the first nine months of the year. Production from Pampa Norte,
Olympic Dam and Cannington during FY2012 was in line with production in FY2011.
Revenue for FY2012 decreased by US$2.6 billion to US$11.6 billion. The reduction was mainly driven by a US$1.6 billion decrease at Escondida
due to a 14 per cent decrease in copper volume sold and to a 14 per cent fall in the average realised price of copper to US$3.58 per pound. Lowers
prices also contributed to decreases at Pampa Norte and Australian Assets, of US$332 million and US$363 million respectively.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$2.8 billion to US$4.0 billion, primarily due to the decrease in revenue. General cost pressure across
the Copper Business portfolio, together with unit cost escalation specifically associated with industrial activity and lower ore grades at Escondida,
reduced Underlying EBIT by US$841 million.
At 30 June 2012, the Group had 278,547 tonnes of outstanding copper sales that were revalued at a weighted average price of US$3.49 per pound.
The final price of these sales was determined in FY2013. In addition, 239,156 tonnes of copper sales from FY2011 were subject to a finalisation
adjustment in FY2012. This finalisation adjustment and the provisional pricing impact as at 30 June 2012 decreased Underlying EBIT by US$265
million for the period.
Iron Ore
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Iron ore production increased by seven per cent in FY2013 to 170 Mt (BHP Billiton share). WAIO production of 187 Mt (100 per cent basis)
represented a thirteenth consecutive annual production record. The delivery of WAIO’s capital efficient growth program and continued strong
operating performance across the supply chain contributed to this record result. The three pellet plants at Samarco (Brazil) continued to operate
at capacity during the period.
Iron Ore revenue decreased by US$2.4 billion to US$20.2 billion in FY2013. Revenue for WAIO decreased US$2.0 billion to US$18.5 billion, a
decrease of 9.9 per cent. Record sales volumes at WAIO, which increased 9.6 per cent, were more than offset by a 17 per cent fall in the average
realised price of iron ore to US$110 per tonne.
Underlying EBIT for FY2013 declined by US$3.1 billion to US$11.1 billion. The increased sales volumes at WAIO increased Underlying EBIT by
US$1.4 billion. However, this was more than offset by the fall in the average realised price of iron ore, which reduced Underlying EBIT by US$3.9
billion, net of price-linked costs. WAIO’s export volumes for FY2013 were sold on the basis of shorter term, market-based prices. Revenue for the
period reflected the average index price one month prior to the month of shipment, adjusted for product characteristics such as iron and moisture
content. Approximately 65 per cent of shipments were delivered on a Cost and Freight (CFR) basis.
Increased labour and contractor costs reduced Underlying EBIT by US$151 million during the period. This largely reflected our decision to invest
in operating capability prior to the full commissioning and ramp-up of expanded capacity at WAIO. WAIO unit cash costs, including freight and
royalty charges of US$856 million and US$1.2 billion, respectively, remained largely unchanged during FY2013. Increased depreciation and
amortisation charges reduced Underlying EBIT by US$239 million, and reflected the recent completion of
Table of Contents
173
several major projects and a US$86 million impairment of project costs associated with the WAIO Tug Harbour project.
On 10 July 2013, we completed the extension of our long-term WAIO joint venture relationship with ITOCHU Corporation (ITOCHU) and Mitsui &
Co., Ltd. (Mitsui). This transaction has aligned interests across the WAIO supply chain. Under the terms of the agreement, ITOCHU and Mitsui
invested approximately US$822 million and US$720 million, respectively, in shares and loans of BHP Iron Ore (Jimblebar) Pty Ltd, representing an
eight per cent and seven per cent interest in the Jimblebar mining hub and resource. The consideration included a share of capital costs
associated with the Jimblebar Mine Expansion project.
Several major milestones were achieved at our WAIO Asset during FY2013, including an increase in port capacity to 220 million tonnes per annum
(Mtpa) (100 per cent basis) following the successful installation of all major infrastructure associated with the Port Hedland Inner Harbour
Expansion project. First production from the Jimblebar Mine Expansion, which is expected to increase mine capacity to 220 Mtpa (100 per cent
basis), is expected in the December 2013 quarter, ahead of schedule. Longer term, the progressive debottlenecking of the supply chain is
expected to underpin substantial low-cost growth in our WAIO Asset.
WAIO production is expected to increase by 10 per cent to approximately 207 Mt (100 per cent basis) in FY2014. The associated productivity gains
should benefit unit costs in FY2014; however, this is expected to be more than offset by a temporary increase in strip ratios as the Jimblebar Mine
Expansion ramps up production. Total iron ore production for FY2014, which includes Samarco production, is forecast to increase by 11 per cent
to 188 Mt (BHP Billiton share).

Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Our commitment to invest throughout the economic cycle helped to deliver a twelfth consecutive annual production record in iron ore. WAIO
shipments rose to a record annualised rate of 179 Mt in the June 2012 quarter (100 per cent basis). Consistently strong operating performance, the
ramp-up of Ore Handling Plant 3 at Yandi, dual tracking of the Company’s rail infrastructure and additional ship loading capacity at Port Hedland
contributed to the record result. The three pellet plants at Samarco continued to operate at capacity in the period.
Iron Ore revenue increased by US$2.2 billion to US$22.6 billion in FY2012. Revenue for WAIO increased by US$2.3 billion to US$20.5 billion, an
increase of 13 per cent, mainly due to record sales volumes, which increased by 19 per cent. This was partially offset by a seven per cent and five
per cent decline in fines and lump prices, respectively.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 increased by US$873 million to a record US$14.2 billion. The outstanding financial performance was underpinned by
record production at WAIO, which increased Underlying EBIT by US$2.4 billion. This was partially offset by the decline in realised prices, which
reduced Underlying EBIT by US$1.3 billion, net of price-linked costs. While the acquisition of the HWE Mining subsidiaries in September 2012
eliminated third party contractor margin, one-off integration costs and an increase in exploration expense more than offset the cost savings
achieved during the period.
Coal
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Metallurgical coal production increased by 13 per cent in FY2013 to 38 Mt. A 19 per cent increase (100 per cent basis) in production at Queensland
Coal was underpinned by record annual performance at both Peak Downs and
Table of Contents
175
South Walker Creek, and this was achieved despite the indefinite closure of Norwich Park and Gregory. In addition, Illawarra Coal (Australia)
achieved record annual production in the period.
Energy coal production increased by three per cent in FY2013 to 73 Mt, which included record annual production from New South Wales Energy
Coal (Australia) following the successful ramp-up of the RX1 project.
Coal revenue for FY2013 decreased by US$2.9 billion to US$10.7 billion. Revenue at Queensland Coal decreased US$1.4 billion to US$4.5 billion, a
decrease of 24.2 per cent. Volume increases at Queensland Coal were more than offset by the effect of decreases in average realised prices. Hard
coking coal and weak coking coal prices fell 34 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. Revenue at Energy Coal South Africa (BECSA) and
Cerrejón (Colombia) decreased US$437 million and US$258 million, respectively, reflecting reduced production and decreased thermal coal
prices, which fell 18 per cent during FY2013. Revenue at New South Wales Energy Coal and New Mexico Coal were in line with FY2012, with
volume increases offset by reduced thermal coal prices.
Underlying EBIT for FY2013 declined by US$2.1 billion to US$746 million. The fall in hard coking coal, weak coking coal and thermal coal prices,
reduced Underlying EBIT by US$3.4 billion, net of price-linked costs. This was partially offset by increased sales volumes and cost savings, which
increased Underlying EBIT by US$1.2 billion. A strong focus on contractor usage and rates and a significant reduction in consumables
expenditure contributed to the substantial reduction in operating costs at Queensland Coal, as demonstrated by the 30 per cent decline in mine
site unit cash costs at BMA. Exploration and business development costs decreased by US$326 million.
During FY2013, the Daunia and Broadmeadow Life Extension projects (both Australia) delivered first production, ahead of schedule. First coal
was also loaded from the Newcastle Third Port Stage 3 project (Australia). The Caval Ridge (Australia), Cerrejón P40 and Appin Area 9 projects
remain on schedule and budget. Following a review of the Hay Point Stage Three Expansion project, we approved a US$255 million increase to
the original budget of US$1.25 billion (BHP Billiton share). Shipments from the new facilities are now expected to commence in CY2015. The
revised schedule and budget reflects the impact of significant weather interruptions and associated productivity issues that have affected the
marine works. The schedule delay is not expected to impact the production profile of the Queensland Coal operation.
The continued ramp-up of Daunia and scheduled commissioning of Caval Ridge is expected to increase the capacity of our Queensland Coal
operation to 66 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) by the end of CY2014. Metallurgical coal production for FY2014 is expected to increase to approximately
41 Mt (BHP Billiton share), while energy coal production is expected to remain steady at 73 Mt (BHP Billiton share).

Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
A modest increase in metallurgical coal production was achieved in FY2012 despite numerous operating challenges. Production at Queensland
Coal remained constrained largely as a result of industrial action, weather related downtime and geotechnical issues at Gregory Crinum. Record
annual production at Illawarra Coal followed successful commissioning of the West Cliff Coal Preparation Plant upgrade project.

Annual production records were achieved in energy coal at two of our export oriented operations, Cerrejón and New South Wales Energy Coal.
The RX1 Project at New South Wales Energy Coal delivered first production during the June 2012 quarter, significantly ahead of schedule. This
project capitalised on strong demand for high ash coal in our key growth markets.
Coal revenue for FY2012 increased by US$518 million to US$13.6 billion. Metallurgical Coal revenue was flat. The impact of stronger realised
prices, particularly a six per cent increase in the price of hard coking coal, were offset by a reduction of 4 per cent in sales volumes, mainly at
Queensland Coal. Energy Coal revenue increased by US$515 million, which was mainly driven by a higher average realised prices and higher
proportion of export sales. These factors increased revenue at BECSA by US$140 million, at NSWEC by US$157 million, and at Cerrejón by
US$163 million.
Coal Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$1.0 billion to US$2.8 billion. The lower production volumes in metallurgical coal reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$135 million. This was offset by stronger volumes and the higher proportion of export sales in energy coal, largely
associated with improved rail performance at BECSA and the accelerated expansion of New South Wales Energy Coal, which increased
Underlying EBIT by US$152 million in the period.
In contrast, the increase in the price of hard coking coal and higher average realised prices in energy coal, most notably at Cerrejón, increased
Underlying EBIT by US$434 million, net of price-linked costs.
Higher labour, raw material and other operating costs, primarily at Queensland Coal, contributed to a US$1.2 billion reduction in Underlying EBIT.
The progression of our development pipeline also led to an increase in exploration and business development costs in the period.
In July 2012, force majeure was lifted across all BMA sites. In addition, BMA and the unions reached a framework agreement that guided the
finalisation of the BMA Enterprise Agreement. Further work was underway to finalise local mine site details.
In response to the challenging external environment, the Group chose to delay the 2.5 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) expansion of Peak Downs
associated with the Caval Ridge mine development. Following a review of the Norwich Park mine’s profitability, we also announced the indefinite
closure of this operation during the June 2012 quarter and the cessation of mining at the Gregory open-cut mine.
The Group announced approval of the US$845 million Appin Area 9 Project in the period.
During FY2012, we also approved a further 8 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) expansion of the Cerrejón mine. The US$437 million project (BHP Billiton
share) would increase export capacity to approximately 40 Mtpa (100 per cent basis). In addition, the partners approved the third phase of
expansion of the Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group’s (NCIG) coal handling facility in Newcastle (Australia).
Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel
The Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business represents the consolidation of three former Customer Sector Groups under a single
management structure.
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Alumina production increased by 18 per cent in FY2013 to a record 4.9 Mt (BHP Billiton share), underpinned by the ramp-up of the Efficiency and
Growth project at Worsley. Aluminium production increased by two per cent to 1.2 Mt (BHP Billiton share), with improved performance at our
southern African smelters.
Table of Contents
178
Total manganese ore production increased by seven per cent in FY2013 to a record 8.5 Mt (100 per cent basis) and reflected a substantial
improvement in plant availability at GEMCO (Australia). Total manganese alloy volumes were largely unchanged from FY2012. The recovery in
TEMCO (Australia) production that followed the temporary suspension of operations in the prior period was offset by the permanent closure of
energy-intensive silicomanganese production at Metalloys (South Africa) in January 2012.
Nickel production in FY2013 was largely unchanged from the prior period. Strong operating performance at Cerro Matoso (Colombia) was offset
by planned maintenance at the Nickel West Kalgoorlie smelter and Kwinana refinery.
Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel revenue decreased by 6.4 per cent, or US$633 million, to US$9.3 billion. The reduction was primarily due to
decreases at Nickel West of US$270 million and from sales of third party products of US$392 million. The decrease in revenue was mainly driven
by lower realised prices across all parts of the Business. In this context, lower average realised prices for aluminium (down six per cent to
US$2,191 per tonne), alumina (down nine per cent to US$302 per tonne), nickel (down 15 per cent to US$16,319 per tonne) and manganese alloy
(down 10 per cent to US$1,051 per tonne) were only partially offset by an increase in the average realised price of manganese ore (up nine per
cent to US$4.83 per dry metric tonne unit).
Underlying EBIT for FY2013 increased by US$188 million to US$164 million. With productivity improvements already well advanced, consisting
principally of the improvement plan at Worsley, substantial cost savings of US$437 million were achieved during the period, while a stronger US
dollar increased Underlying EBIT by a further US$243 million. In contrast, weaker markets continued to challenge the Business as lower average
realised prices contributed to a US$474 million reduction in Underlying EBIT, net of price-linked costs.
The US$167 million (BHP Billiton share) GEEP2 expansion at GEMCO delivered first production during the period, ahead of schedule. The project
has increased processing capacity from 4.2 to 4.8 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) and the ramp-up of the operation is largely complete.

Record annual production at the Alumar refinery (Brazil) contributed to a four per cent increase in total alumina production in FY2012. Aluminium
production was lower as potline capacity at Hillside, South Africa, was temporarily curtailed following a major unplanned outage in the March 2012
quarter.
Consistently strong operating performance and improved plant availability at both GEMCO and Hotazel (South Africa) underpinned annual
manganese ore production and sales records in FY2012. Manganese alloy production was substantially lower than the corresponding period
following the termination of energy-intensive silicomanganese production at Metalloys and the temporary suspension of production at TEMCO.
The successful replacement of the Line 1 furnace at Cerro Matoso in the September 2011 quarter led to an increase in annual nickel production of
3.4 per cent.

Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel revenue decreased by 14 per cent, or US$1.6 billion, to US$9.9 billion. This was driven, in part, by an eight per
cent reduction in the average realised price of aluminium (to US$2,314 per tonne) and a three per cent decline in the average realised price of
alumina (to US$333 per tonne), which reduced revenue by US$274 million. A 22 per cent decline in the average realised price of manganese ore
and a 10 per cent decline in the average realised price of manganese alloy further reduced revenue by US$479 million. Finally, a 22 per cent
decline in the average realised nickel price reduced revenue by US$831 million. In contrast, record manganese ore sales were offset by lower
volumes for other products.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$1.6 billion to a loss of US$24 million. The decrease in Underlying EBIT is primarily due to the
decrease in revenue. At Nickel West’s Mt Keith operation, a reduction in mining activity and the commissioning of the Talc Redesign project
delivered tangible cost benefits during the period. These were offset by cost escalation, which drove significant margin compression over the
Business. Higher raw material costs for alumina and aluminium inputs, such as coke and caustic soda, led to a further US$337 million decline in
Underlying EBIT. Costs associated with the Hillside outage added to the decline.
The Worsley Efficiency and Growth project delivered first production during FY2012. Construction of the new Kwinana hydrogen plant was also
completed in FY2012.
Group and unallocated items
This category includes the Group’s diamonds business (divested effective 10 April 2013), our interest in titanium minerals (divested effective
3 September 2012), non-Potash corporate costs incurred by the former Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG and corporate activities, including
Group Treasury, Freight, Transport and Logistics operations.
Year ended 30 June 2013 compared with year ended 30 June 2012
Underlying EBIT declined by US$456 million to a loss of US$177 million. The decline largely reflected a reduced contribution from Richards Bay
Minerals and EKATI, following their sale during FY2013.
Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Underlying EBIT for Group and Unallocated in FY2012 decreased by US$32 million to US$279 million. Stronger diamond and titanium prices
increased Underlying EBIT by US$246 million, but were offset by the decline in production at EKATI, which reduced Underlying EBIT by US$357
million. Higher corporate and information technology costs were more than offset by a foreign exchange related restatement and partial release of
the Newcastle steelworks rehabilitation provision.

Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our own assets means that we sometimes source third party materials to ensure a steady supply of
product to our customers.
To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third parties.
In order to support development of more liquid markets, we will sometimes source third party physical product and manage risk through both the
physical and financial markets.
3.7    Liquidity and capital resources
As a result of our record production volumes and record prices in many of our key commodities over the past several years, we have generated
very strong cash flows throughout our operations. Despite the changing economic and market conditions, our net operating cash flow in FY2013
of US$18.3 billion reflected the strong cash generating capacity of the Group throughout the economic cycle.
These cash flows have been fundamental to the funding of our existing operations, maintaining a pipeline of growth projects and returning capital
to shareholders through dividends and, in prior years, share buy-backs. Our priority for cash is to reinvest in the Company. In line with our
strategy, we have grown our business through project developments and acquisitions. Through a combination of borrowings and payments to
shareholders, we manage our balance sheet with the goal of maintaining levels of gearing that we believe optimise our costs of capital and return
on capital employed.
Net operating cash flows are our principal source of cash. We also raise funds from the debt markets to manage our liquidity position and to
refinance existing debt. Our liquidity position is supported by our strong credit rating and committed debt facilities.

Net operating cash flows after interest and tax declined by 25.1 per cent to US$18.3 billion for FY2013. A US$5.6 billion reduction in cash
generated from operations (after changes in working capital balances) was the major contributor to the decline.
A US$14.2 billion reduction in net investing cash outflows to US$17.9 billion primarily reflected the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation
in the prior period and a US$4.4 billion increase in proceeds from asset sales. Capital and exploration expenditure totalled US$22.9 billion in
FY2013. Expenditure on major growth projects was US$18.8 billion, including US$6.9 billion on Petroleum projects and US$11.9 billion on Minerals
projects. Capital expenditure on sustaining and other items was US$2.8 billion. Exploration expenditure was US$1.3 billion, including US$1.0
billion classified within net operating cash flows. The breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure by Business is set out in section 3.4.5.
Net financing cash flows included proceeds from borrowings of US$10.0 billion and were partially offset by debt repayments of US$2.6 billion and
dividend payments of US$6.2 billion. Proceeds from borrowings include the issuance of a two tranche Euro bond of €2.0 billion, a two tranche
Sterling bond of £1.75 billion, an Australian dollar bond of A$1.0 billion, a Euro bond of €750 million and a Canadian dollar bond of C$750 million.
Net debt, comprising interest bearing liabilities less cash, was US$29.1 billion, an increase of US$5.5 billion compared to the net debt position at
30 June 2012.

Year ended 30 June 2012 compared with year ended 30 June 2011
Net operating cash flows after interest and tax decreased by 18.9 per cent to US$24.4 billion for FY2012. A US$3.8 billion reduction in cash
generated from operations (after changes in working capital balances) was the major contributor to the decline. Higher net income tax paid and
increased royalty-related taxation payments further reduced net operating cash flows after interest and tax by US$1.4 billion and US$408 million,
respectively.
Investing cash flows increased by US$15.6 billion, primarily driven by investment in subsidiaries and operations of US$12.6 billion in FY2012, the
majority of which related to the purchase of Petrohawk, with a resulting cash outflow of US$12.0 billion. Capital and exploration expenditure,
including exploration expenditure expensed and included in operating cash flows, totalled US$20.8 billion in FY2012. Expenditure on major
growth projects was US$16.3 billion, including US$5.1 billion on Petroleum projects and US$11.2 billion on Minerals projects. Capital expenditure
on sustaining and other items was US$2.0 billion.
Net financing cash flows include proceeds from borrowings of US$13.3 billion, partially offset by dividend payments of US$5.9 billion and debt
repayments of US$4.3 billion. Proceeds from borrowings include the issuance of a three tranche Global Bond of US$3.0 billion, a five tranche
Global Bond of US$5.25 billion, a two tranche Euro Bond of €2.0 billion and proceeds from Commercial Paper of US$995 million.
Net debt, comprising interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, was US$23.6 billion, an increase of US$17.8 billion compared with
the net debt position at 30 June 2011.
3.7.2    Major projects
At the end of FY2013, we had 18 major projects, which are largely brownfield, in execution with a combined budget of US$21.2 billion. The majority
of these projects are scheduled to deliver first production before the end of CY2014. This budget does not include annual capital expenditure at
Onshore US, which is expected to approximate US$3.9 billion in FY2014.
The Broadmeadow Life Extension and Bass Strait Kipper projects (both Australia) were completed during FY2013. In addition, four major projects
achieved either first production or shipment in the period; namely, WAIO Port Hedland Inner Harbour Expansion, WAIO Orebody 24, Daunia and
the Newcastle Third Port Stage 3 project (all Australia).
The Bass Strait Kipper project will commence production upon completion of the mercury removal project (refer to section 2.2.1 for further
details).
During FY2013, we approved the US$520 million (BHP Billiton share) Longford Gas Conditioning Plant (LGCP) project as part of the Gippsland
Basin Joint Venture (Bass Strait, Australia). The LGCP will add carbon dioxide (CO2) removal capacity which is necessary to condition production
from the Bass Strait Turrum project currently in development.
On 25 July 2013, we announced an investment of US$2.0 billion (BHP Billiton share) to construct a desalination facility, which will deliver
sustainable water supply to Escondida over the long term.
On 20 August 2013, we announced an investment of US$2.6 billion to finish the excavation and lining of the Jansen Potash Project production
and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities. This investment will be spread over a number of
years, with completion of both shafts expected during CY2016, while the associated works program will extend into CY2017. Including previous
commitments, total approved investment at Jansen has increased to US$3.8 billion.

The WAIO Jimblebar Mine Expansion, which is set to increase supply chain capacity to 220 Mtpa (100 per cent basis), is expected to achieve first
production in the December 2013 quarter, ahead of schedule. As previously announced, the project remains on budget in local currency terms,
although the capital cost in US dollars is expected to be 10 per cent higher than the original budget. This increase was offset by a change in scope
and US$400 million reduction in the budget for the WAIO Port Blending and Rail Yard Facilities project, which reflects the decision to prioritise
capital efficient growth in the Inner Harbour. As a result, WAIO remains well positioned to deliver 220 Mtpa of supply chain capacity ahead of
schedule and on budget.
Following a review of the Hay Point Stage Three Expansion project (Australia), BHP Billiton approved a US$255 million increase to the original
budget of US$1.25 billion (BHP Billiton share). Shipments from the new facilities are now expected to commence in CY2015. The revised schedule
and budget reflects the impact of significant weather interruptions and associated productivity issues, which have affected the marine works. The
schedule delay is not expected to impact the production profile of the Queensland Coal operation.

3.7.3    Net debt and sources of liquidity
Our policies on debt and treasury management are as follows:
•
•
•
•
a commitment to a solid ‘A’ credit rating;
gearing to be a maximum of 40 per cent;
diversification of funding sources;
generally to maintain borrowings and excess cash in US dollars.
Gearing and net debt
30 June 2013 compared with 30 June 2012
Net debt, comprising Interest bearing liabilities less Cash and cash equivalents, was US$29.1 billion, which represented an increase of US$5.5
billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2012. Gearing, which is the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets, was 28.8 per cent at
30 June 2013, compared with 26.0 per cent at 30 June 2012. The primary reason for the increase in gearing during FY2013 was due to the issue of
bonds during the period.
Cash at bank and in hand less overdrafts at 30 June 2013 was US$6.1 billion compared with US$4.9 billion at 30 June 2012. Included within this
were short-term deposits at 30 June 2013 of US$3.2 billion compared with US$3.3 billion at 30 June 2012.
30 June 2012 compared with 30 June 2011
Net debt was US$23.6 billion, which represented an increase of US$17.8 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2011. Gearing was
26.0 per cent at 30 June 2012, compared with 9.2 per cent at 30 June 2011. The primary reason for the increase in gearing during FY2012 was the
purchase of Petrohawk for US$12.0 billion and assumption of net debt of US$3.8 billion.
Cash at bank and in hand less overdrafts at 30 June 2012 was US$4.9 billion compared with US$10.1 billion at 30 June 2011. Included within this
were short-term deposits at 30 June 2012 of US$3.3 billion compared with US$8.7 billion at 30 June 2011.
Funding sources
During FY2013, we made the following debt issues:
•
•
•
•
In September 2012, we issued a two tranche Euro bond and a two tranche Sterling bond. The Euro bond issue comprised €1.25 billion 2.250 per cent
bonds due 2020 and €750 million 3.250 per cent bonds due 2027. The Sterling bond issue comprised £750 million 3.250 per cent bonds due 2024
and £1.0 billion 4.300 per cent bonds due 2042.
In October 2012, we issued an A$1.0 billion 3.750 per cent Australian dollar bond due 2017.
In April 2013, we issued a €750 million 3.125 per cent Euro bond due 2033.
In May 2013, we issued a C$750 million 3.230 per cent Canadian bond due 2023.

The Group has a US$6.0 billion commercial paper program backed by US$6.0 billion of revolving credit facilities. The multi-currency revolving credit facilities consist of US$5.0
billion expiring in December 2015 and US$1.0 billion expiring in December 2013 with the ability to extend to December 2014. These facilities are used for general corporate purposes
and as backup for the commercial paper programs. The interest rates under these facilities are based on an interbank rate plus a margin. The applicable margin is typical for a credit
facility extended to a company with the Group’s credit rating. The Group had US$1.3 billion outstanding in the US commercial paper market at the end of the financial year
(2012: US$995 million).
(2)
Other bank facilities are arranged with a number of banks with the general terms and conditions agreed on a periodic basis.
Additional information regarding the maturity profile of our debt obligations and details of our standby and support agreements is included in
note 29 ‘Financial risk management’ to the financial statements.
The Group’s long-term credit rating from Moody’s Investor Services is currently A1 (the short-term rating is P-1), and from Standard & Poor’s is A+
(the short-term credit rating is A-1). The ratings outlook from both agencies has not changed during FY2013 or since 30 June 2013.
3.7.4    Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
We identified our primary market risks in section 3.4. A description of how we manage our market risks, including both quantitative and qualitative
information about our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at 30 June 2013, is contained in note 29 ‘Financial risk management’ to the
financial statements.

3.7.5    Portfolio management
190
We continually review our portfolio to identify assets that no longer fit our strategy. Our commitment to simplify our portfolio continued to deliver
value for shareholders, with major transactions totalling US$6.5 billion, either announced or completed during the period. We will purchase
interests in assets where they fit our strategy.
On 19 December 2012, we completed the sale of our wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit for a final cash consideration of US$430 million.
On 7 September 2012, we completed the sale of our 37.76 per cent effective interest in Richards Bay Minerals for a final cash consideration of
US$1.7 billion.
On 10 April 2013, we completed the sale of our diamonds business, comprising our interests in the EKATI Diamond Mine and Diamond Marketing
operations for an aggregate cash consideration of US$553 million (after adjustments).
On 7 June 2013, we completed the sale of our 8.33 per cent interest in the East Browse Joint Venture and 20 per cent interest in the West Browse
Joint Venture to Petrochina International Investment (Australia) Pty Ltd for a consideration of US$1.7 billion.
On 29 April 2013, we announced we had signed a definitive agreement to sell our Pinto Valley mining operation and the associated San Manuel
Arizona Railroad Company to Capstone Mining Corp for aggregate cash consideration of US$650 million.
On 20 June 2013, we announced an extension of our long-term joint venture relationship with ITOCHU Corporation (ITOCHU) and Mitsui & Co.,
Ltd. (Mitsui). This transaction was completed on 10 July 2013 and has aligned interests across the WAIO supply chain. Under the terms of the
agreement, ITOCHU and Mitsui invested approximately US$822 million and US$720 million, respectively, in shares and loans of BHP Iron Ore
(Jimblebar) Pty Ltd, representing an eight per cent and seven per cent interest in the Jimblebar mining hub and resource. The consideration
included a share of capital costs associated with the Jimblebar Mine Expansion project.
3.7.6    Dividend and capital management
The Group’s priorities for capital management remain unchanged: firstly, to invest in high-return growth opportunities throughout the economic
cycle; secondly, to maintain a solid ‘A’ credit rating and to grow our progressive dividend; and finally, to return excess capital to shareholders.
The disciplined application of these priorities within the framework of our strategy has not only facilitated strong growth in the business, but has
also enabled the Company to return US$59.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy-backs over the last 10 years.
BHP Billiton has a progressive dividend policy. The aim of this policy is to steadily increase or at least maintain our base dividend in US dollars at
each half-yearly payment.
On 20 August 2013, the Board declared a final dividend for the year of 59 US cents per share. Together with the interim dividend of 57 US cents
per share paid to shareholders on 28 March 2013, this brought the total dividend declared for the year to 116 US cents per share, a 3.6 per cent
increase over the previous year’s full-year dividend of 112 US cents per share.

3.10    Significant changes since the end of the year
On 18 September 2013, the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Parliament passed legislation which has altered the arrangements BHP Billiton reached with
Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Program Limited (PNGSDP) and the PNG Government upon the transfer of its shareholding in Ok
Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) to PNGSDP in February 2002. The consequences of this legislation will be as follows:
•
•
•
•
repeal of the section of a 2001 Act under which BHP Billiton parties were protected from environmental claims by the PNG Government;
cancellation of the shares which the PNGSDP holds in OTML and replacement with shares issued to the PNG Government;
the mortgage given by PNGSDP over its OTML shares to secure the BHP Billiton indemnity and other similar obligations is declared void and of no
legal effect; and
any provision in an agreement which limits a person’s right to take proceedings against a BHP Billiton party is rendered null and void.
BHP Billiton is considering the impact of this legislation. BHP Billiton retains a broad indemnity from PNGSDP and has adequate security to back
that indemnity. Based on currently available information, the legislation is unlikely to materially alter BHP Billiton’s exposure arising from its past
ownership of the Ok Tedi mine.
Other than the matters outlined above or elsewhere in this Annual Report, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the year that
have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent
accounting periods.

5    Corporate Governance Statement
5.1    Governance at BHP Billiton
Dear Shareholder
202
Welcome to BHP Billiton’s Corporate Governance Statement. This section of our Annual Report outlines the corporate governance processes of
BHP Billiton.
At BHP Billiton, we have a governance framework to which we are held accountable that goes beyond an interest in governance or our need to
fulfil regulatory requirements. Our approach is to adopt what we consider to be the highest of governance standards in Australia, the United
Kingdom and the United States. That is because we believe that high-quality governance supports long-term value creation. Simply put, we think
good governance is good business.
Governance influences how the objectives of the Company are set and achieved, how risk is monitored and assessed, and how performance is
optimised. Therefore, our corporate governance structure encourages the creation of value, while providing accountability and control systems
commensurate with risks involved.
We do not see governance as just a matter for the Board. Good governance is also the responsibility of executive management and is embedded
throughout the organisation.
Our BHP Billiton Charter is core to the governance framework of BHP Billiton – it embodies our corporate purpose, strategy and values, and
defines when we are successful. We foster a culture that values and rewards high ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect
for others.
We live the values enshrined in Our Charter and demonstrably adhere to the standards of conduct required by our BHP Billiton Code of Business
Conduct.
BHP Billiton governance structure
Appointment of Andrew Mackenzie
On 10 May 2013, Andrew Mackenzie was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Group and became our new Executive Director. His appointment
was the result of our long-established leadership development and succession process.
Table of Contents
203
Our planned and considered approach involves attracting and developing the best global talent over a sustained period. This ensures that we
have a deep pipeline of leaders at all levels in the Company, including for succession to Chief Executive.
The Board decided that Mr Mackenzie is the right person to lead BHP Billiton in a changing global environment. He brings a unique combination
of deep industry knowledge and global management skills to the CEO role, with over 30 years’ experience in the oil and gas, petrochemicals and
minerals industries.
Ongoing renewal
We are continuously focused on enhancing the diversity of perspective on the Board. We do this in a structured manner, looking out over a five-
year period at the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board. The right blend of skills, experience and perspective is
critical to ensuring the Board oversees BHP Billiton effectively for shareholders.
The Board has set a goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three. This remains our target, and, while we did not achieve
this target by the end of FY2013, we continue to work to identify future candidates for the Board. More details about the Board’s diversity of skills
and experience are set out in section 5.7.
Continuous improvement
The Board has a commitment to ongoing improvement in the way we carry out our work. Last year, the continued evolution of the Board and its
committees resulted in the formation of the Finance Committee. The Board made a commitment to evaluate the role and function of the Finance
Committee 12 months after its formation. In the past year, the Committee has focused on capital management planning, including capital
allocation and funding, as well as due diligence on divestments. Given our continued focus on capital management, the Board believes that the
Finance Committee adds considerable value to the governance of the Group and will continue to operate under its terms of reference. Further
details are set out in section 5.13.
During the year, our Board Governance Document and Committee terms of reference were reviewed and updated to reflect changing market
practice.
I hope you find this description of our corporate governance useful and look forward to receiving any feedback that fellow shareholders may
have.
Jac Nasser AO
Chairman
5.2    Shareholder engagement
Part of the Board’s commitment to high-quality governance is expressed through the approach we take to engaging and communicating with
shareholders. We encourage shareholders to make their views known to us.
Our shareholders are based across the globe. Outside of the Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Board uses a range of formal and informal
communication channels to understand shareholder views to ensure it can represent shareholders in governing BHP Billiton. Regular proactive
engagement with institutional shareholders and investor representative organisations takes place in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom
and the United States. This is led by:
•
•
the Chairman, supported by the President, Governance and Group Company Secretary – strategy, governance and remuneration;
the Remuneration Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director – governance and remuneration;
Table of Contents
204
•
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), senior management and the Investor Relations team – strategy, financial and
operating performance. Important briefings are webcast live from our website: www.bhpbilliton.com.
In addition, shareholders can contact us at any time through our Investor Relations team, with contact details available on our website:
www.bhpbilliton.com.
Feedback from shareholders is regularly reported to the Board. Shareholder and analyst feedback is shared with the Board through the
Chairman, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (also the Senior Independent Director), other Directors, the CEO and the CFO. In
addition, the Head of Investor Relations provides regular reports to the Board on shareholder feedback and analysis. This approach provides a
robust mechanism to ensure Directors are aware of issues raised and have a good understanding of current shareholder views.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM is an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions of the Board.
Our Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure means that we hold two AGMs each year. The AGMs are important dates in the BHP Billiton calendar. In
October each year, the BHP Billiton Plc meeting is held in the United Kingdom, and in November, the BHP Billiton Limited meeting is held in
Australia. These meetings provide an update for shareholders on the Group’s performance and offer an opportunity for shareholders to ask
questions and vote. Shareholders vote on important matters affecting the Group, including the election of Directors, any changes to our
constitutional documents, the receipt of annual financial statements and incentive arrangements for the Executive Director. Shareholders may
appoint proxies electronically through our website, and the Notice of Meeting describes how this can be done. As described above, a key part of
our approach to governance is that shareholders’ views are heard and understood. The AGM provides an important forum to enable this.
Questions can be registered prior to the meeting by completing the relevant form accompanying the Notice of Meeting. Shareholders can also
email the Group at investor.relations@bhpbilliton.com. Questions can be lodged ahead of the meeting and the answers to the most frequently
asked questions are posted to our website.
Key members of management, including the CEO and CFO, are present and available to answer questions. The External Auditor attends the AGMs
and is also available to answer questions.
Proceedings at shareholder meetings are webcast live from our website. Copies of the speeches delivered by the Chairman and CEO to the AGMs
are released to the stock exchanges and posted to our website. A summary of proceedings and the outcome of voting on the items of business
are released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted to our website as soon as they are available following the completion of the BHP Billiton
Limited meeting.
Information relating to the 2012 AGM is available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/investors/shareholderinfo/Pages/Meetings.aspx.

5.3    Role and responsibilities of the Board
205
The Board’s role is to represent the shareholders. It is accountable to them for creating and delivering value through the effective governance of
the Group. This role requires a high-performing Board, with all Directors contributing to the Board’s collective decision-making processes.
The Board Governance Document is a statement of the practices and processes the Board has adopted to discharge its responsibilities. It
includes the processes the Board has implemented to undertake its own tasks and activities; the matters it has reserved for its own consideration
and decision-making; the authority it has delegated to the CEO, including the limits on the way in which the CEO can execute that authority; and
provides guidance on the relationship between the Board and the CEO.
The Board Governance Document also specifies the role of the Chairman, the membership of the Board and the role and conduct of Non-
executive Directors. Further information is at sections 5.4 to 5.7.
As part of our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement, the Board made high-level changes to the Board Governance Document in
FY2013. The changes reflect revisions to the corporate purpose, enhance clarity and adopt emerging market practice without impacting
accountability of roles.
The Board Governance Document is available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
Allocation of decision-making authority
The matters that the Board has specifically reserved for its decision are:
•
•
•
•
appointments to the position of CEO and approval of the appointment of executives reporting directly to the CEO;
approval of strategy and annual budgets of the Group;
determination of capital and non-capital items in accordance with the approved delegations of authority;
determination and adoption of documents (including the publication of reports and statements to shareholders) that are required by the Group’s
constitutional documents, by statute or by other external regulation.
The Board is free to alter the matters reserved for its decision, subject to the limitations imposed by the constitutional documents and the law.
The CEO is delegated authority to take all decisions and actions that further the corporate purpose of creating long-term shareholder value
through the discovery, acquisition, development and marketing of natural resources. This is subject to the limits imposed by the Board on the
CEO’s decision-making authority and set out in the Board Governance Document, and the matters the Board has specifically reserved for its
decision, including in the Group’s authorities framework. The CEO remains accountable to the Board for the authority that is delegated and for the
performance of the Group with the expectation that the CEO works in a constructive partnership with the Board. The Board monitors the decisions
and actions of the CEO and the performance of the Group to gain assurance that progress is being made towards the corporate purpose within
the limits imposed through the Group’s governance assurance framework. The Board also monitors the performance of the Group and assesses
its risk profile through its committees. Reports from each of the committees are set out in section 5.13.
The CEO is required to report regularly in a spirit of openness and trust on the progress being made by the Group. The Board and its committees
determine the information required from the CEO and any employee or

external party, including the External Auditor. Open dialogue between individual members of the Board and the CEO and other members of the
management team is encouraged to enable Directors to gain a better understanding of our Company.
Independent advice
The Board and its committees may seek advice from independent experts whenever it is considered appropriate. Individual Directors, with the
consent of the Chairman, may seek independent professional advice on any matter connected with the discharge of their responsibilities, at the
Group’s expense.
Strategic focus and review
Within this framework, at the start of the calendar year, the Board agrees its strategic focus and priorities for the year ahead. This ensures that the
work of the Board is aligned with the corporate purpose and takes into account the relevant external environment, such as the markets in which
we operate, and changes to the external and regulatory environment.
The Board also evaluates its activities on a regular basis taking into account:
•
•
•
•
matters considered by the Board (including time spent on those matters);
legal and governance requirements of the Board and its committees;
feedback from shareholders and other stakeholders;
the outcomes of its evaluation process.
The Board is satisfied that it has discharged its obligations as set out in the Board Governance Document.
Key activities during the year
BHP Billiton’s strategy to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity, geography and
market remains the foundation for creating shareholder value. To extend our track record and create a more productive and capital efficient
organisation, we have concentrated our efforts on those world-class basins where we enjoy economies of scale and a competitive advantage.
In addition to the productivity gains delivered during the period, the Group applied strict capital discipline. No major growth projects were
approved during FY2013. Our commitment to maintain a solid ‘A’ credit rating remains unchanged. Within this context, the Board approved a
range of business decisions, including:
the investment of US$520 million in the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant (LGCP) project as part of the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, located in
Victoria, Australia. This investment adds carbon dioxide removal capacity to the Longford Gas Plant which is necessary to condition production for the
Turrum offshore development project;
entering into a definitive agreement with PetroChina International Investment (Australia) Pty Ltd to sell the 8.33 per cent interest in the East Browse
Joint Venture and 20 per cent interest in the West Browse Joint Venture, located offshore Western Australia, with final proceeds from the sale of
US$1.7 billion;
the sale of the 37.76 per cent non-operated interest in Richards Bay Minerals to Rio Tinto for cash proceeds of US$1.7 billion after adjustments;
entering into a definitive agreement to sell the Pinto Valley mining operation and the associated San Manuel Arizona Railroad Company to Capstone
Mining Corporation for an aggregate cash consideration of US$650 million;
entering into a definitive agreement to sell the diamonds business, comprising the interests in the EKATI Diamond Mine and Diamonds Marketing
operations, to Harry Winston Diamond Mines Ltd with final proceeds of US$553 million;

the issuing of a two tranche €2.0 billion bond, and a two tranche £1.75 billion bond, the issuing of a five-year A$1.0 billion note under the Australian
Medium Term Note Program, the issuing of a €750 million bond and the issuing of a C$750 million bond;
the sale of the wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit in Western Australia to Cameco Corporation with final proceeds of US$430 million;
the extension of the long-term joint venture relationship with ITOCHU Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. through the investment by those two joint
venture partners of approximately US$822 million and US$720 million, respectively, in shares and loans of BHP Iron Ore (Jimblebar) Pty Ltd,
representing an eight per cent and seven per cent interest in the Jimblebar mining hub and resource;
after the year-end, an investment of US$2.0 billion to sustain operations at Escondida in Chile, by constructing a new 2,500 litre per second sea water
desalination facility;
the investment of US$2.6 billion, spread over a number of years, with annual instalments of US$800 million, to finish the excavation and lining of the
Jansen Potash project production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities.
Succession
For BHP Billiton, succession of the CEO is an ongoing process, which has worked well for over a decade. This year, Mr Kloppers retired as CEO
and Mr Mackenzie was appointed CEO from 10 May 2013.
A critical component of succession at Group Management Committee (GMC) level and below is the existence of a robust senior leadership
program that operates across multiple organisational levels to build, develop, renew, recruit and promote our leaders. While the program was
driven, during FY2013, by the CEO and President, People and Public Affairs, the Board is actively engaged and oversees President succession
and the development of the senior team. Following his appointment, Mr Mackenzie announced the new senior management team and the removal
of a layer of management to bring the operations closer to the CEO and ensure alignment between strategic and managerial leadership.
5.4    Board membership
The Board currently has 13 members, each of whom must seek re-election by shareholders annually. Of these, 12, including the Chairman, are
independent Non-executive Directors. The Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from
any business relationship or other circumstance that could materially interfere with the exercise of objective, unfettered or independent
judgement. Further information on the process for assessing independence is in section 5.9.
During the year, the composition of the Board changed with the appointment of Mr Mackenzie as CEO and Executive Director and the retirement
of Mr Kloppers from the Board.
In terms of Non-executive Directors, the Nomination and Governance Committee retains the services of external recruitment specialists to
continue to assist in the identification of potential candidates for the Board.
The Board considers that there is an appropriate balance between Executive and Non-executive Directors to promote shareholder interests and
govern the business effectively. While the Board includes a smaller number of Executive Directors than is common for UK-listed companies, its
composition is appropriate for the DLC structure and is in line with Australian-listed company practice. In addition, the Board has extensive
access to members of senior management, who frequently attend Board meetings, where they make presentations and engage in discussions
with Directors, answer questions, and provide input and perspective on their areas of responsibility. The Board also deliberates in the absence of
management at the beginning and end of each meeting, which is chaired by the Group Chairman.

The biographical details of the Directors are set out in section 4.1 of this Annual Report.
5.5    Chairman
The Chairman, Jac Nasser, is considered by the Board to be independent. He was appointed Chairman of the Group from 31 March 2010 and has
been a Non-executive Director of the Group since 6 June 2006. Mr Nasser was last re-elected at the 2012 AGMs and, in accordance with the
Group’s policy that each Director stand for election annually, will stand for re-election in 2013.
The Chairman’s role includes:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
leading the Board and ensuring that it is operating to the highest governance standards;
encouraging a culture of openness and debate to foster a high-performing and collegial team of Directors that operates effectively;
ensuring strategic issues, relevant stakeholder and shareholder views are regularly reviewed, clearly understood and underpin the work of the Board;

209
Table of Contents
The Board considers that none of Mr Nasser’s other commitments (set out in section 4.1 of this Annual Report) interfere with the discharge of his
responsibilities to the Group. The Board is satisfied that he makes sufficient time available to serve the Group effectively.
The Group does not have a Deputy Chairman, but has identified John Schubert to act as Chairman should the need arise at short notice.
5.6    Senior Independent Director
The Board has appointed John Buchanan as the Senior Independent Director of BHP Billiton Plc in accordance with the UK Corporate
Governance Code. Sir John is available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the Chairman, CEO or CFO. As
Senior Independent Director, he also provides a sounding board for the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for other Directors if necessary.
5.7    Director skills, experience and attributes
Skills, experience and attributes required
The Board considers that a diversity of skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience, geographic location, nationalities and gender is required in
order to effectively govern the business. The Board and its committees work to ensure that the Board continues to have the right balance of skills,
experience, independence and Group knowledge necessary to discharge its responsibilities in accordance with the highest standards of
governance.
In order to govern the Group effectively, Non-executive Directors must have a clear understanding of the Group’s overall strategy, together with
knowledge about the Group and the industries in which it operates. Non-executive Directors must be sufficiently familiar with the Group’s core
business to be effective contributors to the development of strategy and to monitor performance.
The Board Governance Document requires that Directors demonstrate unquestioned honesty and integrity, preparedness to question, challenge
and critique, and a willingness to understand and commit to the highest standards of governance. Directors must commit to the collective
decision-making processes of the Board. Individual Directors are required to debate issues openly and constructively, and are free to question or
challenge the opinions of others. Directors must also commit to active involvement in Board decisions and the application of strategic thought to
matters in issue. Directors must be clear communicators and good listeners who actively contribute to the Board in a collegial manner. Each
Director must ensure that no decision or action is taken that places his or her interests in front of the interests of the business.
Directors must be prepared to commit sufficient time and resources to perform their role effectively. The Nomination and Governance Committee
takes account of the other positions held by each potential Director candidate. It assesses whether they will have adequate time to devote to the
Board, prior to making a recommendation to the Board on whether to appoint them as a Director. In addition, Directors are required to consult with
the Chairman before accepting any additional commitments that could conflict with or impact on the time Directors can devote to their role.
The Nomination and Governance Committee is required to assist the Board in ensuring that the Board is comprised of high-calibre individuals
whose background, skills, experience and personal characteristics will augment the present Board and meet its future needs and diversity
aspirations.

The Board plans for its own succession, with the assistance of the Nomination and Governance Committee. In doing this, the Board:
•
•
•
•
considers the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity of geographic location, nationality and gender necessary to allow it to meet the
corporate purpose;
assesses the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity currently represented;
identifies any inadequate representation of those attributes and agrees the process necessary to ensure a candidate is selected who brings them to
the Board;
reviews how Board performance might be enhanced, both at an individual Director level and for the Board as a whole.
The Board believes that orderly succession and renewal is achieved as a result of careful planning, where the appropriate composition of the
Board is continually under review.
When considering new appointments to the Board, the Nomination and Governance Committee oversees the preparation of a position
specification that is provided to an independent recruitment organisation retained to conduct a global search. Independent search firms are
instructed to consider a wide range of candidates, including taking into account geographic location, nationality and gender. In addition to the
specific skills, knowledge and experience deemed necessary, the specification contains the criteria required by the Board Governance Document.
The Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis
upon which they will be indemnified. The letter of appointment clearly defines the role of Directors, including the expectations in terms of
independence, participation, time commitment and continuous improvement. In summary, Directors are expected to constructively challenge; set
values and standards of the Group; monitor the performance of management and of the Group; satisfy themselves as to the adequacy and
integrity of financial statements; and satisfy themselves that the systems for the identification and management of risks are robust and
appropriate. Directors are also expected to commit sufficient time to carry out their role and to participate in continuous improvement programs
and internal reviews to support ongoing development. The letter of appointment also makes it clear that Directors are required to disclose
circumstances that may affect, or be perceived to affect, their ability to exercise independent judgement so that the Board can assess
independence on a regular basis.
A copy of the terms of appointment is available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
Diversity
The Board is committed to ensuring gender diversity is actively pursued and implemented in terms of current and future Board composition.
Diversity is a core consideration in ensuring that the Board and its committees have the right balance of skills, experience, independence and
Group knowledge necessary to discharge their responsibilities. The right blend of perspectives is critical to ensuring the Board oversees BHP
Billiton effectively for shareholders.
In 2011, the Board outlined its aspirational goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three over the following two years,
having appointed Carolyn Hewson and Baroness Shriti Vadera in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The Board remains committed to this goal, and
continues to work towards it in a structured manner, looking out over a five-year period at the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and
diversity on the Board. Independent search firms in the US, UK and Australia have been retained over the last few years to specifically consider
potential female candidates. Short-listed candidates are considered by the Nomination and Governance Committee.
Table of Contents
214
Our goal is, however, unlikely to be achieved until FY2015. As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report, our immediate business imperative in
FY2012 was to appoint an additional Director with skills and experience in the oil and gas sector. The candidate search actively considered both
potential female candidates and other diversity considerations, including background, experience and culture. Ex SASOL CEO Pat Davies was
appointed to the Board in 2012, bringing specific oil and gas experience. During FY2013, we have continued to seek additional oil and gas sector
experience, given the natural succession planning of the Board. While the work of the Nomination and Governance Committee has continued, we
did not appoint any new Non-executive Directors – female or male – during the year.
The Board also considers that it is important to continue to develop the potential of women at all levels of the Company, and part of the Board’s
role is to consider and approve the Group’s measurable objectives, and oversee the Group’s progress towards these objectives. Following the
changes to the GMC, female representation has now increased to 18 per cent. Further information, in relation to the initiatives in place to address
diversity across the broader Group, and the impact they are having, is contained in section 5.17.

5.8    Director induction, training and development
The Board considers that the development of industry and Group knowledge is a continuous and ongoing process.
Upon appointment, each new Non-executive Director undertakes an induction program specifically tailored to their needs.
A copy of an indicative induction program is available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
BHP Billiton’s long-stated strategy is to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity,
geography and market. The Board’s development activity reflects this diversification through the provision of regular updates to Directors on
each of the Group’s commodities, geographies and markets.
Non-executive Directors also participate in continuous improvement programs, in accordance with their terms of appointment. Programs are
designed to maximise the effectiveness of the Directors throughout their tenure and link in with their individual Director performance evaluations.
The Training and Development Program covers a range of matters of a business nature, including environmental, social and governance matters.
Structured opportunities are provided to build knowledge through initiatives such as visits to BHP Billiton sites and briefings provided at Board
meetings. Non-executive Directors also build their Group and industry knowledge through the involvement of the GMC and other senior
employees in Board meetings.
Briefings, site visits and development sessions underpin and support the Board’s work in monitoring and overseeing progress towards the
corporate purpose. We therefore continuously build Directors’ knowledge to ensure that the Board remains up to date with developments within
our Businesses, as well as developments in the markets in which we operate.
During the year, Non-executive Directors participated in the following activities:
•
•
•
•
briefings intended to provide each Director with a deeper understanding of the activities, environment and key issues and direction of the Businesses.
These briefings are provided to the Board by senior executives, including GMC members and other team members with operational and non-
operational responsibilities. They are comprehensive briefings on the commodities, assets and markets in which we operate, including health, safety,
environment and community (HSEC), and public policy considerations. The briefings provided during FY2013 covered metallurgical coal, potash, iron
ore and next generation mining. When these briefings were combined with a site visit, they took place on-site, otherwise they took place at Board
meetings where the relevant executives joined Directors;
development sessions on specific topics of relevance, such as climate change, commodity markets, world economy, changes in corporate governance
standards, Directors’ duties and shareholder feedback;
visits to Western Australia Iron Ore; the Jansen Potash Project, Canada; the Wessels manganese mine in South Africa; and the San Juan coal mine in
New Mexico, United States, including briefings on the assets and other relevant issues, and meetings with key personnel;
addresses by external speakers, who are generally experts in their field.
Director involvement and continuous development through site visits, Business Group Risk and Audit Committee (Business Group RAC)
meetings and on-site briefings are summarised in the map on the following page.
Business Group RAC meetings take place twice yearly as part of our financial governance framework. Directors who are members of the Board’s
Risk and Audit Committee chair the Business Group RAC meetings. Further information on Business Group RACs is at section 5.13.1.
Table of Contents
217
Director site visits, on-site briefings and Business Group RAC meetings 2011-2013
The Nomination and Governance Committee oversees the Directors’ Training and Development Program, and as part of the yearly review process
the Chairman discusses development areas with each Director. Board committees in turn review and agree their training needs. The benefit of this
approach is that induction and learning opportunities can be tailored to Directors’ committee memberships, as well as the Board’s specific areas
of focus. In addition, this approach ensures a coordinated process in relation to succession planning, Board renewal, training and development
and committee composition, which are all relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee’s role in securing the supply of talent to the
Board.
In addition, each Board committee provides a standing invitation for any Non-executive Director to attend committee meetings (rather than just
limiting attendance to committee members). Committee agendas are provided to all Directors to ensure that Directors are aware of matters to be
considered by the committees, and can elect to attend meetings where appropriate.
5.9    Independence
The Board is committed to ensuring a majority of Directors are independent. The Board considers that all the current Non-executive Directors,
including the Chairman, are independent.
Process to determine independence
The Board has a policy that it uses to determine the independence of its Directors. This determination is carried out upon appointment, annually
and at any other time where the circumstances of a Director change such as to warrant reconsideration.
A copy of the policy on Independence of Directors is available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
Table of Contents
218
Under the policy, an ‘independent’ Director is one who is: ‘independent of management and any business or other relationship that could
materially interfere with the exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement by the Director or the Director’s ability to act in the best
interests of the BHP Billiton Group’.
Where a Director is considered by the Board to be independent, but is affected by circumstances that appear relevant to the Board’s assessment
of independence, the Board has undertaken to explain the reasons why it reached its conclusion. In applying the independence test, the Board
considers relationships with management, major shareholders, subsidiary and associated companies and other parties with whom the Group
transacts business against predetermined materiality thresholds, all of which are set out in the policy. A summary of the factors that may be
perceived to impact the independence of certain Directors is set out below.
Tenure
Three Directors, David Crawford, John Schubert and John Buchanan, have each served on the Board for more than nine years. Mr Crawford, Dr
Schubert and Sir John are standing for re-election at the 2013 AGMs, having each undergone a formal performance assessment.
Although Mr Crawford was first appointed to the BHP Limited Board in 1994, the Board considers that he makes a significant contribution to the
work of the Board and that his deep knowledge of the Group and broad international business experience remains especially important, in
particular in his role as Finance Committee Chairman.
Dr Schubert was first elected to the Board of BHP Limited in 2000. The Board is of the view that Dr Schubert continues to make a valuable
contribution through his role as Chairman of the Sustainability Committee, his roles on the Remuneration and Nomination and Governance
Committees, as well as to the work of the Board more broadly. Dr Schubert’s extensive experience as an executive, particularly in the international
oil industry, and subsequently as a public company director across multiple industries, adds significantly to the skills and expertise of the Board.
Sir John was first appointed to the Board (and as Senior Independent Director) in February 2003. The Board believes that he continues to act
independently in the best interests of the Group. His expertise and broad international experience materially enhance the skills and experience
profile of the Board and he continues to make a substantial contribution in his roles, as a member of the Board, Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee, a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee and as Senior Independent Director.
The Board does not believe that Mr Crawford’s, Dr Schubert’s or Sir John’s tenure materially interferes with their ability to act in the best interests
of the Group. The Board also believes that each of them has retained independence of character and judgement and has not formed associations
with management (or others) that might compromise their ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of the Group.
Retirement plan
As former Directors of BHP Limited, prior to the merger with Billiton Plc, which formed the Group in 2001, Mr Crawford and Dr Schubert
participated in a retirement plan approved by shareholders in 1989. The plan was closed on 24 October 2003. Benefits accrued to that date,
together with interest earned on the benefits, have been preserved and will be paid on retirement. The Board does not believe that the
independence of any participating Director is compromised as a result of this plan.
Relationships and associations
Lindsay Maxsted was the CEO of KPMG in Australia from 2001 until 2007. The Board considers that this prior relationship with KPMG does not
materially interfere with Mr Maxsted’s exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement, or his ability to act in the best interests of the
BHP Billiton Group. The Board has
Table of Contents
219
determined, consistent with its policy on the independence of Directors, that Mr Maxsted is independent. The Board notes in particular that:
•
•
•
at the time of his appointment to the Board, more than three years had elapsed since Mr Maxsted’s retirement from KPMG. The Director independence
rules and guidelines that apply to the Group – which are a combination of Australian, UK and US rules and guidelines – all use three years as the
benchmark ‘cooling off’ period for former audit firm partners;
Mr Maxsted has no financial (e.g. pension, retainer or advisory fee) or consulting arrangements with KPMG;
Mr Maxsted was not part of the KPMG audit practice after 1980 and, while at KPMG, was not in any way involved in, or able to influence, any audit
activity associated with BHP Billiton.
The Board considers Mr Maxsted’s financial acumen and extensive experience in the corporate restructuring field to be important in the discharge
of the Board’s responsibilities. His membership of the Board and Chairmanship of the RAC are considered by the Board to be appropriate and
desirable.
Mr Crawford was a partner of KPMG in Australia until his retirement in June 2001. He has had no commercial relationship with KPMG since that
time and the Board does not consider Mr Crawford’s independence to be compromised as a result of this association that ended more than 12
years ago.
Some of the Directors hold or previously held positions in companies with which we have commercial relationships. Those positions and
companies are set out in the Director profiles in section 4.1 of this Annual Report. The Board has assessed all of the relationships between the
Group and companies in which Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that in all cases the relationships do not interfere with the
Directors’ exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of the Group.
A specific instance is Malcolm Broomhead, who, during the year under review, was a Non-executive Director of Coates Group Holdings Pty
Limited, a company with which BHP Billiton has commercial dealings. Coates Group provides equipment hire to the mining and resources
industry (among others). Prior to and since the appointment of Mr Broomhead as a Director of BHP Billiton, the Board has assessed the
relationship between BHP Billiton and Coates Group and remained satisfied that Mr Broomhead was able to apply objective, unfettered and
independent judgement and act in the best interests of BHP Billiton. In addition, no commercial dealings with Coates Group were discussed at
Board or Board committee level. Since year-end, Mr Broomhead has stepped down from the Board of Coates Group with effect from 29 July 2013.
A second instance is David Crawford, who is an Advisory Board member for the commercial law firm Allens, which advises BHP Billiton on
specific matters from time to time but is not one of BHP Billiton’s relationship law firms. Mr Crawford’s role is as a member of the Advisory Board, a
wholly advisory body that does not have decision-making authority for Allens. The Board has assessed the relationship and remains satisfied that
Mr Crawford is independent in mind and judgement and is able to apply objective, unfettered and independent judgement and act in the best
interests of BHP Billiton. In addition, the allocation of business to Allens was not discussed at Board or Board committee level, and to the extent it
is in the future, Mr Crawford will absent himself fully from those deliberations.
Transactions during the year that amounted to related-party transactions with Directors or Director-related entities under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) are outlined in note 31 ‘Key Management Personnel’ to the financial statements.
Executive Director
The Executive Director, Andrew Mackenzie, is not considered independent because of his executive responsibilities. Mr Mackenzie’s appointment
as Chief Executive Officer was announced on 20 February 2013, and took effect from 10 May 2013. He does not hold directorships in any company
included in the ASX 100 or FTSE 100, but he previously served as Non-executive Director of Centrica Plc (from September 2005 to May 2013).
Table of Contents
Conflicts of interest
220
The UK Companies Act requires that BHP Billiton Directors avoid a situation where they have, or can have, an unauthorised direct or indirect
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests, unless approved by non-interested Directors. In accordance with the
UK Companies Act, BHP Billiton Plc’s Articles of Association allow the Directors to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate.
A procedure operates to ensure the disclosure of conflicts and for the consideration and, if appropriate, the authorisation of them by non-
conflicted Directors. The Nomination and Governance Committee supports the Board in this process, both by reviewing requests from Directors
for authorisation of situations of actual or potential conflict and making recommendations to the Board, and by regularly reviewing any situations
of actual or potential conflict that have previously been authorised by the Board, and making recommendations regarding whether the
authorisation remains appropriate. In addition, in accordance with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration in which a Director has a
material personal interest, the affected Director takes no part in decision-making.
5.10    Board evaluation
The Board is committed to transparency in determining Board membership and in assessing the performance of Directors. The Board evaluates
its performance through a combination of both internal peer and externally facilitated assessments. Contemporary performance measures are
considered an important part of this process. Directors’ performance is also measured against their individual development plans.
The Board conducts regular evaluations of its performance, the performance of its committees, the Chairman, individual Directors and the
governance processes that support the Board’s work. The Board evaluation process comprises both assessment and review, as summarised in
the diagram below. This includes analysis of how the Board and its Directors are functioning, the time spent by the Board considering matters and
whether the terms of reference of the Board committees have been met, as well as compliance with the Board Governance Document.
The assessment of the Board’s performance is conducted by focusing on individual Directors and Board committees in one year and the Board
as a whole in the following year. Our approach has been to conduct an externally facilitated review of the Board of Directors and committees at
least every two years. This year, due to the appointment of the new CEO and the changes to the management structure, the FY2013 Board
assessment was internally rather than externally facilitated. The next external review will be conducted in early FY2014. This will provide an
opportunity for the new structure to become sufficiently established for a meaningful review, while also adhering to our commitment of
continuous improvement.
In addition, each year the Board, with the assistance of the Nomination and Governance Committee, conducts a review of the performance of each
Director seeking re-election and uses the results of that review when considering whether to recommend the re-election of each Director. As the
Board has adopted a policy of annual election, this effectively means that all Directors are subject to a performance review annually should they
wish to remain on the Board.
Directors provide anonymous feedback on their peers’ performance and individual contributions to the Board, which is passed on to the relevant
Director via the Chairman. In respect of the Chairman’s performance,
Table of Contents
221
Directors provide feedback directly to either Dr Schubert or Sir John Buchanan as Senior Independent Director to be passed on anonymously to
the Chairman. External independent advisers are engaged to assist these processes, as necessary. The involvement of an independent third
party has assisted in the evaluation processes being rigorous, fair and ensuring continuous improvement in the operation of the Board and
committees, as well as the contributions of individual Directors.
Director evaluation
The evaluation of individual Directors focuses on the contribution of the Director to the work of the Board and the expectations of Directors as
specified in the Group’s governance framework. The performance of individual Directors is assessed against a range of criteria, including the
ability of the Director to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
consistently take the perspective of creating shareholder value;
contribute to the development of strategy;
understand the major risks affecting the Group;
provide clear direction to management;
contribute to Board cohesion;
commit the time required to fulfil the role and perform their responsibilities effectively;
listen to and respect the ideas of fellow Directors and members of management.
Board effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of its committees is assessed against the accountabilities set down in the Board Governance
Document and each committee’s terms of reference. Matters considered in evaluations include:
•
•
•
•
the effectiveness of discussion and debate at Board and committee meetings;
the effectiveness of the Board’s and committees’ processes and relationship with management;
the quality and timeliness of meeting agendas, Board and committee papers and secretariat support;
the composition of the Board and each committee, focusing on the blend of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Group and its
diversity, including geographic location, nationality and gender.
The process is managed by the Chairman, but feedback on the Chairman’s performance is provided to him by Dr Schubert.
Information about the performance review process for executives is set out in section 5.15.
Evaluations conducted in FY2013
During the year under review, the Board conducted a Board performance assessment, an assessment of each Director and reviewed the work and
performance of the committees in accordance with the processes outlined above, all of which were internally facilitated.
Board assessment
The internal review, conducted over three meetings, covered effectiveness of Board meetings, the nature and format of Board materials, as well as
training and development. A range of improvements to the Board’s work and effectiveness were agreed, including:
•
introducing formal strategy days to the Board program to support the discussions of strategy that currently take place between management and the
Board at each meeting;
Table of Contents
222
•
•
•
•
•
implementing an updated plan for Board engagement on strategy, execution and monitoring;
effective methods for engaging on the increasing number of Board matters considered out of session;
increased use of the committee report-out process, which is used for committee chairmen to summarise the key discussions;
new items for the training and development of Directors;
updating the format of materials provided to the Board.
The review of the Board as a whole also indicated that the Board is continuing to function effectively and in accordance with the Board
Governance Document.
Director assessment
As reported last year, an externally facilitated assessment of each Director was completed in FY2012. Therefore, the FY2013 review was internally
facilitated and the overall findings were presented to the Board and discussed. Each Director was provided with feedback on their individual and
collective contribution to the Board and its committees. This review supported the Board’s decision to endorse all retiring Directors standing for
re-election.
Committee assessment
The assessment conducted this year focused on matters assessed against terms of reference, time spent by the committees in considering
matters, quality of information received, time management and composition, the work of each committee, quality of Board and committee
interface, and compliance with corporate governance requirements. These reviews utilised an electronic survey tool provided by Lintstock and
were focused to draw out views on work, overall effectiveness, decision-making and other processes. Outcomes and recommendations from each
committee will be considered and approved by the Board prior to implementation.
In addition, as part of the process for reviewing the Board Governance Document, the opportunity was taken to review each committee’s terms of
reference to ensure the Group’s existing practices remain appropriate. A summary of the changes made to the terms of reference of each
committee is set out under the relevant committee report in section 5.13.
Enhancements following previous evaluations
Board and committee evaluations conducted in recent years have led to a number of enhancements to Board meeting processes:
Chairman’s matters: For some time, the Board has held a closed session at the end of Board meetings. An additional closed session has been
incorporated so that all Board meetings start with a closed session of all Directors (there are no members of the GMC present other than the
Executive Director and the President Governance and Group Company Secretary). This allows the Chairman to outline matters to be considered
by the Board and set the context for the meeting. It is also an opportunity for Directors to raise the items of business they believe warrant
particular attention or any other relevant issues.
Assurance items: The Board agenda provides more time for reports from the committee chairmen to the Board. This ensures that the Board is
properly and formally informed of the work of its committees and relevant committee papers are also provided to the Board. Where appropriate,
presentations made to committees are also presented to the Board during its meeting.
Training and development: Sessions are scheduled during the Board meeting program.
Closed session: Directors continue to have the opportunity to raise matters during the closed session at the end of each Board meeting, which is
attended only by the Non-executive Directors.

5.11    Board meetings and attendance
223
The Board meets as often as necessary to fulfil its role. Directors are required to allocate sufficient time to the Group to perform their
responsibilities effectively, including adequate time to prepare for Board meetings. During the reporting year, the Board met 11 times, with five of
those meetings being held in Australia, three in the United Kingdom and three in the United States. Regularly scheduled Board meetings run over
three days (including committee meetings and Director training and development sessions).
Members of the GMC and other members of senior management attended meetings of the Board by invitation. Senior managers delivered
presentations on the status and performance of our Businesses and matters reserved for the Board, including the approval of budgets, annual
financial statements and strategy.
Attendance at Board and Board committee meetings during the year ended 30 June 2013 is set out in the table below.

5.12    Director re-election
The Board has adopted a policy consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, under which all Directors must seek re-election by
shareholders annually, if they wish to remain on the Board. This policy took effect at the 2011 Annual General Meetings. It replaced the previous
system, as set out in the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc, under which Directors are
required to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at least every three years. The adoption of annual re-election reflects the Board’s
long-standing commitment that where governance principles vary across jurisdictions, the Board will adopt what it considers to be the higher of
the prevailing standards. The Board believes that annual re-election promotes and supports accountability to shareholders, and the combined
voting outcome of the BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited 2012 AGMs meant that each Director received more than 97 per cent in support of
their re-election.
Table of Contents
224
Board support for reappointment is not automatic. Directors who are seeking re-election are subject to a performance appraisal overseen by the
Nomination and Governance Committee of the Board. Annual re-election effectively means all Directors are subject to a performance appraisal
annually. The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee, makes a determination as to whether it will endorse a
retiring Director for re-election. The Board will not endorse a Director for re-election if his or her performance is not considered satisfactory. The
Board will advise shareholders in the Notice of Meeting whether or not re-election is supported.
BHP Billiton does not apply or implement a ‘no vacancy’ rule in relation to Board appointments. Accordingly, Director candidates can be elected
to the Board by ordinary resolution and are not required to out-poll an incumbent Director in order to be elected.
5.13    Board committees
The Board has established committees to assist it in exercising its authority, including monitoring the performance of the Group to gain
assurance that progress is being made towards the corporate purpose within the limits imposed by the Board.
Each of the permanent committees has terms of reference under which authority is delegated by the Board.
The terms of reference for each committee are available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
The office of the Company Secretary provides secretariat services for each of the committees. Committee meeting agendas, papers and minutes
are made available to all members of the Board. Subject to appropriate controls and the overriding scrutiny of the Board, committee chairmen are
free to use whatever resources they consider necessary to discharge their responsibilities.
Reports from each of the committees follow.
5.13.1    Risk and Audit Committee Report
Role and focus
The role of the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) is to assist the Board in monitoring the decisions and actions of the CEO and the Group and to
gain assurance that progress is being made towards the corporate purpose within the limits imposed by the Board, as set out in the Board
Governance Document. The RAC discharges its responsibilities by overseeing:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements;
the appointment, remuneration, qualifications, independence and performance of the External Auditor and the integrity of the audit process as a whole;
the plans, performance, objectivity and leadership of the internal audit function and the integrity of the internal audit process as a whole;
the effectiveness of the systems of internal controls and risk management;
the Group’s systems for compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements within the RAC’s area of responsibility;
the CEO’s compliance with the relevant CEO limits .
The role of the RAC in the context of the Board’s broader governance framework is summarised in the diagram below. Further information about
our approach to risk can be found in sections 1.7 and 5.14.

BHP Billiton governance structure – Risk and Audit Committee
The RAC met 12 times during the year. Information on meeting attendance by Committee members is included in the table in section 5.11 and
information on their qualifications is included in section 4.1.
In addition to the regular business of the year, the Committee discussed the proposals for change in the regulatory environment across the
jurisdictions in which our securities are listed. These included revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code, Financial Reporting Council
concerns about the reporting of risk and the proposals in respect of audit from the European Commission and the UK Competition Commission.
A statement in relation to tendering for external audit is set out below.
The RAC continues to monitor the debate around reform proposals in relation to the audit regime and the role of risk and audit committees from
Europe, and will continue to review and assess the Group’s response to the updated recommendations as they progress.
Business Group Risk and Audit committees
To assist management in providing the information necessary to allow the RAC to discharge its responsibilities, Business Group Risk and Audit
committees have been established, incorporating each Business, and for key functional areas such as Marketing and Treasury. These
committees, known as Business Group RACs, operate as committees of management, but are chaired by members of the RAC. The responsible
member of the GMC participates in those meetings. Business Group RACs perform an important monitoring function in the overall governance of
the Group.
Significant financial and risk matters raised at Business Group RAC meetings are reported to the RAC by the Head of Group Reporting and
Taxation and the Head of Group Risk Assessment and Assurance.

Activities undertaken during the year
Integrity of financial statements
The RAC assists the Board in assuring the integrity of the financial statements. The RAC evaluates and makes recommendations to the Board
about the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices, areas of judgement, compliance with Accounting Standards, stock exchange and
legal requirements and the results of the external audit. It reviews the half-yearly and annual financial statements and makes recommendations on
specific actions or decisions (including formal adoption of the financial statements and reports) the Board should consider in order to maintain
the integrity of the financial statements. From time to time, the Board may delegate authority to the RAC to approve the release of the statements
to the stock exchanges, shareholders and the financial community.
The CEO and CFO have certified that the 2013 financial statements present a true and fair view, in all material respects, of our financial condition
and operating results and are in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
External Auditor
The RAC manages the relationship with the External Auditor on behalf of the Board. It considers the reappointment of the External Auditor each
year, as well as remuneration and other terms of engagement, and makes a recommendation to the Board. There are no contractual obligations
that restrict the RAC’s capacity to recommend a particular firm for appointment as auditor.
The last audit tender was in 2002 at which time the Group had three external auditors following the completion of the DLC merger. The tender
resulted in KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers being appointed as joint auditors for FY2003 and a reduction in audit providers. A competitive
audit review was undertaken in 2003, which resulted in KPMG being appointed as the External Auditor by the Board on the recommendation of the
RAC.
Following the outcome of the Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on the UK Corporate Governance Code and Guidance on Audit
Committees, the Committee considered the new Code provision for tendering the external audit, including the transitional provisions of the Code.
The Committee is watching developments with keen interest given the necessity for the Group’s auditor to have international capability and reach,
and intends to keep this matter under review.
The lead audit engagement partners in both Australia and the UK have been rotated every five years. The current Australian audit engagement
partner was appointed for the FY2010 year-end, and therefore FY2014 will be his last year of involvement before transition to a new engagement
partner. The UK audit engagement partner was appointed for the FY2013 year-end, and therefore FY2017 will be his last year.
The Committee has evaluated the External Auditor’s performance and independence, as set out below.
Auditor evaluation
The RAC evaluates the performance of the External Auditor during its term of appointment against specified criteria, including delivering value to
shareholders and the Group. The RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity of the External Auditor. This review includes:
•
•
•
confirming that the External Auditor is, in its judgement, independent of the Group;
obtaining from the External Auditor an account of all relationships between the External Auditor and the Group;
monitoring the number of former employees of the External Auditor currently employed in senior positions within the Group and assessing whether
those appointments impair, or appear to impair, the External Auditor’s judgement or independence;
Table of Contents
227
•
•
•
considering whether the various relationships between the Group and the External Auditor collectively impair, or appear to impair, the External
Auditor’s judgement or independence;
determining whether the compensation of individuals employed by the External Auditor who conduct the audit is tied to the provision of non-audit
services and, if so, whether this impairs, or appears to impair, the External Auditor’s judgement or independence;
reviewing the economic importance of the Group to the External Auditor and assessing whether that importance impairs, or appears to impair, the
External Auditor’s judgement or independence.
The External Auditor also certifies its independence to the RAC.
Non-audit services
Although the External Auditor does provide some non-audit services, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor is safeguarded
through restrictions on the provision of these services. For example, certain types of non-audit service may only be undertaken by the External
Auditor with the prior approval of the RAC (as described below), while other services may not be undertaken at all, including services where the
External Auditor:
•
may be required to audit its own work;
•
•
•
participates in activities that would normally be undertaken by management;
is remunerated through a ‘success fee’ structure;
acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
The RAC has adopted a policy entitled ‘Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor’ covering the RAC’s pre-approval policies
and procedures to maintain the independence of the External Auditor.
Our policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor can be found on our website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
In addition to audit services, the External Auditor will be permitted to provide other (non-audit) services that are not, and are not perceived to be, in
conflict with the role of the External Auditor. In accordance with the requirements of the US Securities Exchange Act and guidance contained in
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Release 2004-001, certain specific activities are listed in our detailed policy which have
been ‘pre-approved’ by the RAC.
The categories of ‘pre-approved’ services are as follows:
•
•
•
•
Audit services – work that constitutes the agreed scope of the statutory audit and includes the statutory audits of the Group and its entities (including
interim reviews). The RAC will monitor the Audit services engagements and approve, if necessary, any changes in terms and conditions resulting from
changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events.
Audit-related/assurance services – work that is outside the required scope of the statutory audit, but is consistent with the role of the external statutory
auditor. This category includes work that is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of the audit or review
scope, is of an assurance or compliance nature and is work that the External Auditor must or is best placed to undertake.
Tax services – work of a tax nature that does not compromise the independence of the External Auditor.
Other advisory services – work of an advisory nature that does not compromise the independence of the External Auditor.
Table of Contents
228
Activities not listed specifically are therefore not ‘pre-approved’ and must be approved by the RAC prior to engagement, regardless of the dollar
value involved. Additionally, any engagement for other services with a value over US$100,000, even if listed as a ‘pre-approved’ service, can only
be approved by the RAC, and all engagements for other services, whether ‘pre-approved’ or not, and regardless of the dollar value involved, are
reported quarterly to the RAC.
While not specifically prohibited by our policy, any proposed non-audit engagement of the External Auditor relating to internal control (such as a
review of internal controls or assistance with implementing the regulatory requirements, including the US Securities Exchange Act) must obtain
specific prior approval from the RAC. With the exception of the external audit of the Group financial report, any engagement identified that
contains an internal control-related element is not considered to be pre-approved. In addition, while the categories shown above include a list of
certain pre-approved services, the use of the External Auditor to perform such services shall always be subject to our overriding governance
practices as articulated in the policy.
An exception can be made to the above policy where such an exception is in our interests and appropriate arrangements are put in place to
ensure the integrity and independence of the External Auditor. Any such exception requires the specific prior approval of the RAC and must be
reported to the Board. No exceptions were approved during the year ended 30 June 2013.
In addition, the RAC approved no services during the year ended 30 June 2013 pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of the SEC
Regulation S-X.
Fees paid to the Group’s External Auditor during the year for audit and other services were US$29.6 million, of which 61 per cent comprised audit
fees, 33 per cent related to legislative requirements (including Sarbanes-Oxley) and six per cent was for other services. Details of the fees paid are
set out in note 35 ‘Auditor’s remuneration’ to the financial statements.
Based on the review by the RAC, the Board is satisfied that the External Auditor is independent.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function is carried out internally by Group Risk Assessment and Assurance (RAA). The role of RAA is to determine whether risk
management, control and governance processes are adequate and functioning. The Internal Audit function is independent of the External
Auditor. The RAC reviews the mission and charter of RAA, the staffing levels and its scope of work to ensure that it is appropriate in light of the
key risks we face. It also reviews and approves the annual internal audit plan.
The RAC also approves the appointment and dismissal of the Head of Group Risk Assessment and Assurance and assesses his or her
performance, independence and objectivity. The role of the Head of Group Risk Assessment and Assurance includes achievement of the internal
audit objectives, risk management policies and insurance strategy. The position was held throughout the year by Stefano Giorgini. Mr Giorgini
reported to senior management and had all necessary access to management and the RAC. Following a decision to appoint Mr Giorgini to a line
management role in the Group, the Committee appointed Alistair Mytton as Head of Group Risk Assessment and Assurance, effective from
FY2014. Mr Mytton was formerly Vice President, Finance in BHP Billiton.
Effectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management
In delegating authority to the CEO, the Board has established CEO limits set out in the Board Governance Document. Limits on the CEO’s
authority require the CEO to ensure that there is a system of control in place for identifying and managing risk in the Group. The Directors,
through the RAC, review the systems that have been established for this purpose and regularly review their effectiveness. These reviews include
assessing whether processes continue to meet evolving external governance requirements.
Table of Contents
229
The RAC is responsible for the oversight of risk management and reviews the internal controls and risk management systems. In undertaking this
role, the RAC reviews the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
procedures for identifying business and operational risks and controlling their financial impact on the Group and the operational effectiveness of the
policies and procedures related to risk and control;
budgeting and forecasting systems, financial reporting systems and controls;
policies and practices put in place by the CEO for detecting, reporting and preventing fraud and serious breaches of business conduct and whistle-
blowing procedures;
procedures for ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory and legal requirements;
arrangements for protecting intellectual property and other non-physical assets;
operational effectiveness of the Business Group RAC structures;
overseeing the adequacy of the internal controls and allocation of responsibilities for monitoring internal financial controls.
For further discussion on our approach to risk management, refer to sections 1.7 and 5.14.
During the year, the Board conducted reviews of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk management and internal controls for the
financial year and up to the date of this Annual Report in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (including the Turnbull Guidance)
and the Principles and Recommendations published by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Corporate Governance Council. These reviews
covered financial, operational and compliance controls and risk assessment. During the year, management presented an assessment of the
material business risks facing the Group and the level of effectiveness of risk management over the material business risks. The reviews were
overseen by the RAC, with findings and recommendations reported to the Board. In addition to considering key risks facing the Group, the Board
received an assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over key risks identified through the work of the Board committees. The Board is
satisfied that the effectiveness of the internal controls has been properly reviewed.
Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
CEO and CFO, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria
established in Internal Controls – Integrated Framework, issued by the Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 30 June 2013. There were no material
weaknesses in the Group’s internal controls over financial reporting identified by management.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined
to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
BHP Billiton has engaged our independent registered public accounting firms, KPMG and KPMG Audit Plc to issue an audit report on our internal
control over financial reporting for inclusion in the financial statements section of our Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during FY2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Table of Contents
230
The CEO and CFO have certified to the Board that the financial statements are founded on a sound system of risk management and internal
control and that the system is operating efficiently and effectively in all material respects.
During the year, the RAC reviewed our compliance with the obligations imposed by the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including evaluating and
documenting internal controls as required by section 404 of the Act.
Management’s assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of 30 June 2013. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed by BHP Billiton, including in the reports that it files or submits under
the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarised and reported on a timely basis and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to BHP Billiton’s management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on the foregoing, our management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in providing that reasonable assurance.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error
and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only
provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management was necessarily required to apply its
judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Committee review
The assessment of the RAC conducted this year focused on matters assessed against its terms of reference, time spent by the Committee in
considering matters, quality of information received, time management and composition, the work of the Committee, quality of interface between
Board and the Committee, and compliance with corporate governance requirements. The review utilised electronic surveys and was focused to
draw out views on work, processes and overall effectiveness. Outcomes and recommendations from the review will be considered and approved
by the Board prior to implementation.
Terms of reference review
The opportunity was also taken to review the terms of reference for the RAC, to ensure the Group’s existing practices remain appropriate. While
the terms of reference remained fit for purpose, it was considered prudent to update them to take account of our existing practices that have
developed since the last substantive review of the terms of reference, including in relation to Committee report-outs to the Board; more closely
reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code and the ASX recommendations, while still taking into account the relevant US rules; and streamline
and re-order some of the material to improve the structure and readability of the document.
The updated terms of reference for the RAC are available online at

The opportunity was also taken to review the terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee, to ensure the Group’s existing practices remain
appropriate. While the terms of reference for the Committee remained fit for purpose, it was considered prudent to update them to take account of
changes to the external corporate governance environment; for example, by including the new New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) / Dodd Frank
requirement to consider certain independence factors in relation to remuneration advisers; take account of changes to our own governance
practices, including in relation to Committee report-outs to the Board; and streamline and re-order some of the material to improve the structure
and readability of the document.

5.13.3    Nomination and Governance Committee Report
Role and focus
The role of the Nomination and Governance Committee is to assist in ensuring that the Board comprises individuals who are best able to
discharge the responsibilities of a Director, having regard to the highest standards of governance, the strategic direction of the Group and the
diversity aspirations of the Board. It does so by focusing on:
•
•
•
the succession planning process for the Board and its committees including the identification of the skills, experience, independence and knowledge
required on the Board, as well as the attributes required of potential Directors;
the identification of suitable candidates for appointment to the Board, taking into account the skills, experience and diversity required on the Board, and
the attributes required of Directors;
the succession planning process for the Chairman;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the succession planning process for the Chief Executive Officer and periodic evaluation of the process;
Board and Director performance evaluation, including evaluation of Directors seeking re-election prior to their endorsement by the Board (see section
5.12);
the provision of appropriate training and development opportunities for Directors;
the independence of Non-executive Directors;
the time required from Non-executive Directors;
the authorisation of situations of actual and potential conflict notified by Directors in accordance with the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc (see
section 5.9);
the Group’s corporate governance practices;
the preparation of a report by the Committee to be included in the Annual Report.
The Board outlined its aspirational goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three. While we have not appointed any new
Non-executive Directors during the year, we remain committed to achieving this target. The Nomination and Governance Committee continues to
take diversity into account in its deliberations and works continuously to identify future candidates for the Board.
Information regarding the Board’s policy on diversity and the Committee’s role in this regard is set out in sections 5.7 and 5.17.
The Nomination and Governance Committee also has oversight of training and development activity for all Directors. The Board believes this
enhances the Committee’s ongoing consideration and review in relation to the appropriate skills mix for the Board.

There were changes to the composition of the Board during the year with the appointment of Mr Mackenzie as CEO with effect from 10 May 2013
and the retirement of Mr Kloppers from the Board. Further details relating to the succession process are set out in section 5.3. The Nomination
and Governance Committee retained the services of external recruitment specialists, Heidrick & Struggles, to continue to assist in the
identification of potential candidates for the Board and remains committed to the target set for Board diversity as set out in more detail in section
5.7.
The Nomination and Governance Committee also oversaw the Director Training and Development Program for FY2013.

Terms of reference review
The opportunity was also taken to review the terms of reference for the Nomination and Governance Committee, to ensure the Group’s existing
practices remain appropriate. Key changes that were made as part of the update
Table of Contents
234
were to add a new section extending the role of the Committee to cover the Group’s Corporate Governance practices and changing its name to
the Nomination and Governance Committee; take account of changes to our own governance practices, including in relation to Committee report-
outs to the Board; and streamline and re-order some of the material to improve the structure and readability of the document.
The changes relating to the Group’s Corporate Governance practices include formal recognition of the Nomination and Governance Committee’s
role in reviewing and recommending the Corporate Governance Statement for the Board’s approval; advising the Board on applicable
governance requirements; recommending the appropriate explanation for departures from ‘comply or explain’ standards; advising the Board
periodically with respect to significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance; and making recommendations to the Board
on all matters of corporate governance, including any proposed changes to existing structures or practices. These amendments mean that the
terms of reference for the Nomination and Governance Committee now meet the requirements of Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual
followed by US companies, in that it includes the purpose for developing and recommending to the Board a set of Corporate Governance
principles applicable to the Company. This reflects the Board’s commitment to continuous review.

www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
5.13.4    Sustainability Committee Report
Role and focus
The role of the Sustainability Committee is to assist the Board to take reasonable steps in overseeing the:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
adequacy of the Group’s HSEC framework, which consists of:
the CEO limits, which delegate authority to the CEO, including for HSEC matters;
the Committee itself and its terms of reference;
a robust independent assurance and audit process, established by the RAC;
independent legal and specialist advice on HSEC matters;
the Group’s HSEC Management System;
adequacy of the Group’s HSEC Management System, which is designed and implemented by management. It incorporates the systems and
processes, resources, structures and performance standards for the day-to-day identification, management and reporting of HSEC risks and
obligations, which are articulated in Group Level Documents;
Group’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements associated with HSEC matters;
Annual Sustainability Report;
performance, resourcing and leadership of the HSEC function;
Group’s performance in relation to HSEC matters, including the HSEC component of the GMC scorecard.
Our approach to sustainability is reflected in Our Charter, which defines our values, purpose and how we measure success, and in our
sustainability performance targets, which define our public commitments to safety, health and environmental and social responsibility. Further
information is set out in the Group’s Sustainability Report. The Committee provides oversight of the preparation and presentation of the
Sustainability Report by management, including oversight of internal control systems relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Report.
Table of Contents
235
The role of the Sustainability Committee in the context of BHP Billiton’s broader governance framework is summarised in the diagram below.
BHP Billiton governance structure – Sustainability Committee
Sustainable development governance
Our approach to HSEC and sustainable development governance is characterised by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the Sustainability Committee overseeing material HSEC matters and risks across the Group;
management having primary responsibility for the design and implementation of an effective HSEC management system;
management having accountability for HSEC performance;
the HSEC function providing advice and guidance directly, as well as through a series of networks across the Group;
seeking input and insight from external experts such as our Forum for Corporate Responsibility;
clear links between remuneration and HSEC performance.
The Sustainability Committee met seven times during the year. Information on meeting attendance by Committee members is included in the table
in section 5.11.
During the year, the Sustainability Committee continued to assist the Board in its oversight of HSEC issues and performance. This included
consideration of strategic environmental and community issues, HSEC audits and trends, and the findings and action items from accidents and
other incidents.
Table of Contents
236
The key areas on which the Committee, management and the HSEC function focus are outlined in the diagram below.
In addition to our focus on the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, the Committee spent considerable time considering environment and
climate change scenarios and the actions being taken to manage the implications of climate change regulation, in light of the Group’s public
target for emissions through to FY2017 as set out in section 2.8.8 of this Annual Report.
We also continued to monitor our progress in relation to our community contribution and met our target for investments in community programs,
with such investments consisting of cash, in-kind support and administration. This was the equivalent of one per cent of our pre-tax profits,
calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit. In total, we invested US$245.8 million in community programs, including
US$106 million contributed to the BHP Billiton Foundation.
The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the approval of the annual Sustainability Report for publication. The Sustainability
Report identifies our targets for HSEC matters and our performance against those targets, with an emphasis on fact-based measurement and
quality data in setting targets. The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the public targets for FY2013 – FY2017.
In order to link HSEC matters to remuneration, 15 per cent of the short-term incentive opportunity for GMC members was based on HSEC
performance during the year. For FY2014 performance, the weighting of this metric will move to 20 per cent. The Sustainability Committee assists
the Remuneration Committee in determining appropriate HSEC metrics to be included in GMC scorecards, and also assists in relation to
assessment of performance against those measures. The Board believes this method of assessment is transparent, rigorous and balanced, and
provides an appropriate, objective and comprehensive assessment of performance. Further information on the metrics and their assessment is
set out in the Remuneration Report.
In addition, during the year, the Committee considered Directors’ duties under the Australian Model Work Health and Safety legislative reforms.
The current approach taken by the Board, the Committee and GMC allows Directors and Officers of the Group to meet the due diligence
requirements.

management) having regard to the due diligence obligations specified in the Australian Model Work Health and Safety legislative reforms; and to
ensure that the nature and form of material and advice to be presented for consideration by the Committee is clear and referable to the terms of
reference and obligations of the Directors.

www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
5.13.5    Finance Committee Report
Role and focus
The role of the Finance Committee is to assist the Board in its consideration for approval and ongoing oversight of matters pertaining to:
•
•
•
•
capital structure and funding;
capital management planning and initiatives, including capital allocation;
due diligence on acquisitions and investments, including proposals that may have a material impact on the Group’s capital position;
matters the Board may refer to the Committee from time to time in connection with the Group’s capital position.
Upon its establishment in April 2012, the Board made a commitment to evaluate the role and function of the Finance Committee 12 months after its
formation. In the past year, the Committee has focused on capital structure, funding, capital management planning and due diligence on
divestments, including the Yeelirrie uranium deposit, EKATI Diamond Mine, the interest in the West Browse Joint Venture, the Pinto Valley copper
mine and the extension of the long-term joint venture relationship at the Jimblebar iron ore mine. Given our continued focus on capital
management, the Board believes that the Committee adds value to the governance of the Group and should continue to operate under its terms of
reference. Recognising that the focus of the Committee’s activities encompasses matters of strategy reserved for the Board, the Committee does
not, as a matter of course, have a decision-making role. Instead, its focus is to advise the Board and make recommendations. The Board may,
where it considers it appropriate, delegate decision-making power to the Committee in relation to specific matters.
The Board recognised that in establishing a new Board committee, it is important to avoid introducing complexity or overlap in the current
governance framework. The matters specified for the consideration of the Finance Committee are not within the current scope or mandate of any
of the other Board committees (because they were previously dealt with by ad-hoc committees). However, to avoid any perceived overlap of
238
Table of Contents
responsibilities, the terms of reference of each of the Finance Committee and the Risk and Audit Committee allow the respective committee
chairmen to agree the most appropriate committee to fulfil the obligation in question. The role of the Finance Committee in the context of BHP
Billiton’s broader governance framework is summarised in the diagram below.
BHP Billiton governance structure – Finance Committee
The Committee met 11 times during the year. Information on meeting attendance by Committee members is included in the table in section 5.11.
During the year, the Finance Committee continued to assist the work of the Board by considering matters relating to capital structure and funding,
capital management planning and initiatives, capital expenditure prioritisation, divestments and other matters referred to the Committee. The
Committee’s considerations resulted in recommendations to the Board on the matters considered.

Terms of reference review
The opportunity was also taken to review the terms of reference for the Finance Committee, to ensure the Group’s existing practices remain
appropriate. While the terms of reference for the Committee were adopted in 2012, and remained fit for purpose, it was considered prudent to
conduct a detailed review. A clause relating to
Table of Contents

capital allocation was specifically added reflecting the work of the Finance Committee. Other changes were made to harmonise clauses in the
meetings’ procedures section with the RAC’s terms of reference.
The updated terms of reference for the Finance Committee are available online at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
5.14    Risk management governance structure
We believe that the identification and management of risk is central to achieving the corporate purpose of creating long-term shareholder value.
Our approach to risk is set out in section 1.7.
The principal aim of the Group’s risk management governance structure and internal control systems is to identify, evaluate and manage
business risks, with a view to enhancing the value of shareholders’ investments and safeguarding assets.
Each year, the Board reviews and considers the risk profile for the whole Group. This risk profile covers both operational and strategic risks. The
risk profile is assessed to ensure it supports the achievement of the Group’s strategy while maintaining a solid ‘A’ credit rating.
The Board has delegated the oversight of risk management to the RAC, although the Board retains overall accountability for the Group’s risk
profile. In addition, the Board specifically requires the CEO to implement a system of control for identifying and managing risk. The Directors,
through the RAC, review the systems that have been established for this purpose and regularly review their effectiveness. The RAC regularly
reports to the Board to enable it to review the Group’s risk framework.
The RAC has established review processes for the nature and extent of material risks taken in achieving our corporate purpose. These processes
include the application of materiality and tolerance criteria to determine and assess material risks. Materiality criteria include maximum foreseeable
loss and residual risk thresholds and are set at Group, Business and Asset organisational levels. Tolerance criteria additionally assess the control
effectiveness of material risks.
The diagram below outlines the risk reporting process.
Management has put in place a number of key policies, processes, performance requirements and independent controls to provide assurance to
the Board and the RAC as to the integrity of our reporting and effectiveness of our systems of internal control and risk management. Some of the
more significant internal control systems include Board and management committees, Business Group RACs and internal audit.
Table of Contents
240
Business Group Risk and Audit Committees
The Business Group RACs assist the RAC to monitor the Group’s obligations in relation to financial reporting, internal control structure, risk
management processes and the internal and external audit functions.
Board committees
Directors also monitor risks and controls through the RAC, the Remuneration Committee and the Sustainability Committee.
Management committees
Management committees also perform roles in relation to risk and control. Strategic risks and opportunities arising from changes in our business
environment are regularly reviewed by the GMC and discussed by the Board. The Financial Risk Management Committee (FRMC) reviews the
effectiveness of internal controls relating to commodity price risk, counterparty credit risk, currency risk, financing risk, interest rate risk and
insurance. Minutes of the GMC and the FRMC meetings are provided to the Board. The Investment Committee provides oversight for investment
processes across the Company and coordinates the investment toll-gating process for major investments. Reports are made to the Board on
findings by the Investment Committee in relation to major capital projects. The Disclosure Committee oversees the Group’s compliance with
securities dealing and continuous and periodic disclosure requirements, including reviewing information that may require disclosure through
stock exchanges and overseeing processes to ensure information disclosed is timely, accurate and complete.
5.15    Management
Below the level of the Board, key management decisions are made by the CEO, the GMC, other management committees and individual members
of management to whom authority has been delegated.
Following the appointment of Andrew Mackenzie as CEO, a new senior management team was announced, effective from 10 May 2013. Following
the changes, Mike Henry, Graham Kerr and Karen Wood remain as GMC members ensuring a strong balance of existing and new membership of
the team, and both Mr Henry and Mr Kerr have assumed enhanced responsibilities. The new GMC also has a strong emphasis on functional
excellence with the addition of two roles. Geoff Healy, formerly a partner of Herbert Smith Freehills, joined the GMC as Chief Legal Counsel and
Jane McAloon joined as President, Governance and Group Company Secretary.
On 27 August Mike Fraser was appointed to the GMC as President, Human Resources: part of the role previously held by Karen Wood, who
remains a member of the GMC as President, Public Affairs. Having completed the transition activities associated with the appointment of Andrew
Mackenzie as CEO she continues to assist Andrew on a range of specific corporate and Board issues including, development and succession
and executive remuneration.
The GMC now comprises:
Chief Executive Officer: Andrew Mackenzie
President, Copper: Peter Beaven
President, Petroleum and Potash: Tim Cutt
President, Coal: Dean Dalla Valle
President, Human Resources: Mike Fraser
Chief Legal Counsel: Geoff Healy
President, HSEC, Marketing and Technology: Mike Henry

The diagram below describes the responsibilities of the CEO and four key management committees.
Performance evaluation for executives
The performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed on an annual basis. For the members of the GMC, this review includes
their contribution, engagement and interaction at Board level. The annual performance review process that we employ considers the performance
of executives against criteria designed to capture both ‘what’ is achieved and ‘how’ it is achieved. All performance assessments of executives
consider
Table of Contents
242
how effective they have been in undertaking their role; what they have achieved against their specified key performance indicators; how they
match up to the behaviours prescribed in our leadership model and how those behaviours align with Our Charter values. The assessment is
therefore holistic and balances absolute achievement with the way performance has been delivered. Progression within the Group is driven
equally by personal leadership behaviours and capability to produce excellent results.
A performance evaluation as outlined above is conducted for all members of the GMC annually. For the CEO, the performance evaluation is led by
the Chairman of the Board on behalf of all the Non-executive Directors, drawing on guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
5.16    Business conduct
Code of Business Conduct
We have published the Code of Business Conduct, which reflects Our Charter values of Integrity and Respect. It provides clear direction and
advice on conducting business internationally, interacting with communities, governments and business partners and general workplace
behaviour. The Code of Business Conduct applies to Directors and to all employees, regardless of their position or location. Consultants and
contractors are also expected to act in accordance with the Code of Business Conduct.
The Code of Business Conduct can be found on our website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/codeofbusconduct.aspx.
Anti-corruption investigation
Following requests for information in August 2009 from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Group commenced an internal
investigation and disclosed to relevant authorities including the US Department of Justice (DOJ), evidence that it has uncovered regarding
possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws involving interactions with government officials.
As has been publicly reported, the Australian Federal Police has indicated that it has commenced an investigation. The Group is fully cooperating
with the relevant authorities as it has since the US investigations commenced.
As part of the US process, the SEC and DOJ notified the Group in August 2013 of the issues they consider could form the basis of enforcement
actions, and discussions are continuing.
The issues relate primarily to matters in connection with previously terminated exploration and development efforts, as well as hospitality
provided as part of the Company’s sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
In light of the continuing nature of the investigations, it is not appropriate at this stage for BHP Billiton to predict outcomes.
BHP Billiton is fully committed to operating with integrity, and the Group’s policies specifically prohibit engaging in unethical conduct. BHP
Billiton has what it considers to be a world-class anti-corruption compliance program.
Insider trading
We have a Securities Dealing Group Level Document (GLD) that covers dealings by Directors and identified employees, is consistent with the UK
Model Code contained in the UK Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules and complies with the ASX Listing Rule requirements for a trading
policy. The Securities Dealing GLD restricts dealings by Directors and identified employees in shares and other securities during designated
Table of Contents
243
prohibited periods and at any time that they are in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information. As part of a regular, planned process,
the Securities Dealing GLD is reviewed every two years to ensure it remains current, fit for purpose and in line with our broader governance
framework.
A copy of the Securities Dealing GLD can be found on our website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
Business Conduct Advisory Service
We have established a Business Conduct Advisory Service so that employees, contractors or members of the community can seek guidance or
express concerns on how we work with fellow employees, governments, communities, third parties or how we use our Company resources.
Reports can be made anonymously and without fear of retaliation. Arrangements are in place to investigate such matters. Where appropriate,
investigations are conducted independently. Levels of activity and support processes for the Business Conduct Advisory Service are monitored,
with activity reports presented to the Board. Further information on the Business Conduct Advisory Service can be found in the Code of Business
Conduct.
Political donations
We maintain a position of impartiality with respect to party politics and do not make political contributions/donations for political purposes to any
political party, politician, elected official or candidate for public office. We do however, contribute to the public debate of policy issues that may
affect the Company in the countries in which we operate.
5.17    Diversity and inclusion at BHP Billiton
Our BHP Billiton Charter and Human Resources Group Level Documents (GLDs) guide management on all aspects of human resource
management, including diversity and inclusion. Underpinning the GLDs and supporting the achievement of diversity across the Group are
principles and measurable objectives that define our approach to diversity and our focus on creating an inclusive work environment. The Board
believes that critical mass is important for diversity and, in relation to gender, has set a goal of increasing the number of women on the Board. See
section 5.7 for further details. Part of the Board’s role is to consider and approve the Group’s measurable objectives for each financial year, and to
oversee the Group’s progress in achieving those objectives. Further information is set out below.
Our approach to diversity and inclusion is underpinned by key principles, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are necessary to the delivery of our strategy that is predicated on diversification by commodity,
geography and market;
our aspiration is to have a workforce that best represents the communities in which our assets are located and our employees live;
actions that support our diversity objectives should be consistent with our established approach to talent, performance and reward;
achieving an appropriate level of diversity will require structured programs at an early career stage that ensure the development of necessary skills
and experience for leadership roles;
measurable objectives in support of diversity will be transparent, achievable over a period of time and fit for purpose; and
the set of measurable objectives will focus on (i) enabling a diverse workforce by way of removing barriers and (ii) establishing appropriate
representation targets.
Table of Contents
Progress against measurable objectives
244
In FY2013, we committed to three key measurable objectives to enhance our gender diversity profile. A summary of those objectives and a report
of our progress are set out below.
•
•
Embed diversity and inclusion in the behaviours that demonstrate Our Charter values through Our Charter Values in Action. Employees will be
assessed on how they demonstrate Our Charter Values in Action as part of the annual performance review process. Achievements during this
reporting period include:
•
•
•
Our Charter Values in Action are the behaviours we expect all employees at BHP Billiton to demonstrate. They were successfully developed
and launched to the organisation and are a critical part of the performance review process.
Specific behaviours supporting diversity and creating a collaborative and inclusive work environment are featured in Our Charter Values in
Action.
Employees are assessed on Our Charter Values in Action and provided with feedback and coaching. Performance on Our Charter Values in
Action is factored into performance ratings, which link to bonus remuneration.
Implement targeted graduate attraction initiatives, focused on specific disciplines, to increase the proportion of female graduates hired year-on-year.
This objective builds on our 2011 commitment, where we reviewed our graduate recruitment process and implemented actions to address low female
representation. The following highlights examples of work executed during this reporting period to increase female graduate intake representation:
•
The Australian Graduate Intake Recruitment campaign incorporated a number of new initiatives to attract female graduates. These initiatives
had a specific focus on core disciplines. Some examples are targeted digital media advertising; active promotion of graduate opportunities
directly with university faculties; and featuring graduate opportunities for women in our marketing materials, industry events and engagement
activities.
•
As a result, female representation in the graduate program, as a percentage of intake, increased in the Australasia, North America and Asia
regions.
Each Business, Group Function and Marketing will continue to be evaluated on progress in executing its measurable objectives that form part of its
multi-year diversity plan. These will again be taken into account in determining bonus remuneration. Monitoring and tracking performance against
diversity plans will continue to be undertaken as part of the Group’s internal compliance requirements. The performance of each Business, Group
Function and Marketing was evaluated against its FY2013 measurable objectives, which was taken into account in determining bonus remuneration.
The following highlights are examples of work that were delivered during the reporting period:
•
•
•
•
•
Specific actions were executed to increase representation of Indigenous employees. These included direct employment and the development of
a long-term approach to provide them with the training and qualifications to broaden their overall employment opportunities.
Business leaders championed diversity and inclusion activities from their Business plans and facilitated awareness discussions within their
teams. As champions, their involvement included sponsorship of a number of awareness events hosted by Business partners and universities.
Diversity and Inclusion Councils comprised of senior Business leaders were constituted. The Councils endorsed diversity and inclusion plans
and objectives and supported the execution.
Learning sessions on unconscious bias and diversity and inclusion were delivered. These were facilitated via specific workshops or through
existing development and employee induction programs.
The diversity of the successor pipeline for senior roles was reviewed as part of the talent management process.

Development plans were created for all high-potential female and ethnically diverse talent. As part of this, leader-led mentoring relationships
were successfully established.
Targeted sourcing strategies successfully attracted female and ethnically diverse employees.
A range of different flexible work arrangements were launched with positive reception from employees.
Employees’ perspectives were consulted through surveys, focus group and interviews. Insights continue to help inform areas of work in diversity
and inclusion.
Continuous improvement
In FY2014, we will take the following steps to further enhance our gender and diversity profile:
•
•
each Business, Group Function and Marketing will continue to be evaluated on progress in executing the measurable objectives that form part of its
multi-year diversity and inclusion plan;
increase female representation by one in each asset and operations’ leadership team by end of FY2015 (where the Business leadership team
comprises less than 50 per cent females);
•
•
•
•
execute the diversity and inclusion strategy and actions approved by the GMC;
develop recommendations for providing childcare options and flexible work arrangements;
increase the proportion of female and Indigenous graduates hired and retained year-on-year; and
maintain at least 30 per cent female participation in our Accelerated Leadership Development Program (ALDP).
Successful completion of these objectives will again be taken into account in determining bonus remuneration. Monitoring and tracking
performance will continue to be undertaken as part of the Group’s internal compliance requirements.
Progress against each year’s measurable objectives will continue to be disclosed in the Annual Report, along with the proportion of women in our
workforce, in senior management positions and on the Board. There are currently two women on the Board, and the proportion of women in our
workforce and in senior management positions is set out in section 2.9, which also contains further information on diversity and our employee
profile more generally.
5.18    Market disclosure
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of disclosure ensuring that all investors and potential investors have the same access to
high-quality, relevant information in an accessible and timely manner to assist them in making informed decisions. The Disclosure Committee
manages our compliance with market disclosure obligations and is responsible for implementing reporting processes and controls and setting
guidelines for the release of information. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement and in line with the updated guidance on
continuous disclosure that was issued by the ASX and came into effect on 1 May 2013, our disclosure processes were reviewed and updated
during the year to ensure continued alignment with best practice as it develops in the jurisdictions in which we are listed.
Disclosure officers have been appointed in the Group’s Businesses, Group Functions and Marketing. These officers are responsible for
identifying and providing the Disclosure Committee with material information about the activities of the Business or functional areas using
disclosure guidelines developed by the Committee.

5.19    Remuneration
Details of our remuneration policies and practices and the remuneration paid to the Directors (Executive and Non-executive) and members of the
GMC are set out in the Remuneration Report in section 6 of this Annual Report. Shareholders will be invited to consider and to approve the
Remuneration Report at the 2013 AGMs. The Australian Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules prohibit Directors and members of the GMC
from voting on various resolutions relating to Key Management Personnel (KMP) remuneration – including, for example, the adoption of the
Remuneration Report, an increase in the maximum aggregate remuneration payable to the Non-executive Directors and the grant of equity to the
Executive Director.
5.20    Directors’ share ownership
Non-executive Directors have agreed to apply at least 25 per cent of their remuneration to the purchase of BHP Billiton shares until they achieve a
shareholding equivalent in value to one year’s remuneration. Thereafter, they must maintain at least that level of shareholding throughout their
tenure. All dealings by Directors are subject to the Group’s Securities Dealing GLD and are reported to the Board and to the stock exchanges.
Information on our policy governing the use of hedge arrangements over shares in BHP Billiton by both Directors and members of the GMC is set
out in section 6.2.4 of this Annual Report.
Details of the shares held by Directors are set out in section 7.19 of this Annual Report.
5.21    Company secretaries
Jane McAloon is the President, Governance and Group Company Secretary. Ms McAloon’s qualifications and experience are set out in section
4.1. The Group Company Secretary is responsible for developing and maintaining the information systems and processes that enable the Board
to fulfil its role. The Group Company Secretary is also responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and
advising the Board on governance matters. All Directors have access to the Group Company Secretary for advice and services. Independent
advisory services are retained by the Group Company Secretary at the request of the Board or Board committees. Ms McAloon is supported by
Nicola Kleynhans, Deputy Company Secretary of BHP Billiton Limited, Nicole Duncan, Company Secretary BHP Billiton Limited, and Elizabeth
Hobley and Geof Stapledon, who are Deputy Company Secretaries of BHP Billiton Plc. The Board appoints and removes the Company
Secretaries.
5.22    Conformance with corporate governance standards
Our compliance with the governance standards in our home jurisdictions of Australia and the United Kingdom, and with the governance
requirements that apply to us as a result of our NYSE listing and our registration with the SEC in the United States, is summarised in this
Corporate Governance Statement, the Remuneration Report, the Directors’ Report and the financial statements.

The Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority require UK-listed companies to report on
the extent to which they comply with the Main Principles and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (UK Code), and explain the
reasons for any non-compliance. The UK Code is available online at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
The Listing Rules of the ASX require Australian-listed companies to report on the extent to which they meet the Corporate Governance Principles
and Recommendations published by the ASX Corporate Governance Council (ASX Principles and Recommendations) and explain the reasons
for any non-compliance. The ASX Principles and Recommendations are available online at www.asxgroup.com.au/corporate-governance-
council.htm.
Both the UK Code and the ASX Principles and Recommendations require the Board to consider the application of the relevant corporate
governance principles, while recognising that departures from those principles are appropriate in some circumstances. We complied with the
provisions set out in the UK Code and with the ASX Principles and Recommendations during the financial period and continue to comply up to
the date of this Annual Report.
A checklist summarising our compliance with the UK Code and the ASX Principles and Recommendations can be found on our website at
www.bhpbilliton.com/home/aboutus/ourcompany/Pages/governance.aspx.
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc are registrants with the SEC in the United States. Both companies are classified as foreign private
issuers and both have American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE.
We have reviewed the governance requirements currently applicable to foreign private issuers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US), including the
rules promulgated by the SEC and the rules of the NYSE and are satisfied that we comply with those requirements.
Section 303A of the NYSE-Listed Company Manual contains a broad regime of corporate governance requirements for NYSE-listed companies.
Under the NYSE rules, foreign private issuers, such as ourselves, are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the requirements of
Section 303A, except for the rule relating to compliance with Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (audit committee
independence) and certain notification provisions contained in Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual. Section 303A.11 of the Listed
Company Manual, however, requires us to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed
by US companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. Following a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the
requirements of Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual followed by US companies, the following significant difference was identified:
•
Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure that their audit committees are directly responsible
for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the external auditor unless the company’s governing law or documents or
other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters. While the RAC is directly
responsible for remuneration and oversight of the External Auditor, the ultimate responsibility for appointment and retention of the External Auditor
rests with our shareholders, in accordance with UK law and our constitutional documents. The RAC does, however, make recommendations to the
Board on these matters, which are in turn reported to shareholders.
While the Board is satisfied with its level of compliance with the governance requirements in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States,
it recognises that practices and procedures can always be improved, and there is merit in continuously reviewing its own standards against those
in a variety of jurisdictions. The Board’s program of review will continue throughout the year ahead.

6    Remuneration Report
249
6.1    Annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce BHP Billiton’s Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2013.
As I reported to you in my letter last year, in 2012 we completed a comprehensive review of our senior executive remuneration structures and,
after consideration of all relevant issues, concluded that our current arrangements, including the changes to the long-term incentive plan
approved by shareholders in 2010, remain appropriate. Importantly, we believe that the arrangements continue to support our focus on
operational excellence, risk management and the execution of the Group’s strategy. As always, we will continue to seek further improvement
opportunities.
At last year’s annual general meetings, we again enjoyed a strong level of support for the Remuneration Report from shareholders, with a vote in
favour of 96 per cent. In addition, our policies and approach to providing appropriate remuneration for our senior executives have been broadly
endorsed during regular consultation sessions with shareholders. In particular, our long-term incentive plan, approved in 2004, has a five-year
performance period, still a longer period than most other companies. This remains a very important feature for the Remuneration Committee and
shareholders.
However, as the long-term incentive plan is approaching its 10-year anniversary, shareholder re-approval is required under UK governance
guidelines. Accordingly, shareholders will be asked to vote on the long-term incentive plan at this year’s annual general meetings. The plan’s
operation will continue to reflect the Committee’s unchanged commitment to the existing performance hurdle based on relative shareholder
returns, with performance measured over a five-year period. Because we are asking shareholders to re-approve the plan, we have taken the
opportunity to introduce stronger malus and clawback provisions. In our view, these provisions reflect best practice and are consistent with
feedback from our shareholders.
The Committee and the Board will continue to adopt an open-door approach to eliciting shareholders’ views so they can be factored into the
Group’s future approach.
Remuneration policy in action
Remuneration outcomes for FY2013 provide further tangible evidence of our policy in action. This year, the Remuneration Committee, with the full
support of the Board, exercised its discretion to vest fewer than the number of awards allocated under the 2008 long-term incentive plan for
members of the Group Management Committee. The decision was taken to reduce the number of awards by 35 per cent for all participants, even
though the total shareholder return of BHP Billiton once again materially exceeded its peers over the five years of the plan. In the absence of the
Committee exercising its discretion, this performance would have supported 100 per cent vesting of the awards.
This is the first time the Committee has exercised its discretion to reduce vesting under the plan. In doing so, it took into account a range of
factors, including the negative total shareholder return over the performance period that shareholders have experienced. It also considered the
total remuneration of the executives.
While the Board and Committee believe that our executive remuneration packages have contributed to the consistent and substantial financial
outperformance of the Company over many years, they also believed that some downward rebasing of the package for the incoming Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), Andrew Mackenzie, relative to that of the former CEO, was appropriate; a view supported by Andrew. The package
supports our evolving strategic priorities and does not compromise our need to motivate a high level of performance and ensures alignment with
our shareholders’ expectations.
Table of Contents
250
Consistent with this approach, the remuneration packages for other Group Management Committee members have also been rebased
downwards. Aligned with this, the Board decided again to freeze fees for Non-executive Directors, for the second consecutive year. These
outcomes represent an appropriate alignment of remuneration with the prevailing business environment.
When Mr Mackenzie joined BHP Billiton in 2008, he was granted one-off sign-on awards that were in recognition of equity awards foregone when
he left his former employer. The value and quantum of the sign-on awards was based on the value of awards forfeited and calculated by the
Committee’s independent adviser. As a result of the outperformance of BHP Billiton, all those sign-on awards would have vested this year.
However, in the circumstances, Mr Mackenzie concluded, and the Committee agreed, that the value that would have been delivered was excessive
and he has voluntarily relinquished 50,000 of those awards.
Marius Kloppers will retire from the Company on 1 October 2013 when the transition to Mr Mackenzie is complete. The terms of Mr Kloppers’
departure reflect the Group’s remuneration policy and the rules of our incentive plans as approved by shareholders. No additional payments are
being made. My fellow Non-executive Directors and I wish Marius the very best in the future.
In our quest to further improve the transparency of our reporting, we have included in this section information on the remuneration arrangements
of Mr Mackenzie and on the retirement arrangements of Mr Kloppers.
Further details of all of the remuneration aspects described below can be found in later sections of the Remuneration Report.
CEO transition – remuneration of the new CEO Andrew Mackenzie
The new CEO’s target remuneration for FY2014 is made up of:
•
•
•
•
a base salary of US$1,700,000 (an increase from Mr Mackenzie’s previous base salary of US$1,200,000; a decrease from the previous CEO base
salary of US$2,215,200);
pension of 25 per cent of base salary (a decrease from 36 per cent for Mr Mackenzie previously; a decrease from the previous CEO rate of 40 per cent);
a short-term incentive target opportunity of 160 per cent of base salary, with a maximum opportunity of 240 per cent of base salary (maximum reduced
from 320 per cent of base salary for Mr Mackenzie and for the previous CEO);
a long-term incentive award for FY2014 of 400 per cent face value of base salary (subject to shareholder approval), which is a face value of
US$6,800,000 (US$8,392,683 in FY2013 for the prior CEO).
Table of Contents
The target remuneration that will be provided to the CEO in FY2014 is set out in the table below:
251
(1)
The target remuneration for the CEO excludes one-off benefits for his relocation from the UK to Australia in FY2013 (refer section 6.4.1).
Mr Mackenzie’s actual remuneration is linked substantially to business outcomes and shareholder returns. The ‘at risk’ component of his
remuneration (comprising short-term incentives and long-term incentives) is 72 per cent of his total target remuneration (at fair value). Fixed
remuneration (base salary and pension benefits) comprises 28 per cent of the total.
Mr Mackenzie’s annual short-term incentive is at risk. The scorecard against which his performance is ordinarily assessed is made up of a number
of performance measures, including health, safety, environment and community measures, financial outcomes, capital spend and schedule and
performance against personal measures. The minimum short-term incentive is zero, as was the outcome for Mr Mackenzie’s predecessor in
FY2012.
Mr Mackenzie’s long-term incentive is at risk. BHP Billiton’s business is long term, and decisions are made that are likely to have an impact for
many years. It is therefore important that senior executives are rewarded over the long term for long-term performance. BHP Billiton’s long-term
incentive plan measures performance over five years.
CEO transition – retirement of the former CEO Marius Kloppers
Marius Kloppers stepped down as CEO, a member of the Group Management Committee and a Director of the Company on 10 May 2013. He will
retire from BHP Billiton on 1 October 2013. The terms of Mr Kloppers’ departure reflect the Group’s remuneration policy and the rules of our
incentive arrangements as approved by shareholders.
Mr Kloppers will work through the applicable notice period, receive his base salary and pension entitlements at current rates to the date of his
retirement; namely, 1 October 2013, be entitled to the value of the pension and superannuation plans that he has accumulated over his 20 years
with the Company, together with the value of any
Table of Contents
252
accrued leave to 1 October 2013, and retain on a pro-rata basis awards granted in previous years under the long-term incentive plan. They will vest
only if the performance hurdle is met at the end of each five-year performance period (refer further below).
Mr Kloppers has been considered for a short-term incentive payment under the group incentive scheme for the year ended 30 June 2013,
assessed by the Remuneration Committee after year-end. That payment was pro-rated to reflect his period of service as CEO during the year
ended 30 June 2013 (namely, 1 July 2012 to 10 May 2013). He also participated as usual in the normal vesting of share awards in August 2013.
Mr Kloppers will not receive any financial benefit over and above those provided for within his existing contractual entitlements.
Awards granted in prior years under the long-term incentive plan that may vest in the four years after Mr Kloppers’ departure are retained on a pro-
rata basis. Under the terms of the shareholder approved plan, employees who retire are entitled to hold awards granted in prior years. However,
the number of awards is reduced to reflect the period of service in relation to each grant. Under the pro-rating rule, Mr Kloppers will retain 504,675
awards, and 412,649 awards will lapse.
Whether the 504,675 retained awards vest will depend on BHP Billiton’s relative total shareholder return performance over the five-year periods to
30 June 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. In addition, even if the performance hurdle is met, the Committee has an overriding discretion
under the plan rules to reduce the amount of awards that vest. Accordingly, the vesting outcome and the number of long-term incentive awards
that will ultimately vest are unknown at this time. The number of long-term incentive plan awards that vest cannot exceed the 504,675 awards
retained.
In this year’s Remuneration Report, we have continued to improve the clarity of the explanation of the remuneration arrangements for our CEO
and his executive team, including the early adoption of certain new UK requirements which will formally apply for the first time to next year’s
Remuneration Report. This reinforces the importance we see in seeking to explain clearly how BHP Billiton’s remuneration policies support long-
term, sustainable value creation.

What it covers
Message from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in regard
to significant decisions and changes throughout the year and key points
to note in this Remuneration Report.
Explains how the Board and the Committee make remuneration
decisions, including how they use external remuneration consultants.
Details the Key Management Personnel (KMP) for FY2013, being the
members of the GMC and the Non-executive Directors who served
during the year.
Outlines the overarching remuneration policy and framework that
guides decisions on remuneration design and outcomes for the GMC
members and the Non-executive Directors. Describes the components
of remuneration and potential remuneration outcomes for the CEO as a
result of the policy.
Shows the impact of the remuneration policy in FY2013 and how actual
performance outcomes link to remuneration outcomes through short-
term incentive (STI) and long-term incentive (LTI) arrangements.
Presents additional disclosures required under Australian and UK
reporting requirements, including total remuneration for the GMC
calculated pursuant to legislative and accounting requirements.
Provides details of interests in equity awards resulting from BHP
Billiton’s remuneration programs.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group’s remuneration arrangements are equitable and aligned with the long-term interests of BHP
Billiton and its shareholders. In performing this function, it is critical that the Board is independent of management when making decisions
affecting remuneration of the CEO, the other members of the GMC and the Group’s employees.
Accordingly, the Board has established a Remuneration Committee to assist it in making decisions affecting employee remuneration. The
Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors, all of whom are independent. In order to ensure that it is fully informed when making
remuneration decisions, the Committee
Table of Contents
254
receives regular reports and updates from members of management (who the Committee invites to attend meetings as and when appropriate) and
can draw on services from a range of external sources, including remuneration consultants.
6.2.2    Remuneration Committee
The activities of the Remuneration Committee are governed by Terms of Reference (most recently approved by the Board in June 2013), which are
available on our website. The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the remuneration policy and its specific application to the CEO, the other members of the GMC and its general application to all Group employees;
the determination of levels of reward for the CEO and approval of reward to the other members of the GMC;
the annual evaluation of the performance of the CEO, by providing guidance to the Group Chairman;
communication with shareholders on the Group’s remuneration policy and the Committee’s work on behalf of the Board;
the Group’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements associated with remuneration matters;
the preparation of the Remuneration Report to be included in the Group’s Annual Report;
the review, at least annually, of remuneration by gender.

6.2.3    Use of remuneration consultants
The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. Remuneration
consultants are engaged by, and report directly to, the Committee. Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration
consultants are selected and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from, BHP Billiton’s
management. The advice and recommendations of external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough
consideration of the issues by each Director.

Kepler Associates was appointed by the Committee to act as an independent remuneration adviser to provide specialist remuneration advice and
does not provide other services to the Group. Kepler Associates is a member of the UK Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code
of Conduct. During the year, Kepler Associates provided advice and assistance to the Committee on a wide range of matters, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
advice in regard to remuneration arrangements for the new CEO and the members of the GMC;
benchmarking of pay of senior executives against comparable roles at a range of relevant comparator groups, including sector and size peers;
provision of information and commentary on global trends in executive remuneration;
calculation of accounting fair values of equity awards and performance analysis for LTI awards;
review of, and commentary on, management proposals;
other ad-hoc support and advice as requested by the Committee.
As part of its role, Kepler Associates provided ‘remuneration recommendations’ (as defined in the Australian Corporations Act 2001) to the
Committee during the year. Each time Kepler Associates provides a remuneration recommendation, Kepler Associates provides a declaration that
the remuneration recommendation was made free from undue influence by the member of KMP to whom the recommendation relates. The Board
considered the processes outlined above, the constraints incorporated into Kepler Associates’ terms of engagement, the implementation of a
comprehensive protocol for the engagement of remuneration advisers and the receipt of the declaration of no undue influence. It is satisfied that
the remuneration recommendations received from Kepler Associates were made free from undue influence by any of the members of KMP to
whom the recommendations related.
Total fees paid to Kepler Associates for the above services for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 were £159,000, of which £57,000 was
for attendance at Committee meetings and commentary on management proposals, and a total of £81,000 for the provision of remuneration
recommendations and technical advice on executive remuneration. The remainder is mainly a non-recurring item relating to advice on
arrangements for the new CEO and other new GMC members.
Management also appoints external firms from time to time to assist with remuneration benchmarking, data provision and the like; however,
Kepler Associates is the only remuneration consultant appointed by the Committee. While other external firms did provide certain information to
management to assist them in deliberations, no remuneration adviser other than Kepler Associates provided remuneration recommendations
during the year in relation to KMP.
6.2.4    Prohibition on hedging of BHP Billiton shares and equity instruments
GMC members are not allowed to protect the value of any unvested BHP Billiton securities allocated to them under employee programs or the
value of shares and securities held as part of meeting BHP Billiton’s Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) as described below. The policy
also prohibits GMC members from using unvested BHP Billiton securities as collateral in any financial transaction, including hedging and margin
loan arrangements. Any securities that have vested and are no longer subject to restrictions or performance conditions may be subject to
hedging arrangements or used as collateral, provided that consent is obtained from BHP Billiton in advance of the employee entering into the
arrangement. BHP Billiton treats compliance with this policy as a serious issue, and takes appropriate measures to ensure that the policy is
adhered to.
6.2.5    Share ownership guidelines and the minimum shareholding requirements
The MSR helps to ensure that executives’ and shareholders’ interests remain aligned. In FY2013 and prior, the MSR was 300 per cent of annual
gross pre-tax base salary for the CEO and 200 per cent for other GMC members. From FY2014, the MSR will increase to 500 per cent of annual
gross pre-tax base salary for the CEO and 300 per cent for other GMC members.
Table of Contents
256
The value of the securities for the purposes of the policy is the market value of the underlying shares. Unvested securities do not qualify, and
neither do options with a market-based exercise price. Members of the GMC are expected to grow their holdings to the required level from the
scheduled vesting of employee awards over time. Under the policy, employees are not required to meet the holding requirement before awards
are allocated to them, but if they are not holding the required number of shares, then they will be prohibited from selling all of the underlying
shares arising from their awards. Employees are entitled to sell sufficient shares to satisfy tax obligations arising from the granting, holding,
vesting, exercise or sale of employee awards or the underlying shares.
Detailed share ownership information of the CEO and other members of the GMC can be found in sections 7.19 and 7.20.
6.2.6    Key Management Personnel
The Australian Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards require BHP Billiton to
make certain disclosures for KMP, defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the
activities of the Group, directly or indirectly. For the purposes of this Remuneration Report, it has been determined that the KMP are the members
of the GMC and the Non-executive Directors who served during FY2013.
Members of the GMC
Following the announcement of Andrew Mackenzie as CEO in February 2013, BHP Billiton announced a new GMC, which took effect from 10 May
2013. The composition and structure of the GMC reflects a commitment to a relentless focus on the safe execution of the Group’s strategy, and
provides the Company with the right balance of skills and experience to lead the Group. While the new GMC is larger in number than its
predecessor, with 12 members for FY2014 (eight previously), it reflects a balance of operational and functional roles, and a more streamlined
organisation, with the removal of a layer of management below the GMC to create a direct line of communication between the centre and
operations and to ensure alignment between strategic and operational leadership. FY2013 remuneration reported in this report is for the period
that the individual served in the relevant capacity during the year:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Andrew Mackenzie, Mike Henry, Graham Kerr and Karen Wood were members of the GMC for the whole of FY2013.
Peter Beaven, Dean Dalla Valle, Jane McAloon, Daniel Malchuk and Jimmy Wilson were appointed to the GMC effective from 10 May 2013.
Geoff Healy was appointed to the GMC upon his commencement with BHP Billiton on 3 June 2013.
Marius Kloppers, Alberto Calderon and Marcus Randolph retired from the GMC effective from 10 May 2013 and will leave or have left BHP Billiton
during FY2014.
J Michael Yeager retired from the GMC effective from 1 July 2013 and from BHP Billiton effective 8 July 2013, and is therefore included as KMP for the
whole of FY2013.
Tim Cutt was appointed to the GMC effective from 2 July 2013 as President, Petroleum and Potash. Mike Fraser was appointed to the GMC effective
from 27 August 2013 as President, Human Resources. Mr Cutt and Mr Fraser are therefore not included in this report as KMP, but will be included in
FY2014. Also effective 27 August 2013, Karen Wood assumed the role of President, Public Affairs and remains on the GMC.
Dates of appointment of all current GMC members appear in section 4.2 and the dates of their current service contracts appear in the table below.

levels are to be modified from year-to-year. The contracts are all capable of termination by BHP Billiton on 12 months’ notice. The Group retains
the right to terminate a contract immediately by making a payment equal to 12 months’ base salary plus retirement benefits for that period. The
GMC member must give six months’ notice.

Remuneration policy for GMC members
This section outlines the overarching remuneration policy and framework that guided decisions on remuneration design and outcomes for the
GMC members in FY2013 and will guide decisions in FY2014.
6.2.7    The overarching principles of our remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee recognises that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement of
the Group’s strategy and our ongoing performance, aligning the activities of management to the interests of shareholders, and in supporting Our
Charter. The remuneration policy is reviewed annually and, where appropriate, fine-tuned to ensure that it continues to be effective in achieving
these goals.
The key principles of our remuneration policy, which remain unchanged, are to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
support the execution of the Group’s business strategy in accordance with a risk framework that is appropriate for the organisation;
provide competitive rewards to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled executives willing to work around the world;
apply demanding performance measures, including key financial and non-financial measures of performance;
link a large component of pay to our performance and the creation of value for our shareholders from relative performance;
ensure remuneration arrangements are equitable and facilitate the deployment of people around the Group;
limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements (which do not commit us to making any unjustified payments).
6.2.8    Our remuneration policy and arrangements support Our Charter and are focused on the long term
Our Charter sets out our purpose, strategy, values and how we judge our success.
BHP Billiton’s remuneration arrangements reinforce the achievement of our success, as set out in Our Charter, and are designed to ensure that
executives take a long-term approach to decision-making and minimise activities
Table of Contents
259
that focus only on short-term results at the expense of longer-term business growth and success. The Remuneration Committee has considered
the ways in which risk management and the long-term horizon are reflected throughout BHP Billiton’s remuneration arrangements for all
executives, and is satisfied that the approach reinforces the desired behaviours.
This is largely achieved through the Group’s approach to STI and LTI awards, which comprise a significant portion of total remuneration for the
members of the GMC. The equity component of the STI award is deferred for a two-year period, and performance under the Long Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) is measured over a five-year period. The actual rewards received by members of the GMC therefore reflect the Group’s performance
and share price over an extended period.
It is the Committee’s view that this provides an appropriate focus on BHP Billiton’s sustained performance beyond the end of the initial
measurement period. This approach also provides a transparent mechanism for clawback or adjustment in the event of a restatement of Group
results, through changes to the vesting or non-vesting of deferred equity.
In addition, STI and LTI outcomes are not driven by a purely formulaic approach. The Committee holds discretion to determine that awards are not
to be provided or vested in circumstances where it would be inappropriate or would provide unintended outcomes. The Committee has no
discretion to allow vesting when performance conditions have not been satisfied (other than in the event of death, serious injury, disability, illness
that prohibits continued employment, or total and permanent disablement).
6.2.9    How total remuneration is determined
The Remuneration Committee considers the appropriate total remuneration for each member of the GMC by examining the remuneration provided
to comparable roles in organisations of similar global complexity, size, reach and industry.
Each year, the Committee’s independent adviser, Kepler Associates, sources and consolidates relevant remuneration data for appropriate roles,
based on their analysis of relevant organisations and markets. The adviser prepares a comparison to current GMC remuneration, but does not
make specific recommendations regarding the level of individual executives’ remuneration. For more information on the services provided to the
Committee by Kepler Associates refer to section 6.2.3.
From this market comparison, the Committee determines the appropriate remuneration for each individual, taking into account their
responsibilities, location, skills, experience and performance within the Group. In doing so, the Committee recognises that levels of remuneration
should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled executives, but also that the Group should avoid paying more than is necessary
for this purpose.
Total remuneration comprises different elements of remuneration to reflect a balance between fixed and at-risk remuneration and between short-
and long-term incentives. The mix of remuneration elements and how the remuneration outcomes from each element are impacted by
performance are described in detail in the following section.

The following table shows the building blocks of total remuneration, how performance is assessed and will impact remuneration and how the
resulting remuneration outcomes are delivered.

Description
•
•
Base salary is broadly aligned with salaries for comparable roles in global companies of similar global complexity, size,
reach and industry, and reflects an individual’s responsibilities, location, performance, qualifications and experience within
the Group, in order to attract and retain executives in pursuit of the Company’s purpose.
Base salary is reviewed annually and any changes are effective from 1 September each year. Reviews consider general
economic conditions and salary reviews across the rest of the Group.
•   Base salary is denominated in US dollars for all GMC members.
  •   Pension contributions are similarly benchmarked to comparable roles in global companies.
•
All current GMC members are entitled to pension contributions under defined contribution pension plans. They are given a
choice of funding vehicles: a Defined Contribution Plan, an unfunded Retirement Savings Plan, an International
Retirement Plan or a cash payment in lieu.
•   For FY2014, pension contributions for all GMC members will be 25% of base salary.
•
•
•
•
GMC members are reimbursed for costs such as health and other insurances, the costs of tax return preparation in multiple
jurisdictions (to a capped amount), and are provided with cash payments in lieu of untaken annual leave (as required in the
US).
Relocation allowances and assistance are provided under the Company’s global mobility policy and are ‘one-off’
payments with no trailing entitlements.
The Remuneration Committee has approved a new Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for application to the CEO and other
GMC members for FY2014 (and subsequent years). The new STIP replaces the prior Group Incentive Scheme (GIS),
which has applied to the CEO and other GMC members for FY2013 and prior years. The features of the new STIP are set
out below. Where the terms of the GIS (which covers FY2013 and prior awards) are different to those of the STIP, such
differences have been noted below.
The purpose of the STIP (and the prior GIS) is to focus management’s efforts on those performance measures and
outcomes that have been determined to be priorities for the relevant financial year.
Measuring performance
•
An individual scorecard of measures is set for each executive at the commencement of each financial year. These
measures and their relative weightings are chosen by the Committee in order to appropriately drive overall performance in
the current year, including achievement of financial outcomes and delivery against measures that impact the long-term
sustainability of the Group. The Sustainability Committee assists the Remuneration Committee in determining appropriate
health, safety, environment and community (HSEC) metrics to be included in GMC scorecards.
261
Table of Contents
Component
Description
•
At the conclusion of the financial year, each executive’s achievement against their measures is assessed by the
Committee and the Board, and their STI award determined. The Remuneration Committee is assisted by the Sustainability
Committee and by the Risk and Audit Committee in relation to assessment of performance against HSEC and financial
measures, respectively. The Board believes this method of assessment is transparent, rigorous and balanced, and
provides an appropriate, objective and comprehensive assessment of performance.
Half (50%) is delivered in cash and half (50%) in deferred equity
•
•
•
•
•
•
The value of any STI award is provided half in cash and half in an award of the equivalent face value of BHP Billiton
equity, which is deferred for two years. The Committee intends this to provide an appropriate focus on the longer-term time
frame, even in regard to annual STI rewards.
‘On-target’ performance against the scorecard measures delivers an STI award of 160% of base salary (being a cash STI
award of 80% of base salary and the equivalent value in deferred equity).
The maximum STI award payable under the plan is rarely awarded and is only available where all non-financial and
financial targets are significantly exceeded.
For FY2013, the maximum STI award that could have been earned under the GIS was 320% of base salary (160% of base
salary in cash and an equivalent value in deferred equity). The minimum potential STI award was zero.
In FY2014, the maximum STI award that can be earned under the new STIP will be 240% of base salary (120% of base
salary in cash and an equivalent value in deferred equity). The minimum potential STI award will be zero.
The equity is provided as Deferred Shares. Deferred Shares are not ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to
ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights. Each Deferred Share is a conditional right to receive one ordinary BHP
Billiton share in the future if the service conditions are met. When the two-year vesting period is over, the Deferred Shares
will vest if the holder is still employed by the Company or has left in certain circumstances (as described below this table).
Dividends on deferred equity
  •   Dividends are not received by the executives during the vesting period.
•
A Dividend Equivalent Payment (DEP) is provided when the vesting period is over and the holder receives ordinary BHP
Billiton shares in respect of the award. The value of the DEP is based on the dividends that would have been payable on
ordinary BHP Billiton shares over the period from the allocation date to the time that the DEP is paid.
Under the STIP, the Committee intends that DEP will be provided in the form of shares (although the plan accommodates a
cash equivalent in appropriate circumstances). DEP provided under the GIS is paid in cash.
 
  •   A DEP is not provided in relation to any securities that are forfeited during the vesting period.
•

Description
A new LTIP is being proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2013 Annual General Meetings (AGMs) for grants
proposed to be made to the CEO and other GMC members in FY2014 (and subsequent years). The new LTIP replaces the
prior LTIP, which has applied to the CEO and other GMC members for grants made in FY2013 and prior years. Were the
new LTIP not to be approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGMs, the grants proposed to be made in December 2013
would be made under the prior LTIP. The features of the new LTIP, which are not materially different from the prior LTIP,
are set out below. Where the features differ from the prior LTIP, such differences have been noted below.
The purpose of the LTIP is to focus management’s efforts on the achievement of sustainable long-term value creation and
success of the Group (including appropriate management of business risks) and to align senior executive rewards with
sustained shareholder wealth creation through the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition
(described below).
Value of awards
The value of any LTI award is provided as Performance Shares. Performance Shares are not ordinary shares and do not
carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights. Each Performance Share is a conditional right to
receive one ordinary BHP Billiton share in the future if the performance and service conditions are met.
When the Committee is determining the number of LTI awards to be allocated to GMC members, it uses the face value of
the underlying Company shares to determine the value of awards. The Committee also considers the fair value (as below)
of LTI awards in its determinations. In FY2013 and prior years, the Committee placed more emphasis on the fair value of an
LTIP award to determine its size.
The fair value is calculated by Kepler Associates. It reflects outcomes weighted by probability, taking into account the
difficulty of achieving the performance conditions and the correlation between these and share price appreciation, together
with other factors, including volatility and forfeiture risks. This fair value is not the same as the ‘IFRS fair value’ used in
section 6.4.1, which is determined in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 2/AASB 2
Share-based Payments accounting standards.
•   The fair value for the current plan design is 41% of the face value of an award.
•
•
Under both the prior LTIP and the new LTIP rules, the maximum award size is an award with a fair value equal to 200% of
base salary, which is equivalent to a face value of 488% of base salary.
The FY2014 award proposed to be made to the CEO in December 2013 has a face value of 400% of base salary. For the
purposes of benchmarking and derivation of total target remuneration, the Committee uses the fair value of 164% of base
salary (based on the fair value factor of 41%).

•
Under the new LTIP, the Committee intends that DEP will be provided in the form of shares (although the plan
accommodates a cash equivalent in appropriate circumstances). DEP under the prior LTIP was paid in cash.
•   A DEP is not provided in relation to any securities that are forfeited during the vesting period.
  Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition
•
•
•
•
The relative TSR performance condition must be achieved over a five-year period. Full vesting under the LTIP only occurs
where BHP Billiton’s TSR significantly outperforms the TSR of the comparator companies.
TSR measures the return in US$ delivered to shareholders over a defined period through the change in share price and
any dividends paid (which are notionally reinvested for the purposes of the calculation).
TSR has been chosen as the most appropriate measure as it allows for an objective external assessment over a sustained
period on a basis that is familiar to shareholders.
As BHP Billiton’s TSR performance relative to its peers tends to be counter-cyclical, the hurdle used since December 2010
includes both a sector-based comparison (67%) and a comparison to a broad stock market index (the MSCI World) (33%)
for assessing the Group’s TSR performance, in order to provide a fairer and more balanced measure of performance. This
weighting ensures a majority of the outcome is driven by our performance against that of resource industry peers. More
detail on the comparator groups is shown in the final section of this table. The lists of peer companies for FY2013 and for
FY2014 are shown in section 6.3.4.
Level of performance required for vesting
•
For all Performance Shares to vest, BHP Billiton’s TSR must exceed the Index TSR by an average of 5.5% per annum,
which equates to exceeding the average TSR over the five-year performance period by 30.7%. 25% of Performance
Shares vest if BHP Billiton’s TSR is equal to the Index TSR (zero for awards granted prior to December 2010) and vesting
occurs on a sliding scale between the Index TSR and the point of full vesting. BHP Billiton’s TSR is a weighted average of
the TSRs of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.
•   There is no retesting if the performance hurdle is not met.
•
•
In the event that the Committee does not consider the level of vesting that would otherwise apply based on the Group’s
achievement of the TSR hurdle to be a true reflection of the performance of the Group or should it consider that individual
performance or other circumstances makes this an inappropriate outcome, it retains the discretion to lapse any or all
Performance Shares held by one or more participants. This is an important mitigator against the risk of unintended vesting
outcomes.
Vested Performance Shares are able to be exercised for up to five years following the date that vesting is determined, with
an expiry date prior to the fifth anniversary of vesting.

This section describes the treatment of awards under the new STIP and LTIP on cessation of employment. Where the treatment of awards is
different under the prior GIS, this is described in sections 6.4.1 and 6.2.10.
Treatment of STI where a member of the GMC leaves during the financial year
If a participant leaves BHP Billiton during a performance year due to death, serious injury, disability or illness that prohibits continued
employment, forced early retirement, retrenchment or redundancy, termination by mutual agreement or retirement with the agreement of the
Company, or such other circumstances that the Remuneration Committee determines are of a similar nature (other than those set out below), the
Committee may determine in its absolute discretion to pay a pro-rata portion of cash STI based on the length of employment and performance of
the participant up to that date.
Where a participant leaves BHP Billiton due to resignation or dismissal, then no cash amount will be paid in respect of the current performance
year.
If a participant leaves BHP Billiton during a performance year for any reason, no deferred equity awards will be granted in respect of that
performance year.
Treatment of STI where a member of the GMC leaves after the end of a financial year, but before awards are provided
Where a participant leaves BHP Billiton for any reason after the end of a performance year, but before the date of payment of any cash amount, no
cash amount will be paid under the STIP in respect of that performance year, but the Committee may determine in its discretion to pay a separate
amount in respect of the participant’s performance for that year.
Table of Contents
265
Where a participant ceases employment for any reason after the end of a performance year, but before the date of grant of any deferred equity, no
deferred equity will be granted in respect of that performance year, but the Committee may determine in its discretion to pay a separate cash
amount in respect of the participant’s performance for that year.
Treatment of deferred STI and LTI equity holdings on departure
Where a participant leaves BHP Billiton due to forced early retirement, retrenchment or redundancy, termination by mutual agreement or
retirement with the agreement of the Company, or such other circumstances that the Committee determines are of a similar nature (other than
those set out below), then:
•
•
unvested STI equity awards to be granted under the new STIP will be retained by the participant, but will not vest and become exercisable until the
scheduled vesting date. The Committee believes that this is important to assist the Company in applying the malus and clawback provisions, where it
is considered appropriate (as described in the following section). This is a significant change from the terms of the GIS (applicable for prior awards and
those for FY2013), under which awards vest in full on cessation of employment in such circumstances.
the participant may retain entitlements to a portion of unvested LTI awards, pro-rated to reflect the period of service from the start of the relevant
performance period to the date of departure. After the employee’s departure, the LTI awards would only vest and become exercisable to the extent that
the performance hurdles are met, and remain subject to available discretions. This ensures that any benefit received by the individual remains linked
to their contribution to ongoing Group performance.
If a participant’s employment ends due to death, serious injury, disability or illness that prohibits continued employment or total and permanent
disablement, immediate vesting of all of the participant’s STI and LTI awards occurs.
Where a participant leaves BHP Billiton due to resignation or dismissal, then all unvested STI and LTI awards will lapse.
If a participant ceases employment for any other reason, including where the business or company for which the participant works is sold outside
the Group, the Committee in its discretion will determine the rights of a participant to the exercise or award or lapse of deferred equity awards.
Malus and clawback
The new STIP and LTIP include malus and clawback provisions to allow the Remuneration Committee to reduce or clawback awards in certain
circumstances, including:
•
•
•
for any misconduct or fraud by a participant;
where BHP Billiton becomes aware of a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements of a Group company or the Group; or
any circumstances occur that the Committee determines in good faith to have resulted in an inappropriate benefit to the participant.
In addition, the Committee will have the ability to clawback all or some of the shares allocated to a participant or cash received by a participant in
connection with the new STIP or LTIP in order to ensure that no inappropriate benefit is obtained by the participant.

6.2.11     When the components of remuneration are provided
266
The following graph illustrates the usual time frame for delivery of the components of remuneration.
Cash STI awards are paid in September following the release of the Group’s annual results. The remainder of the STI awards and those under the
LTI are delivered after the AGMs and are usually allocated in December. Allocations to the CEO are subject to shareholder approval. Employees
will generally not have access to the value of these equity awards for approximately two years in the case of STI awards, and five years in the case
of LTI awards, depending on the level of vesting under the LTIP performance hurdle, including the exercise of the Remuneration Committee’s
discretion to reduce vesting.

There were no increases to base salary for any members of the GMC in September 2012. Changes in base salary for GMC members during FY2013 were effective at various times
related to the changes in the GMC structure during the year (refer to section 6.3.2).
6.2.12    Potential remuneration outcomes
While the Board recognises that market forces necessarily influence remuneration practices, it strongly believes that the fundamental driver of our
remuneration arrangements should be business performance. Accordingly, while target total remuneration is structured to attract and retain
executives, the amount of remuneration actually received is dependent on the achievement of superior business and individual performance and
on generating sustained shareholder value from relative performance. At risk components of remuneration therefore represent a significant
portion of total remuneration, are subject to performance conditions and to ongoing service, and are designed to deliver appropriate pay over
various time horizons.
The diagrams below illustrate the relative proportion of each remuneration component for the CEO if the minimum, target and maximum levels of
performance were achieved.
These diagrams have been developed with reference to new UK reporting requirements, and in line with UK guidance:
•
•
the figure for other benefits is based on FY2013 actual figures for current GMC members, excluding non-recurring items; and
the impact of potential future share price movements (up and down) on the value of deferred STI and LTI awards have been ignored.

Remuneration mix for the CEO
267
The LTI amount (target and maximum) is based on the new CEO’s normal award size of 400 per cent of base salary, at face value, which is lower
than the maximum permissible award size under the plan rules (an amount equivalent to 488 per cent of base salary face value). The ‘target’ value
for the LTI award is based on the fair value of the award, which is 41 per cent of the face value as this is the expected outcome on the balance of
probabilities.

salary at fair value).
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors
6.2.13    Remuneration policy
Our Non-executive Directors are paid in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (2010) and the ASX Corporate Governance
Council’s Principles and Recommendations (2nd Edition).
Remuneration rates for Non-executive Directors are set at a competitive level, with advice on benchmark fees in equivalent sized companies
provided by external advisers. The remuneration levels reflect the size and complexity of the Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising
from the Dual Listed Company structure, the multiple stock exchange listings, the extent of the geographic regions in which the Group operates
and the enhanced responsibilities associated with membership of Board Committees. They also reflect the considerable travel burden imposed
on members of the Board. In setting the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors, the economic environment and the financial performance of
the Group is taken into account, along with pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive arrangements. A standard letter of appointment has been developed for
Non-executive Directors and is available on our website. Each Non-executive Director is appointed subject to periodic re-election by shareholders
(see section 5.12 for an explanation of the process). There are no provisions in any of the Non-executive Directors’ appointment arrangements for
compensation payable on early termination of their directorship.
6.2.14    Non-executive Director fees
Fees for the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the CEO. The Non-executive Directors do not take part in these
discussions. Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. Fees for the Non-
executive Directors and Chairman were reviewed in June 2013 and benchmarked against peer companies, with the assistance of externally
provided

benchmark data. As a result of the review, a decision was taken to make no change to the fee levels of the Non-executive Directors or the
Chairman for FY2014. The table below sets out the fees, and the changes in fee levels, since 1 July 2009. The aggregate sum available to

The data included in the above table is determined according to incoming UK requirements and reports only remuneration relating to
performance of the services of an Executive Director for the current year and prior year.
For Andrew Mackenzie in FY2013, this means disclosure of the following amounts for the time served as CEO and as an Executive Director:
•
•
•
•
•
Base salary: actual cash salary earned from 10 May to 30 June 2013.
Pension contribution: the Company’s contribution to pension plans during the same period at 25 per cent of base salary.
Other benefits: pro-rated portion of all benefits paid during FY2013, plus the full amount of the relocation allowance paid in respect of Mr Mackenzie’s
move from the United Kingdom to Australia (refer to section 6.4.1).
STI: a pro-rated portion of Mr Mackenzie’s STI for FY2013, to reflect the period from 10 May to 30 June 2013, provided in cash or deferred in respect of
performance for FY2013.
LTI: a pro-rated portion of the value of 243,126 LTIP awards that vested on 22 August 2013, to reflect the period from 10 May to 30 June 2013, as
described in section 6.3.4. The total face value of those awards and the associated DEP on the date of vesting and exercise was US$8,480,000.
For Marius Kloppers in FY2013, the amounts disclosed are similarly for the time served as CEO and as an Executive Director from 1 July 2012 to
10 May 2013.
With the exception of pro-rating for time as an Executive Director for Mr Mackenzie, the base salary, pension contribution, other benefits and cash
STI amounts shown in the table therefore correspond to the similar columns in the table in section 6.4.1 under Australian disclosure requirements.
The values shown above for deferred equity STI and LTI do not correspond to those shown in table 6.4.1 as that table uses a methodology based
on amortised IFRS fair values (as described in section 6.4.1).

6.3.2    Fixed remuneration
Base salary
271
The increase in base salary for Andrew Mackenzie was effective 10 May 2013 upon his appointment as CEO. Changes in base salary for Mike
Henry and Graham Kerr reflect their expanded roles, given to them by the new CEO, as a consequence of the GMC restructure effective 10 May
2013. These base salary changes apply from 1 September 2013.
Non-statutory table: Base salary amounts in the table below are effective 1 September and are not linked to any specific financial year. They
therefore do not match with the 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 salaries shown in section 6.4.1.

For Peter Beaven, Dean Dalla Valle, Jane McAloon, Daniel Malchuk and Jimmy Wilson, the table shows the base salary effective from 10 May 2013, for their new roles as GMC
members. Their base salaries prior to this time are not applicable for the purposes of the Remuneration Report.
For Geoff Healy, the table shows the base salary applicable from 3 June 2013, when he commenced employment with BHP Billiton.
The base salary change for Karen Wood was effective from 10 May 2013.
Marius Kloppers, Alberto Calderon and Marcus Randolph retired from the GMC, effective from 10 May 2013 and J Michael Yeager has retired from BHP Billiton, effective from 8 July
2013. Their 1 September 2013 base salaries are therefore not applicable for the purposes of the Remuneration Report.

The pension contribution percentage for Andrew Mackenzie and for Karen Wood changed to 25.0 per cent of base salary on 10 May 2013 and now align with the pension
arrangements for other current GMC members.
Prior to his appointment as CEO, and under the terms of a pre-existing contract, Marius Kloppers had the choice of a (1) ‘defined benefit’, (2) ‘defined contribution’ underpinned by a
defined benefit promise, or (3) ‘cash in lieu’ pension entitlement for each year since 1 July 2001. He elected to take cash in lieu for each year except for FY2004 when he elected to
take a defined contribution entitlement with a defined benefit underpin. Mr Kloppers retains the option to convert the entitlement accrued in the defined contribution fund to a defined
benefit entitlement for that one year. Upon his succession as CEO on 1 October 2007, Mr Kloppers relinquished all future defined benefit entitlements.
Up until 2011 the value of his defined contribution entitlement exceeded, or was only marginally lower than, the transfer value of the defined
benefit underpin that he would be entitled to should he revert to the defined benefit promise, and as such the entitlement was treated on a defined
contribution basis. However, as measured at 30 June 2012, the transfer value of the underpin was significantly greater than the defined
contribution fund and therefore a disclosure was provided for the defined benefit promise. The transfer value of the underpin at 10 May 2013
(US$898,303) is also significantly greater than the defined contribution fund (US$623,278), and as such the disclosure for this defined benefit
promise is provided below. The actual amount that may be paid to Mr Kloppers will be recalculated on his leaving date of 1 October 2013.

The increase in accrued pension during the period is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued
pension at 10 May 2013 without any allowance for inflation. The increase in transfer value over the period is the difference between the transfer
value at the end of the period and the transfer value at the beginning of the period less the contributions made to the scheme by the participant
(nil), also without any allowance for inflation. The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 2.2 per cent was US$71
and the transfer value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the participant was US$1,995.

Other benefits
273
The total value of benefits actually provided to each GMC member during FY2013 is shown in the statutory remuneration disclosure table in
section 6.4.1.
Shareplus all-employee share purchase plan
Members of the GMC are also eligible to contribute up to US$5,000 per annum from their post-tax base salary to participate in Shareplus, the all-
employee share purchase plan. More details of the plan and of the current holdings of GMC members under the plan are shown in section 6.4.7.
Given the nature of the plan, no performance conditions apply to the shares allocated under Shareplus, although a service condition applies in
respect of the Matched Shares.
For administrative simplicity in regard to stock exchange dealings and announcements, no GMC members currently participate in Shareplus. The
table in section 6.4.7 shows Shareplus holdings previously accumulated by members of the GMC, including during the period before they became
members of the GMC.
The Remuneration Committee does not consider the value of these benefits when determining total remuneration. An IFRS fair value is ascribed
to any Matched Shares and included in remuneration as described in section 6.4.1.
6.3.3    Short-term incentives
FY2013 performance measures and outcomes under the GIS
STI outcomes for FY2013 have been determined under the GIS program, with the new STIP effective from FY2014. The GMC scorecard for the
FY2013 performance year is shown below. The level of achievement against each of the non-individual measures for the FY2013 performance year
as determined by the Remuneration Committee is described below the table.
A performance range is set for each measure with the level of performance determined as:
•
•
•
•
Threshold: the minimum necessary to qualify for any award.
Target: where the performance requirements are met.
Stretch: where the performance requirements are exceeded.
Exceptional: where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded.
This scorecard applies for each member of the GMC as shown in the table footnotes. As each new member of the GMC has been in their new role
for only a short period, their performance for FY2013 has been assessed against their prior scorecard in their previous role for the whole of
FY2013 and in accordance with the Group structure in place at the commencement of FY2013. These scorecards were based on similar elements
as those measured under the GMC scorecard shown below, in that they comprised measures in regard to HSEC, financial and production
outcomes, corporate citizenship and individual contribution as applicable to each individual’s previous non-GMC role within the Group. Geoff
Healy is not eligible for any FY2013 STI assessment or award as he joined BHP Billiton within the last month of the performance year.

Health, Safety, Environment and Community (HSEC)
As it has done for several years, the Remuneration Committee sought guidance from the Sustainability Committee on HSEC performance for
FY2013. In the first instance, the Sustainability Committee reviewed performance against the designated measures (derived from the Group’s
HSEC public targets set out on page 5 of the Group’s Sustainability Report) set at the beginning of FY2013. Following the assessment against the
designated measures, the Remuneration Committee also considered it appropriate to then take a holistic view of how the Group has performed in
critical areas. This approach is consistent with that of prior years.
Table of Contents
275
The Sustainability and Remuneration Committees reflected deeply on the tragic loss of three lives during FY2013 – one in Petroleum, one in
Metallurgical Coal and one in Base Metals. We remain committed to eliminating fatalities from our Company and we continue to maintain an ever-
vigilant focus on safety and fatality prevention through leadership and effective processes. These elements were paramount in the Committees’
considerations when determining the STI outcomes for the Group and the prior businesses. In conjunction with these considerations, both
Committees noted improved performance on TRIF across the Group and also solid outcomes emanating from the Company’s endeavours in
respect of HSEC risk management and health. However, outcomes in respect of environment, particularly greenhouse gas and water abatement,
lagged expectations in several businesses.
The overall Group result for HSEC fell short of expectations (marginally below Target), with differentiated levels of HSEC performance across the
businesses:
•
•
•
Petroleum HSEC performance against targets set was below expectations (between Threshold and Target). Despite reporting significant improvement
in TRIF safety performance at our Onshore US shale asset, the occurrence of a fatality and below target performance in the areas of health and
environment resulted in the assessment of overall performance being below target.
Ferrous & Coal and Non-Ferrous were considered marginally below expectations (marginally below Target), with a fatality in each and below target
performance in the environment area, partly offset by strong performance in respect of health outcomes.
Aluminium & Nickel was considered marginally above expectations (marginally above Target), with on-track outcomes, on average, across a range of
HSEC categories.
Profit After Tax (PAT)
For the reasons noted below in respect of EBIT, in combination with unfavourable impacts against the Group’s bottom line of funding costs and
taxation against targets, the Group PAT was below expectations (between Threshold and Target).
Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)
EBIT performance for the businesses against the targets set at the commencement of the year was varied:
•
•
•
•
Petroleum – below target (between Threshold and Target), with lower production volumes than expected at the commencement of the year.
Ferrous & Coal – above targets set at the start of the year and was rated highly (at Stretch), primarily due to positive results in respect of FY2013 Iron
Ore production volumes.
Non-Ferrous – below expectations (between Threshold and Target) as a consequence of below-target performance on production volumes and cost
management.
Aluminium & Nickel – above expectations (between Target and Stretch) as a consequence of above-target performance on cost management.
Capital management
Performance in respect of capital project management metrics varied for FY2013. The overall Group outcome was positive for capital cost
performance (between Target and Stretch), reflecting strong cost management on several major projects, partly offset by some capital projects
taking slightly longer than expected (marginally below Target). In relation to the businesses:
•
Petroleum – performed in line with expectations on capital cost performance (marginally above Target), offset by below-expectation performance on
capital schedule performance metrics (marginally below Target).
Table of Contents
276
•
•
•
Ferrous & Coal – performed positively on capital cost performance (at Stretch), but performed less well on schedule performance metrics (marginally
below Target).
Non-Ferrous – performed below expectations on capital cost (between Threshold and Target) and better than expected on schedule performance
metrics (marginally above Target).
Aluminium and Nickel – there were no major capital projects in execution for Aluminium and Nickel during FY2013.
These outcomes reflect the varied cost and schedule outcomes for the 23 major projects in the portfolio at the commencement of FY2013.
Individual measures
Individual measures for GMC members are determined at the commencement of the financial year. The Group Chairman determines the measures
for the CEO, and the CEO determines measures for remaining GMC members. These comprise each individual’s contribution to the GMC, delivery
against projects and initiatives within the scope of his or her role, and his or her contribution to the overall performance of the Group. Personal
performance of GMC members was reviewed against these measures by the Committee and, on average, was considered marginally above
expectations (marginally above Target).
STI awards for the FY2013 performance year under the GIS
The following table shows the amount of at risk remuneration awarded by the Remuneration Committee as STI awards as a result of Group,
Business and individual performance against the above scorecard objectives for the FY2013 performance year (with comparative prior year data).
The Deferred Share and/or Option awards shown in the table have not yet delivered any realised value to the serving executives, as they generally
do not vest and cannot be exercised for at least two years from the end of the relevant performance year, i.e. the FY2013 awards are expected to
vest in August 2015. Different vesting treatment may apply for executives who leave the Group under specific circumstances and where an
individual leaves BHP Billiton prior to the normal allocation date of the equity awards, they may instead receive an award in cash.

277
Non-statutory table: Cash STI awards shown below are the same as those reported in section 6.4.1, but this table shows the market value of the
Deferred Shares and/or Options at the time of allocation (rather than amortising the IFRS fair value of each award over the relevant performance
and service periods as per accounting standards).

The Deferred Shares and/or Options have the same values as the corresponding cash award. The actual number of Deferred Shares allocated is
determined by dividing the relevant value by the share price at the time of allocation. The number of Options required to provide an approximately
equivalent value will also be determined (should any members of the GMC nominate this alternative, or a combination of Deferred Shares and
Options) based on a valuation conducted by Kepler Associates. The values shown in the FY2013 Deferred Shares and Options column for those
individuals who are leaving or have left BHP Billiton prior to the normal allocation date in December 2013 (after the AGMs) represents their notional
entitlement to Deferred Shares and Options had they remained in employment at the allocation date. As described in section 6.3.5, these individuals
will receive their FY2013 GIS award (pro-rated for the portion of the year served as a GMC member) wholly in the form of cash. These cash awards
are not subject to any further deferral.
The STI outcome shown for Andrew Mackenzie is based on his performance against his scorecard as Group Executive and Chief Executive – Non-
Ferrous. It was also calculated as a percentage of Mr Mackenzie’s base salary in his previous role of Group Executive and Chief Executive – Non-
Ferrous as per the rules of the GIS. He will be assessed against the CEO scorecard from FY2014.
The STI maximums and outcomes shown for new members of the GMC appointed on 10 May 2013 are based on their performance against their prior
scorecard in their previous non-GMC roles for the whole of FY2013 and also on their base salary in those roles (pro-rated for GMC service). They will
be assessed against their GMC scorecards from FY2014. These new members of the GMC have received their cash and will receive their equity-
based STI awards for FY2013 up to 9 May 2013 under the management Group Short Term Incentive Plan (GSTIP), which applied to their previous
non-GMC positions, and under the GIS in respect of the period in their new GMC positions from 10 May 2013 to 30 June 2013.
As Geoff Healy’s employment with BHP Billiton commenced on 3 June 2013, he is not eligible for an STI outcome in respect of FY2013.

As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, both
Marius Kloppers and Mike Yeager advised the Committee that they did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012. The Committee and
the Board respected and agreed with that decision.
The STI maximums and outcomes shown for Marius Kloppers, Alberto Calderon and Marcus Randolph are based on the period from 1 July 2012 to
10 May 2013. No STI has been earned by these individuals for the period after their retirement from the GMC.
This simple (unweighted) average percentage of maximum is graphed against Group earnings later in this section and includes only the GMC
members in office at 30 June 2013 (that is, it excludes Mr Kloppers, Mr Calderon and Mr Randolph).
Relationship between STI outcomes and Group performance
The following graphs are included as part of satisfying an Australian disclosure requirement to show the relationship between KMP remuneration
and performance, including earnings.
As described earlier in this section, STI awards for members of the GMC are based on a balanced scorecard of key performance measures. A
substantial component of each scorecard is based on measures that will drive the long-term success and sustainability of the Group, but which
may not have a direct correlation to annual profitability.
Only a proportion of STI outcomes are directly related to financial measures, and that proportion varies for different members of the GMC. The
profit measure used for calculating scorecard outcomes (as defined earlier in this section) is not the same as the disclosed profit attributable to
shareholders used in the graph below.
Due to the factors described above, some correlation between STI outcomes and the measures used in the graphs below is evident over the last
five years, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the future. Further details of the Group’s attributable profit and basic earnings per
share over the past five years can be found in section 1.6.1.

FY2013 LTI granted in December 2012
The following table shows the LTI awards provided as part of total remuneration for FY2013, and allocated in December 2012 following approval of
the CEO’s award by shareholders at the AGMs (with comparative prior year data). During FY2013, and before their appointment as members of the
GMC, all new members of the GMC other than Geoff Healy received awards under the Management Award Plan (MAP), as shown in section 6.4.6.
The first awards under the LTIP for these GMC members and for Geoff Healy will be determined by the Remuneration Committee and allocated in
December 2013, along with FY2014 awards for the other members of the GMC.
The maximum award under the LTIP for FY2013 granted December 2012 was a fair value of 200 per cent of base salary as at 1 September 2012 (as
set out in the table in section 6.2.10).

December 2011 fair values are calculated by multiplying the average closing share price (in US dollars) over the three months up to and including the grant date (being A$36.54 for
BHP Billiton Limited shares and £19.06 for BHP Billiton Plc shares) by the fair value factor of 41 per cent (as determined by Kepler Associates). The fair value for each executive
therefore reflects the number of Performance Shares allocated, the entity over which they apply and the relevant exchange rates (where applicable).
December 2012 fair values are calculated in the same way as described in footnote (1) above, except that average closing share prices for the three months up to and including the
grant date were A$33.64 for BHP Billiton Limited shares and £19.53 for BHP Billiton Plc shares.
A description of the performance conditions applying to the LTI Performance Shares is set out in the table in section 6.2.10. The index of peer
group companies since 2007 is shown below. The list of peer group companies is reviewed by the Committee prior to each LTI award being
allocated.

LTI vesting outcomes and the delivery of LTI award
The performance hurdle for the 2007 and 2008 LTI awards requires BHP Billiton’s TSR to exceed the weighted average TSR of a group of peer
companies by 5.5 per cent per annum (on average over the five years), which is 30.7 per cent over five years.
In order to derive TSR outcomes, BHP Billiton’s US$ TSR performance is compared against US$ TSR performance of the LTIP comparator group
over the five-year performance period. The following factors comprise the US$ TSR calculation:
•
•
movements in shares prices in US$ of BHP Billiton and companies in the LTIP comparator group during the five-year performance period, based on
the three-month average US$ share price to the start of the five-year performance period (three months up to and including 30 June 2008) compared to
the three-month average US$ share price to the end of the five-year performance period (three months up to and including 30 June 2013). The
averaging period is used to mitigate the consequences of short-term share price and exchange rate fluctuations;
dividends paid in US$ by BHP Billiton and companies in the LTIP comparator group during the five-year performance period, assuming that dividends
paid are reinvested in the relevant company on the date the dividends were paid.
Upon the introduction of the LTIP in 2004, the Committee, with advice from its independent adviser, Kepler Associates, determined that a
common-currency approach using the US$ would be employed for TSR comparisons. The US$ is the Group’s functional and reporting currency,
and a common-currency approach helps mitigate the effects of currency movements. In addition, all GMC members, including those domiciled in
Australia and the UK, receive their annual salary and cash STI denominated in US$.
TSR is determined for BHP Billiton and each company in the comparator group in US$. The index US$ TSR of the comparator group as a whole is
then determined (i.e. the weighted average of the comparators) and BHP Billiton’s TSR performance against that index TSR is tested.
2008 allocations under the LTIP – tested to the end of FY2013 and vested in FY2014
The five-year performance period for the 2008 LTIP ended on 30 June 2013. For awards to vest in full, BHP Billiton must deliver a TSR that
exceeds the TSR of a group of peer companies by an average of 5.5 per cent per year for five years, or 30.7 per cent in total compounded over the
five-year performance period. The weighted average TSR for peer companies was negative 44.0 per cent, which compared to BHP Billiton’s TSR of
negative 9.4 per cent. As a result, BHP Billiton outperformed its peer companies by 34.6 per cent, and therefore met the requisite performance
hurdle for full vesting. Of the 15 peer companies, only one company recorded a TSR outcome in excess of BHP Billiton’s, and 14 peer companies
recorded negative TSR performance over the five-year performance period.
Table of Contents
282
The impact of the TSR outperformance by BHP Billiton over the weighted average was to add US$78 billion of shareholder value from 1 July 2008
to 30 June 2013 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators (as shown in the graphs below).
The rules of the LTIP give the Committee discretion to reduce the number of awards that will vest, notwithstanding the fact that the performance
hurdle for full vesting has been met. This year, the Committee, with the support of the Board, exercised that discretion and reduced vesting by
35 per cent for all current and former participating GMC members. Accordingly, 35 per cent of awards will not vest and will instead lapse.
In doing so, the Committee took into account a range of factors, including the negative TSR over the five-year performance period that
shareholders have experienced. While the Committee recognised that the TSR performance was delivered in a difficult business environment, it
also felt that more closely aligning the experience of shareholders and executives was important. As always, the Committee also looked at the
total remuneration for executives.
This qualitative judgement, which is applied before final vesting is confirmed, is an important risk management aspect to ensure that vesting is not
simply driven by a formula that may give unexpected or unintended remuneration outcomes. While the Committee has exercised its discretion this
year, based on its consideration of all relevant factors, this does not imply the discretion will or will not be exercised in future years. The
Committee considers its discretion carefully each year, taking account of the circumstances that are relevant to the five-year period under
consideration.
A five-year history of BHP Billiton share prices and dividends is provided in section 6.4.8.

CEO award outcomes under the 2008 LTIP
When Andrew Mackenzie joined BHP Billiton in 2008, he was granted 450,964 awards based on the 2008 LTIP terms.
•
•
225,000 of the LTIP awards were granted in the ordinary course in connection with his role as Chief Executive Non-Ferrous and reflected the grant
sizes to the other business Chief Executives.
A further 225,964 awards (comprising 100,839 LTIP awards and 125,125 phantom LTIP awards) were granted in order to compensate him for equity
awards forgone when he left his former employer (‘Sign-on Awards’). The value and quantum of the sign-on awards was calculated by the
Committee’s independent adviser, Kepler Associates, and disclosed at the time.
As all of the 450,964 awards were granted on terms that mirrored the 2008 LTIP, they have now been tested against the TSR performance hurdle
and are all subject to the 35 per cent reduction.
In addition, Mr Mackenzie has concluded, and the Committee agrees, that despite the out performance of BHP Billiton compared to its peer group,
the value delivered through vesting of the sign-on awards would be excessive. Accordingly, Mr Mackenzie has elected to voluntarily relinquish a
further 50,000 of the sign-on awards, on top of the 35 per cent reduction.
This means 243,126 of the 450,964 awards originally granted to Mr Mackenzie have vested. The 243,126 vested awards are delivered to Mr
Mackenzie via 211,795 ordinary shares and a cash payment representing 31,331 phantom LTIP awards.
2007 allocations under the LTIP – tested to the end of FY2012 and vested in FY2013
As detailed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the performance period for the 2007 LTIP ended on 30 June 2012, and the 2007 LTIP vested in
August 2012. The number and value of vested Performance Shares for each GMC member are provided in section 6.4.3. Over the performance
period, BHP Billiton’s TSR was 41.6 per cent. In contrast, the weighted average TSR for the peer group against which the Group’s performance
was measured was negative 4.0 per cent. Of the 15 peer companies, only two companies recorded TSR outcomes in excess of BHP Billiton’s
41.6 per cent TSR performance (one at 45.6 per cent and one at 41.9 per cent), and eight peer companies recorded negative TSR performance
over the five-year performance period. The impact of this 45.6 per cent outperformance was to add US$75 billion of shareholder value from 1 July
2007 to 30 June 2012 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators.

Implementation of LTIP for FY2014
284
Within the LTIP rules, the maximum annual LTI award that can be allocated is set at a fair value of 200 per cent of the participant’s base salary.
Based on a fair value factor of 41 per cent (representing the probability of vesting), this equates to a maximum face value of 488 per cent of base
salary (i.e. 41 per cent of 488 per cent is 200 per cent). For the FY2014 awards, which are expected to be allocated in December 2013, the
Remuneration Committee has determined that the face value of LTI awards to GMC members will be in the range 300 per cent to 400 per cent of
base salary.
On the advice of the Committee, the Board has proposed an award of FY2014 Performance Shares for the CEO, with a face value of US$6,800,000
(and fair value of US$2,788,000). The face value is equal to 400 per cent of the CEO’s base salary. The same performance and service conditions
will be used for the FY2014 LTI award as was used for the FY2013 LTI awards for all GMC members.
If approved by shareholders, these FY2014 Performance Shares will be granted following the AGMs (i.e. in or around December 2013). The number
of Performance Shares allocated will be notified to shareholders, when provided, along with the number of Performance Shares that will be
granted to the other members of the GMC on the same date in respect of FY2014 LTI.
The actual number of Performance Shares to be granted will depend on the share price and exchange rate over the 12 months up to the date of
grant. As an illustration, if the Performance Shares had been granted on 30 August 2013, the number granted to the CEO would have been 196,234
Performance Shares.

6.3.5    Arrangements for GMC members leaving the Group after 30 June 2013
The arrangements for GMC members leaving the Group are within the approval provided by shareholders at the 2011 AGMs in regard to Australian
termination benefits legislation, including the provision of performance-based remuneration in accordance with the rules of the relevant short-
term incentive and the long-term incentive plans.
The rules of the GIS outline the circumstances in which participants may be entitled to a cash award for the financial year in which they cease
employment, and also in the event that cessation occurs after the end of the financial year but before the date the awards are provided. Such
circumstances depend on the reason for leaving. The Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion under the GIS to allow members of
the GMC who have retired or are retiring from BHP Billiton prior to the normal grant date of FY2013 deferred equity awards (i.e. in December 2013
after the AGMs) to receive all of their STI award for FY2013 in the form of cash. No deferral period will apply in respect of these cash STI awards.

Marius Kloppers will retire from BHP Billiton on 1 October 2013
Until his retirement, Mr Kloppers will receive his base salary and pension contributions and any applicable benefits. He will not receive any
additional payment in relation to his notice period. Upon his retirement, he will be entitled to the value of the pension and superannuation funds
that he has accumulated over his 20 years with the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that Mr Kloppers will receive a pro-rated FY2013 STI award in respect of his performance as CEO
from 1 July 2012 to 10 May 2013, as assessed by the Committee and described in section 6.3.3. He will receive this award in the form of cash. Mr
Kloppers will not be eligible to receive any STI payment for the period after 10 May 2013 until his retirement in October.
The Committee has assessed the performance of the FY2009 LTIP awards (granted December 2008) and determined vesting of these awards in
August 2013, as described in section 6.3.4. The remaining LTIP awards held by Mr Kloppers, which were granted from December 2009 to
December 2012, will be pro-rated, in accordance with the Group’s usual practice, to reflect the percentage of the performance period that has
elapsed to 1 October 2013. The remaining LTIP awards will lapse on 1 October 2013 (further details are in section 6.1). The vesting of the retained
pro-rated awards will be determined by the Committee at the relevant time in future years. The awards will only vest if the performance hurdle is
met at the end of each five-year performance period, subject to the Committee’s ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the plan
rules.
J Michael Yeager retired from BHP Billiton on 8 July 2013
Mike Yeager, previously Group Executive and Chief Executive, Petroleum, retired from the GMC on 1 July 2013 and from BHP Billiton on 8 July
2013. Mr Yeager has received base salary, pension and applicable benefits up to the date of his retirement. He has received a payment of 12
months base salary and pension in lieu of his notice period, and he has also received the value of the pension and superannuation funds that he
has accumulated during his service with the Group.
The Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Yeager would receive a FY2013 short-term incentive award, which was assessed by the
Committee, as described in section 6.3.3. He received this award in the form of cash.
Upon his retirement, the unvested deferred shares allocated to him in respect of FY2011 vested to him in full (Mr Yeager did not receive deferred
shares in FY2012), and his unvested LTIP awards were pro-rated, in accordance with the Group’s usual practice, to reflect the percentage of the
performance period that had elapsed to 8 July 2013. The vesting of the retained pro-rated awards will be determined by the Committee at the
relevant time in future years. The awards will only vest if the performance hurdle is met at the end of each five-year performance period, subject to
the Committee’s ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the plan rules.
Marcus Randolph retired from BHP Billiton on 2 September 2013
Until his retirement, Mr Randolph received his base salary and pension and any applicable benefits. He has received a payment of 12 months base
salary and pension in lieu of his notice period and is entitled to the value of the pension and superannuation funds that he accumulated over the
term of his service with the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that Mr Randolph would receive a pro-rated FY2013 short-term incentive award in respect of his
performance from 1 July 2012 to 10 May 2013, as assessed by the Committee and described in section 6.3.3. He received this award in the form of
cash. Mr Randolph was not eligible to receive any short-term incentive payment for the period after 10 May 2013 until his retirement on
2 September 2013. In accordance with the Group’s usual practice under the GIS, Deferred Shares, which were allocated to Mr Randolph in regard
to FY2012 performance (as shown in section 6.4.2), vested on 2 September 2013.

The Committee has assessed the performance of the FY2009 LTIP awards (granted December 2008) and determined vesting of these awards in
August 2013, as described in section 6.3.4. The remaining LTIP awards held by Mr Randolph, which were granted from December 2009 to
December 2012, were pro-rated, in accordance with the Group’s usual practice, to reflect the percentage of the performance period that had
elapsed to 2 September 2013. The remaining LTIP awards lapsed on 2 September 2013. The vesting of the retained pro-rated awards will be
determined by the Committee at the relevant time in future years. The awards will only vest if the performance hurdle is met at the end of each five-
year performance period, subject to the Committee’s ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the plan rules.
Alberto Calderon will leave BHP Billiton on 9 May 2014
Alberto Calderon, previously Group Executive and Chief Executive, Aluminium, Nickel & Corporate Development, retired from the GMC on 10 May
2013 and will remain as an adviser to the CEO until he leaves BHP Billiton on 9 May 2014.
In his position as adviser to the CEO, Mr Calderon will continue to receive his base salary and pension and any applicable benefits. He will not
receive any additional payment in relation to his notice period when he departs on 9 May 2014. Upon his departure, he will be entitled to the value
of the pension and superannuation funds that he has accumulated during his service with the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that Mr Calderon will receive a pro-rated FY2013 short-term incentive award in respect of his
performance as a member of the GMC from 1 July 2012 to 10 May 2013, as assessed by the Committee and described in section 6.3.3. He will
receive this award in the form of cash and deferred equity. Mr Calderon will not be eligible to receive any short-term incentive payment for the
period after 10 May 2013 until he leaves BHP Billiton on 9 May 2014. In accordance with the Group’s usual practice under the GIS, Deferred Shares,
which were allocated to Mr Calderon in regard to FY2012 performance (as shown in section 6.4.2), will vest on his leaving date.
The LTIP awards held by Mr Calderon, which were granted from December 2009 to December 2012, will be pro-rated on his departure in May 2014
to reflect the percentage of the performance period that has elapsed to 9 May 2013. The remaining LTIP awards will lapse. In August 2013, the
Committee assessed the performance of the LTIP awards granted in December 2008 and determined vesting as described in section 6.3.4. The
relevant portion of Mr Calderon’s awards were lapsed (for time to 9 May 2013) before the vesting result was applied. The vesting of the other
retained pro-rated awards will be determined by the Committee at the relevant time in future years. The awards will only vest if the performance
hurdle is met at the end of each five-year performance period, subject to the Committee’s ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the
plan rules.

Statutory remuneration disclosures for GMC members
6.4.1    Remuneration table
The table below has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 (and the Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 made thereunder) and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and relevant
accounting standards. Remuneration data for all KMP are pro-rated for the periods of FY2012 and FY2013 that each individual served as a
member of the GMC. An explanation of the share-based payments terms used in the table is provided following the table and associated
footnotes.
The figures provided in the shaded columns of the statutory table below for share-based payments were not actually provided to the KMP during
FY2013. These amounts are calculated in accordance with accounting standards and are the amortised IFRS fair values of equity and equity-
related instruments that have been granted to the executives, either in relation to FY2013 performance or that of prior financial years. Please refer
to sections 6.3.3, 6.3.4 and the remainder of this section for information on awards allocated during FY2012 and FY2013.

Base salaries are generally reviewed on 1 September each year, although during FY2013 changes were made at various times as a result of change
to the GMC structure during the year. Amounts shown in this table reflect the amounts paid over the 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June each year
pro-rated for time served on the GMC. All GMC base salaries are expressed and denominated in US dollars. More detail on base salaries is provided
in sections 6.2.10 and 6.3.2.
Annual cash incentive is the cash portion of STI awards earned in respect of performance during each financial year as described in sections 6.2.10 and 6.3.3. Section 6.3.3 shows
the STI award earned as a percentage of the maximum award, where the maximum possible award is 100 per cent. The remaining portion of the 100 per cent maximum has not been
earned (i.e. it has been ‘forfeited’). The minimum possible value awarded is nil. Actual payments are made in September, once performance has been assessed, e.g. in September
2013 for FY2013 awards or upon cessation of employment if earlier. The equity portion of STI awards is described in footnote (6) below.
Non-monetary benefits are non-pensionable and include such items as health and other insurances and fees for tax return preparation (in multiple jurisdictions, to a capped amount).
Other benefits are non-pensionable and include relocation allowances provided to Andrew Mackenzie, Mike Henry and Daniel Malchuk in regard to their international relocations, and
to Dean Dalla Valle in regard to his domestic relocation. These allowances are provided under the Group’s global mobility policy and are ’one-off’ payments with no trailing
entitlements. Other benefits also include payment of US$99,202 in lieu for leave accrued but not taken by Mr Yeager in FY2013, as US-based Group executives are not allowed to
roll forward annual leave entitlements from one financial year to the next.
Retirement benefits are calculated as a percentage of base salary for each GMC member, as set out in the table in section 6.3.2.
The percentage of the total remuneration for FY2013, which is made up of options and rights (excluding Geoff Healy who has not yet received any
allocations), ranges from 13 per cent for Daniel Malchuk to 64 per cent for Alberto Calderon

The amounts shown in this column are described below these footnotes. They may include awards paid in the form of cash where the individual ceases employment prior to the
scheduled allocation date of the awards, e.g. in December 2013 for FY2013 awards. Section 6.3.3 shows the STI awards earned as a percentage of the maximum award, where the
maximum possible award is 100 per cent. The remaining portion of the 100 per cent maximum has not been earned (i.e. it has been ‘forfeited’). These share-based payments may
also be forfeited after allocation in specific circumstances as described in section 6.2.10 and therefore, the minimum possible value of the awards is nil. The maximum possible
value cannot be determined as it depends on future share price movements, but is estimated by the IFRS fair value used for accounting purposes in this table. At the date of this
Annual Report, GMC members had not made their elections for Deferred Shares and/or Options in regard to FY2013 GIS awards. No GMC members elected to receive Options in
respect of FY2012 awards. The actual number of Deferred Shares allocated in respect of FY2012 awards is shown in section 6.4.2. Section 6.4.7 also describes the Shareplus
program and the rights to acquire Matching Shares are included as share-based remuneration in the table.
The amounts shown in this column are described below these footnotes. Section 6.3.4 shows the LTI provided as a percentage of the maximum award, where the maximum possible
award is 100 per cent. The remaining portion of the 100 per cent maximum has not been earned (i.e. it has been ‘forfeited’). These share-based payments may also be forfeited after
allocation in specific circumstances as described in section 6.2.10 and therefore the minimum possible value of the awards is nil. The maximum possible value cannot be
determined as it depends on future share price movements, but is estimated by the IFRS fair value used for accounting purposes in this table. Details of individual awards are set
out in the table in section 6.4.3 and 6.4.6. This column also includes the amount allocated to remuneration for each year in respect of awards received by Mr Mackenzie on
commencement of employment with BHP Billiton, the vesting outcomes of which are described in section 6.3.4. These awards, are in the form of Performance Shares allocated on
4 December 2008 as shown in the table in section 6.4.3 and conditional rights to receive cash sums under two phantom awards, which are treated as cash-settled share-based
payments and are included in this column for the purposes of remuneration. The awards were approved by the Remuneration Committee for the purposes of compensating Mr
Mackenzie for awards forgone by him as a result of leaving his former employer. The awards were subject to performance and/or service conditions. The value and nature of the
awards were determined by the Committee as being an equivalent fair value as that forgone by Mr Mackenzie under the at risk remuneration arrangements operated by his former
employer. In valuing the awards, the Committee sought the advice of its independent adviser, Kepler Associates. Full details of the awards were disclosed in the FY2009 Annual
Report.
All remuneration details for FY2013 are for the part of the year relating to service as members of the GMC. This includes the amount of base salary
and retirement benefits provided for the part of the year as members of the GMC, and the relevant portions of non-monetary benefits and of annual
relocation allowances which were paid in relation to international moves prior to their appointment as members of the GMC. The amount shown as
annual cash incentive is the amount of cash STI paid for performance for the period as GMC members. The amounts included in share-based
payments include the amortised IFRS fair value of awards provided under the MAP and GSTIP equity plans and as Shareplus Matched Shares prior
to appointment as members of the GMC.

Table of Contents
The value of STI and Shareplus awards shown in the table includes:
•
•
the estimated IFRS fair value of Deferred Shares and Options provided as equity or cash settled share-based payments under the GIS and GSTIP as
shown in sections 6.4.2 and 6.4.5. The IFRS fair value of the Deferred Shares and Options is estimated at grant date by discounting the total value of
the shares that will be issued in the future using the risk-free interest rate for the period to the date of award. Participants who are provided with awards
under the GIS are entitled to a DEP in lieu of the dividends that would have been payable on ordinary BHP Billiton shares over the period from the
allocation date to the time their award vests or is exercised and they receive ordinary shares in BHP Billiton. Prior to FY2011 awards, a similar DEP
entitlement applied to GSTIP Deferred Shares and Options. This is not the case with awards allocated since October 2011. From FY2011, there was a
change in accounting policy to account for the DEP from cash-settled to equity-settled. Deferred Shares and Options are awarded to participants
following the relevant AGMs (awards to the CEO are subject to shareholder approval). If employment ceases prior to that scheduled allocation of
equity awards, the value of the awards may be provided in cash, but would still be included in this column of table 6.4.1. Once awarded, the only
vesting condition is for participants to remain in employment for two further years. Accordingly, the number of securities (if any) that will ultimately vest
cannot be determined until the service period has been completed. The estimated IFRS fair value of the Deferred Shares and Options forms part of the
STI at risk remuneration appearing throughout this Remuneration Report. The IFRS fair value of Deferred Shares and Options is apportioned to annual
remuneration based on the expected future service period, which is normally three years. The vesting of Deferred Shares and Options may be
accelerated in the event of leaving the Group, in which case the expected future service period is amended;
the estimated IFRS fair value of rights to Matching Shares acquired during each share purchase period under the Shareplus program, as described in
section 6.4.7. These rights are acquired on each of the quarterly share purchase dates under the program (grant dates), and the IFRS fair value is
apportioned to annual remuneration based on the future service period required for the Matching Shares to be allocated (i.e. the vesting date of the
rights). Where entitlements to the Matching Shares are accelerated on leaving the Group, the expected future service period is amended.
The value of LTI awards shown in the table includes:
•
Performance Shares allocated under the LTIP, Restricted Shares under the MAP and Performance-conditional Restricted Shares awarded as
Transitional GMC grants as shown in sections 6.4.3, 6.4.4 and 6.4.6 are defined as equity-settled share-based payments. The amount in respect of
each LTI award is the estimated IFRS fair value of the Performance Shares as determined by Kepler Associates using a Monte Carlo simulation
methodology taking account of the performance hurdle, the term of the award, the share price at grant date, the expected price volatility of the
underlying share, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the award and the value of the DEP that will be received on exercise of the award. The IFRS
fair value of each award is apportioned to annual remuneration in equal amounts to each of the years in the expected future service period, which is
normally five years. Where entitlements to Performance Shares are preserved on leaving the Group, the expected future service period is amended.
Equity awards
The following sections set out the interests held by members of the GMC under the Group’s equity plans. Each equity award is a conditional right
to acquire one ordinary share in BHP Billiton Limited or in BHP Billiton Plc upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions. The vesting conditions will
include performance and/or service requirements as relevant to the purpose of the award and as described in each of the following sections. The
value of awards over BHP Billiton Limited shares is shown in Australian dollars and of securities over BHP Billiton Plc shares in Sterling.
The awards are not ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights. Dividends are not received by
the executives during the vesting period. Unless stated otherwise in the
Table of Contents
291
following sections, a DEP (as described in section 6.2.10) is provided to cover the period between grant and the provision of the ordinary shares
to the holder. A DEP is only provided in relation to awards that have vested upon satisfaction of the relevant conditions. This payment is not made
in relation to any securities that are forfeited during the vesting period.
The Securities Dealing Group Level Document governs and restricts dealing arrangements and the provision of shares on vesting or exercise of
awards.
Equity awards provided for GMC service
6.4.2    STI awards of Deferred Shares and Options under the GIS
Awards under the GIS will not deliver any value to the holder for at least two years from the beginning of the financial year in which they are
granted (unless the executive’s employment with the Group ends earlier in specific circumstances, such as on death, serious injury, disability or
illness, retirement with the agreement of the Company and redundancy/retrenchment).
The terms and conditions of the GIS are largely the same as those of the new STIP, as set out in section 6.2.10, which will replace the GIS from
FY2014. The main differences as noted throughout section 6.2.10 are:
•
•
•
•
the maximum potential award under the GIS is 320 per cent of base salary (240 per cent under the new STIP);
DEP is provided in cash under the GIS (intended to be provided in shares under the new STIP);
GIS awards vest in full on cessation of employment in circumstances, including retirement and redundancy (awards remain unvested under the new
STIP until the scheduled vesting time);
the malus and clawback provisions are strengthened in the new STIP.
Each employee may nominate to receive GIS awards in the form of Options or in the form of Deferred Shares or a combination thereof. The
Options have an exercise price determined by the weighted average price at which BHP Billiton shares were traded over the one week up to and
including the date of grant. This is the amount payable by the individual to exercise each Option. A greater number of Options are therefore
allocated if an executive chooses this alternative.

The holding period for each award ends on 30 June in the year the award ‘may vest and become exercisable’ if the conditions for vesting are met
(including the relevant service conditions). Under the GIS rules, awards will vest and become exercisable on, or as soon as practicable after, the first
non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June. The expiry date of awards is the day prior to the third anniversary of that vesting date.
The market price shown for the December 2012 grant is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on 5 December 2012. No price is payable by the
individual for acquiring the Deferred Shares at the time of grant. The grant date IFRS fair value of each Deferred Shares is estimated as at the start of
the vesting period, being 1 July 2012 and were A$31.72 and £18.30.
All (100 per cent) of the awards granted under the GIS in December 2010 became fully vested on 3 October 2012 as the service conditions were met,
as described in footnote 1. The price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on that date.
The market price shown (and used for calculating the aggregate gain) is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the date that the individual exercised their award.
The amounts shown in this column are the value of the DEP paid on the awards, as described in section 6.2.10.
On 10 May 2013, when Andrew Mackenzie was appointed as a Director, and Marius Kloppers retired as a Director, their holdings were the same as at 30 June 2013.
Alberto Calderon exercised some of his vested Deferred Shares on 3 October 2012, and the remainder on 18 December 2013.
The December 2012 GIS Deferred Shares for Mr Calderon will vest on his departure from BHP Billiton in May 2014.
The December 2012 GIS Deferred Shares for Marcus Randolph vested on his departure from BHP Billiton on 2 September 2013.
6.4.3    LTI awards of Performance Shares under the LTIP
Awards under the LTIP will not deliver any value to the holder for at least five years from the beginning of the financial year in which they are
granted (unless the executive’s employment with the Group ends earlier in specific circumstances, such as on death, serious injury, disability or
illness).
The terms and conditions of the LTIP, including the performance conditions, are described in sections 6.2.10 and 6.3.4. The key differences
between the prior LTIP and the new LTIP (effective from December 2013 allocations) are:
•
•
under the new LTIP, DEP is intended to be provided in the form of shares (rather than in cash);
the malus and clawback provisions are strengthened in the new LTIP.

The performance period for each award ends on 30 June in the year the award ‘may vest and become exercisable’ if the conditions for vesting are met (including if the relevant
performance hurdle is achieved). Under the LTIP rules, awards will vest and become exercisable on, or as soon as practicable after, the first non-prohibited period date occurring
after 30 June. The expiry date of awards is the day prior to the fifth anniversary of that vesting date.
The market price shown for the December 2012 grant is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on 5 December 2012. No price is payable by the individual for acquiring the
Performance Shares at the time of grant. The accounting grant date IFRS fair values of the awards are estimated as at the start of the vesting period, being 1 July 2012, using a
Monte Carlo simulation, and were A$14.16 and £7.91.
All (100 per cent) of the Performance Shares granted under the LTIP in December 2007 became fully vested on 2 October 2012, following the performance hurdle being fully
achieved and the Remuneration Committee considering its discretion over the vesting outcome, as described in section 6.3.4. The price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton
shares on that date.
The market price shown (and used for calculating the aggregate gain) is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the date that the individual exercised their Performance Shares.
No price is payable by the individual for exercising the Performance Shares. One ordinary BHP Billiton share is acquired for each Performance Share exercised.
The amounts shown in this column are the value of DEP paid on awards as described in section 6.2.10.
The awards allocated to Andrew Mackenzie on 4 December 2008 included 225,000 Performance Shares allocated to him as part of FY2009 Total Remuneration and a further 100,839
Performance Shares allocated to him on commencement with BHP Billiton, in relation to at risk rewards forfeited when he left his former employer. More information on Mr
Mackenzie’s commencement arrangements is included in footnote 7 to the table in section 6.4.1.

On 10 May 2013, when Andrew Mackenzie was appointed as a Director, and Marius Kloppers retired as a Director, their holdings were the same as at 30 June 2013.
The Unvested LTIP awards held by members of the GMC on the date that they leave BHP Billiton in FY2014 have been, or will be, pro-rated as set out in section 6.3.5 and remain
subject to performance and vesting conditions.
6.4.4    Awards of Performance-conditional Restricted Shares as Transitional GMC grants
As shown in section 6.4.6, the final MAP awards allocated to Mr Henry and Mr Kerr in November 2011 in their non-GMC management positions
have a three-year service condition and are due to vest in 2014. The LTIP awards provided to Mr Henry and Mr Kerr in December 2012 as GMC
members, and shown in section 6.4.3 have a five-year service and performance condition and may vest in 2017. Therefore, as a transitional step,
Mr Henry and Mr Kerr also received Transitional GMC awards in December 2012 as shown in the table below. The Remuneration Committee may
determine that similar awards be allocated in December 2013 to individuals who have joined the GMC since May 2013 from within the Company.
These awards have two tranches. Tranche one has a three-year service and performance condition and may vest in 2015. Tranche two has a four-
year service and performance condition and may vest in 2016. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine if the performance condition
has been met and whether any, all or some of the Restricted Shares will vest (or otherwise lapse), having regard to (but not limited to) BHP
Billiton’s TSR over the three- or four-year performance period (respectively), the participant’s contribution to Group outcomes and the
participant’s personal performance (with guidance on this assessment from the CEO). No DEP is payable on these awards.
The treatment of the awards on cessation of employment will depend on the circumstances and is similar to those for LTIP awards. If the
participant’s employment ceases due to dismissal or resignation, any unvested awards will lapse immediately. If the reason for cessation is death,
serious injury, disability or illness, then the awards will vest in full on the date of cessation. If the participant retires from the Group with the
agreement of the Company, is made redundant or employment is terminated by mutual agreement, then a proportion of the award (pro-rated to
reflect the percentage of the Performance Period that has elapsed) will continue on foot and vest, subject to the performance condition, on the
future vesting date. The remaining Restricted Shares will lapse. In all other circumstances, the Committee in its absolute discretion will determine
the number of Restricted Shares that vest (or lapse).

The holding period for each award ends on 30 June in the year the award ‘may vest’ if the conditions for vesting are met as described above the table. Awards will vest on or as soon
as practicable after the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June.
The market prices shown are the closing prices of BHP Billiton shares on 5 December 2012. No price is payable by the individual for acquiring the Restricted Shares at the time of
grant. The grant date IFRS fair values of the awards are estimated at the start of the vesting period, being 1 July 2012, and were $28.90 and £16.33 for tranche one, and A$28.10
and £15.78 for tranche two.
Equity awards provided for pre-GMC service
6.4.5    STI awards of Deferred Shares and Options under the GSTIP and GIS
The table below shows awards that were held by the executives at the time that they were appointed to the GMC or were allocated in relation to
performance and service before they became GMC members.
Prior to their appointment as members of the GMC, the individuals listed in the tables below received STl awards:
•
•
under the Group Short Term Incentive Plan (GSTIP), which has applied for the non-GMC management of BHP Billiton since the awards allocated in
FY2010 (in relation to FY2009 performance);
prior to that under the GIS, which applied to non-GMC management (as well as to the GMC members) before the GSTIP was introduced.
The terms and conditions of the GSTIP awards are essentially the same as those provided under the GIS. Under both plans, participants must
satisfy applicable STl performance conditions in order to be eligible for any award. Due to changes in the GSTIP, which applied to all participants
in that plan, no DEP is payable on the GSTIP awards that were allocated in FY2012 (in relation to FY2011 performance) or since that time.

The opening balance shown for individuals who have become KMP upon joining the GMC on 10 May 2013 reflects their holdings on that date (rather
than on 1 July 2012).
The holding period for each award ends on 30 June in the year the award ‘may vest and become exercisable’ if the conditions for vesting are met
(including the relevant service conditions). Under the GSTIP, awards will vest and become exercisable on, or as soon as practicable after, the first
non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June. Where applicable, the expiry date of awards is the day prior to the third anniversary of that vesting
date.

The market price shown for grants during FY2013 is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the relevant date of grant. No price is payable by the individual for acquiring the
Deferred Shares at the time of grant. The grant date IFRS fair values of the awards are estimated as at the start of the vesting period, being 1 July 2012, and were A$31.72 and
£18.30.
All (100 per cent) of the Deferred Shares granted under the GSTIP in October 2010 became fully vested on 3 October 2012 as the service conditions were met, as described in
footnote 1. The price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on that date.
The market price shown (and used for calculating the aggregate gain) is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the date that the individual exercised their Deferred Shares. No
price is payable by the individual for exercising the Deferred Shares. One ordinary BHP Billiton share is acquired for each Deferred Share exercised.
The amounts shown in this column are the value of the DEP paid on the awards as described in section 6.2.10.
The awards shown for Graham Kerr and Mike Henry with a grant date of 22 August 2013 had this allocation date due to administrative reasons, but were made on the same basis as
if they had been made on 5 December 2012.
6.4.6    LTI awards of Restricted Shares under the MAP and Performance Shares under the LTIP
The table below shows awards that were held by the executives at the time that they were appointed to the GMC.
Prior to their appointment as members of the GMC, the individuals listed in the tables below received LTI awards:
•
•
under the Management Award Plan (MAP), which has applied for the non-GMC management of BHP Billiton since FY2009;
prior to that under the LTIP, which applied to non-GMC management (as well as to the GMC members) before the MAP was introduced.
Mr Henry and Mr Kerr received their first LTIP awards as members of the GMC in December 2012 as shown in section 6.3.4. Other GMC members
listed will receive their first LTIP award in December 2013.
Table of Contents
300
The vesting of MAP awards is subject to a service condition of continued employment with the Group through to the vesting date as shown in the
table below. Where a participant resigns or is terminated for cause prior to the vesting date, their unvested MAP awards are forfeited. If a
participant’s employment ends due to death, illness or injury, a pro rata number of unvested Restricted Shares will vest based on the portion of
the relevant vesting period served. Due to changes in the MAP, which applied to all participants in that plan, no DEP is payable on the MAP
awards that were allocated in FY2012 or since that time.

The opening balance shown for individuals who have become KMP upon joining the GMC on 10 May 2013 reflects their holdings on that date (rather than on 1 July 2012).

The holding period for each award ends on 30 June in the year the award ‘may vest and become exercisable’ if the conditions for vesting are met (including the relevant service
conditions). Under the MAP rules, awards will vest and become exercisable on, or as soon as practicable after, the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June. Where
applicable, expiry date of awards is the day prior to the third anniversary of that vesting date.
The market prices shown for grants during FY2013 are the closing prices of BHP Billiton shares on the relevant date of grant. No price is payable by
the individual for acquiring the Restricted Shares at the time of grant. The grant date IFRS fair values of the awards are estimated as at the start of the
vesting period, being 1 July 2012, and were A$31.72 and £18.30. No exercise requirement or expiry date applies to these awards (as described
above the table).
All (100 per cent) of the Restricted Shares granted under the MAP in October 2009 became fully vested on 3 October 2012 as the service conditions were met as in footnote (1). The
price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on that date.
The market price shown (and used for calculating the aggregate gain) is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the date that the individual exercised their Restricted Shares. No
price is payable by the individual for exercising the Restricted Shares. One ordinary BHP Billiton share is acquired for each Restricted Share exercised.
The amounts shown in this column are the value of the DEP paid on the awards as described in section 6.2.10.
During FY2012, two MAP awards were allocated to Mr Henry and Mr Kerr. An initial grant of Restricted Shares was provided on the relevant date of grant at the same time and on
the same basis as allocations for all other non-GMC management. Additional awards were provided on 25 November 2011 in recognition of their increased responsibilities as
members of the GMC over the remainder of FY2012.

6.4.7    Awards of Matched Shares under the Shareplus all-employee share purchase plan
Like all permanent employees, members of the GMC are eligible to participate in Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan. For
administrative simplicity in regard to stock exchange dealings and announcements, no GMC members currently participate. This table shows
Shareplus holdings previously accumulated by members of the GMC, including during the period before they joined the GMC.
Participants in Shareplus contribute from their post-tax base salary (capped at US$5,000 per year) to acquire shares in BHP Billiton Limited or in
BHP Billiton Plc. For each share purchased, the participant receives a right to acquire a Matched Share, which vests provided the participant
remains employed by BHP Billiton on the third anniversary of the start of the relevant Shareplus Plan Year.
Differences in exchange rates in relation to the base salaries of the participants in previous financial years and the currencies of each securities
exchange result in minor differences in the numbers of shares allocated.

The opening balance shown for individuals who have become KMP upon joining the GMC on 10 May 2013 reflects their holdings on that date (rather than on 1 July 2012).
Rights to Matched Shares were granted quarterly during FY2013 as the participant purchased shares in BHP Billiton under the plan (Acquired Shares) for the 2012 Shareplus Plan
Year (i.e. from salary contributions from June 2012 to May 2013).
Matched Shares allocated upon the vesting of rights acquired during the 2010 Shareplus Plan Year (i.e. from salary contributions from June 2010 to May 2011).
The market price shown (and used for calculating the aggregate gain) is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the relevant vesting date. Matched Shares are allocated on
vesting. There is no exercise action required by the holder and no DEP is payable.
On 10 May 2013, when Andrew Mackenzie was appointed as a Director, and Marius Kloppers retired as a Director, their holdings were the same as
at 30 June 2013.
Unvested rights to Matched Shares held by members of the GMC on the date that they leave BHP Billiton in FY2014 will vest on their date of departure.
Mike Yeager received American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange, each equivalent to two BHP Billiton Limited shares.
6.4.8    Estimated value range of equity awards
The current face value of STI and LTI awards allocated during FY2013 and yet to vest (to be disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001)
is the number of awards as set out in the previous tables multiplied by the current share price of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc as
applicable.

The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on, and therefore fluctuates with, the
share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc at the date that any particular award is exercised. The table below provides five-year
share price history for BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc, and history of dividends paid.

Company, section 3 Operating and financial review and prospects, section 4 Board of Directors and Group Management Committee, section 5

Annual Report are each incorporated by reference into, and form part of, this Directors’ Report.
7.1    Principal activities, state of affairs and business review
The UK Companies Act 2006 requires this Directors’ Report to include a fair review of the business of the Group during FY2013 and of the
position of the Group at the end of the financial year and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group (known as the
‘business review’). In addition to the information set out below, the information that fulfils the requirements of the business review can be found in

A review of the operations of the Group during FY2013, the results of those operations during FY2013 and the expected results of those
operations in future financial years, are set out in sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.2 and 3 and other material in this Annual Report. Information on the
development of the Group and likely developments in future years also appear in those sections of this Annual Report. We have excluded certain
information from the Operating and financial review and prospects in section 3 (which forms part of this Directors’ Report) on the basis that
including the information would cause unreasonable prejudice to the Group because such disclosure could be misleading due to the premature
nature of the information, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would undermine confidentiality between the Group and its suppliers and
clients, or would otherwise unreasonably damage the business. The categories of information omitted include forward looking estimates and
projections prepared for internal management purposes, information regarding the Group’s assets and projects, which is embryonic and
susceptible to change, and information relating to commercial contracts or pricing modules.
Our principal activities during FY2013 were exploration, development, production and processing of minerals (in respect of iron ore, metallurgical
and energy coal, copper, aluminium, manganese, uranium, nickel, silver and potash), and exploration, development and production of
conventional and unconventional oil and gas. During FY2013, we completed the sale of our diamonds and titanium minerals businesses. Further
information in relation to these sales is provided in sections 2.2.6, 3 and 5 of this Annual Report. Other than these developments, no significant
changes in the nature of the Group’s principal activities occurred during FY2013.
Information in relation to significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group that occurred during FY2013 and significant post-balance date
events is set out in sections 2.2, 3 and 5.3 of this Annual Report.
No other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2013 that has significantly affected or is expected to significantly affect the
operations, the results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in future years.

7.2    Share capital and buy-back programs
308
At the Annual General Meetings held in 2012, shareholders authorised BHP Billiton Plc to make on-market purchases of up to 213,618,545 of its
ordinary shares, representing approximately 10 per cent of BHP Billiton Plc’s issued share capital at that time. During FY2013, we did not make
any on-market or off-market purchases of BHP Billiton Limited shares or BHP Billiton Plc shares under any share buy-back program.
Shareholders will be asked at the 2013 Annual General Meetings to renew this authority. The Directors have no present intention to exercise this
authority, if granted.
Some of our executives receive options over BHP Billiton shares as part of their remuneration arrangements. Entitlements may be satisfied by the
transfer of existing shares, which are acquired on-market, or in respect of some entitlements, by the issue of new shares.
The shares in column ‘A’ below were purchased to satisfy awards made under the various BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc employee
share schemes during FY2013.

Group’s capital management objectives, its approach to financial risk management and exposure to financial risks, liquidity and borrowing
facilities.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore they continue to adopt the going-concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements.

7.5.1    Remuneration
The policy for determining the nature and amount of emoluments of members of the Group Management Committee (GMC) (including the

to the financial statements.
We have not made available to any Director any interest in a registered scheme.
The former Directors of BHP Limited participated in a retirement plan under which they were entitled to receive a payment on retirement calculated
by reference to years of service. This plan was closed on 24 October 2003, and benefits accrued to that date are held by BHP Billiton Limited and

7.6    Secretaries
Jane McAloon is the Group Company Secretary. Details of her qualifications and experience are set out in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this Annual
Report. The following people also act as the Company Secretaries of either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc: Nicola Kleynhans, BBus,
Deputy Company Secretary, BHP Billiton Limited and Nicole Duncan BA (Hons), LLB, Company Secretary, BHP Billiton Limited, and Geof
Stapledon, BEc, LLB (Hons), DPhil, FCIS, Deputy Company Secretary, BHP Billiton Plc, and Elizabeth Hobley, BA (Hons), ACIS, Deputy Company
Secretary, BHP Billiton Plc. Each such individual has experience in a company secretariat role or other relevant fields arising from time spent in
such roles within BHP Billiton, large listed companies or other relevant entities.
7.7    Indemnities and insurance
Rule 146 of the BHP Billiton Limited Constitution and Article 146 of the BHP Billiton Plc Articles of Association require each Company to
indemnify to the extent permitted by law, each Director, Secretary or Executive Officer of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc respectively
against liability incurred in, or arising out of, the conduct of the business of the Company or the discharge of the duties of the Director, Secretary
and Executive Officer. The Directors named in section 4.1 of this Annual Report, the Executive Officers and the Company Secretaries of BHP
Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have the benefit of this requirement, as do individuals who formerly held one of those positions.
In accordance with this requirement, BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have entered into Deeds of Indemnity, Access and Insurance
(Deeds of Indemnity) with each of their respective Directors. The Deeds of Indemnity are qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the
purposes of the UK Companies Act 2006.
We have a policy that we will, as a general rule, support and hold harmless an employee, including an employee appointed as a Director of a
subsidiary who, while acting in good faith, incurs personal liability to others as a result of working for us.
Table of Contents
311
From time to time, we engage our External Auditor, KPMG, to conduct non-statutory audit work and provide other services in accordance with our
policy on the provision of other services by the External Auditor. The terms of engagement typically include an indemnity in favour of KPMG:
•
•
against all losses, claims, costs, expenses, actions, demands, damages, liabilities or any proceedings (liabilities) incurred by KPMG in respect of third
party claims arising from a breach by the Group under the engagement terms;
for all liabilities KPMG has to the Group or any third party as a result of reliance on information provided by the Group that is false, misleading or
incomplete.
We have insured against amounts that we may be liable to pay to Directors, Company Secretaries or certain employees pursuant to Rule 146 of
the Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited and Article 146 of the Articles of Association of BHP Billiton Plc or that we otherwise agree to pay by way
of indemnity. The insurance policy also insures Directors, Company Secretaries and some employees against certain liabilities (including legal
costs) they may incur in carrying out their duties for us.
We have paid premiums for this ‘Directors and Officers’ insurance of US$2,124,852 net during FY2013. Directors, Company Secretaries and
employees insured under the policy contribute to the premium for this insurance.
No indemnity in favour of a current or former officer of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc, or in favour of the External Auditor, has been
called on during FY2013.
7.8    Employee policies and involvement
We are committed to open, honest and productive relationships with our employees. At BHP Billiton, we recognise the most important ingredient
for success is our talented and motivated workforce, whose members demonstrate behaviours that are aligned to Our BHP Billiton Charter values.
We have an integrated people strategy to effectively attract, retain and develop talented people. Our approach is outlined in Our Charter, the BHP
Billiton Code of Business Conduct and the Group Level Documents (GLDs) that prescribe what we will do and how we will do it. All of these
documents are published and accessible to employees.
Effective communication and employee engagement is critical for maintaining open and productive relationships between leaders and employees.
Employees receive communication on BHP Billiton goals and performance, as well as on other important issues such as health and safety and
the environment and the Code of Business Conduct. Our Code of Business Conduct is founded on Our Charter values, which make an
unqualified commitment to working with integrity. Communication is undertaken through a variety of channels, including the internet, intranet,
email, newsletters and other means designed to cater for the local environment. These tools are also used to facilitate employee feedback, as are a
variety of consultative processes. Dispute and grievance handling processes are also in place to assist in equitably addressing workplace issues
in all businesses. A Business Conduct Advisory Service operates worldwide to allow concerns to be raised about conduct that is out of step with
Our Charter values, our policies and procedures or the law.
Our all-employee share purchase plan, Shareplus, is available to all permanent full-time and part-time employees, and those on fixed-term
contracts, except where local regulations limit operation of the scheme. In these instances, alternative arrangements are in place. As at 30 June
2013, 24,746 employees, or approximately 50.1 per cent of those eligible for the April 2013 offer, were participants in Shareplus. The Shareplus
employee plan is described in section 6.3.2 of this Annual Report. Short-term and long-term incentive schemes also operate across the Group.
Rewards for eligible individuals are predicated on the need to meet targets relating to the Group’s performance in areas such as health, safety and
achievement of financial measures and on the personal performance of each employee.
Table of Contents
312
Our performance management process aligns individual performance and behaviour to Our Charter and our strategic and operational priorities,
as well as working to ensure that individual and team performance is recognised. Our leaders are accountable for providing constructive feedback
and identifying development needs to help our employees maximise their performance and realise their full potential. In FY2013, 68 per cent of
employees participated in a formal performance review process. Due to industrial agreements, not all employees are able to participate in
individual performance or reward programs. The importance we place on employee development and training is demonstrated by the significant
amount of training our employees undertake.
BHP Billiton is committed to building and maintaining a diverse workforce and providing a work environment in which every employee is treated
fairly and with respect. We work actively to avoid discrimination on any basis, including disability. Where an employee suffers some disability
while they are employed, we work to identify roles that meet their skill, experience and capability, and in some cases offer retraining. We also offer
flexible work practices, where this is possible, taking into account the needs of the employee and those of the particular workplace. The
employment packages under our remuneration policy, which must comply with local regulations, are aligned to our business requirements and
are designed to be sufficiently attractive to recruit and retain the best people.
Our employees can access our Annual Reports either via the internet or hard copy.
7.9    Corporate Governance
The UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 7.2) require that certain information be included in a corporate
governance statement set out in the Directors’ Report. BHP Billiton has an existing practice of issuing a separate corporate governance statement
as part of its Annual Report. The information required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s
Listing Rules (LR 9.8.6) is located in section 5 of this Annual Report, with the exception of the information referred to in DTR 7.2.6, which is located
in section 7.22 of this Annual Report.
7.10    Dividends
A final dividend of 59 US cents per share will be paid on 25 September 2013. Details of the dividends paid and the dividend policy are set out in
sections 3.7.6 and 11.3 of this Annual Report.
7.11    Auditors
A resolution to appoint KPMG LLP as the auditor of BHP Billiton Plc will be proposed at the 2013 Annual General Meetings in accordance with
section 489 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
Mr Maxsted was the only officer of BHP Billiton during FY2013 who was a director or partner of the Group’s External Auditor at a time when the
Group’s External Auditor conducted an audit of the Group. Mr Maxsted’s prior relationship with KPMG is set out in section 5.9 of this Annual
Report. Mr Maxsted was not part of the KPMG audit practice after 1980 and, while at KPMG, was not in any way involved in, or able to influence,
any audit activity associated with BHP Billiton.
Each person who held the office of Director at the date the Board resolved to approve this Directors’ Report makes the following statements:
•
•
so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s External Auditor is unaware;
the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the Group’s External Auditor is aware of that information.

7.12    Non-audit services
313
Details of the non-audit services undertaken by our External Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, are set out in note 35
‘Auditor’s remuneration’ to the financial statements. All non-audit services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the Policy on
Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor, and no non-audit services were carried out that were specifically excluded by the
Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. Based on advice provided by the Risk and Audit Committee, the
Directors have formed the view that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and
that the nature of non-audit services means that auditor independence was not compromised. Further information about our policy in relation to
the provision of non-audit services by the auditor is set out in section 5.13.1 of this Annual Report.
7.13    Value of land
Much of our interest in land consists of leases and other rights that permit exploration and production on that land, including the erection of
buildings and equipment thereon for the purpose of extracting and processing minerals. Land is mainly carried in the accounts at cost and it is
not possible to estimate the market value as it is not readily discernible from the estimated value of each operation situated on the land.
7.14    Political and charitable donations
No political contributions/donations for political purposes were made to any political party, politician, elected official or candidate for public office
during FY2013.
In FY2013, we made charitable donations for the purposes of funding community programs in the United Kingdom of US$46,689 (cash) (2012:
US$71,000). Our worldwide voluntary community investment totalled US$245.8 million (2012: US$214.1 million), comprising cash, in-kind support
and administrative costs, and included a US$106 million contribution to the BHP Billiton Foundation. For further information, refer to section
2.8.13 of this Annual Report.
7.15    Exploration, research and development
Companies within the Group carry out exploration and research and development necessary to support their activities. Further details are
provided in sections 2.2, 2.5 and 2.6 of this Annual Report.
7.16    Creditor payment policy
When we enter into a new contract with a supplier, payment terms will be communicated with the supplier in the negotiation phase of the contract
and confirmed upon both parties signing and executing the agreement. Our approach to payment terms is outlined in our GLD that prescribes
what we will do and how we will do it. We settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing overall terms of business, and seek to abide by the
terms of the contracts to which we are bound. As at 30 June 2013, BHP Billiton Plc (the unconsolidated parent entity) had US$1,286,242 of trade
creditors outstanding, which represents 65 days of purchases outstanding in respect of costs, based on the total invoiced by suppliers during
FY2013. The calculated 65 days is impacted by the quantum of invoices received during the last week in June (2013: US$1.3 million, 2012: US$0.2
million), which are included in the 30 June creditor balance. All invoices received in June 2013 were fully paid within 30 days after year-end.
7.17    Class order
BHP Billiton Limited is a company of a kind referred to in Australian Securities and Investments Commission Class Order No. 98/100, dated
10 July 1998. Amounts in this Directors’ Report and the financial statements, except estimates of future expenditure or where otherwise indicated,
have been rounded to the nearest million dollars in accordance with that Class Order.

7.21    Performance in relation to environmental regulation
A significant environmental incident is one with a severity rating of four or above based on our internal severity rating scale (tiered from one to
seven by increasing severity). There were no significant environmental incidents reported at our controlled operations in FY2013.
Fines and prosecutions
In FY2013, BHP Billiton received eight fines at our controlled operations with a total value of US$195,405.
We received a fine of US$181,581, levied in South Africa, for activities relating to the establishment of fuel, water and effluent infrastructure that
were undertaken at our Wolvekrans Colliery without approval under the National Environment Management Act (NEMA) of 1998. We have
instituted corrective measures, which include putting in place a process to ensure that all necessary approvals are obtained before any new
mining activity commences.
The seven other fines, totalling US$13,824, were levied in Australia, where our operations were cited for activities in relation to exceeding allowable
discharge limits, excessive dust generation and release events. We have instituted preventive measures for all these occurrences.
Further information in relation to environmental performance, including environmental regulation, can be found in section 2.8 of this Annual
Report and in the Sustainability Report available online at www.bhpbilliton.com.

8    Legal proceedings
317
We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and governmental investigations of a character normally incidental to our business,
including claims and pending actions against us seeking damages or clarification of legal rights and regulatory inquiries regarding business
practices. In many cases, insurance or other indemnification protection afforded to us relates to such claims and may offset the financial impact
on the Group of a successful claim.
This section summarises the significant legal proceedings and investigations in which we are currently involved.
Rio Algom Pension Plan
In June 2003, Alexander E Lomas, a retired member of the Pension Plan for Salaried Employees of Rio Algom Mines Limited (Plan), filed a Notice
of Application in a representative capacity in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice Commercial List against Rio Algom Limited (RAL) and the Plan
Trustee alleging certain improprieties in their administration of the Pension Plan and use of Pension Plan funds from January 1966 onward.
Mr Lomas seeks relief, both quantified and unquantified, for himself and those Plan members he purports to represent in respect of a number of
alleged breaches committed by RAL, including allegations of breach of employment contracts, breach of trust, and breach of the Trust Agreement
underlying the Pension Plan. In particular:
•
•
Mr Lomas seeks US$119.25 million (C$125 million) on account of monies alleged to have been improperly paid out or withheld from the Pension Plan,
together with compound interest calculated from the date of each alleged wrongdoing; and
punitive, aggravated and exemplary damages in the sum of US$1.91 million (C$2 million).
Mr Lomas purports to represent members of the defined benefits portion of the Pension Plan. In 2005, the defined contribution members of the
Pension Plan were included as parties to this action.
A motion to strike Mr Lomas’ request for the winding-up of the Plan was heard on 27 November 2006. The court struck out part of Mr Lomas’ claim,
but allowed the remainder to proceed. RAL’s appeal from that decision was dismissed, but further leave to appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal
was granted. On 10 March 2010, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in favour of RAL’s motion to strike out that part of the plaintiff’s claim that
sought a court order to wind up the Plan. No further step has been taken by the plaintiff to prosecute the proceedings at this time.
RAL has notified its insurers of the application and has advised other third parties of possible claims against them in respect of matters alleged in
the application.
Class actions concerning Cerrejón privatisation
The non-government organisation, Corporación Colombia Transparente (CCT), brought three separate class actions (Popular Actions 1,029,
1,032 and 1,048) against various defendants in connection with the privatisation of 50 per cent of the Cerrejón Zona Norte mining complex in
Colombia in 2002. Two of the actions were dismissed leaving only the action against Cerrejón Zona Norte SA (CZN). The mining complex is
currently owned by CZN and Carbones del Cerrejón Limited (CDC). Our subsidiary Billiton Investment 3 BV owns a 33 per cent share in CDC, and
our subsidiaries Billiton Investment 3 BV and Billiton Investment 8 BV (BHP Billiton Shareholders) collectively own a 33.33 per cent share in CZN.
CCT alleges, in part, that the defendants failed to comply with the privatisation process, and that the offer price for shares in CZN between Stages
1 and 2 of the privatisation process was not correctly adjusted for inflation.
Table of Contents
318
Our share of the alleged adjustment of the CZN share price would be approximately US$4.41 million. In the alternative, CCT seeks declaration that
the privatisation is null and void and forfeiture of the transfer price paid, of which our share would be approximately US$147.14 million. In both
instances, CCT also seeks unquantified sanctions, including payment of stamp taxes, an award of 15 per cent of all monies recovered by the
defendants, together with interest on all amounts at the maximum rate authorised by law.
The CZN action was dismissed on 18 February 2011, the Court determining that there were no irregularities in the privatisation of the Cerrejón
Zona Norte mining complex.
CCT’s request for a reconsideration of the judgment was denied. On 15 March 2011, CCT filed an appeal against the dismissal. This appeal was
dismissed on 1 February 2013 and on 15 February 2013 the plaintiff filed for a revision of the judgment. Revision of judgment is a new avenue of
review introduced by the Columbian Administrative Code that applies to the last instance judgments and may be used when the plaintiff believes
certain issues were not considered in the decision. On 15 March 2013, Cerrejón filed an opposition to this revision application.
A separate class action arising out of the privatisation of the CZN mining complex has been brought by Mr Martín Nicolás Barros Choles, against
various defendants including CDC.
Mr Choles claims that the transfer of rights by CDC to CZN was ineffective because it only involved a transfer of shares and not the transfer of the
underlying rights in the properties and assets used in the CZN mining complex. Consequently, he is seeking orders that CDC pays for the use
and lease of the properties and assets until November 2009, and that from that date the properties and assets of the Cerrejón project revert to the
State.
Investigations
Following requests for information in August 2009 from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Group commenced an internal
investigation and disclosed to relevant authorities, including the US Department of Justice (DOJ), evidence that it has uncovered regarding
possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws involving interactions with government officials.
As has been publicly reported, the Australian Federal Police has indicated that it has commenced an investigation. The Group is fully cooperating
with the relevant authorities as it has since the US investigations commenced.
As part of the US process, the SEC and DOJ notified the Group in August 2013 of the issues they consider could form the basis of enforcement
actions and discussions are continuing.
The issues relate primarily to matters in connection with previously terminated exploration and development efforts, as well as hospitality
provided as part of the Company’s sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
In light of the continuing nature of the investigations it is not appropriate at this stage for BHP Billiton to predict outcomes.

Definition
Those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can
be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date
forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods,
and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to
operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of
whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation (from SEC Rules
2010).
Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches,
workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed
sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely
and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of
reserves are well-established.

11.6    Taxation

The taxation discussion below describes the material Australian, UK and US federal income tax consequences to a US holder of owning BHP
Billiton Limited ordinary shares or ADSs or BHP Billiton Plc ordinary shares or ADSs. The discussion below also outlines the potential South
African tax issues for US holders of BHP Billiton Plc shares that are listed on the JSE.
The following discussion is not relevant to non-US holders of BHP Billiton Limited ordinary shares or ADSs or BHP Billiton Plc ordinary shares or
ADSs. By its nature the commentary below is of a general nature and we recommend that holders of ordinary shares or ADSs consult their own
tax advisers regarding the Australian, UK, South African and US federal, state and local tax and other tax consequences of owning and disposing
of ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances.
For purposes of this commentary, a US holder is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs who is, for US federal income tax purposes:
•
•
•
•
a citizen or resident alien of the US;
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) that is created or organised under the laws of the US or any
political subdivision thereof;
an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust:
a)
if a court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more US persons have the authority to
control all of its substantial decisions; or
b)
that has made a valid election to be treated as a US person for tax purposes.
This discussion of material tax consequences for US holders is based on the Australian, UK, US and South African laws currently in effect, the
published practice of tax authorities in those jurisdictions and the double taxation treaties and conventions currently in existence. These laws are
subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.

In this section, references to ‘resident’ and ‘non-resident’ refer to residence status for Australian income tax purposes.
Dividends
Dividends (including other distributions treated as dividends for Australian tax purposes) paid by BHP Billiton Limited to an Australian resident
US holder, or whose holding is effectively connected with:
•
•
a permanent establishment in Australia; or
a fixed base in Australia from which they perform personal services;
may be subject to income tax on an assessment basis. However, any franking credits attached to the dividends may be creditable against any
such income tax liability. Broadly, an amount of tax paid by the company flows through to shareholders (as a franking credit) when the company
pays a dividend which is franked by the company.

Under the Tax Convention between Australia and the US as to the Avoidance of Double Taxation (the Australian Tax Treaty), dividends paid by
BHP Billiton Limited to a non-resident US holder who or which is eligible for treaty benefits and whose holding:
•
•
is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment in Australia; or
in the case of a non-resident US holder who performs independent personal services from a ‘fixed base’ situated therein, is not connected with that
‘fixed base’;
may be subject to Australian withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of such gross dividend. For such a non-resident US holder:
•
•
•
where fully franked dividends are paid to non-residents they are not subject to withholding tax. The payment of Australian income tax by BHP Billiton
Limited generates a ‘franking credit’ for the company;
dividends paid to non-residents of Australia are also exempt from withholding tax to the extent to which such dividends are declared by BHP Billiton
Limited to be conduit foreign income (CFI). CFI is made up of certain foreign income amounts that are earned by BHP Billiton Limited that are not
subject to tax in Australia, such as dividends remitted to Australia by foreign subsidiaries; and
any part of a dividend paid to a US holder that is not ‘franked’ and is not CFI will generally be subject to Australian dividends withholding tax at 15 per
cent unless a specific exemption applies.
Sale of ordinary shares and ADSs
An Australian resident US holder (other than dual residents under the Australian tax treaty and certain temporary residents) may be liable to
Australian income tax on an assessment basis on any gain of an income nature on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs or alternatively Australian
capital gains tax on any gain on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs acquired after 19 September 1985. The position of dual residents and
temporary residents is more complex and they should seek advice that is specific to their circumstances.
A non-resident US holder may be liable to Australian income tax on an assessment basis on any gain of an income nature on disposal of ordinary
shares or ADSs that is sourced in Australia. However, where the US holder is eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty, the non-
resident US holder is only liable to Australian tax if the gain constitutes one or more of the following:
•
•
•
business profits of an enterprise attributable to a permanent establishment situated in Australia through which the enterprise carries on business in
Australia;
income from the alienation of property that forms part of the business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise in Australia, or pertains to
a fixed base available to the US holder in Australia for the purpose of performing independent personal services; or
income derived from the disposition of shares in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property (which includes rights to
exploit or to explore for natural resources) situated in Australia, whether such assets are held directly, or indirectly through one or more interposed
entities.
Where the gain of a non-resident US holder on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs is not of an income nature (or is of an income nature but is
sourced outside Australia), the non-resident US holder may be liable to Australian income tax on an assessment basis if Australian capital gains
tax applies. Australian capital gains tax will only generally apply to a disposal of the ordinary shares or ADSs by a non-resident US holder if the
shares or ADSs have been acquired after 19 September 1985 and one or more of the following applies:
•
•
the ordinary shares or ADSs have been used by the US holder in carrying on a trade or business through a permanent establishment in Australia; or
the US holder (together with associates) directly or indirectly owns or owned 10 per cent or more of the issued share capital of BHP Billiton Limited at
the time of the disposal or throughout a 12-month period
Table of Contents
342
•
during the two years prior to the time of disposal and, at the time of the disposal, the sum of the market values of BHP Billiton Limited’s assets that are
taxable Australian real property (held directly or through interposed entities) exceeds the sum of the market values of BHP Billiton Limited’s assets
(held directly or through interposed entities) that are not taxable Australian real property at that time (real property, for these purposes, includes mining,
quarrying or prospecting rights in respect of minerals, petroleum or quarry materials situated in Australia); or
the US holder is an individual who elected on becoming a non-resident of Australia to continue to have the ordinary shares or ADSs subject to
Australian capital gains tax.
The Australian Government has announced proposals to exempt from Australian income tax and capital gains tax gains made on disposals by
certain categories of non-resident funds – called Investment Management Regime (IMR) foreign funds – of (relevantly) portfolio interests in
Australian public companies. The exemptions would apply to gains made by IMR foreign funds that are treated as companies for Australian tax
purposes as well as gains made by non-resident investors in IMR foreign funds that are treated as trusts and partnerships for Australian tax
purposes. These reforms are not yet law and if enacted, their start date is uncertain.
Stamp duty, gift, estate and inheritance tax
Australia does not impose any stamp duty, gift, estate or inheritance taxes in relation to transfers or gifts of shares or ADSs or upon the death of a
shareholder.
(b) US taxation
This section describes the material US federal income tax consequences to a US holder of owning ordinary shares or ADSs. It applies only to
ordinary shares or ADSs that are held as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs that
is a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including a dealer in securities, a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-
market method of accounting for its securities holdings, a tax-exempt organisation, a life insurance company, a person liable for alternative
minimum tax, a person who actually or constructively owns 10 per cent or more of the voting stock of BHP Billiton Limited, a person that holds
ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, a person that purchases or sells ordinary shares or ADSs
as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or a person whose functional currency is not the US dollar.
If a partnership holds the ordinary shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the ordinary shares or ADSs should consult its tax adviser with
regard to the US federal income tax treatment of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs.
This section is part based on the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any
related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
In general, for US federal income tax purposes, a holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.
Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADSs, and ADSs for ordinary shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income tax.
Dividends
Under US federal income tax laws and subject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules discussed below, a US holder must include
in its gross income the amount of any dividend paid by BHP Billiton Limited out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined
for US federal income tax purposes) plus any Australian tax withheld from the dividend payment even though the holder does not receive it. The
dividend is taxable to the holder when the holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively
receives the dividend.
Table of Contents
343
Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder on shares or ADSs will be taxable at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains provided that the
US holder holds the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and does not
enter into certain risk reduction transactions with respect to the shares or ADSs during the abovementioned holding period. In addition, a non-
corporate US holder that elects to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the US Internal Revenue
Code will not be eligible for the reduced rate of taxation. In the case of a corporate US holder, dividends on shares and ADSs are taxed as ordinary
income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from
other US corporations.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a
non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder’s tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as a
capital gain.
The amount of any cash distribution paid in any foreign currency will be equal to the US dollar value of such currency, calculated by reference to
the spot rate in effect on the date such distribution is received by the US holder or, in the case of ADSs, by the Depositary, regardless of whether
and when the foreign currency is in fact converted into US dollars. If the foreign currency is converted into US dollars on the date received, the
US holder generally should not recognise foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If the foreign currency is not converted into US
dollars on the date received, the US holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its US dollar value on the date received, and generally
will recognise foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposal of such currency. Such foreign currency gain or loss
generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.
Subject to certain limitations, Australian tax withheld in accordance with the Australian Treaty and paid over to Australia will be creditable against
an individual’s US federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are
taxed at the capital gains rate. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to a US holder under Australian law or under the Australian
Treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against the holder’s US federal income tax liability. A US holder
that does not elect to claim a US foreign tax credit may instead claim a deduction for Australian income tax withheld, but only for a taxable year in
which the US holder elects to do so with respect to all foreign income taxes paid or accrued in such taxable year.
Dividends will be income from sources outside the US, and generally will be ‘passive category’ income or, for certain taxpayers, ‘general category’
income, which are treated separately from each other for the purpose of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to a US holder. In general, a
taxpayer’s ability to use foreign tax credits may be limited and is dependent on the particular circumstances. US holders should consult their own
tax advisers with respect to these matters.
Sale of ordinary shares and ADSs
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will recognise a capital gain
or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised and the holder’s tax basis,
determined in US dollars, in those ordinary shares or ADSs. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for
foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The capital gain of a non-corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the holder has a
holding period greater than 12 months in the shares or ADSs sold. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.
The US dollar value of any foreign currency received upon a sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will be calculated by reference
to the spot rate in effect on the date of sale or other disposal (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, on the settlement
date). A US holder will have a tax basis in the
344
Table of Contents
foreign currency received equal to that US dollar amount, and generally will recognise foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent conversion
or other disposal of the foreign currency. This foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
We do not believe that the BHP Billiton Limited ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes, but
this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually at the end of the year and thus may be subject to change. If BHP Billiton Limited
were treated as a PFIC, any gain realised on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as a capital
gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if it had realised such gain and certain ‘excess distributions’ ratably over its holding period for the
ordinary shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an
interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. In addition, dividends received with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs would
not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if BHP Billiton Limited were a PFIC either in the taxable year of the
distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead would be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income. Assuming the shares or ADSs are
‘marketable stock’, a US holder may mitigate the adverse tax consequences described above by electing to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market
basis with respect to such shares or ADSs.
US Holders in BHP Billiton Plc
(a) UK taxation
Dividends
Under UK law, no UK tax is required to be withheld at source from dividends paid on ordinary shares or ADSs.
Sale of ordinary shares and ADSs
US holders will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains realised on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs unless:
•
•
they are resident or ordinarily resident in the UK; or
they carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency for the year in which the disposal occurs and the shares or ADSs
have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade (or profession or vocation), branch or agency. In the case of a trade, the term ‘branch’
includes a permanent establishment.
An individual who ceases to be a resident in the UK for tax purposes while owning shares or ADSs and then disposes of those shares or ADSs
while not a UK resident may become subject to UK tax on capital gains if he/she subsequently becomes treated as a UK resident again before five
complete UK tax years of non-UK residence have elapsed from the date he/she left the UK. In this situation US holders will generally be entitled to
claim US tax paid on such a disposition as a credit against any corresponding UK tax payable.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current UK – US Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty, ordinary shares or ADSs held by a US holder who is domiciled for the purposes of the
UK – US Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty in the US, and is not for the purposes of the UK – US Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty a national of the UK,
will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual’s death or on a chargeable gift of the ordinary shares or ADSs during the
individual’s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the ordinary shares or ADSs are part of the
business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal
services, pertain to a fixed base situated
Table of Contents
345
in the UK. Where the ordinary shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US-resident shareholder,
the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, was not domiciled in
the US and was a UK national. In the exceptional case where the ordinary shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal
gift or estate tax, the UK – US Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of credit relief.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Under applicable legislation, UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) is, subject to certain exemptions, payable on any issue or transfer
of shares to the Depositary or their nominee where those shares are for inclusion in the ADR program at a rate of 1.5 per cent of their price (if
issued), the amount of any consideration provided (if transferred on sale) or their value (if transferred for no consideration). However, from
1 October 2009, this 1.5 per cent charge has generally ceased to apply to issues of shares into EU depositary receipt systems and into EU
clearance systems. Further, the First-tier Tribunal has held that the 1.5 per cent SDRT charge on a transfer of shares to an issuer of American
Depositary Receipts (as an integral part of a fresh capital raising) was incompatible with European Union law. Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs has confirmed that it will no longer seek to impose the 1.5 per cent SDRT charge on the issue of shares to a depositary receipt issuer or
a clearance service outside the European Union. The law in this area may still be susceptible to change. We recommend advice should be sought
in relation to paying the 1.5 per cent SDRT or stamp duty charge in any circumstances.
No SDRT would be payable on the transfer of an ADS. No UK stamp duty should be payable on the transfer of an ADS provided that the
instrument of transfer is executed and remains at all times outside the UK. Transfers of ordinary shares to persons other than the Depositary or
their nominee will give rise to stamp duty or SDRT at the time of transfer. The relevant rate is currently 0.5 per cent of the amount payable for the
shares. The purchaser normally pays the stamp duty or SDRT.
Special rules apply to transactions involving intermediates and stock lending.
(b) US taxation
This section describes the material US federal income tax consequences to a US holder of owning ordinary shares or ADSs. It applies only to
ordinary shares or ADSs that are held as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs that
is a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including a dealer in securities, a trader in securities who elects to use a mark-to-
market method of accounting for its securities holdings, a tax-exempt organisation, a life insurance company, a person liable for alternative
minimum tax, a person who actually or constructively owns 10 per cent or more of the voting stock of BHP Billiton Plc, a person that holds
ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, a person that purchases or sells ordinary shares or ADSs
as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or a person whose functional currency is not the US dollar.
If a partnership holds the ordinary shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the ordinary shares or ADSs should consult its tax adviser with
regard to the US federal income tax treatment of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs.
This section is in part based on the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any
related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
In general, for US federal income tax purposes, a holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.
Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADSs, and ADSs for ordinary shares generally will not be subject to US federal income tax.

Under US federal income tax laws and subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a US holder must include in its gross income the gross amount
of any dividend paid by BHP Billiton Plc out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax
purposes). The dividend is taxable to the holder when the holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or
constructively receives the dividend.
Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder on shares or ADSs will be taxable at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains provided that the
US holder holds the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, and does

income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from
other US corporations.
Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a
non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder’s tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as a
capital gain.
The amount of any cash distribution paid in any foreign currency will be equal to the US dollar value of such currency, calculated by reference to
the spot rate in effect on the date such distribution is received by the US holder or, in the case of ADSs, by the Depositary, regardless of whether
and when the foreign currency is in fact converted into US dollars. If the foreign currency is converted into US dollars on the date received, the US
holder generally should not recognise foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If the foreign currency is not converted into US dollars
on the date received, the US holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its US dollar value on the date received, and generally will
recognise foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposal of such currency. Such foreign currency gain or loss
generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.
Dividends will be income from sources outside the US, and generally will be ‘passive category’ income or, for certain taxpayers, ‘general category’

conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually at the end of the year and thus may be subject to change. If BHP Billiton Plc were

(c) South African taxation
Dividends
As from 1 April 2012, it is possible that US holders of BHP Billiton Plc shares or ADSs that remain South African residents may be subject to
South African Dividends Tax, at a maximum rate of 15 per cent, on any dividends received from shares listed on the JSE. The South African
Dividends Tax will be withheld from the gross amount of the dividend paid to the shareholder.
No South African Dividends Tax is required to be withheld from cash dividends provided the dividends are paid to non-South African tax resident
shareholders or South African tax resident corporate shareholders (including South African pension, provident, retirement annuity and benefit
funds). However, these dividends will only be exempt from South African Dividends Tax if these types of shareholders provide the requisite
exempt declarations to the regulated intermediaries making the cash dividend payments.
Dividends Tax is nevertheless required to be withheld on dividends paid on ordinary shares and ADSs of BHP Billiton Plc listed on the JSE, where
such dividends are paid to South African tax resident shareholders who are natural persons (individuals) or trusts, other than closure
rehabilitation trusts.
Except for certain exclusions, generally speaking such dividends paid to South African tax resident natural persons or trusts are exempt from
South African income tax and as such, the Dividends Tax may be considered as a final and non-creditable levy.
Sale of ordinary shares and ADSs
A US holder who or which is tax resident in South Africa would be liable for income tax on any profit on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs, or
capital gains tax on any gain on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs, depending on whether the shares and ADSs are held on revenue or capital
account.
Income tax is payable on any profit on disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs held by a non-resident US holder where the profit is of a revenue
nature and sourced in South Africa. However, the profit would only be regarded as being sourced in South Africa if the ordinary shares or ADSs
are attributable to a permanent establishment of that non-resident US holder situated in South Africa.
Where the ordinary shares or ADSs are not held on revenue account, non-resident US holders will not be liable for South African tax on capital
gains realised on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs unless:
•
•
such US Holders are tax resident in South Africa;
the shares or ADSs are held in a company, where 80 per cent or more of the market value of those shares or ADSs is attributable (at the time of
disposal of those shares or ADSs) directly or indirectly to immovable property situated in South Africa, held otherwise than as trading stock; or
Table of Contents
348
•
the US holder’s interest (the shares or ADSs in BHP Billiton Plc) is attributable to a permanent establishment which the US holder has in South Africa.
A US holder who holds ordinary shares or ADSs connected to a permanent establishment in South Africa will recognise a capital gain or loss for
South African income tax purposes equal to the difference between the Rand value of the amount realised and the holder’s tax basis, determined
in Rand, in those ordinary shares or ADSs. The holder’s tax basis will generally be equal to the cost that was incurred to acquire the shares, if
such shares were acquired after 1 October 2001. The capital gain of a non-resident’s permanent establishment in South Africa will be taxed at an
effective rate of 18.6 per cent.
Securities Transfer Tax
South African Securities Transfer Tax is levied at 0.25 per cent in respect of the transfer of ordinary shares or ADSs. The tax is levied on the
amount of consideration at which the ordinary share or ADS is transferred or, where no value is declared, the closing price of the ordinary shares
or ADSs. The tax is ultimately borne by the person to whom that ordinary share or ADS is transferred.

Dual Listed Companies’ structure and basis of preparation of financial statements
Merger terms
On 29 June 2001, BHP Billiton Limited (previously known as BHP Limited), an Australian listed company, and BHP Billiton Plc (previously known as Billiton Plc), a United
Kingdom (UK) listed company, entered into a Dual Listed Company (DLC) merger. This was effected by contractual arrangements between the Companies and amendments to
their constitutional documents.
The effect of the DLC merger is that BHP Billiton Limited and its subsidiaries (the BHP Billiton Limited Group) and BHP Billiton Plc and its subsidiaries (the BHP Billiton Plc
Group) operate together as a single economic entity (the Group). Under the arrangements:
•
•
•
•
•
the shareholders of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have a common economic interest in both Groups;
the shareholders of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc take key decisions, including the election of Directors, through a joint electoral procedure under which the shareholders of
the two Companies effectively vote on a joint basis;
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc have a common Board of Directors, a unified management structure and joint objectives;
dividends and capital distributions made by the two Companies are equalised;
BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc each executed a deed poll guarantee, guaranteeing (subject to certain exceptions) the contractual obligations (whether actual or contingent,
primary or secondary) of the other incurred after 29 June 2001 together with specified obligations existing at that date.
If either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc proposes to pay a dividend to its shareholders, then the other Company must pay a matching cash dividend of an equivalent
amount per share to its shareholders. If either Company is prohibited by law or is otherwise unable to declare, pay or otherwise make all or any portion of such a matching
dividend, then BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc will, so far as it is practicable to do so, enter into such transactions with each other as the Boards agree to be necessary
or desirable so as to enable both Companies to pay dividends as nearly as practicable at the same time.
The DLC merger did not involve the change of legal ownership of any assets of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc, any change of ownership of any existing shares or
securities of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc, the issue of any shares or securities or any payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each Company of one
special voting share to a trustee company which is the means by which the joint electoral procedure is operated.
Accounting for the DLC merger
The basis of accounting for the DLC merger was established under Australian and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP), pursuant to the requirements of the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Practice Note 71 ‘Financial Reporting by Australian Entities in Dual Listed Company Arrangements’, an order issued by
ASIC under section 340 of the Corporations Act 2001 on 2 September 2002, and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 1985. In accordance with the transitional provisions of
IFRS 1/AASB 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’, the same basis of accounting is
F-7
Table of Contents
applied under International Financial Reporting Standards. Accordingly, these financial statements consolidate the Group as follows:
•
•
Assets and liabilities of the BHP Billiton Limited Group and the BHP Billiton Plc Group were consolidated at the date of the merger at their existing
carrying amounts.
Results for the years ended 30 June 2013, 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are of the consolidated entity comprising the BHP Billiton Limited Group
and the BHP Billiton Plc Group.
Basis of preparation
This general purpose financial report for the year ended 30 June 2013 has been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the
requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the UK Companies Act 2006 and with:
•
•
•
Australian Accounting Standards, being Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations as issued by the
Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) effective as of 30 June 2013;
International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations as adopted by the European Union (EU) effective as of 30 June 2013;
International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board effective as of 30 June
2013.
The above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively referred to as ‘IFRS’ in this report.
There were no significant impacts arising from accounting standards or interpretations adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
The following new accounting standards and interpretation are not yet effective but will have an impact on the Group in financial years
commencing from 1 July 2013:
•
IFRS 10/AASB 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ is a replacement of IAS 27/AASB 127 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. The
revised standard introduces a modified single concept of control that applies to all entities. It changes the requirements for determining whether an
entity is consolidated by revising the definition of control and adding further guiding principles.
A review of all entities and contractual arrangements in the Group which are less than 100 per cent owned, currently proportionately consolidated,
or currently accounted for as joint operations or assets has been completed to assess the impact of IFRS 10 on the Group. That review
determined that Minera Escondida Limitada (Escondida) will be controlled by the Group under IFRS 10 and consolidated into the results of the
Group from 1 July 2013. Accordingly, the Group will no longer recognise its 57.5 per cent share of Escondida’s assets, liabilities, revenue,
expenses and cash flows, but will recognise 100 per cent of Escondida’s revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows and a 42.5 per cent
non-controlling interest in Escondida’s profit and net assets. No other entities which are not currently consolidated under IAS 27 have been
determined to be controlled under IFRS 10.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the adjustments to be recognised at the transition date of 1 July 2011 and to the comparative
periods ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 upon consolidation of Escondida.
•
IFRS 11/AASB 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ modifies the accounting for joint arrangements in two ways:
•
It changes the definition of joint control with reference to the definition of unanimous consent (the contractually agreed sharing of control of an
arrangement with reference to voting on relevant
Table of Contents
F-8
activities). Arrangements which do not fall within this definition are beyond the scope of IFRS 11 and will be accounted for under other IFRS.
•
For those entities within the scope of IFRS 11, a distinction is made between joint ventures and joint operations based on the rights and
obligations of the parties arising from the arrangement in the normal course of business. Entities for which it is determined the Group has rights
only to the net assets of the arrangement are classified as ‘joint ventures’ and are equity accounted. Entities for which it is determined the Group
has rights to the underlying assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement are classified as ‘joint operations‘ and therefore the
Group recognises its proportionate share of the jointly held assets and liabilities, revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the
joint operation and from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its share of any expenses incurred jointly.
A review of all entities and contractual arrangements in the Group which are less than 100 per cent owned, currently proportionately consolidated,
or currently accounted for as joint operations or assets has been completed to assess the impact of IFRS 11 on the Group.
That review determined for ongoing operations that:
•
•
Antamina, Cerrejón, Newcastle Infrastructure Group, Cleopatra Oil Pipeline and Caesar Oil Pipeline arrangements no longer meet the definition
of unanimous consent and therefore will be equity accounted under the requirements of the revised IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint
Ventures’.
Samarco is classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11 and therefore will be equity accounted under the requirements of the revised IAS 28
‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’.
As a result, the Group will no longer recognise its proportionate share of the revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of each of the
above operations. Commencing 1 July 2013, the Group will recognise its share of net assets on a single line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, its
share of net profit on a single line in the Consolidated Income Statement and cash flows from dividends in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
The application of IAS 28 to the operations above will also result in changed financial outcomes to the Group in the following situations:
•
Where the Group’s share of losses of an associate or joint venture equal or exceed the carrying amount of its interest in the associate, the Group
will discontinue recognising its share of losses, except to the extent the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation or made payments
on behalf of the associate or joint venture. Shares of subsequent profits earned by loss making associates or joint ventures (for which the
investment balance has been reduced to nil) will not be recognised in the Group’s results until the previously unrecognised losses have been
recouped.
•
Where the Group’s investment in an associate or joint venture is nil (and there is no legal or constructive obligation or made payments on behalf
of the associate or joint venture), dividends received from the associate or joint venture will be recognised in the Group’s result as a Profit from
Associate for the period rather than being eliminated as a consolidation adjustment.
The following joint arrangements meet the definition of joint operations and as a result, the Group will continue to recognise its share of assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows: Petroleum Joint Arrangements (including Onshore US), Alumar, Worsley, Central Queensland Coal
Associates, Gregory, Guinea Alumina, Mozal and Phola Coal Processing.
Table of Contents
F-9
The Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) contractual arrangement does not fall within the scope of either IFRS 10 or IFRS 11 and as a result, this
operation will be accounted for under other IFRS. The Group will continue to recognise its share of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and
cash flows on a line by line basis in the financial statements.
With respect to operations divested during the year ended 30 June 2013:
•
•
Richards Bay Minerals was determined to be a joint venture under IFRS 11 and therefore will be equity accounted in the comparative periods as
described below;
EKATI was determined to be outside the scope of IFRS 11 and therefore will be accounted for under other IFRS in the comparative periods as
described below.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the adjustments to be recognised at transition date of 1 July 2011 and to the comparative
periods ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013. As a result of the different treatment of associate losses required by IAS 28 described above, there
will be some losses previously recognised in the Group result in the periods ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013, which will not be recognised
in the restated comparative amounts. Entities divested during the year ended 30 June 2013 will be taken into account up to the date of divestment
when calculating the impact of IFRS 11 and the revised IAS 28 for the comparative periods.
•
IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’ applies to waste removal (stripping) costs incurred during the production phase
of a surface mine; it does not deal with stripping costs in the development phase of a surface mine nor stripping costs in an underground mine. IFRIC
20 modifies the accounting for production stripping as follows:
•
•
requires an entity to recognise a production stripping asset only if certain criteria are met;
mandates the depreciation method to be applied to resulting stripping activity assets; and
•
provides principles to follow in the determination of the adjustment on transition.
A review has been conducted of all assets in the Group which have surface mines to assess the impact of IFRIC 20. The review determined that
IFRIC 20 will impact the ongoing accounting for production stripping at the following continuing operations: Escondida, WAIO and Nickel West.
At the Group’s transition date of 1 July 2011, the net book value of deferred stripping balances for all surface mines was US$1,600 million.
Application of IFRIC 20 to ongoing operations will result in a transition adjustment to reduce this deferred stripping asset by US$1,139 million with
a corresponding decrease to retained earnings of US$1,139 million (US$765 million after tax). Adjustments for ongoing operations for the
comparative period ended 30 June 2012 will be an increase to the deferred stripping asset of US$458 million, a decrease to inventories of US$159
million, an increase to deferred tax liabilities of US$93 million and a corresponding increase to net profit after tax of US$207 million for the period.
Adjustments for ongoing operations for the comparative period ended 30 June 2013 will be an increase to the deferred stripping asset of US$694
million, a decrease to inventories of US$68 million, an increase to deferred tax liabilities of US$192 million and a corresponding increase to net
profit after tax of US$434 million for the period.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the adjustments to be recognised at transition date of 1 July 2011 and to the comparative
periods ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 for the EKATI operation divested during the year. This adjustment is not expected to be material to
the Group.
The following new accounting standards are not yet effective but may have an impact on the Group in financial years commencing from 1 July
2013:
•
IFRS 13/AASB 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ replaces fair value measurement guidance in individual IFRSs with a single source of fair value
measurement guidance.
F-10
Table of Contents
•
Amendments to IAS 19/AASB 119 ‘Employee Benefits’. These amendments require all actuarial gains and losses to be recognised immediately in
other comprehensive income (consistent with current Group policy) and require the expected return on plan assets (recognised in the income
statement) to be calculated based on the rate used to discount the defined benefit obligation.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the impact of the above standards.
The following new accounting standards and interpretation are not yet effective but may have an impact on the Group in financial years
commencing from 1 July 2014 or later:
•
•
•
IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ modifies the classification and measurement of certain classes of financial assets and liabilities. The most
significant change is to rationalise from four to two primary categories of financial assets.
Amendments to IAS 31/AASB 132 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ clarify the criteria for offsetting financial assets and liabilities.
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ confirms that a liability to pay a levy is only recognised when the activity that triggers the payment occurs.
The Group is currently in the process of determining the potential impact of adopting the above standards and interpretation.
The above standards and interpretations are available for early adoption in the 30 June 2013 financial year as permitted by the Australian
Corporations Act 2001 but have not been applied in the preparation of these financial statements. Except for IFRS 9 and IFRIC 21, all of the above
standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU and hence are available for early adoption in the EU.
Basis of measurement
The financial statements are drawn up on the basis of historical cost principles, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other
financial assets, which are carried at fair value.
Currency of presentation
All amounts are expressed in millions of US dollars, unless otherwise stated, consistent with the predominant functional currency of the Group’s
operations.
Change in accounting policy
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by all entities included in the Group consolidated financial statements and are consistent
with those applied in all prior years presented.
Principles of consolidation
The financial statements of the Group include the consolidation of BHP Billiton Limited, BHP Billiton Plc and their respective subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by either parent entity. Control exists where either parent entity has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial report from the
date control commences until the date control ceases. Where the Group’s interest is less than 100 per cent, the interest attributable to outside
shareholders is reflected in non-controlling interests. The effects of all transactions between entities within the Group have been eliminated.

Joint ventures
F-11
The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint ventures. Joint ventures are established through contractual arrangements that require the unanimous
consent of each of the venturers regarding the strategic, financial and operating policies of the venture (joint control). The Group’s joint ventures are of two types:
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is a corporation, partnership or other entity in which each participant holds an interest. A jointly controlled entity operates in the same way as other
entities, controlling the assets of the joint venture, earning its own income and incurring its own liabilities and expenses. Interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for
using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the Group’s proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of jointly controlled entities are
recognised within each applicable line item of the financial statements. The share of jointly controlled entities’ results is recognised in the Group’s financial statements from the
date that joint control commences until the date on which it ceases.
Jointly controlled assets
The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities involving the joint ownership of assets dedicated to the purposes of each
venture. These arrangements do not create a jointly controlled entity as the venturers directly derive the benefits of operation of their jointly owned assets, rather than deriving
returns from an interest in a separate entity.
The financial statements of the Group include its share of the assets in such joint ventures, together with the liabilities, revenues and expenses arising jointly or otherwise from
those operations. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which are usually in proportion to the Group’s interest in the jointly
controlled assets.
Business combinations
Business combinations that occurred between 1 July 2004 and 30 June 2009 were accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, whereby the purchase
consideration of the combination is allocated to the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations prior to 1 July 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with the
Group’s previous policies under Australian GAAP and UK GAAP and have not been restated.
Business combinations undertaken from 1 July 2010 are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities (identifiable net assets) are measured on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill
Where the fair value of consideration paid for a business combination exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is treated
as purchased goodwill. Where the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference is immediately recognised
in the income statement. The recognition and measurement of goodwill attributable to a non-controlling interest in a business combination is determined on a transaction by
transaction basis. Goodwill is not amortised, however, its carrying amount is assessed annually against its recoverable amount as explained below under ‘Impairment of non-
current assets’. On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, any remaining balance of associated goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss on disposal or termination.
Table of Contents
Intangible assets
F-12
Amounts paid for the acquisition of identifiable intangible assets, such as software and licences, are capitalised at the fair value of consideration paid and are recorded at cost
less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life, which
is typically no greater than eight years. The Group has no identifiable intangible assets for which the expected useful life is indefinite.
Foreign currencies
The Group’s reporting currency and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is the US dollar as this is assessed to be the principal currency of the economic
environments in which they operate.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies (currencies other than the functional currency of an operation) are recorded using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the
underlying transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange prevailing at year-end and the gains or losses
on retranslation are included in the income statement, with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for site closure and rehabilitation,
which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment for operating sites.
Exchange variations resulting from the retranslation at closing rate of the net investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures arising after 1 July 2004 are accounted for in
accordance with the policy stated below. Exchange variations arising before this date were transferred to retained earnings at the date of transition to IFRS.
Subsidiaries and joint ventures that have functional currencies other than US dollars translate their income statement items to US dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at
the date of each transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at year-end. Exchange variations resulting from the retranslation at closing rate
of the net investment in such subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with differences between their income statement items translated at actual and closing rates, are
recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. For the purpose of foreign currency translation, the net investment in a foreign operation is determined inclusive of
foreign currency intercompany balances for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. The balance of the foreign currency translation
reserve relating to a foreign operation that is disposed of, or partially disposed of, is recognised in the income statement at the time of disposal.
Share-based payments
The fair value at grant date of equity-settled share awards granted on or after 8 November 2002 is charged to the income statement over the period for which the benefits of
employee services are expected to be derived. The corresponding accrued employee entitlement is recorded in the employee share awards reserve. The fair value of awards is
calculated using an option pricing model which considers the following factors:
•
exercise price;
expected life of the award;
current market price of the underlying shares;
expected volatility;
expected dividends;
risk-free interest rate;
market-based performance hurdles;
non-vesting conditions.
•
•
•
•

Table of Contents
F-13
For equity-settled share awards granted on or before 7 November 2002 and that remained unvested at 1 July 2004, the estimated cost of share awards is charged to the income
statement from grant date to the date of expected vesting. The estimated cost of awards is based on the market value of shares at the grant date or the intrinsic value of options
awarded, adjusted to reflect the impact of performance conditions, where applicable.
Where awards are forfeited because non-market based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the expense previously recognised is proportionately reversed. Where shares in BHP
Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc are acquired by on-market purchases prior to settling vested entitlements, the cost of the acquired shares is carried as treasury shares and
deducted from equity. When awards are satisfied by delivery of acquired shares, any difference between their acquisition cost and the remuneration expense recognised is
charged directly to retained earnings. The tax effect of awards granted is recognised in income tax expense, except to the extent that the total tax deductions are expected to
exceed the cumulative remuneration expense. In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income and forms part
of the employee share awards reserve.
Sales revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods and disposal of other assets is recognised when persuasive evidence (usually in the form of an executed sales agreement) of an arrangement
exists and;
•
•
•
•
•
there has been a transfer of risks and rewards to the customer;
no further work or processing is required by the Group;
the quantity and quality of the goods has been determined with reasonable accuracy;
the price is fixed or determinable;
collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue is therefore generally recognised when title passes. In the majority of sales for most commodities, sales agreements specify that title passes on the bill of lading date,
which is the date the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent. For these sales, revenue is recognised on the bill of lading date. For certain sales (principally coal sales to
adjoining power stations and diamond sales), title passes and revenue is recognised when the goods have been delivered.
In cases where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the goods by the customer (for instance an assay for
mineral content), recognition of the sales revenue is based on the most recently determined estimate of product specifications.
For certain commodities, the sales price is determined on a provisional basis at the date of sale; adjustments to the sales price subsequently occurs based on movements in
quoted market or contractual prices up to the date of final pricing. The period between provisional invoicing and final pricing is typically between 60 and 120 days. Revenue on
provisionally priced sales is recognised based on the estimated fair value of the total consideration receivable. The revenue adjustment mechanism embedded within
provisionally priced sales arrangements has the character of a commodity derivative. Accordingly, the fair value of the final sales price adjustment is re-estimated continuously
and changes in fair value are recognised as an adjustment to revenue. In all cases, fair value is estimated by reference to forward market prices.
Revenue is not reduced for royalties and other taxes payable from the Group’s production.
The Group separately discloses sales of Group production from sales of third party products because of the significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for mineral and petroleum resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability
of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation activity includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
researching and analysing historical exploration data;
gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource;
surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;
conducting market and finance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the income statement. Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore
in an existing exploration area are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure (including amortisation of capitalised licence costs) is charged to the income statement as incurred except in the following
circumstances, in which case the expenditure may be capitalised:
•
•
In respect of minerals activities:
•
•
the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest which was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business combination and measured at fair
value on acquisition; or
the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established.
In respect of petroleum activities:
•
•
the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest for which it is expected that the expenditure will be recouped by future exploitation or sale; or
exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure considered to be a tangible asset is recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment at cost less impairment
charges. Otherwise, it is recorded as an intangible asset (such as licences). As the capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure asset is not available for use, it is not
depreciated. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications of impairment. Where a potential impairment is indicated, assessment is
performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the group of operating assets (representing a cash generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. Exploration
areas in which reserves have been discovered but require major capital expenditure before production can begin, are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities
of reserves exist or to ensure that additional exploration work is under way or planned. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is
charged to the income statement.
Development expenditure
When proved reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassified as assets under construction, and is
disclosed as a component of property, plant and equipment. All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as assets under construction, provided
commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied. Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the sale of ore extracted during the development phase. On completion
of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as either plant and equipment or other mineral assets.
Table of Contents
Property, plant and equipment
F-15
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Cost is the fair value of consideration
given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct cost of bringing the asset to the location and
condition necessary for operation and the estimated future cost of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.
Other mineral assets
Other mineral assets comprise:
•
•
•
Capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure (including development stripping) for properties now in production;
Mineral rights and petroleum interests acquired;
Capitalised production stripping (as described below in ‘Overburden removal costs’).
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment (including initial and any subsequent capital expenditure) are depreciated to their
estimated residual value over the estimated useful lives of the specific assets concerned, or the estimated life of the associated mine, field or
lease, if shorter. Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and any change in estimate is taken into account in the
determination of remaining depreciation charges. Depreciation commences on the date of commissioning. The major categories of property, plant
and equipment are depreciated on a unit of production and/or straight-line basis using estimated lives indicated below. However, where assets are
dedicated to a mine, field or lease and are not readily transferable, the below useful lives are subject to the lesser of the asset category’s useful life
and the life of the mine, field or lease:
•       Buildings
•       Land
•       Plant and equipment
•       Mineral rights and Petroleum interests
•       Capitalised exploration, evaluation and development  expenditure
–    25 to 50 years
    –    not depreciated
    –    3 to 30 years straight-line
    –    based on reserves on a unit of production basis
    –    based on reserves on a unit of production basis
Leased assets
Assets held under leases, which result in the Group receiving substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset (finance leases), are
capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the property, plant and equipment or the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding finance lease obligation is included within interest bearing liabilities. The interest element is allocated to accounting periods
during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Operating lease assets are not capitalised and rental payments are included in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provision is made for the present value of future operating lease payments in relation to surplus lease space, when it is first determined that the
space will be of no probable future benefit. Operating lease incentives are recognised as a liability when received and subsequently reduced by
allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability.
Table of Contents
Impairment of non-current assets
F-16
Formal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an
indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values annually, which is used as a source of information to assess for
any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other market factors, are also monitored to
assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated, being the higher of
fair value less direct costs to sell and the asset’s value in use.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income
statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable
and willing parties. Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent
market participant may take into account. These cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset.
Value in use is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its
present form and its eventual disposal. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and cannot
take into account future development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating fair value and consequently the value in use
calculation is likely to give a different result (usually lower) to a fair value calculation.
In testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to as
cash generating units. Cash generating units are the smallest identifiable group of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The impairment assessments are based on a range of estimates and assumptions, including:
Estimates/assumptions:
•       Future production
Basis:
•   proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and, in  certain cases,
•       Commodity prices
•       Exchange rates
•       Discount rates
Overburden removal costs
expansion projects
•
forward market and contract prices, and longer-term price  protocol
estimates
•   current (forward) market exchange rates
  •   cost of capital risk-adjusted appropriate to the resource
Overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine site in order to access the mineral deposit.
This activity is referred to as development stripping. The directly attributable costs (inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure)
are initially capitalised as assets under construction. Capitalisation of development stripping costs ceases at the time that saleable material
begins to be extracted from the mine. On completion of development, all capitalised development stripping included in assets under construction
is transferred to other mineral assets.
Table of Contents
F-17
Production stripping commences at the time that saleable materials begin to be extracted from the mine and normally continues throughout the life of a mine. The costs of
production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs, when the ratio of waste material to ore extracted for an area of interest is expected to be constant
throughout its estimated life. When the ratio of waste to ore is not expected to be constant, production stripping costs are accounted for as follows:
•
•
•
All costs are initially charged to the income statement and classified as operating costs.
When the current ratio of waste to ore is greater than the estimated life-of-mine ratio, a portion of the stripping costs (inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure) is
capitalised to other mineral assets.
In subsequent years when the ratio of waste to ore is less than the estimated life-of-mine ratio, a portion of capitalised stripping costs is charged to the income statement as operating
costs.
The amount of production stripping costs capitalised or charged in a financial year is determined so that the stripping expense for the financial year reflects the estimated life-of-
mine ratio. Changes to the estimated life-of-mine ratio are accounted for prospectively from the date of the change.
Inventories
Inventories, including work in progress, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined primarily on the basis of average costs. For processed
inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis. Cost comprises cost of purchasing raw materials and cost of production, including attributable mining and
manufacturing overheads. In respect of minerals inventory, quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. In respect of petroleum inventory, quantities are
derived through flow rate or tank volume measurement; volume calculation and composition is derived via sample analysis.
Finance costs
Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of
time to prepare for their intended future use. Finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. The amount of finance costs capitalised
(before the effects of income tax) for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period, to the average
amount of capitalised expenditure for the qualifying assets during the period.
Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end, and includes any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax assessment or deduction purposes. Where an asset has no deductible or depreciable amount for income tax purposes,
but has a deductible amount on sale or abandonment for capital gains tax purposes, that amount is included in the determination of temporary differences. The tax effect of
certain temporary differences is not recognised, principally with respect to: goodwill; temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities (other than
those arising in a business combination or in a manner that initially impacted
Table of Contents
F-18
accounting or taxable profit); and temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates to the extent that the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax recognised is
based on the expected manner and timing of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, with the exception of items that have a tax base solely
derived under capital gains tax legislation, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at period end. To the extent that an item’s tax base is solely derived from the amount
deductible under capital gains tax legislation, deferred tax is determined as if such amounts are deductible in determining future assessable income.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each balance sheet date and amended to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group has both the right and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or
simultaneous basis.
Royalties and resource rent taxes are treated as taxation arrangements when they have the characteristics of a tax. This is considered to be the case when they are imposed under
government authority and the amount payable is calculated by reference to revenue derived (net of any allowable deductions) after adjustment for temporary differences. For such
arrangements, current and deferred tax is provided on the same basis as described above for other forms of taxation. Obligations arising from royalty arrangements that do not
satisfy these criteria are recognised as current provisions and included in expenses.
Provision for employee benefits
Provision is made in the financial statements for all employee benefits, including on costs. In relation to industry-based long service leave funds, the Group’s liability, including
obligations for funding shortfalls, is determined after deducting the fair value of dedicated assets of such funds.
Liabilities for unpaid wages and salaries are recognised in sundry creditors. Current entitlements to annual leave and accumulating sick leave accrued for services up to the
reporting date are recognised in provision for employee benefits and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid. Entitlements to non-accumulating sick leave are
recognised when the leave is taken.
The current liability for long service leave (for which settlement within 12 months of the reporting date cannot be deferred) is recognised in the current provision for employee
benefits and is measured in accordance with annual leave described above. The non-current liability for long service leave is recognised in the non-current provision for
employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using
market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
Superannuation, pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates or participates in a number of pension (including superannuation) schemes throughout the world. The funding of the schemes complies with local
regulations. The assets of the schemes are generally held separately from those of the Group and are administered by trustees or management boards.
For defined contribution schemes or schemes operated on an industry-wide basis where it is not possible to identify assets attributable to the participation by the Group’s
employees, the pension charge is calculated on the basis of contributions payable.
Table of Contents
F-19
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement so as to recognise current and past service
costs, interest cost on defined benefit obligations, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements, net of expected returns on plan assets.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. An asset or liability is consequently recognised in the balance sheet based on the
present value of defined benefit obligations, less any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of plan assets, except that any such
asset cannot exceed the total of unrecognised past service costs and the present value of expected refunds from and reductions in future
contributions to the plan. Defined benefit obligations are estimated by discounting expected future payments using market yields at the reporting
date on high-quality corporate bonds in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate bond
markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to national government bonds. In both instances, the bonds are selected with
terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash flows.
Certain Group companies provide post-retirement medical benefits to qualifying retirees. In some cases the benefits are provided through medical
care schemes to which the Group, the employees, the retirees and covered family members contribute. In some schemes there is no funding of
the benefits before retirement. These schemes are recognised on the same basis as described above for defined benefit pension schemes.
Closure and rehabilitation
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group normally give rise to obligations for site closure or rehabilitation. Closure and
rehabilitation works can include facility decommissioning and dismantling; removal or treatment of waste materials; site and land rehabilitation.
The extent of work required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of relevant authorities and the Group’s environmental
policies.
Provisions for the cost of each closure and rehabilitation program are recognised at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the
extent of disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision is increased accordingly. Costs included in the provision encompass
all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure in connection with
disturbances at the reporting date. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate closure and rehabilitation activities, such as waste
material handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising from
unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when the
event gives rise to an obligation which is probable and capable of reliable estimation.
The timing of the actual closure and rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the
operating licence conditions, the principles of Our BHP Billiton Charter and the environment in which the mine operates. Expenditure may occur
before and after closure and can continue for an extended period of time dependent on closure and rehabilitation requirements. The majority of
the expenditure is expected to be paid over periods of up to 50 years with some payments into perpetuity.
Closure and rehabilitation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, discounted to their present value and determined
according to the probability of alternative estimates of cash flows occurring for each operation. Discount rates used are specific to the country in
which the operation is located. Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming expectations of future activities and the amount and
timing of the associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing environmental and regulatory requirements or, if more
stringent, Group environmental policies which give rise to a constructive obligation.
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the
cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised in
property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of
discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognised in financial expenses.
F-20
Table of Contents
Closure and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments are accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised cost, except
where a reduction in the provision is greater than the undepreciated capitalised cost of the related assets, in which case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the remaining
adjustment is recognised in the income statement. In the case of closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes to the
capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future depreciation. Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing of future closure and rehabilitation cash flows are a normal
occurrence in light of the significant judgements and estimates involved. Factors influencing those changes include:
•
•
•
•
•
revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations;
developments in technology;
regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies;
changes in the estimated extent and costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and movements in foreign exchange rates;
movements in interest rates affecting the discount rate applied.
Financial instruments
All financial assets are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid. Subsequently, financial assets are carried at fair value or amortised cost less impairment.
Where non-derivative financial assets are carried at fair value, gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised directly in equity unless the financial assets have been
designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss, in which case the gains and losses are recognised directly in the income statement. Financial assets are designated
as being held at fair value through profit or loss when this is necessary to reduce measurement inconsistencies for related assets and liabilities. All financial liabilities other than
derivatives are initially recognised at fair value of consideration received net of transaction costs as appropriate (initial cost) and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Derivatives, including those embedded in other contractual arrangements but separated for accounting purposes because they are not clearly and closely related to the host
contract, are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting
gain or loss on remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The measurement of
fair value is based on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable
transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks
implicit in such estimates.
Forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes are accounted for as either cash flow or fair value hedges. Derivatives embedded within other
contractual arrangements and the majority of commodity-based transactions executed through derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of
the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged risk constitutes
ineffectiveness of the hedge and is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Table of Contents
Cash flow hedges
F-21
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve. The gain or
loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when the forecast transaction that is
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, plant and equipment purchases) or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in
equity are transferred from equity and included in the measurement of the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at
that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a hedged forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative hedge gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Available for sale and trading investments
Available for sale and trading investments are measured at fair value. Gains and losses on the remeasurement of trading investments are recognised directly in the income
statement. Gains and losses on the remeasurement of available for sale investments are recognised directly in equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement when
realised by sale or redemption, or when a reduction in fair value is judged to represent an impairment.
Application of critical accounting policies and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods presented
therein. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management
bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and
conditions.
The Group has identified the following critical accounting policies under which significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are made and where actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
Further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Reserve estimates
Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s properties. In order to estimate reserves, estimates are required

and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and
exchange rates.
Estimating the quantity and/or grade of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or fields to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling
samples. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements to interpret the data.
The Group determines and reports ore reserves in Australia and the United Kingdom under the principles incorporated in the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results
of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves December 2012 known as the JORC Code, and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules 2012 for minerals. The JORC Code
requires the use of reasonable investment assumptions when reporting reserves. As a result, management will form a view of forecast sales prices, based on current and long-
term historical average price trends. For example, if current prices remain above long-term historical averages for an extended period of time, management may assume that
lower prices will prevail in the future and as a result, those lower prices are used to estimate reserves under the JORC Code. Lower price assumptions generally result in lower
estimates of reserves.
Reserve reporting requirements for SEC (United States of America) filings are specified in Industry Guide 7, which requires economic assumptions to be based on current
economic conditions (which may differ from assumptions based on reasonable investment assumptions). Accordingly, for SEC filings, we test our reserve estimates derived
under JORC against assumed ‘current economic conditions’. ‘Current economic conditions’ are based on the three-year average of historical contract and market prices for
commodities such as iron ore and coal, and the three-year average of historical market prices for commodities that are traded on the London Metal Exchange, such as copper
and nickel. However, we only report a different reserve in the United States if, based on the United States SEC pricing assumptions test, the reserve will be lower than that
reported under JORC in Australia and the United Kingdom.
Oil and gas reserves reported in Australia and the United Kingdom, and the United States for SEC filing purposes, are based on the average of prices prevailing on the first day of
each month for the past 12 months as required under the SEC Rules ‘Modernisation of Oil & Gas Reporting’. Reserves reported in prior periods are based on the prices prevailing
at the time of the estimates as previously required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 ‘Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities’, issued by the US
Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Because the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and because additional geological data is generated during the course of
operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of
ways, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Asset recoverable amounts may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the units of production basis, or where the useful
economic lives of assets change.
Overburden removal costs recorded on the balance sheet or charged to the income statement may change due to changes in stripping ratios or the units of production basis of
depreciation.
Decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax benefits.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered
likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. This
policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation
can be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy, a
judgement is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the income statement.
Development expenditure
Development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project is
economically viable. In exercising this judgement, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalised
exploration and evaluation expenditure. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having commenced the development
activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is impaired, the appropriate amount will be written off to the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of
impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that carrying amount exceeds
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating group of assets is measured at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices
(considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), reserves (see ‘Reserve estimates’ above), operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future
capital expenditure. These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections,
which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be further impaired or the impairment
charge reduced with the impact recorded in the income statement.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes requires management to make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby
determine the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of
scheme assets, future remuneration changes, employee attrition rates, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected
remaining periods of service of employees. In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries. Where
actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Refer to note 30 Pension and other post-retirement obligations for details
of the key assumptions.
Provision for closure and rehabilitation
The Group’s accounting policy for the recognition of closure and rehabilitation provisions requires significant estimates and assumptions such as: requirements of the relevant
legal and regulatory framework; the magnitude
Table of Contents
F-24
of possible contamination; and the timing, extent and costs of required closure and rehabilitation activity. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing
from the amounts currently provided.
The provision recognised for each site is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs for
operating sites are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting both the closure and rehabilitation asset and provision. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are
recognised immediately in the income statement.
In addition to the uncertainties noted above, certain closure and rehabilitation activities are subject to legal disputes and depending on the ultimate resolution of these issues,
the final liability for these matters could vary.
Taxation
The Group’s accounting policy for taxation, including royalty-related taxation, requires management’s judgement as to the types of arrangements considered to be a tax on
income in contrast to an operating cost. Judgement is also required in assessing whether deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are recognised on the balance
sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from unrecouped tax losses, capital losses, foreign tax credits and temporary differences, are recognised only where it is
considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities arising from
temporary differences in investments, caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be
controlled and are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits and repatriation of retained earnings depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These depend on
estimates of future production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, dividends and other capital
management transactions. Judgements are also required about the application of income tax legislation and its interaction with income tax accounting principles. These
judgements and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount
of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the balance sheet and the amount of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. In such
circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the
income statement.

Business segments
The Group operates five Businesses aligned with the commodities which we extract and market, reflecting the structure used by the Group’s management to assess the
performance of the Group.
During the financial year the Group completed the following changes:
•
•
•
•
Following the sale of its diamonds business and interests in Richards Bay Minerals, the Group has consolidated its Potash development activity with the Petroleum Customer Sector
Group (CSG) to form the Petroleum and Potash Business. In view of the new management structure, this Business is now considered to be a single reportable segment. There were
no inter-segment transactions between the Petroleum CSG and Potash Business and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the new Petroleum and Potash segment for the
years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are an aggregation of Petroleum and Potash. The remaining amounts reported previously for the Diamonds and Specialty Products CSG
have been included in Group and unallocated items.
The Base Metals CSG was renamed the Copper Business.
The consolidation of the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs to form the Coal Business. In view of the new management structure, this Business is now considered to be a
single reportable segment. There were no inter-segment transactions between the Metallurgical Coal and Energy Coal CSGs and therefore the comparative amounts reported for the
new Coal segment for the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are an aggregation of previously reported amounts.
The consolidation of the Aluminium, Manganese and Stainless Steel Materials CSGs to form the Aluminium, Manganese and Nickel Business. In view of the new management
structure, this Business is now considered to be a single reportable segment. There were no inter-segment transactions between the

Sale of Yeelirrie uranium deposit:
On 27 August 2012, the Group announced the sale of its wholly owned Yeelirrie uranium deposit and the transaction was completed on 19 December 2012. A gain on sale of

US$126 million.
Sale of Richards Bay Minerals:
On 7 September 2012, the Group announced it had completed the sale of its 37.76 per cent effective interest in Richards Bay Minerals. A gain on sale of US$1,190 million (after tax

On 12 December 2012, the Group signed a definitive agreement to sell its 8.33 per cent interest in the East Browse Joint Venture and 20 per cent interest in the West Browse Joint
Venture. A gain on sale of US$1,539 million was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2013. The associated tax expense of US$462 million was partly offset by the recognition of
deferred tax benefits on available tax losses of US$241 million and the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities of US$33 million. The transaction was completed on 7 June 2013.

As a result of expected continued strength in the Australian dollar and weak nickel prices, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$1,244 million (after tax benefit) in
the year ended 30 June 2013.
Table of Contents
Impairment of Worsley assets:
F-32
The Group recognised an impairment of assets at Worsley as a result of expected continued strength in the Australian dollar and weak alumina
prices. A total impairment charge of US$1,631 million (after tax benefit) was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2013.
Impairment of Permian Basin assets:
An impairment charge of US$167 million (after tax benefit) was recognised as the performance of specific evaluation wells in certain areas of the
Permian Basin (US) do not support economic development.
Other impairments arising from capital project review:
In the year ended 30 June 2013, WAIO refocused its attention on the capital efficient expansion opportunity that exists within the Port Hedland
inner harbour and all early works associated with the outer harbour development option were suspended. This revision to the WAIO development
sequence and the change in status of other minor capital projects across the Group has resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of
US$639 million (after tax benefit) and other restructuring costs of US$76 million (after tax benefit) in the year ended 30 June 2013.
Newcastle steelworks rehabilitation:
The Group recognised a decrease of US$158 million (before tax expense) to its rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the

As a result of the fall in United States domestic gas prices and the Company’s decision to adjust its development plans, the Group recognised impairments of goodwill and other
assets in relation to its Fayetteville shale gas assets. A total impairment charge of US$1,839 million (after tax benefit) was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2012.
Impairment of Nickel West goodwill and other assets:
The Group recognised impairments of goodwill and other assets at Nickel West as a result of the continued downturn in the nickel price and margin deterioration. A total
impairment charge of US$355 million (after tax benefit) was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2012.
Suspension or early closure of operations and the change in status of specific projects:
As part of our regular portfolio review, various operations and projects around the Group were either suspended, closed early or changed in status. These included: the change
in status of the Olympic Dam expansion project; the temporary suspension of production at TEMCO and the permanent closure of the Metalloys South Plant in South Africa; the
indefinite cessation of production at Norwich Park; and the suspension of other minor capital projects. As a result, impairment charges of US$338 million (after tax benefit), idle
capacity costs and inventory write-down of US$28 million (after tax benefit) and other restructuring costs of US$28 million (after tax benefit) were recognised in the year ended
30 June 2012.
Settlement of insurance claims:
During 2008, extreme weather across the central Queensland coalfields affected production from the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) and BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal (BMC)
operations. The Group settled insurance claims in respect of the lost production and insurance claim income of US$210 million (after tax expense) was recognised in the year
ended 30 June 2012.
Recognition of deferred tax assets on enactment of MRRT and PRRT extension legislation in Australia:
The Australian MRRT and PRRT extension legislation were enacted in March 2012. Under the legislation, the Group is entitled to a deduction against future Minerals Resource
Rent Tax (MRRT) and Petroleum Resource
Table of Contents
F-34
Rent Tax (PRRT) liabilities based on the market value of its coal, iron ore and petroleum assets. A deferred tax asset, and an associated net
income tax benefit of US$637 million, was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2012 to reflect the future deductibility of these market values for
MRRT and PRRT purposes, to the extent they were considered recoverable.

Withdrawn offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp):
The Group withdrew its offer for PotashCorp on 15 November 2010 following the Board’s conclusion that the condition of the offer relating to
receipt of a net benefit as determined by the Minister of Industry under the Investment Canada Act could not be satisfied. The Group incurred fees
associated with the US$45 billion debt facility (US$240 million), investment bankers’, lawyers’ and accountants’ fees, printing expenses and other
charges (US$74 million) in progressing this matter during the period up to the withdrawal of the offer, which were expensed as operating costs in
the year ended 30 June 2011.
Newcastle steelworks rehabilitation:
The Group recognised a decrease of US$150 million (before tax expense) to its rehabilitation obligations in respect of former operations at the
Newcastle steelworks (Australia) following a full review of the progress of the Hunter River Remediation Project and estimated costs to
completion.
Release of income tax provisions:
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued amended assessments in prior years denying bad debt deductions arising from the investments in
Beenup and Boodarie Iron and the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project. The Group challenged the assessments
and was successful on all counts before the Full Federal Court. The ATO obtained special leave in September 2010 to appeal to the High Court in
respect of the denial of capital allowance claims made on the Boodarie Iron project. The Group’s position in respect of the capital allowance claims
on the Boodarie Iron project was confirmed by the High Court in June 2011. As a result of these appeals, US$138 million was released from the
Group’s income tax provision in September 2010 and US$580 million in June 2011.

Reversal of deferred tax liabilities:
F-35
Consistent with the functional currency of the Group’s operations, eligible Australian entities elected to adopt a US dollar tax functional currency
from 1 July 2011. As a result, the deferred tax liability relating to certain US dollar denominated financial arrangements was derecognised,
resulting in a credit to income tax expense of US$1,455 million.

Interest on bank loans and overdrafts, and other borrowings, relates to financial liabilities carried at amortised cost.
Interest on all other borrowings for the year ended 30 June 2013 included an amount of US$97 million of realised fair value changes on non-hedging derivatives used to manage
interest rate exposure on debt securities. Fair value change on non-hedging derivatives for the year ended 30 June 2013 included unrealised fair value changes on similar
instruments. The total changes in fair value of non-hedging derivatives amounted to US$280 million.
Interest has been capitalised at the rate of interest applicable to the specific borrowings financing the assets under construction or, where financed through general borrowings, at a
capitalisation rate representing the average interest rate on such borrowings. For the year ended 30 June 2013, the capitalisation rate was 2.24 per cent (2012: 2.83 per cent; 2011:
2.87 per cent).
Interest income relates to financial assets carried at amortised cost.

At 30 June 2013, the Group had US$463 million of tax credits that have not been recognised (2012: US$397 million). Of the US$463 million of tax credits, US$356 million expire
later than five years and not later than ten years. The remainder of the tax credits do not have an expiration date.
Temporary differences relating to MRRT and PRRT
At 30 June 2013, the Group had US$19,419 million of unrecognised deductible temporary differences (2012: US$19,338 million) that arose due to the enactment of the Australian
MRRT and PRRT extension legislation in March 2012. Recognition of a deferred tax asset for MRRT and PRRT depends on benefits expected to be obtained from deduction
against MRRT and PRRT liabilities based on the 1 May 2010 market value of Australian coal, iron ore and petroleum assets. Recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with
MRRT and PRRT of US$19,419 million (2012: US$19,338 million) would result in a corresponding additional deferred tax liability for income tax purposes of US$5,826 million
(2012: US$5,801 million).
Other deductible temporary differences
At 30 June 2013, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$3,350 million (2012: US$3,192 million) have not been recognised because it
is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax
legislation.

Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities
At 30 June 2013, deferred tax liabilities of US$2,174 million (2012: US$1,997 million) associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not
been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Each American Depositary Share (ADS) represents two ordinary shares.
The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP
Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton share repurchase scheme, the Billiton Employee Share
Ownership Plan Trust, and the BHP Bonus Equity Plan Trust and adjusting for the BHP Billiton Limited bonus share issue. Included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per
share are shares contingently issuable under Employee Share Ownership Plans.
Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes 2,612,172 of instruments (2012: 2,943,856; 2011: 2,210,433) which are considered antidilutive.

Dividends are declared after period end in the announcement of the results for the period. Interim dividends are declared in February and paid in
March. Final dividends are declared in August and paid in September. Dividends declared are not recorded as a liability at the end of the period to
which they relate. Subsequent to year-end, on 20 August 2013, BHP Billiton declared a final dividend of 59.0 US cents per share (US$3,147
million), which will be paid on 25 September 2013 (2012: 57.0 US cents per share – US$3,049 million; 2011: 55.0 US cents per share – US$2,943
million).

Includes investments held by BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa Rehabilitation Trust Fund. The future realisation of this investment is intended to fund environmental obligations
relating to the closure of the South African coal operations, and consequently this investment, while under the Group’s control, is not available for the general purposes of the Group.
Any income from this investment is reinvested or applied to meet these obligations. The Group retains responsibility for these environmental obligations until such time as the former
mine sites have been rehabilitated in accordance with the relevant environmental legislation. These obligations are therefore included under non-current provisions. Refer to note 18

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, as follows:

Impairment testing of goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and
which represent the level at which management will monitor and manage the goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the Onshore US group of CGUs and the Fayetteville CGU were determined based on fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS). FVLCS was determined as
the present value of the estimated future cash flows (expressed in real terms) expected to arise from the continued use of the assets (life of asset), including any expansion
prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account. These cash flows were discounted using a real after-tax
discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Table of Contents
The determination of FVLCS was most sensitive to the following assumptions:
F-50
•
•
•
•
Production volumes
Crude oil prices
Natural gas prices
Discount rate
Production volumes – estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the
fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process. Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the
recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary
to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production leases and the selling price of the hydrocarbons
produced. As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed
using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management. The production profiles used were consistent
with the resource volumes approved as part of the Group’s process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Crude oil and natural gas prices – key assumptions for oil and gas prices were derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global
supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. These prices were adjusted to arrive at
appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The crude oil and natural gas prices used in the FVLCS determinations were either lower or within the range of prices published by market
commentators:
Crude oil price (US$/boe)
Natural gas price (US$/MMBtu)
2013
71.00 – 125.00    
4.45 – 6.51
2012
75.82 – 101.93  
2.74 – 6.21
Discount rate – in arriving at the FVLCS, a real post-tax discount rate of 5.9 per cent (2012: 5.9 per cent) was applied to the post-tax cash flows
expressed in real terms. This discount rate was derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), with appropriate
adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.
Onshore US
The goodwill of US$3,591 million that arose from the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation has been allocated to the Onshore US group of
CGUs which comprises the Fayetteville, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian Basin CGUs. The Onshore US group of CGUs comprises the
natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, gas production wells and associated facilities, and gas gathering systems in the Eagle Ford,
Haynesville and the Permian areas in Texas and Louisiana (US) and the Fayetteville area in Arkansas (US). The Onshore US group of CGUs is part
of the Petroleum and Potash reportable segment. The Onshore US group of CGUs was tested for impairment after testing each of the individual
CGUs that it comprises.
Year ended 30 June 2013
The impairment tests for the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Fayetteville CGUs indicated that no impairments were required. However, an impairment
of US$266 million was recognised in relation to the Permian Basin. In the prior year the Permian Basin had been identified as one CGU. However,
the current development plan identifies two distinct regions that would have to be developed independently: North Reeves/Pecos region
(Delaware
Table of Contents
F-51
Basin) and South Midland (Midland Basin) region. Management also noted that each region has a separate and distinctive basin; they are
geographically distant; and they do not share common infrastructure. Accordingly, management determined that each region represents a
separate CGU. The US$266 million impairment relates to the South Midland CGU and was recognised against property, plant and equipment, refer
to note 3 Exceptional items for further discussion.
The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs was therefore performed after the Permian assets were written down to their recoverable
amount (which was based on FVLCS measured using discounted cash flow projections). The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the
Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill by US$4,104 million and no further impairment was required.
The table below shows the key assumptions used in the FVLCS as well as the amount by which each key assumption must change in isolation in
order for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of the Onshore group of CGUs, including goodwill. Owing to the
complexity of the analysis caused by relationships between each key assumption, such that a change in one would cause a change in several
other inputs to the calculation, the analysis below was performed for each assumption individually.

The impairment tests for the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Permian Basin CGUs indicated that no impairments were required. As indicated
below, an impairment was recognised in relation to the Fayetteville CGU. The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs was therefore
performed after the Fayetteville assets were written down to their recoverable amount. The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the
Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount and no further impairment was required.
With regard to the assessment of FVLCS for the Onshore US group of CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of
the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
Fayetteville
The goodwill of US$552 million that arose from the acquisition of the Fayetteville gas business in March 2011 was allocated to the Fayetteville
CGU. The Fayetteville CGU comprises the Fayetteville natural gas reserves and resource; gas production wells and associated facilities; and the
gas gathering system located in Arkansas, US.
Year ended 30 June 2013
Goodwill allocated to Fayetteville was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2012. Accordingly, a goodwill impairment test was not required to
be performed in the year ended 30 June 2013.
Year ended 30 June 2012
For the interim period ended 31 December 2011, impairment testing indicated that the Fayetteville CGU was not impaired. However, during the
second half of the year ended 30 June 2012 there was a significant fall in US

F-52
domestic gas prices, which prompted the Group to adjust its development plans. Consequently, a further impairment test was performed as at
30 June 2012 and resulted in a total impairment charge of US$2,835 million being recognised for the year ended 30 June 2012, including
impairment of the Fayetteville goodwill of US$552 million and property, plant and equipment of US$2,283 million. The total impairment charge is
included in ‘Expenses excluding net finance costs’ in the Consolidated Income Statement, refer to note 5 Expenses.
Other
Goodwill held by other CGUs is US$514 million (2012: US$514 million), representing less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2013 (2012:
less than one per cent). The goodwill has been allocated across a number of CGUs in different reportable segments, with no CGU accounting for
more than US$200 million of total goodwill.

On 15 November 2010, BHP Billiton announced the reactivation of the remaining US$4.2 billion component of its previously suspended US$13
billion buy-back program and subsequently announced an expanded US$10 billion capital management program on 16 February 2011. This
expanded program was completed on 29 June 2011 through a combination of on-market and off-market buy-backs. In accordance with the UK
Companies Act 2006 and with the resolutions passed at the 2010 Annual General Meetings, BHP Billiton Limited purchased fully paid shares in
BHP Billiton Plc on-market and then transferred those shares to BHP Billiton Plc for nil consideration and cancellation. BHP Billiton Plc shares
bought back as part of this program but not cancelled at 30 June 2011 were accounted for as Treasury shares within the share capital of BHP Billiton
Plc. An off-market tender buy-back of BHP Billiton Limited shares was completed on 11 April 2011. In accordance with the structure of the buy-back,
US$44 million was allocated to the share capital of BHP Billiton Limited and US$6,301 million was allocated to retained earnings. These shares
were then cancelled. Details of the purchases are shown in the table below. Cost per share represents the average cost per share for BHP Billiton
Plc shares and final cost per share for BHP Billiton Limited shares.

The Group has entered into various counter-indemnities of bank and performance guarantees related to its own future performance in the normal course of business.
Actual or potential litigation amounts relate to a number of actions against the Group, none of which are individually significant and where the liability is not probable and therefore the
Group has not provided for such amounts in these financial statements. Additionally, there are a number of legal claims or potential claims against the Group, the outcome of which
cannot be foreseen at present, and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.
In addition to the amounts reported above, following requests for information in August 2009 from the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the Group commenced an internal investigation and disclosed to relevant authorities including the US Department of Justice (DOJ)
evidence that it has uncovered regarding possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws involving interactions with government officials.
As has been publicly reported, the Australian Federal Police has indicated that it has commenced an investigation. The Group is fully cooperating
with the relevant authorities as it has since the US investigations commenced.
As part of the US process, the SEC and DOJ notified the Group in August 2013 of the issues they consider could form the basis of enforcement
actions and discussions are continuing.
The issues relate primarily to matters in connection with previously terminated exploration and development efforts, as well as hospitality
provided as part of the Company’s sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
In light of the continuing nature of the investigations it is not appropriate at this stage for BHP Billiton to predict outcomes, and therefore no
amount has been included in the contingent liabilities above.

Petrohawk Energy Corporation
–

–
On 14 July 2011, the Group announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Petrohawk Energy Corporation Inc. (Petrohawk) by
means of an all-cash tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petrohawk. The acquisition date of Petrohawk was 20 August
2011.
Petrohawk is an oil and natural gas company based in the United States. It owns a number of shale gas assets in Texas and Louisiana and
associated midstream pipeline systems. This acquisition provides the Group with operated positions in the resource areas of the Eagle Ford
shale, Haynesville shale and the Permian Basin.
Petrohawk was purchased for total consideration of US$12,005 million consisting of US$11,690 million for existing shares and US$315 million for
settlement of outstanding options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights (collectively referred to as employee awards). The vesting of the
employee awards was accelerated at the acquisition date pursuant to a change of control clause in the original employee award plans. As a result,
all of the consideration for settlement of such awards was included in purchase consideration. The terms of the acquisition agreement did not
include any contingent consideration. The consideration paid was in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and therefore
goodwill of US$3,591 million has been recognised in respect of the acquisition. The goodwill is attributable to the expected synergies to be
realised through managing the portfolio of both the acquired assets and the Group’s existing assets, and to the measurement of deferred income
taxes based on nominal amounts rather than fair value.
Acquisition related costs of US$46 million have been expensed and included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
HWE Mining
On 30 September 2011, the Group finalised the purchase of the HWE mining services business (HWE Mining), comprising three entities and other
property, plant and equipment, which provide contract mining services to the
Table of Contents
F-65
Group’s Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) joint ventures, from Leighton Holdings Limited (Leighton Holdings). The acquisition was funded by the
Group’s available cash and control was obtained through the purchase of all the issued share capital of the acquired entities.
The acquisition relates to the mining equipment and related assets that serviced the Area C, Yandi and Orebody 23/25 operations and is
consistent with the Group’s previously stated intention to move the WAIO business from contract mining to owner-operator mining.
Acquisition related costs of US$17 million have been expensed and included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The consideration paid was in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and therefore goodwill of US$187 million has been
recognised in respect of the acquisition. The goodwill is attributable to the skilled workforce and the expected synergies to result from an in-
house mining workforce, improved safety and the management of costs.

A complete list of investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities will be attached to BHP Billiton Plc’s annual return made to the UK
Registrar of Companies.
The ownership interest at the Group’s and the jointly controlled entity’s reporting date are the same. When the annual financial reporting date is different to the Group’s, financial
information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on an annual basis consistent with the Group’s reporting date.
While the Group holds a 57.5 per cent interest in Minera Escondida Limitada, the entity is subject to effective joint control due to participant and management agreements which
result in the operation of an Owners’ Council, whereby significant commercial and operational decisions are determined on aggregate voting interests of at least 75 per cent of the
total ownership interest. Accordingly, the Group does not have the ability to unilaterally control, and therefore consolidate, the investment in accordance with IAS 27/AASB 127
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. Refer to note 1 Accounting policies for a description of the change in the basis of accounting for Minera Escondida Limitada from
1 July 2013 in accordance with IFRS 10/AASB 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
Richards Bay Minerals comprises two legal entities, Richards Bay Mining (Proprietary) Limited and Richards Bay Titanium (Proprietary) Limited, in each of which the Group had a
50 per cent interest and which function as a single economic entity. After deducting non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of Richards Bay Minerals, the Group’s effective interest
in the operations of Richards Bay Minerals was 37.76 per cent up to the date of its effective disposal on 3 September 2012.
Included in contingent liabilities and capital expenditure commitments for the Group – refer to notes 21 Contingent liabilities and 22 Commitments respectively.

29    Financial risk management
Financial risk management strategy
The financial risks arising from the Group’s operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk. These risks arise in the normal course of
business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Group’s portfolio risk management strategy. The objective of the
strategy is to support the delivery of the Group’s financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of
the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Group’s operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Group’s financial
targets. The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis, which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected
business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 95 per cent.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. Under the
strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index
basis. This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities. The following table summarises
these activities and the key risk management processes.
Activity
1       Risk mitigation
On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific
and significant expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if
necessary to support the Group’s strategic objectives.
2       Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs and debt
instruments
Where Group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate
from the relevant index target, and where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial
instruments may be executed as an economic hedge to align the revenue price
exposure with the index target.
Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and/or at a fixed interest
rate, fair value and cash flow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with
the Group’s functional currency of US dollars and/or to swap to a floating interest rate.
As part of this strategy swaptions may also be used.
3       Strategic financial transactions
Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value
from perceived market over/under valuations.

F-73
Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the
above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group
Management Committee.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will
affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments. Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk
management strategy.
The majority of the Group’s debt is raised under central borrowing programs. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency
interest rate swaps to convert most of the centrally managed debt into US dollar floating interest rate exposures. As at 30 June 2013, the Group
holds US$5,377 million (2012: US$4,317 million) of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings as well as US$4,412 million (2012: US$4,039
million) of other fixed interest rate borrowings that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, arising from debt raised during the financial
years ended 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation and debt raised prior to
the DLC merger. The Group’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Group’s net
borrowings.

Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2013, taking into account interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions, it is
estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Group’s equity and profit after taxation by US$136
million (2012: decrease of US$103 million). This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and
the fixed/

floating mix and balances are constant over the year. However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant over
the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
Currency risk
The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and
balances in currencies other than the US dollar. The Group’s potential currency exposures comprise:
•
•
translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items;
transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues.
The Group’s foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items
Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are
periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement. The exception is foreign exchange
gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property,
plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than
the US dollar.

The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, South African rand and UK pound sterling. Based
on the Group’s net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2013, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the
table below, with all other variables held constant, would (decrease)/increase profit after taxation and equity as follows:

Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency. To a lesser extent,
certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may
require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. These currency risks are managed as part of
the portfolio risk management strategy. When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is
an asset of US$1 million and a liability of US$1 million (2012: an asset of US$14 million and a liability of US$6 million).
Commodity price risk
Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant
index target. Where pricing terms deviate from the index, derivative commodity contracts may be used when available to return realised prices to
the index. Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost
(typically at nil); they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below. Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set
out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Group’s objectives. Movements in the fair
value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former
movement is recognised in the Group’s income statement prior to settlement. The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of
the portfolio risk management strategy.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are those entered into for the following activities:
•
•
•
economic hedging of prices realised on commodity contracts as described above;
purchases and sales of physical contracts that can be cash-settled;
derivatives embedded within other supply contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in commodity prices at
each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange rates, constant.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity
prices. The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part
of the portfolio risk management strategy. Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in
conjunction with short- and long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some
circumstances. To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
The Group’s long-term credit rating from Moody’s Investor Services is currently A1 (the short-term rating is P-1), and from Standard & Poor’s is A+
(the short-term credit rating is A-1). The ratings outlook from both agencies has not changed during FY2013 or since 30 June 2013.
The Group’s strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to
meet its daily cash requirements. The Group’s policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing
are used for the investment of any excess cash.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.

The Group has a US$6.0 billion commercial paper program backed by US$6.0 billion of revolving credit facilities. The multi-currency revolving credit
facilities consist of US$5.0 billion expiring in December 2015 and US$1.0 billion expiring in December 2013 with the ability to extend to December
2014. These facilities are used for general corporate purposes and as backup for the commercial paper programs. The interest rates under these
facilities are based on an interbank rate plus a margin. The applicable margin is typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Group’s
credit rating. The Group had US$1.3 billion outstanding in the US commercial paper market at the end of the financial year (2012: US$995 million).
Other bank facilities are arranged with a number of banks with the general terms and conditions agreed on a periodic basis.
Maturity profile of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the contractual amounts, taking into account the derivatives related to debt, is as
follows:

Includes secured debt of US$ nil (2012: US$178 million) and trade and other payables of US$41 million (2012: US$153 million) included in liabilities
held for sale – refer to note 25 Assets and liabilities held for sale.
The amounts presented in the tables above comprise the contractual undiscounted cash flows, and therefore will not always agree with the
amounts presented in the balance sheet. The Group holds derivatives related to net debt, commodities and currencies that are classified as other
financial assets when they are expected to generate cash inflows – refer to note 11 Other financial assets.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group. To manage credit risk
the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits and daily
monitoring of exposures against these limits. As part of these processes the financial viability of all counterparties is regularly monitored and
assessed. The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet as at the
reporting date.
The Group’s credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings:
Counterparties
The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties:
•
Receivables counterparties
Approximately half of sales to the Group’s customers are made on open terms.
F-81
Table of Contents
•
Payment guarantee counterparties
Approximately half of sales to the Group customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
•
Derivative counterparties
Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
•
Cash investment counterparties
As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties.
Geographic
The Group trades in all major geographic regions. Countries in which the Group has a significant credit risk exposure include South Africa,
Australia, the United States, Japan and China. Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used
to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry
In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors. This diversity means that the Group is not
materially exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Group’s receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile
thereon.

Receivables are deemed to be past due or impaired with reference to the Group’s normal terms and conditions of business. These terms and
conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customer’s credit quality and prevailing market conditions. Receivables
that are classified as ‘past due’ in the above tables
Table of Contents
F-82
are those that have not been settled within the terms and conditions that have been agreed with that customer. For an analysis of movements in
impaired trade receivables, refer to note 10 Trade and other receivables.
The credit quality of the Group’s customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment
exist. The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment. In certain
circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable. Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to
recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
No other financial assets were past due or impaired at 30 June 2013 (30 June 2012: nil).
Fair values
All financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of
transaction costs as appropriate, and subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost, as indicated in the tables below. Derivatives are initially
recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the tables below at their carrying values, which generally approximate to the fair
values. In the case of US$5,377 million (2012: US$4,317 million) of centrally managed fixed rate debt and other fixed interest borrowings of
US$4,412 million (2012: US$4,039 million) not swapped to floating rate, the fair values at 30 June 2013 were US$5,164 million (2012: US$4,552
million) and US$4,280 million (2012: US$4,034 million) respectively.

Valuation hierarchy
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated with reference to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or
recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to
accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be
recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income. The following table shows the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the nature of valuation inputs used.

Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.
(b)
(c)
Valuation is based on inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are observable for the financial asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as
unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are calculated using
appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and
inflation. The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in these models, based on a change in the most significant
input by 10 per cent while holding all other variables constant, is shown in the following table. Significant inputs are assessed individually for each
financial asset and liability.

The Group’s strategy is to own and operate large, long-life, low-cost, expandable, upstream assets diversified by commodity, geography and
market and the Group continually reviews its portfolio to identify assets which do not fit this strategy. The Group will invest capital in assets where
they fit our strategy. The Group’s priorities for cash flow are:
•
•
•
reinvestment in projects that carry attractive rates of return regardless of the economic climate;
commitment to a solid ‘A’ credit rating; and
returning excess capital to shareholders firstly with its progressive dividends policy and thereafter via capital management initiatives (for example
share buy-backs).
Further information relevant to the actions and outcomes of the Group’s capital management strategy is contained in section 9.1.4 Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement, note 9 Dividends, note 19 Share capital and note 20 Other equity.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets. Our policy is for net gearing to be a
maximum of 40 per cent.

30    Pension and other post-retirement obligations
Defined contribution pension schemes and multi-employer pension schemes
The Group contributed US$456 million (2012: US$388 million; 2011: US$336 million) to defined contribution plans and multi-employer defined
contribution plans. These contributions are expensed as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group has closed all defined benefit schemes to new entrants. Defined benefit pension schemes remain operating in Australia, the US,
Canada, South America, Europe and South Africa for existing members. Full actuarial valuations are prepared and updated annually to 30 June by
local actuaries for all schemes. The Projected Unit Credit valuation method is used. The Group operates final salary schemes that provide final
salary benefits only, non-salary related schemes that provide flat dollar benefits and mixed benefit schemes that consist of a final salary defined
benefit portion and a defined contribution portion.
Defined benefit post-retirement medical schemes
The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the US, Canada, Europe and South Africa. Full actuarial valuations are
prepared by local actuaries for all schemes. All of the post-retirement medical schemes in the Group are unfunded.
The following tables set out details of the Group’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes.

Scheme assets classified as ‘Other’ as at 30 June 2013 primarily comprise investments in private equity in Australia, commodities in Europe and
various asset-backed securities and derivatives in the US. The increase in cash and net current assets reflects the sale of the Dutch pension fund
assets, in preparation for the possible transfer of the Dutch fund assets and obligations to an insurance company during FY2014.
The fair value of scheme assets includes no amounts relating to any of the Group’s own financial instruments or any of the property occupied by
or other assets used by the Group.
The investment strategy is determined by each plan’s fiduciary body in consultation with the Group. In general, the investment strategy for each
plan is set by reference to the duration and risk profile of the plan, as well as the plan’s solvency level.
Actuarial assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as weighted averages) for defined benefit pension schemes are as follows:
Discount rate
Future salary increases
Future pension increases
Expected rate of return on pension scheme assets
Europe
Australia
Americas
South Africa

Assumptions regarding future mortality can be material depending upon the size and nature of the plan liabilities. Post-retirement mortality
assumptions in the Americas, Europe and South Africa are based on post-retirement mortality tables that are standard in these regions.
Table of Contents
F-92
For the main funds, these tables imply the following expected future lifetimes (in years) for employees aged 65 as at the balance sheet date: US
males 19.8 (2012: 19.8), US females 21.6 (2012: 21.6); Canadian males 19.8 (2012: 19.7), Canadian females 22.2 (2012: 22.1); Netherlands males 22.2
(2012: 21.5), Netherlands females 24.0 (2012: 24.0); UK males 23.6 (2012: 23.3), UK females 26.2 (2012: 25.7); South African males 19.0 (2012: 18.8),
South African females 23.4 (2012: 23.3).
The overall expected rate of return on assets is the weighted average of the expected rate of return on each applicable asset class and reflects the
long-term target asset allocation as at the reporting date. For bonds, the expected rate of return reflects the redemption yields available on
corporate and government bonds, as applicable, as at the reporting date. For all other asset classes, the expected rate of return reflects the rate of
return expected over the long term.
The present value of defined benefit obligations, fair value of scheme assets and associated experience adjustments for the defined benefit
pension and post-retirement medical schemes are shown for the current year and the previous four years as follows:
Present value of defined benefit obligation
Fair value of defined benefit scheme assets
Deficit in the schemes
Experience gain/(loss) adjustments to scheme liabilities
Experience gain/(loss) adjustments to scheme assets
Present value of defined benefit obligation

Awards were made to senior management under four active employee ownership plans in BHP Billiton for the year ended 30 June 2013: the Long
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Group Incentive Scheme (GIS), Management Award Plan (MAP) and Group Short Term Incentive Plan (GSTIP). These
awards take the form of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares and/or Options, and Restricted Shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton
Plc. Awards made are subject to performance hurdles (LTIP) and service conditions (all plans). Subject to the performance conditions and service
conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of
ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options

F-112
over the relevant number of ordinary shares. Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue; however, there is
discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation of BHP Billiton’s share capital. A description of the plans follows:
(i)
GIS and GSTIP
The GIS awards are split equally between a cash award (being a percentage of base salary) and a grant of Deferred Shares and/or Options. The
GSTIP is a replacement plan to the GIS for certain employees below the GMC and was first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Awards are split equally between a cash award (being a percentage of base salary) and a grant of Deferred Shares and/or Options. Deferred
Shares and/or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised. If, during that period, an individual resigns without
the Remuneration Committee’s consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited. Deferred Shares and/or Options in respect of the
year ended 30 June 2013 will be awarded during the year ending 30 June 2014.
(ii)
LTIP and MAP
The LTIP awards are in the form of Performance Shares, and are awarded annually. The performance hurdle applicable to the awards granted
requires the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a five-year performance period to be greater than a combination of the weighted
average TSR of a peer group of companies and of the Morgan Stanley Capital Index World. To the extent that the performance hurdle is not
achieved, awards are forfeited. There is no retesting. For all Performance Shares to vest, the Group’s TSR must exceed the weighted average TSR
of the Index by a specified percentage, determined each year by the Remuneration Committee. Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this
percentage has been set each year at 5.5 per cent. For performance between the weighted average TSR of the Index and 5.5 per cent per annum
above the Index, vesting occurs on a sliding scale.
The MAP is a replacement plan to the LTIP for employees below the GMC. Under the MAP participants receive an Award of Restricted Shares, the
number of which is determined by role, performance and organisational level. There are no performance conditions attached to the Award and all
the shares that have been granted will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
(iii)
Transitional GMC Grants
These awards have two tranches. Tranche one has a three-year service and performance condition and may vest in 2015. Tranche two has a four-
year service and performance condition and may vest in 2016. The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to determine if the
performance condition has been met and whether any, all or some of the Restricted Shares will vest (or otherwise lapse), having regard to (but not
limited to) BHP Billiton’s Total Shareholder Return over the three- or four-year performance period (respectively), the participant’s contribution to
Group outcomes and the participant’s personal performance (with guidance on this assessment from the CEO). No Dividend Equivalent Payment
is payable on these awards.
All awards issued prior to 1 July 2011 are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the
underlying shares represented by the Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares awarded to those participants (the
Dividend Equivalent Payment). The Dividend Equivalent Payment is made to the participants once the underlying ordinary shares are issued or
transferred to them. No Dividend Equivalent Payment is made in respect of Deferred Shares, Options, Restricted Shares and Performance Shares
that lapse. Awards issued after 1 July 2011 under the GSTIP and MAP plans are no longer eligible to receive the Dividend Equivalent Payment.
(b)
(c)
Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan, commenced in April 2007. Employees may contribute up to US$5,000 to acquire shares (Acquired
Shares) in any Plan year. On the third anniversary of the start of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the
employee at that time with Matched Shares. The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded. Acquired
Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis. Employees can sell their Acquired Shares at any time. If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual sells
their Acquired Shares, resigns without the Remuneration Committee’s consent or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement to Matched Shares is
forfeited.
The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date. The fair values of awards granted were estimated
using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, Black-Scholes option pricing technique and net present value technique.

Shares issued on exercise of BHP Billiton’s employee share ownership plans include shares purchased on-market.
In respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the following trusts:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
The Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust is a discretionary trust for the benefit of all employees of BHP Billiton Plc and its
subsidiaries. The trustee is an independent company, resident in Jersey. The Trust uses funds provided by BHP Billiton Plc and/or its
subsidiaries as appropriate to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satisfied under the LTIP, MAP, GIS, GSTIP, CIP,
Shareplus and other employee share schemes operated by BHP Billiton Plc from time to time. The ordinary shares may be acquired by
purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value. The Trust has waived its rights to dividends on shares held to meet
future awards under Shareplus.
The BHP Performance Share Plan Trust is a discretionary trust established to distribute shares under selected BHP Billiton Limited
employee share plan schemes. The trustee of the trust is BHP Billiton Employee Plan Pty Ltd, an Australian company. The Trust uses funds
provided by BHP Billiton Limited and/or its subsidiaries to acquire shares on-market to satisfy exercises made under the LTIP, MAP, GIS,
GSTIP and PSP.
The BHP Billiton Limited Executive Incentive Scheme Trust is a discretionary trust established for the purposes of holding shares in BHP
Billiton Limited to satisfy exercises made under the LTIP, MAP, GIS, GSTIP, Shareplus and other employee share schemes operated by BHP
Billiton Limited from time to time.

36    Subsequent events
On 20 June 2013, BHP Billiton announced an extension of its long-term WAIO joint venture relationship with ITOCHU Corporation (ITOCHU) and
Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui). This transaction was completed on 10 July 2013 and aligned interests across the WAIO supply chain. Under the terms of
the agreement, ITOCHU and Mitsui invested approximately US$822 million and US$720 million, respectively, in shares and loans of BHP Iron Ore
(Jimblebar) Pty Ltd, representing an eight per cent and seven per cent interest in the Jimblebar mining hub and resource. The consideration
included a share of capital costs associated with the Jimblebar Mine Expansion project.
On 25 July 2013, BHP Billiton announced an investment of US$2.0 billion (BHP Billiton share) to construct a desalination facility which will deliver
sustainable water supply to Escondida over the long term.
On 20 August 2013, BHP Billiton announced an investment of US$2.6 billion to finish the excavation and lining of the Jansen Potash project
production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities. This investment will be spread over
a number of years, with completion of both shafts expected during the 2016 calendar year, while the associated works program will extend into the
2017 calendar year.
On 18 September 2013, the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Parliament passed legislation which has altered the arrangements BHP Billiton reached with
Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Program Limited
Table of Contents
F-115
(PNGSDP) and the PNG Government upon the transfer of its shareholding in Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) to PNGSDP in February 2002. The
consequences of this legislation will be as follows:
•
•
•
•
repeal of the section of a 2001 Act under which BHP Billiton parties were protected from environmental claims by the PNG Government;
cancellation of the shares which the PNGSDP holds in OTML and replacement with shares issued to the PNG Government;
the mortgage given by PNGSDP over its OTML shares to secure the BHP Billiton indemnity and other similar obligations is declared void and of no
legal effect; and
any provision in an agreement which limits a person’s right to take proceedings against a BHP Billiton party is rendered null and void.
BHP Billiton is considering the impact of this legislation. BHP Billiton retains a broad indemnity from PNGSDP and has adequate security to back
that indemnity. Based on currently available information, the legislation is unlikely to materially alter BHP Billiton’s exposure arising from its past

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. References to the ‘Group and parent company financial statements’ are made in relation to the Group and
individual parent company financial statements of BHP Billiton Plc.
UK company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare
the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).
The Group financial statements must, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law, present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; references in the UK Companies Act 2006 to such financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements must, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the parent company at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the parent company for the financial year.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•
•
•
•
•
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006. They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms
To the members of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited:
We have audited the BHP Billiton Group’s (comprising BHP Billiton Plc, BHP Billiton Limited and their respective subsidiaries) internal control
over financial reporting as of 30 June 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The BHP Billiton Group’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying section 5.13.1 Risk and Audit Committee Report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the BHP Billiton Group’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the BHP Billiton Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 30 June 2013,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

To the members of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited:

period ended 30 June 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the BHP Billiton Group’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the BHP
Billiton Group as of 30 June 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
30 June 2013, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves (Standardised measure)
The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed
and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the Group’s estimated proved reserves (as presented in section 2.13.1 ‘Petroleum reserves’) and this data
should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section. The Standardised measure is
prepared on a basis which presumes that year-end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year-end proved
reserves would be produced. The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates, expected future changes in technology, taxes,
operating practices and any regulatory changes have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing
that future production to derive future cash inflows. Estimates of future cash flows for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are computed using the average first-
day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period. Future price increases for all periods presented are considered only to the extent that they are
provided by fixed and determinable contractual arrangements in effect at year-end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate
changes.
Future cash inflows for all periods presented are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year-end proved reserves based
on costs in effect at year-end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices. Future development costs include
the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves
owned at year-end. They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of
production platforms and rehabilitation of drilling sites. Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect
at year-end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year-end. The resultant annual
future net cash flows (after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes) are discounted at
10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.

Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves (Standardised measure) continued
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of
which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof. The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of
the Group’s oil and gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in
excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and
income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and
gas.

Dry net development wells include 13 net wells that encountered problems during drilling and/or completion and were not pursued further.
Other is primarily comprised of Algeria, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom.
The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was
initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the
appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas
in another reservoir. A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon
known to be productive.
A productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or
extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Oil and gas properties, wells, operations, and acreage
The following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and
undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 30 June 2013. A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or
acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one. Productive wells are producing wells and wells
mechanically capable of production. Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well.
Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or
