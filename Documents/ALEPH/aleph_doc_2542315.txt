About Tasman Metals Ltd.
Tasman is a Canadian mineral exploration and development company focused on critical metals including Rare Earth Elements (REE's) and tungsten (W) in
Scandinavia. Tasman is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "TSM" and the NYSE-MKT under the symbol "TAS".  REE and tungsten
demand is increasing, due to the metals' unique properties that make them essential for high technology and industry.  Since over 95% of REE and 80% of
tungsten supply is sourced from China, the European Commission promotes policy to develop domestic supply of critical metals to ensure the security of
industry.  Tasman receives research funding from the European Commission.
Tasman's exploration portfolio is uniquely placed, with the capacity to deliver strategic metals from politically stable, mining friendly jurisdictions with
developed infrastructure and skills.  The Company's Norra Karr and Olserum projects in Sweden are two of the most significant known heavy REE resources
in the world, enriched in dysprosium, yttrium, terbium and neodymium.  The Company is now focused on the safe, sustainable and responsible development
of its Scandinavian mineral portfolio.
On behalf of the Board,
 
 
"Mark Saxon"

The TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange), the NYSE - MKT nor
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Mineral Resources and Reserves. In this news release, the definition of "mineral resources" is that used by the
Canadian securities administrators and conforms to the definition utilized by CIM in the "CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves – Definitions
and Guidelines" adopted on August 20, 2000 and amended December 11, 2005.
The standards employed in estimating the mineral resources referenced in this news release differ significantly from the requirements of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the resource information reported may not be comparable to similar information reported by United
States companies.  The term "resources" does not equate to "reserves" and normally may not be included in documents filed with the SEC.  "Resources" are
sometimes referred to as "mineralization" or "mineral deposits."  While the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral
resource" and "inferred mineral resource" are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, they are not defined terms under standards in the United
States and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC.

The terms "mineral reserve," "proven mineral reserve" and "probable mineral reserve" are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with National
Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and the CIM - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral
Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time by the CIM. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7 ("SEC Industry Guide 7") under the Securities Act of 1933. Under Canadian rules, estimates of
inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies, except in rare cases. Disclosure of "contained ounces" in a resource
is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute
"reserves" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.
The estimation of measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources involves greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the
estimation of proven and probable reserves.  U.S. investors are cautioned (i) not to assume that measured or indicated resources will be converted into
reserves and (ii) not to assume that estimates of inferred mineral resources exist, are economically or legally minable, or will be upgraded into measured or
indicated mineral resources.  It cannot be assumed that the Company will identify any viable mineral resources on its properties or that any mineral reserves,
if any, can be recovered profitably, if at all. As such, information contained in this news release and the documents incorporated by reference herein
concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by United
States companies in SEC filings.
Cautionary Statements. Certain statements found in this release may constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect the speaker's current views with respect to future events and financial performance and
include any statement that does not directly relate to a current or historical fact. Such statements reflect the current risks, uncertainties and assumptions
related to certain factors including, without limitations, competitive factors, general economic conditions, customer relations, uncertainties related to the
availability and costs of financing, unexpected geological conditions, success of future development initiatives, imprecision in resource estimates, ability to
obtain necessary permits and approvals, relationships with vendors and strategic partners, the interest rate environment, governmental regulation and
supervision, seasonality, technological change, changes in industry practices, changes in world metal markets, changes in equity markets, environmental
and safety risks, and one-time events.  Should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein. Forward-looking statements cannot be guaranteed and actual results may vary
materially due to the uncertainties and risks, known and unknown, associated with such statements. Shareholders and other readers should not place undue
reliance on "forward-looking statements," as such statements speak only as of the date of this release.
