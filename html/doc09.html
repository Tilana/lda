Bwampamye) / Burundi
Summary of Facts
1. Lawyers Fabien Segatwa, Moussa Coulibaly and Cédric Vergauwen, respectively called to the bars of
Burundi, Niger and Brussels and members of ''Avocats Sans Fronti?res'' in Burundi, and acting on behalf of
Mr Gaetan Bwampamye, currently detained at the Mpimba Prison (Bujumbura) present the facts of the
case as follows:
2. On 25 th September 1997, Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye was sentenced to death by the Criminal Chamber of
the Appeal Court of Ngozi after being convicted for having (in Ruhoro, on 21 October 1993, as author,
co-author or accomplice) incited the population to commit crimes, and for having (under the same
circumstance, organised as attack geared towards provoking massacres), set up barricades with a view to
hindering the enforcement of public order, all of which are offences under Articles 212, 417 and 425 of the
Penal Code of Burundi.
3. On 2 nd October 1997, he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Burundi. In support of his appeal, he
invoked six grounds, including the violation of Article 75 of the Penal Procedure Code of Burundi, Article 14
paragraph 3(d)
× Article 14 3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the
following minimum guarantees, in full equality: ...
(d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own
choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance
assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any
such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , as well as Article 51 of Decree No. 100/103 of
29 th August 1979, defining the status of the profession of lawyers. According to the complainants, the latter
argument was invoked by the accused to denounce the fact that he was denied the services of his counsel
during the public prosecution's closing address and that, in spite of his request for assistance, he was
compelled to prepare his own defence.
4. The Complainants assert that on 3 rd June 1997, the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Appeal closed the
hearing of the witnesses, and on account of the volume of the case, decided to adjourn the hearing to 20 th
August 1997.
5. During the hearing of 20 th August 1997, the prosecution refused to make its closing address, arguing
that it needed more time to study the contents of the statement of the defence counsel. The Criminal
Chamber therefore decided to adjourn the case to 25 September 1997. On that day, the counsel for the
defence was unable to attend the hearing due to ill health. Despite the repeated requests of Mr
Bwampanye for the case to be adjourned to another date, the Chamber decided to hear the prosecution,
and compelled the accused to defend himself, without the assistance of his lawyer. The verdict sentencing
him to death was rendered that same day at the end of the submissions.
6. The Complainants point out that the Supreme Court had rejected this argument, which the accused had
invoked before it. The accused had wanted the ruling of the Ngozi Court of Appeal quashed on the grounds
that insofar as the court is concerned, the law does not obligate the judge to designate a lawyer, but he
may do so.
7. The Supreme Court continues in the following terms "further, whereas for the specific case in question,
the accused has always been assisted by a lawyer, the evidence being that his lawyer had already
submitted his 19 page written arguments on 20 th August 1997, that has no furthermore they had already
pleaded together in the public hearing, whereas in the face of such situation, the plaintiff justification in
saying that the judge should have designated a lawyer for him whereas he already had one who had
already accomplished all the essential duties expected of a lawyer; that consequently, this argument is also
to be rejected" .
8. This line of argument of the Supreme Court is challenged by the complainants who raise a certain
number of points of law, including inter alia , the ignorance according to them by the said court of the
principles of the right of defence and judicial assistance. They claim that, this ruling of the Supreme Court is
1

not only contrary to the provisions of Article 73 of Burundi's Criminal Procedure Code which unequivocally
establishes the right to judicial assistance but also the general principle of oral submissions in criminal
proceedings.
9. They assert on the one hand that "whilst it is customary for a lawyer to communicate his pleas to the
prosecution before the closing address of the latter, no written rule requires him to do so" . On the other
hand, the complainants assert that "the lawyer is obviously never bound by the contents of a statement of
defence deposited before the hearing. Such a statement therefore is not exhaustive and may only be
confined to certain aspects of the case and not focus on issues that the defence intends to elaborate on
later at the bar. Counsel for the defence may also renounce certain arguments contained in his note,
depending on for instance the issues raised by the prosecution. This freedom is at the very core of the
rights of the defence. Before any decision, they assert, there is the unconditional right to oral submissions
and freedom of speech" .
10. The Complainants assert that this same freedom of speech was accorded to the prosecution, and recall
that the "prosecutor is never bound by the written closing speeches of his office." The principle is
furthermore established by the old saying that "the written word is not, as free as the spoken word" . They
vehemently assert, that in indicating in its judgement that the lawyer had already submitted a 19-page
statement of defence and that in this respect, he had accomplished all the fundamental duties of a lawyer",
the Court ignores all the principles that have just been set forth and, consequently, authorises a blatant
violation of the rights of the defence in general and the rights of judicial assistance in particular".
11. On the basis of the foregoing, the Complainant whilst stressing that the aim of the present complaint is
to highlight the above-mentioned violations, call on the Commission to rule that:
1.
2. By refusing Mr Gaetan Bwampamye the assistance of his legal counsel to plead his case, the
Criminal Chamber of the Ngozi Court of Appeal held a hearing which was not equitable under the
African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and all the relevant international instruments.
3. To establish the violation by the Republic of Burundi of the rights enshrined in the Charter more
specifically, the violation of Article 7.1.c of the Charter and the general principles on the rights of the
defence;
4. To report its findings to the parties concerned and to the Assembly of Heads of State and
Government of the OAU.

Procedure
12. The communication is dated 11 th April 1999. It was sent to the Secretariat by E-mail.
13. On account of the fact that the judgement of the Ngozi Court of Appeal (a major piece written in Kirundi)
was still being translated, the communication could not be brought before the Commission during its 25 th
Ordinary Session held in Bujumbura, in May 1999. Towards the end of the said Session however, the
plaintiffs forwarded to the Secretariat the outstanding documents, thus enabling it to complete the file on
the communication and bring the matter before the 26 th Session of the Commission.
14. At its 26 th Session, the Commission heard from the representatives of Mr Bwampamye who had come
to present their position on the matter. After a long debate, the Commission reached a decision to be
seized of the communication. Mr Bwampamye was represented by the following lawyers: Segatwa Fabien,
Seydou Doumbia and Boubine Toure (all of them being members of Avocats Sans Fronti?res ).
15. On 13 th December 1999, the Secretariat informed the parties of this decision and a letter signed by the
Chairman of the Commission, Rule 111 requesting a stay of execution was addressed to the Burundian
Head of State.
16. On 15 th February 2000, the Burundi office of Avocats Sans Fronti?res acknowledged receipt of the
letter of 13 th December 1999, addressed to it by the Secretariat without, however, communicating its
observations as regards the admissibility of the communication.

2

17. At its 27 th Ordinary Session held in Algiers, Algeria, the Commission examined the case and declared
it admissible and requested the parties to furnish it with arguments on its merits. It also requested the
Chairman of the Commission to repeat its earlier appeal for stay of execution pending the determination of
the communication.
18. The above decision was communicated to parties on 1 st August 2000.
19.During its 28 th Session, the Respondent State and Counsel for the complainant presented their written
and oral submissions before the Commission

Law
Admissibility
20. Article 56(5) of the Charter stipulates that "communications relating to human and peoples'
rights...received by the Commission shall be considered if they...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if
any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged..."
21. It is apparent from an examination of the documents appended to the dossier that the verdict handed
down on 25 th September 1997, by the Ngozi Court of Appeal, sentencing Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye to death
was confirmed on 5 October of the same year by the Supreme Court of Burundi. The Commission notes,
consequently, that the domestic remedies had been duly exhausted. For these reasons, it declares the
communication admissible.
22. In its oral submission, the respondent state argued that the Complainant had not exhausted other local
remedies which include "le recours dans l'intér?t de la loi" , revision and the plea for pardon.
23. The Commission however holds the view that the Complainant could only benefit from the first two
remedies at the initiative of the Ministry of Justice and also as a result of discovery of new facts that may
lead to reopening the file. With regard to the plea for pardon, it is not a judicial remedy but serves to affect
the execution of a sentence. For these reasons the Commission maintains its decision on admissibility.
Merits
24. Article 7 (1) (c) of the Charter states: "Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This
comprises...the right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice" .
25. In its verdict of 5 th October 1997, the Supreme Court of Burundi adjudged and stated:
"Whereas this Court is of the view that the law implies no obligation on the part of the judge to nominate a
lawyer, though he may do so; Whereas in the case under consideration, the accused had always been
assisted by a lawyer, proof being that his 19 page written plea of 20 th August was filed by his lawyer; and
that they had appeared together at the public sitting; Whereas, in view of such situation, the appellant has
no reason to claim that the judge should appoint a lawyer for him, since he already had one who had
performed all essential functions of a lawyer for him; this procedure is, therefore, also hereby rejected..."
26. The Commission recalls that the right to fair trial involves fulfilment of certain objective criteria, including
the right to equal treatment, the right to defence by a lawyer, especially where this is called for by the
interests of justice, as well as the obligation on the part of courts and tribunals to conform to international
standards in order to guarantee a fair trial to all. The Commission shall examine the verdict of the Ngozi
Court of Appeal, as well as that of the Supreme Court in light of the above criteria.
27. The right to equal treatment by a jurisdiction, especially in criminal matters, means, in the first place,
that both the defence and the public prosecutor shall have equal opportunity to prepare and present their
pleas and indictment during the trial. Simply put, they should argue their cases before the jurisdiction on an
equal footing. Secondly it entails the equal treatment of all accused persons by jurisdictions charged with
trying them. This does not mean that identical treatment should be meted to all accused. The idea here is
the principle that when objective facts are alike, the response of the judiciary should also be similar. There
is a breach of the principle of equality if judicial or administrative decisions are applied in a discriminatory
manner. In the case under consideration, it is expected of the Commission to attend to the first aspect, that
is, observation of the rule of equality of the means utilised by the defence and the prosecution.
28. The right to defence also implies that at each stage of the criminal proceedings, the accused and his
counsel should be able to reply to the indictment of the public prosecutor and should, in any case, be the
last to intervene before the court retires for deliberations.

29. The Ngozi Court of Appeal had on 25 th September 1997, handed down a verdict sentencing Mr
Bwampamye to death, thereby following the prayer of the public prosecutor, paying no heed to the
accused's prayer for adjournment of the case, pleading the absence of his lawyer. The Commission holds
the view that the judge should have upheld the prayer of the accused, in view of the irreversible character
of the penalty involved. This was all the more imperative considering that during the 20 >
