In connection with the Spin-off, the ordinary shares of Feishang Anthracite will be distributed on a pro rata basis to holders of record of the common shares of CHNR
on                       , 2013 (the “Distribution Record Date”). Holders of CHNR common shares (“CHNR Shareholders”) will be entitled to receive five Feishang Anthracite
ordinary shares for each CHNR common share held on the Distribution Record Date. CHNR Shareholders will not be required to pay any consideration for the Feishang
Anthracite ordinary shares that they will be entitled to receive in the Distribution or to surrender or exchange CHNR common shares in order to be entitled to receive
Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares and do not need to take any other action in connection with the Spin-off. No CHNR Shareholder approval of the Spin-off or
Distribution is required or sought. CHNR is not asking you for a proxy and you are requested not to send CHNR a proxy.

ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
Feishang Anthracite is a company incorporated in and under the laws of the British Virgin Islands with limited liability, and all of Feishang Anthracite’s directors and
officers reside outside the United States and all or a substantial portion of the assets of Feishang Anthracite and of such persons are located outside the United States. 
As a result, it may not be possible for shareholders to effect service of process within the United States upon Feishang Anthracite or such persons, or to enforce
against Feishang Anthracite or such persons judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the Federal
securities laws of the United States. Feishang Anthracite has been advised by its British Virgin Islands counsel, Maples and Calder, that there is doubt as to the
enforceability in the British Virgin Islands in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, or civil liabilities predicated solely upon
the Federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any State or territory within the United States. Feishang Anthracite has also been advised by its
PRC counsel, Commerce & Finance Law Offices, that there is doubt as to the enforceability in the PRC, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of
United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the Federal securities laws of the United States, since the PRC does not have treaties with the United
States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts.

SUMMARY
The following summary highlights information contained in, and is qualified in its entirety by, the more detailed information (including our consolidated financial
information and the notes thereto) appearing elsewhere in this information statement. Since the following is a summary, it does not contain all of the information relevant
to the Spin-off. Accordingly, you are urged to read the entire information statement, including the Hong Kong Listing Document.
OVERVIEW
We are a producer of anthracite coal based in Guizhou province of the PRC. We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, construction and development of anthracite
coal mines and the extraction and sale of anthracite coal. Our mining assets consist of seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four
have commenced commercial production, two are under construction and one is undergoing its pilot run phase. All of our anthracite coal mines are accessible by road
and located in Guizhou province, which, according to the latest report released by the SAWS, had the largest anthracite coal resources among the provinces in
Southwest China in 2008. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our seven anthracite coal mines as of the date of this listing document other than
information regarding the total proved and probable reserves of our anthracite coal mines, which was as of April 30, 2013.

(1)   Represents the annual production capacity as permitted under the relevant mining rights permits.
(2)   Operations have been suspended at Gouchang Coal Mine since March 2013 pending the acquisition by us of a nearby coal mine and Gouchang Coal Mine achieving
certain production capacity targets in accordance with Guizhou province’s coal mine consolidation policy.
As of April 30, 2013, we had total proved and probable coal reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes and total permitted annual production capacity of 2.34
million tonnes. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we sold 166,362 tonnes, 314,058 tonnes and 437,010 tonnes of anthracite coal, respectively, and had revenues of RMB38.7
million, RMB105.2 million and RMB141.9 million, respectively. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the average selling price of the anthracite coal we produced was RMB232.4,
RMB296.4 and RMB323.6 per tonne, respectively.
During the Track Record Period, we derived our revenue primarily from the sale of coal we produced. From time to time, we also engaged in coal trading activities by
selling coal that we purchased from third party suppliers. In 2011 and 2012, revenue from sales of third party coal was RMB33.1 million and RMB1.1 million,
respectively, representing 31.5% and 0.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. We did not engage in any coal trading activities in 2010, and we do not intend to engage
in any significant coal trading activities in the future.
In the PRC, end users generally characterize anthracite coal as thermal coal, chemical coal or PCI coal. Prior to 2011, we sold substantially all of the coal produced
from our mines as thermal coal. In each of 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 5% of our revenue from the sale of chemical coal we produced, while our
IS-5
remaining revenue in each of these years was derived from the sale of thermal coal we produced and coal sourced from third parties. Subject to market conditions, we
intend to significantly increase our sales of chemical coal in the future and begin selling PCI coal in 2014.
In order to increase our production capacity, we plan to optimize all of our currently operating anthracite coal mines by improving mine layout and upgrading mine
infrastructure and equipment. We expect that our optimization plans will begin in 2015 and, after their expected completion in December 2018, we expect to be able to
achieve an aggregate annual production capacity of 5.81 million tonnes. The estimated costs of our optimization plans are RMB807.5 million.
Under PRC law, each coal mine in the PRC must obtain certain permits prior to commencing commercial production, including a mining right permit, a safe production
permit and a coal production permit. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our mining right permits, safe production permits and coal production
permits as of the Latest Practicable Date:

(1)    In 2011 and 2012, the actual production output of Baiping Coal Mine exceeded its permitted annual production capacity under its mining right permit and coal production permit. See “Business — Our
Anthracite Coal Mines — Mines in Commercial Production — Baiping Coal Mine” on page 97 of the Hong Kong Listing Document. We have applied for a mining right permit with an annual production capacity of
300,000 tonnes for Baiping Coal Mine and we expect to obtain such permit in 2014.
(2)    The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank.
(3)    The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank and Bank of China.
(4)    The mining right has been pledged to China Merchants Bank.
(5)    The National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed certain amendments to the Coal Law, which became effective on June 29, 2013, including removing the requirement of obtaining coal
production permits.
Each of our anthracite coal mines currently utilizes manual longwall mining, semi-mechanical longwall mining or mechanical longwall mining methods to extract coal.
Longwall mining refers to extracting coal from long rectangular blocks of coal seams. Manual longwall mining refers to drilling holes in the mining face, placing
explosives and detonating the explosives to extract the coal. Mechanical and semi-mechanical longwall mining involve using a mechanical shearer in coal extraction. In
mechanical longwall mining, the mine roof is held up
IS-6
during the extraction process by automatic hydraulic roof supports, while in semi-mechanical longwall mining, the mine roof is held up hydraulic roof supports that are
operated manually. The following table sets forth the current extraction method of each of our anthracite coal mines:

Our capital expenditures were RMB219.7 million, RMB341.5 million and RMB360.2 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our capital expenditures primarily
related to the construction of our coal mines, purchase of mining-related equipment and machinery and pre-payments for land use rights for our coal mines. We expect
to pay approximately an aggregate of RMB545.0 million in 2013 and 2014 for capital expenditures. See Appendix III — “Competent Person’s Report” to the Hong Kong
Listing Document. We expect to fund these capital expenditures through interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings. See “Financial Information — Indebtedness”

mines.

(1)   Inventory turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the opening and closing balances of inventories for the year by cost of sales in that year
and multiplying by 360 days.  As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, inventory turnover days for 2010 is calculated by dividing the
arithmetic mean of the balance of inventories as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by cost of sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on
December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(2)   The average trade and bill payables turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the opening and ending balances of trade and bill payables for
the year by cost of sales in the year and then multiplying by 360 days.  As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average trade and bill
payables turnover days for 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill payables as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by cost
of sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(3)   The average trade and bill receivables turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the opening and ending balances of trade and bill receivables
for the year by revenue in that year and then multiplying by 360 days.  As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average trade and bill
receivables turnover days for 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill receivables as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by
revenue for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(4)   Gearing ratio is calculated by dividing total interest-bearing debt by total capital at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%.  Interest-bearing debt includes
interest-bearing loans and mining rights payables.  Capital includes total equity and interest-bearing debt.
(5)   Gross margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%.
IS-12
RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION
You should carefully consider the risks described below and under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 31 in the Hong Kong Listing Document.
The combined market value of CHNR common shares and Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares after the Spin-off may be less than the market value of CHNR
common shares prior to the Spin-off.
CHNR currently has two business segments: base metals exploration and mining; and anthracite coal exploration and mining, which is operated through Feishang
Anthracite.  After the completion of the Distribution, CHNR will no longer hold any Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares and, accordingly, it will only retain its base metals
exploration mining business.  Until the market has fully evaluated the business of CHNR without Feishang Anthracite, as well as the business of Feishang Anthracite on
a stand-alone basis, the trading price of the common shares of CHNR and the ordinary shares of Feishang Anthracite may fluctuate significantly.  In particular, the
combined market value of CHNR common shares and Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares after the Spin-off may be significantly less than the market value of CHNR
common shares prior to the Spin-off.
CHNR intends to treat the Distribution as a taxable dividend for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
It is not clear whether the Distribution would qualify  as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If
CHNR is required to report the Distribution to the IRS, CHNR intends to treat the Distribution as a taxable dividend to its Shareholders  for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes. Under this treatment, as explained in “Certain Material Tax Consequences — United States Federal Income Taxation” in this information statement, U.S.
holders of CHNR common shares would be subject to tax on the fair market value of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares they receive. Holders should consult
their own tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences of the Distribution in light of their particular circumstances.
Holders of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares located in the United States may not be able to participate in rights offerings or elect to receive dividends
in the form of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares and may experience dilution of their holdings.
We may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. We may not offer or sell securities in the United States unless we
register those securities under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these
rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares located
in the United States may be unable to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result.
We may offer, from time to time, a share dividend election to all our shareholders, subject to applicable securities laws, in respect of future dividends. We will, however,
not permit our shareholders to exercise such election unless the issuance of our ordinary shares pursuant to such election is either exempt from registration under the
Securities Act or registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish an exemption from registration under
the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to shares issuable pursuant to these elections or to endeavor to have a
registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act. In addition, we may choose not to offer such election to some shareholders, and may instead offer
those shareholders dividends in the form of cash only. Accordingly, our shareholders may be unable to elect to receive dividends in the form of our ordinary shares
rather than cash and, as a result may experience dilution of their holdings.
We are a British Virgin Islands company and, because the rights of shareholders under British Virgin Islands differ from those under U.S. law, you may have
difficulty protecting your shareholder rights.
We are a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. In addition, all of
our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or
enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or executive officers.
Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, The BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, of the British Virgin
Islands and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the
fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by The BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, and the common law
of the British Virgin Islands. The common law of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as
well
IS-13
as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions
in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states, such as
Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a
shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States.
The British Virgin Islands courts are also unlikely:
·                                          to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal securities
laws; and
·                                          to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal
securities laws that are penal in nature.
There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will generally
recognize and enforce a non-penal final and conclusive monetary judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits.
As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the
board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. company.
IS-14
EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION
The PRC
The People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) sets and publishes daily a base exchange rate with reference primarily to the supply and demand of Renminbi against a basket of
currencies in the markets during the prior day. The PBOC also takes into account other factors such as the general conditions existing in the international foreign
exchange market. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of Renminbi to that of the U.S. dollar. Under the policy,
Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies determined by the PBOC. On May 18, 2007, the
PBOC increased the floating band of Renminbi trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the interbank spot foreign currency exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. This
allows the Renminbi to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar by up to 0.5% above or below the central parity rate published by the PBOC. On June 19, 2010, the PBOC
announced that it intends to further reform the Renminbi exchange rate regime by allowing greater flexibility in the Renminbi exchange rate. According to this
announcement, the exchange rate floating bands will remain the same as previously announced, but the PBOC will place more emphasis on reflecting market supply
and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The floating band was further widened to 1.0% since April 16, 2012. The PRC government in the future may make
further adjustments to the exchange rate system. The PBOC authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, effective since January 4, 2006, to announce the
central parity exchange rate of certain foreign currencies against the Renminbi at 9:15 a.m. each business day. This rate is set as the central parity for the trading
against the Renminbi in the inter-bank foreign exchange spot market and the over the counter exchange rate for that business day.
The following table sets forth the exchange rates between Renminbi and U.S. dollar for the periods indicated:

Hong Kong
The Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible into the U.S. dollar. Since October 17, 1983, the Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of HK$7.80
to US$1.00. Under existing Hong Kong law, (i) there are no foreign exchange controls that affect the remittance of dividend payments to United States residents and
(ii) there are no limitations on the rights of non-residents or foreign owners to hold the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (the “Basic Law”), which came into effect on July 1, 1997, provides that no foreign exchange control policies
shall be applied in Hong Kong.
The market exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar continues to be determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange
market. However, against the background of the fixed rate system which applies to the issuance and withdrawal of Hong Kong currency in circulation, the market
exchange rate has not deviated significantly from the level of HK$7.80 to US$1.00 since the peg was first established. However, in May 2005, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority broadened the 22-year old trading band from the original rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar to a rate range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong
government has indicated its intention to maintain the link within that rate range. Under the Basic Law, the Hong Kong dollar will continue to circulate and remain freely
convertible. The Hong Kong government has also stated that it has no intention to impose exchange controls in Hong Kong and that the Hong Kong dollar will remain
freely convertible into other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. However, no assurance can be given that the Hong Kong government will maintain the link at HK$7.75
to HK$7.85 to US$1.00 or at all.

THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which commenced trading on April 2, 1986, was formed upon the unification of the four stock exchanges then existing in Hong Kong
and, by the end of 2012, listed the shares of 1,368 companies on the main board with a total market capitalization of approximately HK$21,872 billion. During the month
ended December 31, 2012, the average trading volume in value for the main board per trading day on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was approximately HK$61,092
million. On March 3, 1999, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong announced in his budget speech a comprehensive reform of the securities and futures markets in Hong
Kong, which included the demutualization and merger of the five recognized and approved market operators in Hong Kong, namely the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,
Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited, HKSCC, The SEHK Options Clearing House Limited and HKFE Clearing Corporation Limited under a single holding company
(which was subsequently incorporated under the name of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEx”)). The merger became effective on March 6, 2000.
As a result of the merger, the former shareholders of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited (together, the “Exchanges”) effectively
exchanged their ownership rights in the Exchanges for economic interests in HKEx and the conventional right to receive dividends, while retaining their existing rights to
trade on the Exchanges. At the same time, certain of the regulatory functions performed by the Exchanges were passed over to the SFC.
Shares in the HKEx were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on June 27, 2000. As a listed company on its own stock market, HKEx is regulated by the SFC to
avoid any conflict of interest and to ensure a level playing field between HKEx and other listed companies which are subject to the Listing Rules. Regulation by the SFC
is imposed through two sets of provisions. First, the Listing Rules have been amended to incorporate a new chapter (Chapter 38) relating specifically to the listing of
HKEx and which sets out the requirements that must be satisfied for the securities of HKEx to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Second, a Memorandum of
Understanding, dated June 19, 2000 (which was subsequently replaced and superseded by another Memorandum of Understanding dated August 22, 2001), has been
entered into among the SFC, HKEx and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange which sets forth the manner the parties to it will relate to each other in relation to:
·                                          HKEx’s and other applicants’ and issuers’ compliance with the Listing Rules;
·                                          the enforcement by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange of its rules in relation to HKEx’s securities and those of other applicants and issuers;
·                                          the SFC’s supervision and regulation of HKEx as a listed issuer and, where a conflict of interest arises, other applicants and issuers;
·                                          conflicts of interest which may arise between the interests of HKEx as a listed company and companies of which it is the controller, and the
interests in the proper performance of regulatory functions by such companies; and
·                                          market integrity.
Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange takes place on each business day with continuous trading being divided into morning and afternoon sessions. Trading is
order-based using a computer-assisted trading system that conveys bid and ask prices for securities. Trades are then effected on a matched trade basis directly
between buyers and sellers. All securities are traded in board lots. For most companies a board lot is 1,000 shares or 2,000 shares; odd lots are traded separately,
usually at a small discount to the board lot prices. Settlement of trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is required to take place on the second trading day after the
day the trade takes place. All trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are generally required to be settled between broker participants through CCASS, the central
clearing and settlement system, operated by HKSCC. CCASS is the central depositary of share certificates and provides a computerized book-entry settlement of share
transactions between its participants, which includes all broker participants of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Share certificates kept at CCASS are electronically
recorded in the stock accounts of its participants. CCASS also facilitates money settlement between
IS-19
participants. It is also possible for settlement to take place outside CCASS (except in relation to trades between broker participants of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange).
In such a case, share certificates, together with signed instruments of transfer, must be delivered on the second business day following the transaction and will typically
be delivered against payment by check or bank cashier orders. There are no market-makers in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange except in the market for exchange-
traded options, but exchange dealers may act as dual capacity broker-dealers. Short selling of securities at or through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is currently
prohibited except in respect of a limited group of securities.
The SFC charges a transaction levy of 0.003% of the consideration of each transaction and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange charges a trading fee of 0.005% of the
consideration of each transaction, payable by both seller and buyer. In addition, member brokers charge brokerage commissions to either a buyer or a seller which are
freely negotiated between such brokers and their clients. Additional administrative fees are also payable for trades settled through CCASS. Member brokers are required
to make a contract note in respect of each transaction in securities. The contract note is required to be stamped with ad valorem stamp duty and to be delivered to the
client not later than the end of the second trading day following the transaction.
The SFC, an independent, non-government statutory body outside the civil service that provides a general regulatory framework of the securities and futures industries,
was established by the Hong Kong government in 1989. The SFC administers certain elements of Hong Kong securities law, including the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (Chapter 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong) which regulates, among other things, activities in the securities market, requirements and conduct of intermediaries,
investor compensation, market misconduct and disclosure of interests.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange promulgates its own rules governing share trading and disclosure of information to shareholders and investors. Companies listed on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange are required to comply with the provisions of the Listing Rules, which provide for, among other things, the issuance of interim and audited
annual accounts to shareholders and the making of prompt public disclosure of material transactions and developments. In addition, the Hong Kong Codes on
Takeovers and Mergers and Share Repurchases, which have been issued by the SFC but do not have the force of law, provide guidelines for the fair treatment of
shareholders and preservation of an impartial trading market in connection with takeovers and mergers of public companies in Hong Kong and guidelines for share
repurchases by such companies. Part XV of the Securities and Futures Ordinance also contains provisions which require certain persons interested (or deemed to be
interested) in shares, underlying shares and short positions in listed companies in Hong Kong to disclose their interest in those shares in certain circumstances.
Disclosure of the Directors’ interests in the Company is set out in Appendix V — “Statutory and General Information — Disclosure of Interests” starting on page V-13 in
the Hong Kong Listing Document.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange imposes a requirement on us to keep the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Shareholders and other holders of our listed securities
informed as soon as reasonably practicable of any information relating to us, including information which (i) is necessary to avoid a false market in our securities, or
(ii) constitutes inside information within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance and which is required to be disclosed under Part XIVA of the Securities and
Futures Ordinance.
There are also requirements under the Listing Rules for us to obtain prior shareholders’ approval and/or to disclose to shareholders details of certain acquisitions or
disposal of assets and connected transactions.

IS-21
CERTAIN MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
The following discussion of the material British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and United States Federal income tax consequences of the Distribution is based upon laws
and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this information statement, all of which are subject to change. This discussion does not address all
possible tax consequences relating to the Distribution ordinary shares, including the tax consequences under United States state and local tax laws. CHNR
Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers concerning the overall tax consequences to them, including consequences arising under United States state
and local or other tax laws.
British Virgin Islands Tax Consequences
The distribution of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares as part of the Distribution will not be subject to British Virgin Islands tax.
Feishang Anthracite, as well as all dividends, interest, rents, royalties, compensation and other amounts paid by Feishang Anthracite to persons who are not resident in
the British Virgin Islands and any capital gains realized with respect to any shares, debt obligations or other securities of Feishang Anthracite by persons who are not
resident in the British Virgin Islands are exempt from all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance in the British Virgin Islands.
No estate, inheritance, succession or gift tax, rate, duty, levy or other charge is payable by persons who are not resident in the British Virgin Islands with respect to any
shares, debt obligation or other securities of Feishang Anthracite.
All instruments relating to transfers of property to or by Feishang Anthracite and all instruments relating to transactions in respect of the shares, debt obligations or other
securities of Feishang Anthracite and all instruments relating to other transactions relating to the business of CHNR or Feishang Anthracite are exempt from payment of
stamp duty in the British Virgin Islands. This assumes that CHNR and Feishang Anthracite do not hold an interest in real estate in the British Virgin Islands.
There are currently no withholding taxes or exchange control regulations in the British Virgin Islands applicable to Feishang Anthracite.
Hong Kong Tax Consequences
The distribution of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares as part of the Distribution will not be subject to Hong Kong tax.
Dividends
No tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by Feishang Anthracite.
Capital Gains and Profits Tax
No tax is imposed in Hong Kong in respect of capital gains from the sale of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares.
Trading gains from the sale of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares by persons carrying on a trade, profession or business in Hong Kong where such gains arise in or are
derived from Hong Kong from such trade, profession or business will be chargeable to Hong Kong profits tax. Currently, profits tax is imposed on corporations at the rate
of 16.5% and on individuals and unincorporated businesses at a maximum rate of 15.0%. Gains from sales of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares effected on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange will be considered to arise in or be derived from Hong Kong. Liability for Hong Kong profits tax may thus arise in respect of trading gains
IS-22
from sales of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares effected on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange realized by persons carrying on a business or trading or dealing in
securities in Hong Kong.
Stamp Duty
Hong Kong stamp duty will be payable by the purchaser on every purchase, and by the seller on every sale, of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares registered on
Feishang Anthracite’s Hong Kong branch register. The duty is charged at the ad valorem rate of 0.1% of the consideration for, or (if greater) the value of, the shares
transferred on each of the seller and purchaser. In other words, a total of 0.2% is currently payable on a typical sale and purchase transaction of shares. In addition, any
instrument of transfer (if required) will be subject to a flat rate of stamp duty of HK$5.00. Where a sale or purchase of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares registered on
Feishang Anthracite’s Hong Kong branch register is effected by a person who is not resident in Hong Kong and any stamp duty payable on the contract note is not paid,
the relevant instrument of transfer (if any) shall be chargeable with such duty. If stamp duty is not paid on or before the due date, a penalty of up to ten times the duty
payable may be imposed.
No Hong Kong stamp duty will be levied on the transfer of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares that are registered on a share register outside Hong Kong.
No Hong Kong stamp duty is payable in connection with the distribution of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares to CHNR Shareholders in the Distribution.
United States Federal Income Taxation
This summary describes certain material U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the Distribution for CHNR Shareholders, but it does not purport to be a
comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to such holder, including tax considerations that arise from rules of general application to
all taxpayers or to certain classes of investors or that are generally assumed to be known by holders. This summary applies only to a holder that will hold the Feishang
Anthracite ordinary shares it receives in the Distribution as a capital asset, and does not apply to a holder subject to special rules, such as a dealer in securities or
currencies, a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings; a bank; a life-insurance company; a tax-exempt
organization; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; a person subject to the alternative minimum tax; U.S. expatriates; a person that holds his
or her CHNR common shares (or that will hold his or her Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares) as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction for tax purposes; a
person whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar; or a person that owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of any class of CHNR common shares
(or of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares).
This summary is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as
currently in effect. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and other national tax consequences of the Distribution in light of
their particular circumstances.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is, generally, a beneficial owner of CHNR common shares that is: (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. Federal income taxation regardless of its source; (iv) a trust if a court within the
United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust;
or (v) any other person that is subject to U.S. Federal income taxation on a net income basis with respect to the CHNR common shares.
If a partnership or other pass-through entity is a beneficial owner of CHNR common shares, the tax treatment of a partner or other owner will generally depend upon the
status of the partner or other owner and the
IS-23
activities of the entity. Partners and other owners of a partnership or other pass-through entity that own CHNR common shares should consult their own tax adviser
regarding the tax consequences of the Distribution.
For the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the Distribution to a holder that is not a U.S. Holder (a “non-U.S. Holder”), see the discussion below under “— Non-
U.S. Holders.”
U.S. Holders
Taxation of the Distribution
It is not clear whether the Distribution should be treated as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Code. If CHNR is required to report the Distribution to the IRS,
CHNR intends to take the view that the Distribution will be treated as a taxable distribution, and the remainder of the disclosure so assumes. Under this treatment, for
U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Distribution should be a taxable event for holders of CHNR common shares on the Distribution Record Date. Accordingly, a U.S.
Holder:
·                                          should generally be treated as having received (at the time of receipt of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares) a taxable distribution (as
explained below) in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares received in the Distribution,
·                                          should have a tax basis in its Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares equal to their fair market value on the date of the Distribution, and
·                                          should have a holding period in its Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares that will commence on the day after the date of the Distribution.
The fair market value of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares distributed by CHNR to a U.S. Holder should be taxed as a “dividend” to the extent of such holder’s
proportionate share of CHNR’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (if any), and should otherwise be (i) a tax-free return of capital to the extent of such holder’s
adjusted tax basis in his or her CHNR common shares and (ii) thereafter as a capital gain. CHNR does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance
with U.S. Federal income tax principles; accordingly holders should assume that the entire Distribution should be taxed as a dividend. CHNR intends to treat the
distribution of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares as a taxable dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the remainder of the disclosure so assumes.
Dividend Amount
Under the U.S. federal income tax laws, and subject to the passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, rules discussed below, if you are a U.S. Holder, the dividend
amount is subject to U.S. federal income taxation.  If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, the dividend will be taxable to you at a maximum rate of 20% provided that
you hold the CHNR common shares for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the distribution date and meet other holding period
requirements. The dividend amount will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporations.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
A foreign corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year in which (i) 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or (ii) 50% or more of the average
value (or, if elected, the adjusted tax basis) of its assets are considered “passive assets” (generally, assets that generate passive income).
Based on CHNR’s audited accounts and relevant market and shareholder data, CHNR believes that it was not a PFIC for U.S. Federal income tax purposes under the
foregoing tests with respect to its 2012 taxable year, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change.
If CHNR were classified as a PFIC for 2012 or 2013, a U.S. Holder could be subject to an increased tax liability (possibly including an interest charge) upon the receipt
of the Distribution. The PFIC rules are complex, and holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules to the
Distribution.
IS-24
Taxation of Future Distributions from Feishang Anthracite
Distributions made by Feishang Anthracite to a U.S. Holder should generally be taxed as a “dividend” to the extent of such holder’s proportionate share of Feishang
Anthracite’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (if any), and should otherwise be (i) a tax-free return of capital to the extent of such holder’s adjusted tax
basis in his or her Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares and (ii) thereafter as a capital gain. Feishang Anthracite does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits
in accordance with U.S. Federal income tax principles; accordingly, holders should assume that distributions they receive on their Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares
should generally be taxed as dividends.
Distributions treated as dividends are includable in the income of a U.S. Holder as foreign source ordinary dividend income on the date the distribution is received by the
holder and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Dividends paid in a foreign currency will be included in the income of a U.S.
Holder as a dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, whether or not converted into U.S. dollars.
Sale, Exchange or Disposition of Feishang Anthracite Ordinary Shares
Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax as
capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares (which, as indicated
under “— United States Federal Income Taxation — U.S. Holders — Taxation of the Distribution,” should generally be equal to their fair market value on the date of the
Distribution) and the dollar-value of the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition. If the amount realized is denominated in a foreign currency, such
amount shall be determined at the spot rate on the date of disposition, or, at the spot rate on the settlement date if the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares are traded
on an established securities market and the holder is a cash basis U.S. holder or an accrual basis U.S. holder that so elects.
The gain or loss will be long-term gain or loss if the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares were held for more than one year. The excess of net long-term capital gains
over net short-term capital losses generally will be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income for non-corporate taxpayers. The deduction of capital losses is subject to
limitations.
Non-U.S. Holders
A Non-U.S. Holder generally will be exempt from U.S. Federal income tax, including withholding tax and backup withholding tax, with respect to the Distribution.
Similarly, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be exempt from U.S. Federal income tax, including withholding tax and backup withholding tax, with respect to distributions
from, and sale, exchange or other disposition of, its Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares. However, to qualify for these exemptions, a Non-U.S. Holder may be required
to satisfy certain certification requirements of the Internal Revenue Service to establish that it is not a U.S. person. See “—United States Federal Income Taxation —
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below.
Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets
Owners of “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 (and in some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required to file an
information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns.  “Specified foreign financial assets” may include financial accounts maintained by foreign financial
institutions, as well as the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions:  (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States
persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities.  Holders
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of the Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
To the extent paid within the United States or through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries, the Distribution as well as future distributions on Feishang Anthracite
ordinary shares and the sale, exchange or disposition of Feishang Anthracite ordinary shares are subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup
withholding unless the holder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of exemption from
backup withholding has occurred. Non-U.S. Holders generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, a Non-U.S. Holder may be
required to provide a certification as to its non-U.S. status in connection with payments received within the United States or through certain U.S. related financial
intermediaries.
IS-25
Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against a holder’s United
States Federal income tax liability, provided that such holder provides the required information to the United States Internal Revenue Service.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31,
2010, 2011 and 2012 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity
with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2011 AND 2012
2.1                     BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Company was part of a series of reorganisations and became the holding companies now comprising the Group since July 2011.
The consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group for the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 include the results and cash flows of all companies now comprising the Group, as if the Group structure had been in
existence throughout each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, or since the respective dates of incorporation/establishment of the combining
companies, or since the date when the subsidiaries and/or businesses first came under the common control of the controlling shareholder, whichever is a shorter period.
The consolidated statements of financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been prepared to present the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiaries and/or businesses comprising the Group at these dates, as if the Group structure had been in existence as at these dates. The net assets and results of
the relevant companies of the Group were consolidated using the existing book values from the controlling shareholder’s perspective. No adjustments are made to
reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities as a result of the reorganisations.
Equity interests in subsidiaries and held by parties other than the controlling shareholder prior to the reorganisations, if significant, are presented as non-controlling
interests in equity in applying the principles of merger accounting.
All intra-group transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.
2.2                     BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. All IFRSs effective for the annual period commencing from
January 1, 2012, together with the relevant transitional provisions, have been early adopted by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
throughout the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Renminbi (“RMB”).
GOING CONCERN
As of December 31, 2012, the Group had a working capital deficiency of RMB1,030.1 million and the Group has undrawn loan facilities totalling RMB275.0 million to
finance its future operations.  Subsequent to years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and, the Group has secured an additional loan facilities as at July 5, 2013
totalling RMB1,139.6 million (note 36). The Group’s forecasts and projections, after taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, operating as
well as capital expenditure, and of the available bank facilities, support that the Group’s ability to continue to operate within the level of its current capacity.
In view of the above, in the opinion of the Directors, the Group expects it will have sufficient liquidity to finance its operations for the next twelve months. Therefore, the
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that the Group will continue in operation for the
foreseeable future and will be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

Further information about those changes that are expected to significantly affect the Group is as follows:
The IFRS 7 Amendments require an entity to disclose information about rights to set-off and related arrangements (e.g., collateral agreements). The disclosures would
provide users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The new disclosures are required for all
recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. The disclosures also apply to recognised financial
instruments that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are set off in accordance with IAS 32. The
Group expects to adopt the amendments from January 1, 2013.

2.3                     ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
IFRS 9 issued in November 2009 is the first part of phase 1 of a comprehensive project to entirely replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
This phase focuses on the classification and measurement of financial assets. Instead of classifying financial assets into four categories, an entity shall classify
financial assets as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, on the basis of both the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. This aims to improve and simplify the approach for the classification and measurement of financial
assets compared with the requirements of IAS 39.
In October 2010, the IASB issued additions to IFRS 9 to address financial liabilities (the “Additions”) and incorporated in IFRS 9 the current derecognition principles of
financial instruments of IAS 39. Most of the Additions were carried forward unchanged from IAS 39, while changes were made to the measurement of financial liabilities
designated as at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option (“FVO”). For these FVO liabilities, the amount of change in the fair value of a liability that is
attributable to changes in credit risk must be presented in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). The remainder of the change in fair value is presented in the income
statement, unless presentation of the fair value change in respect of the liability’s credit risk in OCI would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in the income
statement. However, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts which have been designated under the FVO are scoped out of the Additions.
IAS 39 is aimed to be replaced by IFRS 9 in its entirety. Before this entire replacement, the guidance in IAS 39 on hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets
continues to apply. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 9 from January 1, 2015. The Group will quantify the effect in conjunction with other phases, when the final
standard including all phases is issued.
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities or structured entities. It includes a new definition of control which
is used to determine which entities are consolidated. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management of the Group to exercise significant judgment to
determine which entities are controlled, compared with the requirements in IAS 27 and SIC 12 Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 replaces the portion
of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also includes the issues raised in
SIC 12. Based on the preliminary analyses performed, IFRS 10 is not expected to have any impact on the currently held investments of the Group.
IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC 13 Jointly Controlled Entities — Non-Monetary Contributions by Ventures. It describes the accounting for
joint arrangements with joint control. It addresses only two forms of joint arrangements, i.e., joint operations and joint ventures, and removes the option to account for
joint ventures using proportionate consolidation.
IFRS 12 includes the disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities previously included in IAS 27 Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements, IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and IAS 28 Investments in Associates. It also introduces a number of new disclosure requirements
for these entities.
In June 2012, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 which clarify the transition guidance in IFRS 10 and provide further relief from full
retrospective application of these standards, limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. The
amendments clarify that retrospective adjustments are only required if the consolidation conclusion as to which entities are controlled by the Group is different between
IFRS 10 and IAS 27 or SIC 12 at the beginning of the annual period in which IFRS 10 is applied for the first time. Furthermore, for disclosures related to unconsolidated
structured entities, the amendments will remove the requirement to present comparative information for periods before IFRS 12 is first applied.

2.3                     ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
The amendments to IFRS 10 issued in October 2012 include a definition of an investment entity and provide an exception to the consolidation requirement for entities
that meet the definition of an investment entity. Investment entities are required to account for subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9
rather than consolidate them. Consequential amendments were made to IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (Revised). The amendments to IFRS 12 also set out the disclosure
requirements for investment entities. The Group expects that these amendments will not have any impact on the Group as the Company is not an investment entity as
defined in IFRS 10.
Consequential amendments were made to IAS 27 and IAS 28 as a result of the issuance of IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 10, IFRS
11, IFRS 12 and the consequential amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 28 from January 1, 2013.
IFRS 13 provides a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The standard does
not change the circumstances in which the Group is required to use fair value, but provides guidance on how fair value should be applied where its use is already
required or permitted under other IFRSs. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 13 prospectively from January 1, 2013.
The IAS 1 amendments change the grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income. Items that could be reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future
point in time (for example, upon de-recognition or settlement) would be presented separately from items which will never be reclassified. The Group expects to adopt the
amendments from January 1, 2013.
The IAS 19 Amendments include a number of amendments that range from fundamental changes to simple clarifications and re-wording. The amendments introduce
significant changes in the accounting for defined benefit pension plans including removing the choice to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses. Other
changes include modifications to the timing of recognition for termination benefits, the classification of short-term employee benefits and disclosures of defined benefit
plans. The Group expects to adopt the IAS 19 Amendments from January 1, 2013.
The IAS 32 Amendments clarify the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right to set off” for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The
amendments also clarify the application of the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to settlement systems (such as central clearing house systems) which apply gross settlement
mechanisms that are not simultaneous. The amendments are not expected to have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group upon adoption on
January 1, 2014.
The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 36 address the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value
less costs of disposal. When developing IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, the IASB decided to amend IAS 36 to require disclosures about the recoverable amount of
impaired assets. The Group expects to adopt the amendments from January 1, 2014.
The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 39 will allow hedge accounting to continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated as a hedging instrument,
is novated to effect clearing with a central counterparty as a result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met (in this context, a novation indicates that parties to
a contract agree to replace their original counterparty with a new one). The amendments are not expected to have any impact on the financial position or performance of
the Group upon adoption on January 1, 2014.

IFRIC Interpretation 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It
also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant
legislation. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be recognised before the specified minimum
threshold is reached. The Group expects to adopt the amendments from January 1, 2014.
The Group has already commenced an assessment of the related impact of the above revised standards, amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial
statements and is not expecting any significant impact on the Group’s financial position and results.
Improvements to IFRSs
Apart from the above, the IASB has also issued improvements to IFRSs which set out amendments to a number of IFRSs primarily with a view to remove
inconsistencies and clarify wording. The adoption of those amendments upon their effective dates did not have any material impact on the accounting policies, financial
position or performance of the Group. While the adoption of some of the amendments when they will become effective after July 1, 2012 may result in changes in
accounting policy, none of them are expected to have a material financial impact on the Group.

2.4                     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a)                        Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity whose financial and operating policies the Group controls, directly or indirectly, so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
(b)                        Business combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporates the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and
2012. As explained in note 2.1 above, the acquisition of subsidiaries and business under common control, where applicable, has been accounted for using merger
accounting. The financial statements of the combining entities or businesses under common control are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using
consistent accounting policies.
The merger method of accounting involves incorporating the financial statement items of the combining entities or businesses in which the common control
combinations occurs as if they had been combined from the date when the combining entities or businesses first came under the control of the controlling shareholder.
The net assets of the combining entities or businesses are combined using the existing book values from the controlling shareholder’s perspective. No amount is
recognised in respect of goodwill or the excess of the acquirers’ interest in the net fair value of acquirees’ identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the
cost of investment at the time of common control combination.
The consolidated income statement include the results of each of the combining entities or businesses from the earliest date presented or since the date when the
combining entities or businesses first came under common control or since their respective dates of incorporation/establishment, where this is a shorter period,
regardless of the date of the common control combination. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and
dividends are eliminated on consolidation
Business combinations, other than business combinations under common control, are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For
each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their
holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. All other
components of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts
by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair
value at the acquisition date through the income statement.

(b)                       Business combinations (continued)
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the
contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or as a change to other
comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it will not be remeasured. Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In
instances where the contingent consideration does not fall within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any fair
value of the Group’s previously held equity interests in the acquiree over the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the sum of this consideration and
other items is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is, after reassessment, recognised in the income statement as a gain
on bargain purchase.

(d)                       Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprise buildings, mining structures, mining rights, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, exploration rights and construction in
progress.
Exploration rights are capitalised and amortised over the term of the license granted to the Company by the authorities.
When proven and probable coal reserves have been determined, costs incurred to develop coal mines are capitalised as part of the cost of the mining structures.
Buildings, mining structures, machinery and equipment, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Expenditures
for routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Mining rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. The costs of mining rights are initially capitalised when purchased. If proven
and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed, costs are capitalised and are
amortised upon production based on actual units of production over the estimated reserves of the mines. For mining rights in which proven and probable reserves have
not yet been established, the Group assesses the carrying value for impairment at the end of each reporting period. The Group’s rights to extract minerals are
contractually limited by time. However, the Group believes that it will be able to extend licenses.
Mining related buildings, mining structures and mining related machinery and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Those mining related assets for which proven and probable reserves have been established are depreciated upon production based on actual units of production over the
estimated proven and probable reserves of the mines.
Reserve estimates are reviewed when information becomes available that indicates a reserve change is needed, or at a minimum once a year. Any material effect from
changes in estimates is considered in the period the change occurs.
Depreciation for the following items is calculated on the straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated useful life down to the estimated residual value of each asset.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:
Non-mining related buildings
Non-mining related machinery and equipment
Motor vehicles
15 - 35 years 
5 - 15 years 
5 - 8 years
Residual values, useful lives and the depreciation method are reviewed and, adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
When properties are retired or otherwise disposed, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on
disposition is recognised in the income statement.
Construction in progress is carried at cost and is to be depreciated when placed into service over the estimated useful lives or units of production of those assets.
Construction costs are capitalised as incurred. Interest is capitalised as incurred during the construction period.

(e)                        Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation assets include topographical and geological surveys, exploratory drilling, sampling and trenching and activities in relation to commercial and
technical feasibility studies, and expenditure incurred to secure further mineralisation in existing coal bodies and to expand the capacity of a mine. Expenditure incurred
prior to acquiring legal rights to explore an area is expensed as incurred.
Once the exploration right to explore has been acquired, exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred, unless a future
economic benefit is more likely than not to be realised. Exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value. They
are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated impairment.
When it can be reasonably ascertained that a mining property is capable of commercial production, exploration and evaluation costs are transferred to tangible or
intangible assets according to the nature of the exploration and evaluation assets. If any project is abandoned during the evaluation stage, the total expenditure thereon
will be written off.
(f)                         Impairment of non-financial assets
Where an indication of impairment exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required (other than inventories, financial assets, etc.), the asset’s
recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets
or groups of assets, in which case the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The fair value less costs to sell
calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in arm’s length transactions of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs
for disposing of the asset or other appropriate valuation technique. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model, using a discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is charged to the income statement in the
period in which it arises in those categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or
may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss of an asset other than goodwill is
reversed on if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of that asset, but not to an amount higher than the carrying amount
that would have been determined (net of any depreciation / amortisation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of such an
impairment loss is credited to the income statement in the period in which it arises (only if there are revalued assets in the financial statement), unless the asset is
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting policy for that revalued
asset.

(g)                        Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurements
As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Group’s financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are all classified as loans and receivables. The Group determines the
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, that is, the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular
way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in
the marketplace.
Subsequent measurement of loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current
assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in “trade
and bills receivables”, “prepayments, deposits and other receivables”, “term deposits with an original maturity over three months”, “restricted bank deposits”, “cash and
cash equivalents”, “rehabilitation fund” and “due from related companies” in the consolidated statements of financial position. These assets are subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method (“EIR”) less any provision for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the interest income or finance costs in
the consolidated income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Fair value of loans and receivables
As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the carrying amounts of rehabilitation fund are not materially different from their fair values. The carrying values of other
financial assets approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Impairment of loans and receivables
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the loans and receivables are impaired. The Group first assesses individually
whether objective evidence of impairment exists for loans and receivables that are individually significant, or collectively for loans and receivables that are not
individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed loans and receivables, whether significant or
not, it includes the asset in a group of loans and receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Loans and
receivables that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment
of impairment.

(g)                         Financial assets (continued)
Impairment of loans and receivables (continued)
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced
either directly or through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in finance costs for loans and in
other operating expenses for receivables.
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. Any subsequent reversal of an
impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed amortised cost at the reversal
date.
In relation to trade and other receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant
financial difficulties of the debtor and significant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment that have an adverse effect on the debtor) that the
Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of an invoice.
Derecognition of loans and receivables
For financial assets classified as loans and receivables, the financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)
is derecognised where:
i)         the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
ii)        the Group retains the rights to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a
third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; or
iii)       the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
(b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of
the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the
maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.

(h)                       Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities including trade and bills payables, amounts due to related companies, other payables and certain accrued liabilities, interest-bearing loans, mining
rights payable and interest payable are initially stated at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using
the EIR. The related interest expense is recognised within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Fair value
As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the carrying values of these financial liabilities other than long-term interest-bearing loans and mining rights payable,
approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of long-term interest bearing-loans and mining rights payable
approximated their fair values as the interest rates on almost all the balances are reset each year based on prevailing interest rates stipulated by the People’s Bank of
China.
The Group had no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial position, if and only if, there is a currently enforceable
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(i)                           Financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability
at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

(j)                          Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the weighted-average method. Net realisable value is based on estimated
selling prices less any estimated costs to be incurred to completion and disposal. Major types of inventories include:
·             Spare parts and consumables
·             Coal
(k)                       Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and short term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and have a short maturity of generally
within three months when acquired, less bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
For the purpose of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and at banks, including term deposits, and assets similar in
nature to cash, which are not restricted as to use.
(l)                           Employee benefits
Pension obligations
The Group contributes on a monthly basis to various defined contribution retirement benefit plans administered by the PRC government. The relevant government
agencies undertake to assume the retirement benefit obligation payable to all existing and future retired employees under these plans and the Group has no further
obligation for post-retirement benefits beyond the contributions made. Further information is set out in note 9.
Housing funds
All full-time employees of the Group are entitled to participate in various government-sponsored housing funds. The Group contributes on a monthly basis to these funds
based on certain percentages of the salaries of the employees. The Group’s liability in respect of these funds is limited to the contributions payable in each year.

(m)                   Asset retirement obligations
The Group’s legal or constructive obligations associated with the retirement of non-financial assets are recognised at fair value at the time the obligations are incurred
and if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Upon initial recognition of a
liability, a corresponding amount is capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment. Asset retirement obligations are regularly
reviewed by management and are revised for changes in future estimated costs and regulatory requirements. Changes in the estimated timing of retirement or future
estimated costs are dealt prospectively by recording an adjustment against the carrying value of the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property and
equipment. Depreciation of the capitalised asset retirement cost is generally determined on a units-of-production basis. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation is
recognised over time and generally will escalate over the life of the producing asset, typically as production declines. Accretion is included in the finance cost in the
consolidated income statement. Any difference between the recorded obligation and the actual costs of reclamation is recorded in the income statement in the period
the obligation is settled.
(n)                       Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly relating to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the
cost of the respective assets. The capitalisation of such borrowing costs ceases when the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other
borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
(o)                       Revenue recognition
The Group sells its products pursuant to sales contracts entered into with its customers. Revenue for all products is recognised when the significant risks and rewards
of ownership have passed to the customer and when collectability is reasonably assured. The passing of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the customer
is based on the terms of the sales contract, generally upon delivery and acceptance of the product by the customer.
In accordance with the relevant tax laws in the PRC, value-added taxes (“VAT”) is levied on the invoiced value of sales and is payable by the purchaser. The Group is
required to remit the VAT it collects to the tax authority, but may deduct the VAT it has paid on eligible purchases. The difference between the amounts collected and
paid is presented as VAT recoverable or payable in the consolidated statements of financial position. VAT on sales amounted to RMB9.3 million, RMB18.4 million and
RMB29.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The Group recognises revenues net of VAT.
The price adjustment fund (“PAF”) was imposed by the Guizhou Provincial Government of the PRC at predetermined rates and on the quantity of coal sold by entities
operated in Guizhou Province. The PAF paid can be claimed as a deductible expense for corporate income tax purposes and the amount claimed is based on the actual
amount paid. The Group recognised PAF in “cost of sales” in the consolidated income statement.

(p)                       Income taxes
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement or consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
either as an expense as it relates to operating activities or as a component of the applicable categories of other comprehensive income or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax
rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, by the reporting date, in the countries where the Group operates and
generates taxable income.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
·                       where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
·                      in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised,
except:
·                      where the deferred tax assets relating to the deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
·                      in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets
are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred
taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

(q)      Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as
consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service
conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at the end of each reporting period until the vesting date reflects the extent to
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the income
statement for a period represents the movement in the cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest for the Group.
(r)                          Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of substantially all the operations of the Group is the RMB, the national currency of the PRC. Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the RMB recorded by the entities of the Group are initially recorded using their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies have been translated into RMB at the functional currency rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the reporting
period. The resulting exchange gains or losses are credited or charged to the consolidated income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.
The financial statements of certain overseas subsidiary operations with a functional currency other than the RMB have been translated into RMB. The assets and
liabilities of these entities have been translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date and the income statement have been translated using the
weighted average exchange rate for the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income
statement.
(s)                         Provisions
A provision is recognised when a present obligation (legal or constructive) has arisen as a result of a past event and it is probable that a future outflow of resources will
be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the effect of discounting is material, the amount recognised for a provision is the present value at the end of the reporting period of the future expenditures
expected to be required to settle the obligation. The increase in the discounted present value amount arising from the passage of time is included in finance costs in the
income statement.

(t)                          Leases
Leases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets to the Group, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. At the
inception of a finance lease, the cost of the leased asset is capitalised at the lower of its fair value of the present value of the minimum lease payments and recorded
together with the obligation, excluding the interest element, to reflect the purchase and financing. Assets held under capitalised finance leases are included in property,
plant and equipment, and depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the estimated useful lives of the assets. The finance costs of such leases are charged to
the income statement so as to provide a constant periodic rate of charge over the lease terms.
Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Rentals payable under
operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on the straight-line basis over the lease terms.
Prepaid land lease payments under operating leases are initially stated at cost and subsequently recognised on the straight-line basis over the lease terms.

2.5                     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities at the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. However, uncertainty about
these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
(i)                 Commercial production start date
The Group assesses the stage of each coal mine under construction to determine when a coal mine moves into the production stage. The criteria used to assess the
start date are determined based on the unique nature of each coal mine construction project. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the coal mine
is substantially complete, ready for its intended use and is reclassified from “Construction in progress” to “Mining structures”. The criteria will include, but are not limited,
to the following:
·                      The level of capital expenditure compared to the construction cost estimates
·                      Completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine and equipment
·                      Ability to produce coals in saleable form (within specifications)
·                      Ability to sustain ongoing production of coal
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain coal mine construction costs ceases, and further extraction costs
incurred are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for costs that qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, underground
mine development or mineable reserve development. The commercial production start date is also the date when depreciation and/or amortisation of the mining structure
assets commences.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. The Company has based its assumptions and
estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments,
however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they
occur.
(i)                 Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In estimating the recoverable amounts of assets, various assumptions,
including future cash flows to be associated with the non-current assets and discount rates, are made. If future events do not correspond to such assumptions, the
recoverable amounts will need to be revised, and this may have an impact on the Group’s results of operations or financial position.
There were no impairments recognised for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

2.5                     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)
(ii)              Units-of-production depreciation for mining related assets
The Group determines the depreciation and/or amortisation of mining related assets by the actual units of production over the estimated reserves of the mines. Further
details about the reserve estimates are included in note 2.5 (iv).
(iii)           Useful lives of non-mining related property, plant and equipment
The Group’s management determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for its non-mining related property, plant and equipment. This estimate
is based on the historical experience of the actual useful lives of non-mining related property, plant and equipment of similar nature and functions. It could change
significantly as a result of technical innovation and competitor action in response to severe industry cycles. Management will increase the depreciation charges where
useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or it will write-off or write-down technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold.
(iv)          Reserve estimates
Proven and probable coal reserve estimates are estimates of the amount of coal that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties. In
determining the estimates, recent production and technical information of each mine will be considered.
Fluctuations in factors including the price of coal, production costs and transportation costs of coal, a variation on recovery rates or unforeseen geological or
geotechnical perils may render it necessary to revise the estimates of coal reserves.
Because the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves changes from period to period, and because additional geological data is generated during the course of
operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a
number of ways, including the following:
·                        Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows.
·                         Depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged to the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the units of production
basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change.
·                         Asset retirement obligations may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities.
·                         The carrying value of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax benefits.
(v)             Trade and other receivables
The Group’s management determines the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables. This estimate is based on the credit history of its customers and
current market conditions. Management reassesses the provision at the end of each reporting period.
(vi)          Income taxes
There are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises
liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially
recorded, the differences will be reflected in the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made. In addition, the realisation of
future income tax assets is dependent on the Group’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilise income tax benefits and income tax loss
carryforwards. Deviations of future profitability from estimates or in the income tax rate would result in adjustments to the value of future income tax assets and
liabilities that could have a significant effect on earnings.

2.5                     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONTINUED)
(vii)       Provision for asset retirement obligations
The provision for asset retirement obligations is determined by management based on the past experience and best estimation of future expenditures, taking into
account existing relevant PRC regulations. However, insofar as the effect on the land and the environment from current mining activities becomes apparent in future
years, the estimate of the associated costs may be subject to revision from time to time.

The Company is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) and conducts its primary business through its subsidiaries in the PRC. It also has an intermediate
holding company in Hong Kong. Under the current laws of the BVI, the Company incorporated in the BVI is not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Hong Kong
Profits Tax rate is 16.5% during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Company’s Hong Kong subsidiary has both Hong Kong-sourced and non-
Hong Kong-sourced incomes. The latter is not subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax and the related expenses are non-tax-deductible. For the Hong Kong-sourced income,
no provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax was made as such operation sustained tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Furthermore,
there are no withholding taxes in Hong Kong on the remittance of dividends.
Effective from January 1, 2008, the PRC’s statutory corporate income tax (“CIT”) rate is 25%. The Company’s PRC subsidiaries are subject to income tax at 25% on
their respective taxable incomes as calculated in accordance with the CIT Law and its relevant regulations (“the actual method”) except for Dayuan Coal, Gouchang
Coal, Baiping Mining, Xinsong Coal, Linjiaao Coal and Guizhou Yongfu. Prior to 2012, based on the local practices, the aforementioned subsidiaries were taxed on a
deemed profit method based on their actual revenue minus deemed expenses with the 25% statutory rate. Practically, the CIT were collected approximately at a range
of RMB9.5 to RMB32.0 per tonne of sales, or 7.50% to 10.64% of sales. No deferred tax assets were then provided for these subsidiaries in view of the deemed profit
method imposed.
During 2012, the Group received written confirmations from the respective local tax bureaus that the aforementioned subsidiaries excluding Guizhou Yongfu are subject
to income tax on the actual method effective retroactively from 2011. And Guizhou Yongfu is subject to income tax on the actual method effective retroactively from the
date of its establishment. The effect of change in the taxing method is the recognition of deferred tax assets for prior year tax losses amounting to RMB15.3 million
during 2012.
Under the prevailing CIT Law and its relevant regulations, any dividends paid by the Company’s PRC subsidiaries from their earnings derived after January 1, 2008 to
the Company’s Hong Kong subsidiary are subject to a 5% or 10%, depending on the applicability of the Sino-Hong Kong tax treaty, PRC dividend withholding tax.

In assessing the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets, the management has performed a detailed assessment on the coal mining subsidiaries’ profitability
based on their production plans, forecasted selling prices, and the related production and operational costs, of which strong profits are expected. Accordingly, the
management considered it is probable that the Group, in future, will earn sufficient taxable profits to utilise the coal mining subsidiaries’ deductible temporary differences
and unused tax losses before they expire and as such, the related deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group did not recognise any deferred tax liabilities in respect of the 5% or 10%, depending on the applicability of the tax treaty preferential, PRC dividend
withholding tax on the undistributed earnings of its PRC subsidiaries as there were no undistributed earnings available due to aggregate loss of the subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
The total amounts of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to RMB18.6 million, RMB55.1 million and RMB97.8 million as of
December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, unused tax losses of RMB18.6 million, RMB36.5 million and RMB42.7 million, if unused,
will expire by end of 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

under the PRC’s Foreign Exchange Control Regulations and Administration of Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange Regulations, the Group is permitted
to exchange RMB into other currencies through banks authorised to conduct foreign exchange business.
Cash at banks earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short term time deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three
months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at respective short term deposit rates. The bank balances and pledged deposits
are deposited with creditworthy banks with no recent history of default.

and 2012 are 2.53%, 9.91% and 6.09%, respectively. There were no material changes to those rates used in subsequent periods.
27.                   ISSUED CAPITAL
The Company was incorporated on January 6, 2010 with authorised capital of a maximum of 50,000 shares of a single class each with a par value of US$1.00. On
January 15, 2010, 1 share was issued to Feishang which was subsequently transferred to CHNR on April 30, 2010.
28.                   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
In January 2008, 1,000,000 stock options of CHNR were granted to Mr. Li Feilie, at an exercise price of US$22.64 per share (the fair market value of CHNR’s common
stock as of the grant date). Vesting is conditional upon Mr. Li Feilie’s working for CHNR for the next three years commencing from the grant date. As of December 31,
2010, the compensation expense related to the options has been fully recognised. In January 2011, the outstanding 1,000,000 shares of stock options were expired and
not exercised.
The estimated fair value of these options at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model was RMB78.0 million, which is being amortised over the
requisite service period of three years with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 3.00%; no dividend yield; volatility of 124.50%; and the expected term of
the options of one year.
Since the share options were granted by CHNR to Mr. Li Feilie for his services to CHNR, including the coal business of the Group, the compensation expense relating to
his service to the coal business of the Group of RMB17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, determined using a proportional allocation method based on the
headcount of the coal business and non-coal business of CHNR, is recognised in the Group’s financial statements with a corresponding credit to deemed contribution
from the owner of the Company.

30.                   BUSINESS COMBINATION
As further explained below, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the Group completed the Acquisition. Guizhou Puxin and its subsidiaries principally engage in
coal mine development and operation in Guizhou Province, the PRC.
On March 18, 2010, Guizhou Fuyuantong, an indirect wholly-owned PRC subsidiary of Feishang, acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Guizhou Puxin
and its five subsidiaries, including Baiping Mining, Dayuan Coal, Gouchang Coal, Linjiaao Coal and Xinsong Coal, from unrelated third parties. The total purchase
consideration was in the form of cash, totalling RMB150.0 million.
In April 2010, the Company acquired all the issued outstanding capital stock of Guizhou Fuyuantong through its direct subsidiary, Hong Kong Smartact Limited, from
Feishang for RMB10.0 million. Guizhou Puxin and its five subsidiaries engage in coal mine development and operation in Guizhou Province, the PRC.
The following table summarises the fair values of assets and liabilities of Guizhou Puxin and its five subsidiaries, including Baiping Mining, Dayuan Coal, Gouchang
Coal, Linjiaao Coal and Xinsong Coal when they were acquired from the unrelated third parties on March 18, 2010:

(150,000)

The bargain purchase gain arise from the distressed sale by the unrelated third parties as a result of the consolidation of smaller coal mines by the PRC government.
The valuation is based on an independent valuation report, which uses an income-based approach estimating the future economic benefits and discounting these
benefits into present value using a discount rate appropriate for the risks associated with realising those benefits. The fair value of the non-controlling interest is
measured at the non-controlling interest proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Since the Acquisition date, Guizhou Puxin and its five subsidiaries contributed RMB38.7 million to the Group’s revenue and a loss of RMB68.6 million to the
consolidated profit for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Had the Acquisition taken place at the beginning of the year, the revenue and profit of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been RMB48.0
million and RMB548.6 million, respectively.

34.      TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
At December 31, 2012, the Group endorsed certain bills receivable accepted by banks in the PRC (the “Derecognised Bills”), to certain of its suppliers in order to settle
the trade payables due to these suppliers with a carrying amount in aggregate of RMB22.5 million . The Derecognised Bills have a maturity from one to six months at
the end of the reporting period. In accordance with the Law of Negotiable Instruments in the PRC, the holders of the Derecognised Bills have a right of recourse against
the Group if the PRC banks default (the “Continuing Involvement”). In the opinion of the directors, the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards relating to
the Derecognised Bills. Accordingly, it has derecognised the full carrying amounts of the Derecognised Bills and the associated trade payables. The maximum exposure
to loss from the Group’s Continuing Involvement in the Derecognised Bills and the undiscounted cash flows to repurchase the Derecognised Bills equals to their carrying
amounts. In the opinion of the directors, the fair values of the Group’s Continuing Involvement in the Derecognised Bills are not significant.
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Group has not recognised any gain or loss on the date of transfer of the Derecognised Bills. No gains or
losses were recognised from the continuing involvement, both during the year or cumulatively. The Endorsement has been made evenly throughout the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
35.      FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Financial instruments of the Group primarily include cash, trade and bills receivables, certain other current assets, trade and bills payables, certain other liabilities,
amounts due to related companies, interest-bearing loans and mining rights payables.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group has not used any derivatives and other instruments for hedging
purposes. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these
risks and they are summarised below.
(a)        Credit risk
The carrying amounts of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, restricted bank deposits, trade and bills receivables, and certain other current assets,
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to its financial assets.
Cash and cash deposits
The Group maintains its cash and cash deposits primarily with various PRC state-owned banks and Hong Kong-based financial institutions, which management believes
are of high credit quality. The Group performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions.

35.       FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a)        Credit risk (continued)
Trade receivables
The Group sells anthracitic coal to companies in the PRC. Trade receivables are typically unsecured and are mainly derived from revenue earned from customers in the
PRC. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations that the Group performs on its customers and its ongoing monitoring of outstanding
balances. The Group provides impairment for trade receivables primarily based on the age of the balances and factors surrounding the customer’s creditworthiness. No
provision for impairment of trade receivables was provided during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the
largest five customers accounted for 59.4%, 84.2% and 87.2% of the trade receivables, respectively.
Sales to the largest five customers accounted for 66.6%, 73.5% and 56.7% of the consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The
largest five customers are all recognised and creditworthy third parties and trading terms are mainly on payment in advance or with a credit period of one month. The
Group expects the concentration of coal customers to subside once the production volume increases in the future.
Bills receivable
Bills receivable represent letters of credit obtained by customers of the Group to finance purchases which have been presented to banks for payment after delivery of
goods to customers. As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, the bills receivable balance was guaranteed by financial institutions. The bills receivable have normal terms of
maturity of six months.
(b)        Foreign currency risk
These financial statements are presented in RMB, which is the Company’s presentation currency. The currency is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. The
State Administration for Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the People’s Bank of China, controls the conversion of the currency into foreign currencies. The value
of the currency is subject to changes in PRC government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System market. All foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the People’s Bank of China or other banks authorised
to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the People’s Bank of China.

(c)        Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s
exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The interest rate risk is
closely monitored by the Group’s senior management. As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the interest rates for only 5.30%, 8.10%, and 12.50% of the Group’s
interest-bearing debts were fixed, respectively. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the portion of
interest-bearing loans and mining rights payables with floating interest rates except for interest which is capitalised. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s
profit / (loss) before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows:

The Group manages its liquidity risk by regularly monitoring its liquidity requirements and its compliance with debt covenants to ensure that it maintains sufficient cash
and cash equivalents, and adequate time deposits to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and long term. The Group also relies on financial support from its
controlling shareholder. In addition, bank facilities have been put in place for contingency purposes.

This summary is intended to give you an overview of the information contained in this listing document. Since it is a summary, it does not contain all the
information that may be important to you. You should read the listing document in its entirety. The resource and reserve data of the Company included in
this listing document are determined by measuring the raw coal extracted from our coal mines. The characteristics of our coal products are assessed by
measuring our raw coal after beneficiation (or coal washing) as may be required under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard. See “Business — Our Coal
Characteristics and Coal Products — Coal Classification.”
OVERVIEW
We are a producer of anthracite coal based in Guizhou province of the PRC. We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, construction and development of anthracite
coal mines and the extraction and sale of anthracite coal. Our mining assets consist of seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four
have commenced commercial production, two are under construction and one is undergoing its pilot run phase. All of our anthracite coal mines are accessible by road
and located in Guizhou province, which, according to the latest report released by the SAWS, had the largest anthracite coal resources among the provinces in
Southwest China in 2008. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our seven anthracite coal mines as of the date of this listing document other than
information regarding the total proved and probable reserves of our anthracite coal mines, which was as of April 30, 2013.

As of April 30, 2013, we had total proved and probable coal reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes and total permitted annual production capacity of 2.34
million tonnes. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we sold 166,362 tonnes, 314,058 tonnes and 437,010 tonnes of anthracite coal, respectively, and had revenues of RMB38.7
million, RMB105.2 million and RMB141.9 million, respectively. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the average selling price of the anthracite coal we produced was RMB232.4,
RMB296.4 and RMB323.6 per tonne, respectively.
During the Track Record Period, we derived our revenue primarily from the sale of coal we produced. From time to time, we also engaged in coal trading activities by
selling coal that we purchased from third party suppliers. In 2011 and 2012, revenue from sales of third party coal was RMB33.1 million and RMB1.1 million,
respectively, representing 31.5% and 0.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. We did not engage in any coal trading activities in 2010, and we do not intend to engage
in any significant coal trading activities in the future.
In the PRC, end users generally characterize anthracite coal as thermal coal, chemical coal or PCI coal. Prior to 2011, we sold substantially all of the coal produced
from our mines as thermal coal. In each of 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 5% of our revenue from the sale of chemical coal we produced, while our remaining
revenue in each of these years was derived from the sale of thermal coal we produced and coal sourced from third parties. Subject to market conditions, we intend to
significantly increase our sales of chemical coal in the future and begin selling PCI coal in 2014.
In order to increase our production capacity, we plan to optimize all of our currently operating anthracite coal mines by improving mine layout and upgrading mine
infrastructure and equipment. We expect that our optimization plans will begin in 2015 and, after their expected completion in December 2018, we expect to be able to
achieve an aggregate annual production capacity of 5.81 million tonnes. The estimated costs of our optimization plans are RMB807.5 million.

(1)                                     In 2011 and 2012, the actual production output of Baiping Coal Mine exceeded its permitted annual production capacity under its mining right permit and coal production permit. See
“Business — Our Anthracite Coal Mines — Mines in Commercial Production — Baiping Coal Mine” on page 97. We have applied for a mining right permit with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes for
Baiping Coal Mine and we expect to obtain such permit in 2014.
(2)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank.
(3)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank and Bank of China.
(4)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Merchants Bank.
(5)                                     The National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed certain amendments to the Coal Law, which became effective on June 29, 2013, including removing the requirement of
obtaining coal production permits.
Each of our anthracite coal mines currently utilizes manual longwall mining, semi-mechanical longwall mining or mechanical longwall mining methods to extract coal.
Longwall mining refers to extracting coal from long rectangular blocks of coal seams. Manual longwall mining refers to drilling holes in the mining face, placing
explosives and detonating the explosives to extract the coal. Mechanical and semi-mechanical longwall mining involve using a mechanical shearer in coal
3
extraction. In mechanical longwall mining, the mine roof is held up during the extraction process by automatic hydraulic roof supports, while in semi-mechanical longwall
mining, the mine roof is held up hydraulic roof supports that are operated manually. The following table sets forth the current extraction method of each of our anthracite
coal mines:

Our capital expenditures were RMB219.7 million, RMB341.5 million and RMB360.2 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our capital expenditures primarily
related to the construction of our coal mines, purchase of mining-related equipment and machinery and pre-payments for land use rights for our coal mines. We expect
to pay approximately an aggregate of RMB545.0 million in 2013 and 2014 for capital expenditures. See Appendix III — “Competent Person’s Report.” We expect to fund
these capital expenditures through interest-bearing bank loans and other borrowings. See “Financial Information — Indebtedness.”
OUR STRENGTHS
We believe our principal strengths include the following:
·                  anthracite is a relatively scarce and valuable resource;
·                  our high quality coal reserve;
·                  we are located in Guizhou province, which has one of the largest anthracite coal resources in the PRC;
4
·                  we are well-positioned to capitalize on industry consolidation opportunities in Guizhou; and
·                  our experienced management team.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
We aim to grow our business by focusing on the following strategies:
·                  achieve profitability through sales of higher margin chemical and PCI coal and increasing our production output;
·                  strengthen our sales and marketing networks;
·                  create a more vertically integrated business;
·                  enhance our operational efficiency and cost control;
·                  enhance the environmental and occupational health and safety standards of our operations; and
·                  increase our anthracite coal production capacity in the long-term through mine optimization plans and acquisitions of high quality anthracite coal mines.

Committee granting listing of, and permission to deal in, our Shares in issue on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange. The reasons for the Spin-off include the
following:
·                  as CHNR’s base metals exploration and mining business is fundamentally different from our Company’s business, we believe the Spin-off could result in more
efficient and focused management for our Company and CHNR;
5
·                  following the Spin-off, each of our Company and CHNR may adopt more effective incentive compensation arrangements, including share-based compensation,
that are more directly tied to performance;
·                  after the Spin-off, each of our Company and CHNR may adopt more individually tailored capital structures; and
·                  we believe that after the Spin-off, the trading price of the shares of each of our Company and CHNR may more accurately reflect their respective values, and
any future capital raised by our Company or CHNR may more accurately reflect such company’s respective cost of capital.
Immediately following the Spin-off, Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief executive officer, will, through his shareholdings in Laitan Investments and Feishang, continue
to be a Controlling Shareholder of the Company. See “Relationship with Our Controlling Shareholders” for further details.

(1)                                 Inventory turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the opening and closing balances of inventories for the year by cost of
sales in that year and multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, inventory turnover days in 2010 is calculated by
dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of inventories as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by cost of sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and
ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(2)                                 The average trade and bill payable turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of opening and ending balance of trade and bill
payables for the year by cost of sales in the year and then multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average
trade and bill payables turnover days in 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill payables as of March 18 and December 31,
2010 by cost of sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.

(3)                                 The average trade and bill receivable turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of opening and ending balance of trade and bill
receivables for the year by revenue in that year and then multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average
trade and bill receivables turnover days in 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill receivables as of March 18 and
December 31, 2010 by revenue for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(4)                                 Gearing ratio is calculated by dividing total interest-bearing debt by total capital at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%. Interest-bearing debt
includes interest-bearing loans and mining rights payables. Capital includes total equity and interest-bearing debt.
(5)                                 Gross margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%.
RISK FACTORS
There are certain risks relating to an investment in our Shares. These risks can be categorized into: (i) risks relating to our business; (ii) risks relating to PRC’s coal
industry; (iii) risks relating to conducting business in the PRC; and (iv) risks relating to the Spin-off, and include the following significant risks:
·                  As we are a development stage coal mining company with a limited operating and production history, it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;
·                  We have a history of losses and we anticipate that losses will continue;
·                  We require a significant amount of cash to fund the growth of our business as well as to meet our working capital requirements, and we may be unable to
obtain sufficient capital in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all;
·                  We are highly leveraged, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to expand our
business;
·                  If we are unable to successfully expand our coal production capacity, our business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected;
·                  Our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to the cyclical nature of the PRC anthracite coal market and vulnerable to
fluctuations in anthracite coal prices; and
·                  We are subject to extensive regulation, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected if
we fail to comply with applicable regulations or if existing regulations or other government policies change.
The risks listed above are not the only risks that may affect us, and we urge you to read the entire section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 31.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Set forth below is a summary of our material non-compliance incidents during the Track Record Period, as well as the rectification actions and preventative measures
that we have taken in respect of such incidents, including obtaining confirmations from the relevant regulatory authorities that they would not impose penalties or other
measures on us. For further information on each of these incidents, see “Business — Regulatory Compliance”:
Non-Compliance
In 2012, Baiping Coal Mine produced 292,000 tonnes of
anthracite coal which significantly exceeded its annual
production capacity of 150,000 tonnes as permitted under its
mining right permit and coal production permit.
None of our four anthracite coal mines in commercial
production have completed its environmental trial run or the
environmental acceptance inspection by the relevant
government authorities prior to commencing commercial
production.
Rectification Actions / Preventive Measures
·      In January and July 2013, the relevant Guizhou government authority issued confirmation letters
stating that it would not impose any penalties or other measures (including but not limited to
revocation of the coal production permit or suspension of coal mining operations) against Baiping
Mining or its employees in respect of any over-production in 2012 or thereafter, and that it would
support our application for the relevant permits with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes
or more. We plan to continue producing anthracite coal at Baiping Coal Mine, and may produce
anthracite coal in excess of its permitted production capacity as our annual production levels were
determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s annual guidance relating to the provision
of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants operating in Guizhou. See “Regulation —
PRC Laws relating to the Coal Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power plants.” Our PRC legal
advisors, Commerce & Finance Law Offices, have advised us that such confirmation letters were
issued by the competent government authority and are legally valid. We have applied for a 300,000
tonnes mining right permit for Baiping Coal Mine and we expect to obtain such permit in 2014. After
receiving such permit, we do not expect Baiping Coal Mine will continue to produce anthracite coal in
excess of its permitted production capacity.
 

During the Track Record Period, certain of our subsidiaries
made non-interest bearing intercompany loans to our other
subsidiaries in the PRC in contravention of applicable PRC
regulations on intercompany lending.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS
As we are a development stage coal mining company with a limited operating and production history, it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
We are a development stage coal mining company. We have seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four have commenced commercial
production, two are under construction and one is undergoing its pilot run phase. Baiping Coal Mine, Gouchang Coal Mine (currently suspended), Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
and Liujiaba Coal Mine commenced commercial production in June 2009, April 2011, April 2012 and December 2012, respectively. We did not generate any revenue or
begin commercial production of anthracite coal until the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin in March 2010. Accordingly, we have a limited operating and production history
upon which you could evaluate our business and prospects. We are subject to risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by coal mining companies at an early
stage of development in the PRC, and our ability to manage and respond to these risks is unproven. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to:
·                  expand production capacity in a cost-effective manner;
·                  respond to fluctuating demand for, and variations in price of, coal in a highly cyclical market;
·                  respond to competition in a highly fragmented market;
·                  effectively market and sell the anthracite coal we produce;
·                  respond to changing, unpredictable and increasingly onerous regulatory requirements; and
·                  raise sufficient capital to sustain and grow our business.
If we are not successful in addressing these risks, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely affected.
31
We have a history of losses and we anticipate that losses will continue.
Our business has not yet achieved any operating profits. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we incurred operating losses of RMB54.5 million, RMB23.0 million and RMB36.6
million, respectively, and, disregarding the effects of a RMB624.1 million non-recurring gain relating to the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin in 2010, we would have incurred
net losses in each of those periods. We cannot assure you when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability.
We require a significant amount of cash to fund the growth of our business as well as to meet our working capital requirements, and we may be unable to
obtain sufficient capital in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all.
Our business is capital intensive. In particular, we will need a substantial amount of cash for the construction and development of our coal mines, our coal beneficiation
plant and our shipping port. As of the date of this listing document, we expect to pay approximately an aggregate of RMB545.0 million in 2013 and 2014 for capital
expenditures. These estimated capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for the construction of Dayuan Coal Mine, Dayun Coal Mine, Yongsheng Coal
Mine, a coal beneficiation plant in Jinsha county and a port along the Wujiang River near Yongsheng coal Mine. We have not generated any net cash flows from our
operating activities, and as of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had net current liabilities of RMB437.1 million, RMB632.1 million and RMB1,030.1 million,
respectively. As a result, we may need to obtain additional funding to finance our growth and meet our working capital requirements. Our ability to obtain additional
funding is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:
·                  our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;
·                  the conditions in the PRC, Hong Kong and other markets where we may seek to raise funds;
·                  investors’ perception of, and demand for, securities of coal mining companies; and
·                  economic, political and other conditions in the PRC and elsewhere.
Among our seven coal mines, four have commenced commercial production, two are under construction and one is undergoing its pilot run phase. In the past, we have
financed a significant portion of our funding needs with non-interest bearing loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief executive officer. In
2013, we refinanced a significant portion of our non-interest bearing loans with interest-bearing bank and other borrowings, which significantly increased our finance
costs and reduced our ability to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, or at all, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.
32
We are highly leveraged, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to expand our
business.
We have a high degree of financial leverage. As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our gearing ratio was 47.5%, 60.4% and 68.8%, respectively. We rely heavily on
borrowings to fund our capital requirements and expect to continue to do so in the future. As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had total outstanding interest-
bearing loans of RMB418.7 million, RMB735.9 million and RMB1,013.5 million, respectively, and as of the Latest Practicable Date, the total outstanding amount of our
interest-bearing loans was RMB     . In addition, in July 2013, we obtained from China Minsheng Bank a commitment to provide a term loan of up to RMB1.6 billion
aggregate principal amount before July 18, 2014, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in such commitment. The degree to which we are leveraged may
impair our ability to make necessary capital expenditure, increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and limit our ability to develop business opportunities or
make strategic acquisitions, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to expand our business.
If we are unable to successfully expand our coal production capacity, our business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.
Our future success is dependent on our ability to expand our coal production capacity. We need to increase our coal production capacity and meet the demands of our
customers as well as benefit from economies of scale and reduce our average costs. In particular, Dayun Coal Mine, Dayuan Coal Mine and Yongsheng Coal Mine have
not commenced commercial production, and our ability to achieve commercial production at these coal mines in a timely and cost effective manner is subject to a
number of risks and factors beyond our control, including:
·                  construction delays and cost overruns due to weather, mechanical failures, mine accidents, unforeseen geological anomalies, changes in government
regulations or policies and other reasons;
·                  inability to obtain or delays in obtaining the requisite government approvals; and
·                  our ability to fund the capital expenditure requirements.
The construction of our anthracite coal mines has been subject to multiple delays and cost overruns, and we cannot assure you that delays and cost overruns will not
occur in the future. In the past, our delays and cost overruns were caused by various factors beyond our control, including:
·                  suspensions of mining activities in Guizhou by the Guizhou government in response to the occurrence of severe mining accidents and certain government
meetings and other events in Guizhou;
·                  unanticipated difficulties in relocating local residents affected by certain of our coal mines, including Dayun Coal Mine and Zhulinzhai Coal Mine; and
33
·                  Guizhou’s requirement for certain coal mines using drilling and blasting mining methods to upgrade to semi-mechanical longwall mining methods in 2012,
which required us to incur significant time and expense to redesign and upgrade Liujiaba Coal Mine.
In addition, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to continue operations at our coal
mines. For example, the operations at Gouchang Coal Mine were suspended from March to August 2012 under certain newly implemented mine gas control
requirements in Guizhou, and have been suspended by the Guizhou government since March 2013 pending the acquisition by us of a nearby coal mine and Gouchang
Coal Mine achieving certain production capacity targets in accordance with Guizhou province’s coal mine consolidation policy. We cannot assure you that our
acquisition of the coal mine near Gouchang Coal Mine would be successful or that Gouchang Coal Mine would be able to achieve the required production capacity
targets. If we cannot acquire such coal mine or Gouchang Coal Mine cannot achieve the required production capacity targets, we may be required to divest or shut down
Gouchang Coal Mine. As of April 30, 2013, Gonchang Coal Mine had proved and probable reserve of 5.72 million tonnes, representing approximately 2.7% of our total
proved and probable reserve.
To manage the growth of our business, we would also need to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, integrate the transportation
logistics at these coal mines with our existing operating coal mines, as well as expand, train and manage our employee base. We cannot assure you that our current
and planned operations, personnel, systems and internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth. If we are unable to increase our coal
production capacity in a timely and cost effective manner, or if we are unable to successfully manage and integrate our increased coal production capacity, we may not
be able to effectively grow our business, benefit from the intended economies of scale or achieve profitability.
Our reliance on sales of thermal coal makes our financial results vulnerable to downturns in the demand for, and government price controls imposed on,
thermal coal in the PRC.
Although we intend to increase our sales of chemical coal in the future, we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of thermal coal to local
power plants in Guizhou province. The demand for thermal coal from power producers in the PRC is dependent on a number of factors, including the rate of economic
growth and general economic conditions in the PRC, the PRC Government’s economic, energy, environmental and other policies, and the availability and cost of
alternative energy sources. Although thermal coal is expected to remain a significant energy source in the PRC, the PRC Government is investing heavily in exploring
alternative energy sources, including nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar power. Moreover, the PRC Government agreed during the United Nations Climate Change
Conference in December 2009 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40% to 45% by 2020 from 2005 levels. Any government initiative to reduce energy consumption or
control greenhouse gas emission could reduce the demand for, and prices of, thermal coal in the PRC.
34
Moreover, the price of thermal coal in the PRC has from time to time been subject to government price controls. For example, in November 2011, the NDRC limited
increases in the contract price of thermal coal sold to certain power producers in the PRC to 5% in 2012, as well as imposed certain price limits on the spot prices of
thermal coal. Although these measures were terminated in January 2013, we cannot assure you that the price of thermal coal would not be subject to further price
controls in the future. Any significant decline in the demand for, or prices of, thermal coal could materially decrease our revenue and cash flows, and may further
increase our net losses.
We may not be able to successfully produce, market and sell chemical and PCI coal, which could materially and adversely affect our business and
prospects.
Our future profitability will significantly depend on our ability to produce, market and sell chemical coal and PCI coal, which generally command higher average selling
prices and have higher margins than thermal coal. In each of 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 5% of our revenue from the sale of self-produced chemical coal,
and we have not yet commenced selling any PCI coal. As part of our strategy, however, we intend to significantly increase our sales of chemical coal, and we intend to
begin selling PCI coal in 2014.
Our ability to produce, market and sell chemical and PCI coal is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, our annual coal production levels were
determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s annual guidance relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants
operating in Guizhou, which has significantly limited our capacity to produce and sell chemical coal. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to the Coal Industry —
Supply of thermal coal to power plants.” We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to other regulatory requirements or government actions that will constrain our
ability to produce, market or sell chemical or PCI coal in the future. Moreover, although we have entered into certain non-binding cooperation arrangements relating to
the sale of chemical coal, we have not yet entered into any binding agreements for the sale of chemical or PCI coal, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
effectively market and sell chemical or PCI coal. The target customers for chemical and PCI coal, which primarily include chemical, steel and iron companies, are
different from our existing customers for thermal coal, which mainly consist of power producers, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary
customer relationships. Furthermore, the underdeveloped road, water and railway transportation infrastructure in the regions where our coal mines are located may limit
our ability to efficiently transport chemical and PCI coal to our target customers. If we cannot successfully produce, market and sell chemical and PCI coal in sufficient
quantities, our revenue and cash flows as well as our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We are planning to construct a coal beneficiation plant in Jinsha county to process anthracite coal into chemical coal and PCI coal. However, we have no experience
with constructing or operating coal beneficiation plants, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the construction process without significant delays or
cost overruns, or that we will be able to operate the coal beneficiation plant efficiently and profitably once it has been constructed.

The coal reserve data in this listing document are estimates and may be inaccurate, and our actual reserves and production may differ materially from these
estimates.
The coal reserve data on which our production and capital expenditure plans are based are estimates that have made based on the results of geological exploration and
were reviewed by Behre Dolbear, an independent mining consultant. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating coal reserves, and these reserve estimates may be
inaccurate and may differ materially from our actual volume of reserves, rates of production and coal characteristics. As these coal reserve estimates are based on a
number of assumptions regarding expected market coal prices, production and transportation costs and recovery rates, these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect
or need to be revised in light of actual results. In particular, most of our coal mines have multiple mining stacked seams, and we may not be able to achieve the
assumed recovery rates due to our inexperience with multiple mining stacked seams, particularly the lower stacked seams. Moreover, the current engineering and
technical design of our coal mines may not support the assumed recovery rates, particularly in the later years of production when deeper extraction from our coal mines
is needed to recover the coal. If any revision results in these estimates in a substantial reduction in proven or probable reserves at one or more of our coal mines, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain or renew the
necessary government permits and licenses or complete the required environmental trial runs and inspections relating to our operations.
Prior to the commencement of commercial production, each coal mine in the PRC is required to obtain a number of permits and licenses, including:
·                  a mining right permit;
·                  a safe production permit; and
·                  a coal production permit.
In addition to these permits, prior to commencing commercial production, coal mines in the PRC are required to complete an environmental trial run and an
environmental acceptance inspection.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or renew the permits, licenses and approvals necessary for our business operations or complete the required
environmental trial runs and inspections in a timely manner or at all, or that onerous conditions will not be imposed in connection with the granting or renewal of such
permits and licenses. The granting of permits and licenses in the PRC is discretionary and is subject to the PRC Government’s prevailing economic, energy,
environmental, health and safety and other policies. If we are unable to obtain or renew the required permits and licenses at any of our coal mines, we may need to
suspend, terminate or downsize our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
36
In 2012, the production output of Baiping Coal Mine significantly exceeded its assessed annual production capacity as set forth in its mining right permit and coal
production permit. Moreover, none of our anthracite coal mines have completed the requisite environmental trial run or the environmental acceptance inspection prior to
commencing commercial production. Although the relevant PRC Governmental authorities have issued letters to confirm that no penalties would be imposed in respect
of these violations, we cannot assure that similar violations will not occur in the future, which could subject us to significant fines, production suspensions and, for
certain serious violations, criminal liability and mine closure. See “Business — Regulatory Compliance.”
Our long-term business and prospects depend upon our ability to successfully increase our production based on existing coal reserves, and acquire and
develop additional coal reserves.
As of April 30, 2013, we had approximately 210.28 million tonnes of proved and probable coal reserves, respectively. Our existing coal reserves will decline as we
produce coal. As a result, our ability to sustain or increase our production in the long-term will depend on our ability to increase our production based on existing coal
reserves, and acquire additional coal reserves and develop these reserves into coal mines. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable
coal reserves for acquisition, or that we will be able to acquire such reserves on acceptable terms, or at all. There is a limited supply of desirable coal reserves in the
PRC, and there is intense competition for mining rights from other coal producers, some of which may have significantly greater financial and other resources than we
do.
Moreover, assuming we are able to acquire additional coal reserves, our ability to develop these reserves into commercially viable coal mines is subject to a number of
risks. For example, the geological and extraction conditions of these reserves may turn out to be different from what we anticipated, the characteristics of the coal
produced from these reserves may be less desirable than we expected, the construction and production costs may be higher than our estimates, and the relevant
governmental approvals, permits and licenses may be delayed or withheld. If we cannot successfully expand our coal resources, our business and prospects could be
materially and adversely affected.
We are dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and a significant reduction in purchases or delayed payments
by our largest customers would materially decrease our revenue and cash flows, as well as materially and adversely affect our liquidity.
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we derived 66.6%, 73.5% and 56.7%, respectively, of our total revenue from our five largest customers. The average term of our contracts with
these customers is less than one year. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renew existing coal supply contracts or enter into new contracts with major
customers on acceptable terms, or at all, or that payments by major customers would not be materially delayed. If one or more of our largest customers were to
significantly reduce coal purchases from us, or if we are unable to continue to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current contracts, or
if our largest customers delay payments to us, our revenue and cash flows, as well as our liquidity, would materially decrease.
37
Accidents at our coal mines or neighboring coal mines could materially disrupt our business and operations and damage our reputation.
Our coal mining operations are subject to certain inherent safety risks that could lead to death or serious injuries, including methane gas explosions, roof collapses, coal
mine water discharge and ground falls. Accidents at coal mines may also result from insufficient attention to safety, maintenance and working conditions. During the
Track Record Period, we had separate accidents involving three employee fatalities, all of which occurred in 2010. Although we are endeavoring to minimize the number
of accidents at our coal mines, accidents involving death or serious injuries are unavoidable. The occurrence of accidents at our coal mines may result in substantial
disruptions to our business and operations, reputational harm, litigation, and investigations and sanctions by regulatory authorities, which could lead to substantial
monetary penalties, onerous remediation orders and production suspensions.
Accidents that occur at our neighboring coal mines could also materially and adversely affect our coal mining operations. In response to a mining accident, the
regulatory authorities may suspend the production of all coal mines in the region where the mining accident occurred, regardless of whether those coal mines are owned
by the mining company involved in the accident. For example, certain coal mining activities were suspended in Guizhou on multiple occasions in 2012 and in 2013 in
response to certain mining accidents in Guizhou, which caused us to suffer significant losses and production delays. Moreover, in response to an accident, the
regulatory authorities may enact new safety regulations applicable to all coal mines in the region, leading to substantially greater compliance costs.
As our coal mining operations are subject to seasonality, operating results in different periods of a year may not be comparable and our financial condition
and results of operation may be materially and adversely affected if our coal mining operations experience any interruptions during the periods normally
associated with higher production output.
Our production output in the first quarter of each year is generally lower than our production output in other quarters, as our coal mining operations are typically
suspended for approximately three to five weeks during the lunar new year holidays. In addition, our production output in the third and fourth quarters of each year is
generally higher than our production output in other quarters, mainly as a result of higher demand and more favorable weather conditions for coal extraction. As a result,
if our coal mining activities during periods normally associated with higher coal production output experience any material interruptions or slowdowns, our coal production
output for the year would significantly decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Our coal mining operations may be materially disrupted by operational risks and natural disasters for which we have limited insurance.
Our coal mining operations are subject to significant risks and hazards, including earthquakes and other natural disasters, severe weather conditions, unexpected
maintenance or technical problems,
38
key equipment failures, unexpected geological variations and underground mining risks such as mine collapse, gas leaks or explosions, fire and flooding. The
occurrence of these events may materially disrupt our coal production capacity, disrupt coal transportation or cause significant business interruptions, personal injuries,
property or environmental damage and reputation harm.
In line with what we believe to be industry practice, we do not maintain any fire, liability or other property insurance covering our properties, equipment or inventories,
and we do not carry any business interruption insurance, transportation insurance or third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injuries or
property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our properties. Any uninsured losses and liabilities incurred by us may have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.
A decrease in availability or increase in costs of electricity, water or other key supplies may significantly disrupt our business and operations as well as
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our coal mining operations require a reliable supply of electricity, water and other key materials and components, including mining equipment, replacement parts,
explosives and roof control materials, and our demand for these resources and materials is expected to grow as our business grows and our production capacity
increases. We obtain power supply from the China Southern power grid and we obtain water primarily from surface and subsurface supplies, including rivers, reservoirs
and springs. We have not entered into any long-term supply contracts or obtained any guarantees of supply with respect to water, electricity or any of our key supplies.
Any shortages or disruption in the availability of water, electricity or other key supplies could lead to delays and suspensions of our production process, and any
significant increase in the cost of these resources and supplies will increase our operating costs, may significantly disrupt our business and operations and could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to pass on the increased costs to our customers.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we experience any significant interruptions, capacity
shortages or cost increases with respect to our coal transportation.
We currently transport coal to our customers primarily by road using third party coal transportation services. To date, we have not entered into any long-term contracts
with or otherwise obtained any capacity guarantees or commitments from any provider of coal transportation services, and we cannot assure that we will not experience
coal transportation interruptions or capacity shortages. For many consumers of anthracite coal, particularly chemical plants, having a timely and reliable supply of
anthracite coal is critical for their business. As a result, our failure to deliver anthracite coal to our customers in a timely manner could cause significant damage to our
customer relationships and our reputation. Moreover, as we have not entered into any long-term contracts with any provider of coal transportation services, we cannot
assure that coal transportation costs will not increase significantly in the future, which may materially decrease the competitiveness of our anthracite coal as well as our
profit margins.
39
We rely on third party contractors for the construction of our coal mines, and their failure to perform their obligations could have a material and adverse
effect on our business and prospects.
We have outsourced to third party contractors the construction of our coal mines. See “Business — Suppliers, Third Party Contractors and Utilities.” Although we
maintain close supervision over our contractors, we cannot assure you that our contractors will perform their obligations on time, to our satisfaction, or at all. Our
contractors’ failure to perform their obligations, meet our quality, safety and environmental protection standards or comply with relevant laws, rules and regulations may
result in liabilities for us and could severely damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we have any material dispute with our contractors or if our relationship with our
contractors deteriorates, our production capacity expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected.
We depend on our key personnel, and our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we lose their services.
Our success is significantly dependent on the continued service of our key executives and skilled employees. In particular, Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief
executive officer, and the other individuals set forth in the section headed “Directors and Senior Management” are critical to the development of our business and our
strategic direction. If we lose the services of one or more of our key executives and skilled employees, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements,
and we may need to incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Moreover,
as we expect to continue to expand our operations, we will need to continue attracting and retaining experienced management and other skilled personnel.
Competition in the PRC mining industry for personnel experienced in the acquisition, exploration and development of coal mines is intense, and the availability of
suitable and qualified candidates is limited. Competition for these individuals could cause us to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain
them, which could materially increase our operating costs. If we are unable to attract or retain the personnel required to achieve our business objectives, our financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from those of our other shareholders.
Immediately following the Spin-off, Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief executive officer, will directly and indirectly own approximately 59.33% of our outstanding
Shares. Accordingly, Mr. Li will have the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including matters relating to:
·                  the nomination and election of our Directors;
·                  our management, particularly the composition of our senior management;
·                  the issuance of new securities;
·                  the timing and amount of dividend payments;
40
·                  our business strategies and policies;
·                  any plans relating to acquisitions, investments, divestitures or other significant corporate transactions; and
·                  amendments to our Articles of Association.
The interests of Mr. Li may differ from your interest as a shareholder of our Company, and Mr. Li may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our Company
or our other shareholders. Moreover, Mr. Li’s controlling stake in our Company may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or other business combination
involving our Company, which could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your Shares as part of a sale of our Company and may reduce the price of
our Shares.
Failure by the Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy to fulfill their obligations under the Deed of Non-Competition could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In connection with the Listing, the Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy entered into a Deed of Non-Competition pursuant to which each of them has
undertaken to:
·                  not, and procure that their respective subsidiaries or parties controlled by them either solely or jointly with another Controlling Shareholder or any other party
will not, either on their own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly, be interested or engaged in or acquire or
hold any right or interest (in each case whether as a shareholder, partner, agent or otherwise) in any business which directly or indirectly competes or may so compete
with the Core Businesses;
·                  if any of them becomes aware of any business opportunity which directly or indirectly competes or may so compete with the Core Businesses (“New Business
Opportunity”), notify our Company of such business opportunity forthwith; and
·                  use its best endeavors to procure that the New Business Opportunity is first offered to our Company on terms and conditions that are fair and reasonable.
Feishang Energy, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Feishang Enterprise, is one of the entities in Guizhou province (including our Company) that has been
assessed under the Guizhou government’s coal mine consolidation policy to be a consolidator of coal mines in Guizhou province. Accordingly, Feishang Energy has
provided the above undertakings with respect to the period beginning from the date of the Listing until it ceases to be qualified as a consolidator. Mr. Li Feilie, our
chairman and chief executive officer, owns approximately 60.74% of the outstanding shares of Feishang Enterprise.
41
For the purpose of the Deed of Non-Competition, “Core Businesses” include the acquisition and exploitation of coal mining rights (including the exploration, construction,
development and operation of coal mines) located in Guizhou province in the PRC. Failure by the Controlling Shareholders and/or Feishang Energy to fulfill their
obligations under the Deed of Non-Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See
“Relationship with Our Controlling Shareholders — Deed of Non-Competition.”
If we are unable to renew the governmental approvals to use certain of our leased properties for coal mining purposes, our business and operations could
be materially disrupted.
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we leased 19 parcels of collectively-owned land with a total site area of approximately 470,821.0 square meters in connection with our
coal mining operations. Our use of these properties for coal mining is subject to the approval of the local land and resources authorities. Each approval is generally valid
for one to two years and must be renewed thereafter. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these approvals in a timely manner or at all. If we are not able
to continue occupying and using these properties for coal mining purposes, our business and operations could be materially disrupted.
RISKS RELATING TO PRC’S COAL INDUSTRY
Our business, financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to the cyclical nature of the PRC anthracite coal market and vulnerable to
fluctuations in anthracite coal prices.
As substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of anthracite coal, our business, financial condition and results of operations are substantially dependent
upon the prices we charge for our anthracite coal. We price our anthracite coal by reference to prices in the domestic PRC anthracite coal markets, which is highly
cyclical and has in the past exhibited significant fluctuations in prices due to various supply and demand factors. For example, anthracite coal prices in Guizhou
declined significantly in the second quarter of 2012 as a result of the general economic slowdown in the PRC, which reduced demand, as well as an increase in
production capacity in Shanxi province, which increased supply. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging transactions to manage our commodity price risk. The
PRC anthracite coal market is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:
·                  general economic conditions in the PRC;
·                  global and regional supply and demand for anthracite coal;
·                  competition from other energy sources or alternatives to anthracite coal;
·                  abnormal weather conditions;
·                  speculative anthracite coal trading;
42
·                  the PRC Government’s economic, energy, environmental, health and safety and other policies; and
·                  fluctuations in the development and growth of industries in the PRC with high demand for anthracite coal, including the power, chemical, iron and steel, and
building materials industries.
Moreover, technological developments may reduce the long-term demand for anthracite coal. In particular, certain chemical manufacturers have begun experimenting
with alternative synthesis processes that would allow the use of lower cost bituminous coal or natural gas instead of anthracite coal to produce ammonia and methanol,
while certain iron and steel enterprises are experimenting with using bituminous coal instead of anthracite coal in the steel production process. Although these
processes have not yet been proven to be commercially viable, if cost-effective and reliable alternatives to anthracite coal are developed in the future, the long-term
demand for, and prices of, anthracite coal would suffer. Any substantial or extended decline in the market prices of anthracite coal in the PRC could materially decrease
our revenue and cash flows as well as increase our net loss. For the discussion on sensitivity analysis of the effects of increases or decreases in the average selling
price of our anthracite coal on our financial results, see “Financial Information — Market Risk Disclosure — Commodity Price Risk.”
We are subject to extensive regulation, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected if
we fail to comply with applicable regulations or if existing regulations or other government policies change.
Our coal mining operations are subject to extensive regulation in the PRC relating to:
·                  the granting and renewal of coal exploration rights and mining rights;
·                  the granting of safe production permits;
·                  coal mining project approvals;
·                  production capacity requirements;
·                  resource recovery rate and water and soil preservation requirements;
·                  environmental, safety and occupational health requirements;
·                  government control over coal prices;
·                  taxes, duties and levies, including, among others, resource taxes, mining right usage fees, mineral resource compensatory fees and the coal price levies; and
·                  the allocation of coal transportation capacity on the national railway system.
43
Interpretation of these regulations may change and new regulations may come into effect, which could disrupt or restrict our coal mining operations, reduce our
competitiveness or require us to incur substantial compliance costs. In particular, we are subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements with respect to coal
mine safety. For example, Gouchang Coal Mine suspended its operations from March to August 2012 to comply with certain newly implemented mine gas control
requirements in Guizhou. Furthermore, in 2012, the Guizhou government required certain coal mines utilizing drilling and blasting methods to upgrade to semi-
mechanical longwall mining methods, which required us to incur significant time and expense to redesign and upgrade our Liujiaba Coal Mine. We are also subject to
extensive and increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations in the PRC. These laws, rules and regulations impose, among other things, fees for the
discharge of pollutants and waste substances, as well as require us to establish reserves for land reclamation and rehabilitation. Any failure to comply may result in
fines, restrictions and limits on our coal mining operations, as well as suspension or revocation of our business licenses.
Changes in or implementation of government policies in relation to the consolidation of coal enterprises or coal mines may also have a material adverse effect on our
business. For example, in March 2013, the Guizhou government issued a coal mine consolidation policy which aims to, among other things, reduce the total number of
coal enterprises and coal mines in Guizhou. As a result of this policy, the operations of Gouchang Coal Mine have been suspended by the Guizhou government since
March 2013 pending the acquisition by us of a nearby coal mine and Gouchang Coal Mine achieving certain production capacity targets in accordance with Guizhou
province’s coal mine consolidation policy. We cannot assure you that our acquisition of the coal mine near Gouchang Coal Mine would be successful or that Gouchang
Coal Mine would be able to achieve the required production capacity targets. If we cannot acquire such coal mine or Gouchang Coal Mine cannot achieve the required
production capacity targets, we may be required to divest or shut down Gouchang Coal Mine. As of April 30, 2013, Gouchang Coal Mine had proved and probable
reserve of 5.72 million tonnes, representing approximately 2.7% of our total proved and probable reserve.
Regulatory changes in the PRC could also significantly reduce the demand for, and the price of, anthracite coal. For example, in November 2011, the NDRC limited
increases in the contract price of thermal coal sold to certain power producers in the PRC to 5%, as well as imposed certain price limits on the spot prices of thermal
coal. Although these measures were terminated in January 2013, we cannot assure you that the price of thermal coal would not be subject to further price controls in the
future. Moreover, the Guizhou government levies a coal price adjustment fund levy on the coal sold by local coal producers and the rate of the coal price adjustment
fund levy is subject to frequent changes based on prevailing government policies, which significantly reduced the competitiveness of coal producers in Guizhou. We
cannot assure you that we will not be subject to further price restrictions, levies or additional regulations in the future, or that future regulatory changes would not have a
material adverse effect on our business or prospects.
44
Competition in the PRC coal industry is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively.
The PRC coal industry is highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of many factors, including, coal quality and characteristics, stability of supply, availability
and cost of transportation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, customer service and price. Moreover, as there is a limited supply of desirable anthracite coal reserves
in the PRC, there is intense competition for mining rights among anthracite coal producers in the PRC. We face competition primarily from other anthracite coal
enterprises in Guizhou. Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources, lower operating costs, more advanced technologies, longer
operating histories and greater brand recognition than us. If we are unable to compete effectively in attracting and retaining customers as well as obtaining mining rights
over coal reserves, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.
RISKS RELATING TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN THE PRC
Changes in economic, political and social conditions in the PRC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
Substantially all of our business and operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are, to a
significant degree, subject to the economic, political and social conditions in the PRC. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in
many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although
the PRC Government has implemented measures since the late 1970s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state
ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC
is still government-owned. In addition, the PRC Government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development through the implementation of
industrial policies. In particular, the PRC coal industry is subject to extensive regulation. See “Regulation — PRC Laws Relating to the Coal Industry.” The PRC
Government also exercises significant control over the economy through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations,
setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our business and operations are primarily conducted in the PRC and governed by PRC laws, rules and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are generally subject to laws,
rules and regulations applicable to foreign investments in the PRC and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is a civil
law system based on written statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since the late 1970s, the PRC Government
has significantly enhanced PRC legislation and regulations to provide protections to various forms of foreign investments in the PRC. However, the PRC has not
developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in the PRC. As many
of these laws, rules and regulations are continually
45
evolving, and because of the limited volume of published decisions, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties and
may not be as consistent or predictable as in other more developed jurisdictions. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and
administrative rules that may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of any violations by us until some time after the violation. Furthermore, the legal
protections available to us under these laws, rules and regulations may be limited. Any litigation or regulatory enforcement action in the PRC may be protracted and
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
Governmental control over currency conversion may affect the value of your investment and limit our ability to utilize our cash effectively.
The PRC Government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC.
We receive substantially all of our revenue in Renminbi, which is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict
our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy any foreign currency dominated obligations we may incur. Under existing PRC foreign
exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, may be
made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from the SAFE or its local
branch may be required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses, such as offshore investments
denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC Government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. In addition,
since a significant amount of our future cash flow from operations will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit
our ability to receive dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries in the PRC, purchase goods and services outside of the PRC or otherwise fund any future
business activities that may be conducted in foreign currencies. This could also affect the ability of our subsidiaries in the PRC to obtain foreign exchange through debt
or equity financing, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us.
We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries in the PRC to fund our cash and financing requirements, and
any limitation on the ability of our operating subsidiaries in the PRC to pay dividends or make distributions to us could have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity.
We are a holding company, and we rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our operating subsidiaries in the PRC for our cash and financing
requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay certain operating
expenses. Under the applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, dividends may be paid only out of distributable profits. We cannot assure you that our operating
subsidiaries will generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or otherwise distribute sufficient funds to enable us to meet our financial obligations or
declare dividends. In particular, each of our subsidiaries in the PRC is required under the applicable laws, rules and regulations to set aside a portion of its net income
each year to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves, together with the registered equity, are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, our bank borrowing
or other
46
financing agreements may contain certain restrictions relating to the payment of dividends or other distributions. As a result, these subsidiaries are restricted in their
ability to transfer a portion of their respective net assets to their shareholders as dividends. Limitations on the ability of these subsidiaries in the PRC, such as Guizhou
Puxin and Guizhou Fuyuantong, to pay dividends or make distributions to us could limit our ability to grow our business, make investments or acquisitions, pay
dividends to our shareholders, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.
Dividends received by holders of our Shares that are non-PRC enterprises and gains derived from the disposition of our Shares by such holders may
become subject to PRC taxation, which may materially reduce the value of investments in our Shares.
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008, a non-PRC enterprise is generally subject to
enterprise income tax at the rate of 10% with respect to PRC-sourced income, including dividends derived from sources within the PRC and gains derived from the
disposition of equity interests in a PRC company, subject to any reductions under any special arrangements or applicable treaty between the PRC and the jurisdiction of
the relevant foreign enterprise’s residence. As the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules are relatively new, there remains significant uncertainty
as to their interpretation and application by the PRC tax authorities, including whether and how enterprise income tax on dividends payable to and gains derived by
holders of our Shares that are non-PRC enterprises may be collected. If we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, dividends we pay with respect to our Shares, or
the gain our Shareholders may realize from the transfer of our Shares, may be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax. If we
are required under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our Shareholders that are non-
PRC resident enterprises, or if our Shareholders are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our Shares, the value of such non-PRC enterprise holders’
investments in our Shares may be materially reduced.
We may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on our global income, or dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiary may be subject to PRC withholding
tax, depending on whether we are recognized as a resident enterprise in the PRC.
Pursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign country or region whose “de facto
management body” is located within the PRC territory is considered a resident enterprise and will generally be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on
its global income. According to the Implementation Rules, “de facto management body” refers to a managing body that exercises, in substance, overall management
and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting and assets of an enterprise. As there is no official interpretation or application of the resident
enterprise, it remains unclear how PRC tax authority will treat an overseas company that is controlled by natural persons like us. In addition, if new rules and
interpretations are issued in the future specifying the criteria for determining whether a foreign entity controlled by a natural person is a resident enterprise under the PRC
Enterprise Income Tax Law, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed a PRC resident enterprise. If, in accordance with any future rules, we were considered a
PRC resident enterprise, we would be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our global income and any dividend received by our non-resident
enterprise shareholder may be subject to 10% withholding tax. If we are
47
considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we will not be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our global
income. In such case, however, dividends we receive from our PRC subsidiaries will be subject to a PRC withholding tax of 10% or 5%, depending on the availability of
the relevant tax treaty.
We may not be able to enjoy a reduced withholding tax rate under the special arrangement between Hong Kong and the PRC
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008, a non-PRC resident enterprise is generally subject
to a withholding tax rate of 10% with respect to dividends paid by its subsidiaries in the PRC, subject to any reductions under any special arrangements or applicable
treaty between the PRC and the jurisdiction of the relevant foreign enterprise’s residence. Under the Arrangement between the Mainland and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (內地和香港特別行政區關於對所得避
免雙重徵稅和防止偷漏稅的安排), which became effective on January 1, 2007, the withholding tax rate for dividends paid by a PRC resident enterprise to a Hong Kong
resident enterprise may be lowered to 5% if the Hong Kong resident enterprise owns at least 25% of the PRC resident enterprise. Nonetheless, according to the Circular
of the State Administration of Taxation on Relevant Issues relating to the Implementation of Dividend Clauses in Tax Treaties (國家稅務總局關於執行稅收協定股息條款
有關問題的通知), which became effective on February 20, 2009, special tax treatments on dividends paid by a PRC company under relevant tax treaties will not be
available unless certain conditions are satisfied. In addition, pursuant to the Administrative Measures for Non-residents to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties (Trial)
(非居民享受稅收協定待遇管理辦法(試行)), which became effective on October 1, 2009, approvals from competent local tax authorities are required before an enterprise
can enjoy the relevant tax treatments. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to Taxation And Fee.” Although Smartact is a Hong Kong resident enterprise which wholly
owns Guizhou Fuyuantong, our holding company in the PRC, we cannot assure you that it will be able to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate under the special
arrangement between Hong Kong and the PRC.
PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders or our
PRC subsidiaries to liabilities or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute
profits to us.
The SAFE issued a public notice in October 2005 (“SAFE Circular No. 75”), requiring PRC residents to register with the local branch of the SAFE before establishing or
controlling any company outside of the PRC for the purpose of capital financing with assets or equities of PRC companies, referred to in the notice as an “offshore
special purpose company.” In addition, any PRC resident that is a shareholder of an offshore special purpose company is required to amend its registration with the
SAFE with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity
investment, creation of any security interest over any assets located in the PRC or any other material change in share capital. We may not be fully informed of the
identities of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Moreover, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC
resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular No. 75. The failure of our beneficial owners who
48
are PRC residents to register or amend their registrations with the SAFE in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular No. 75 or the failure of future beneficial owners of
our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular No. 75 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC
subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions, and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to
distribute dividends to us or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. See “Regulation — Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange.”
PRC regulation of loans to, and investments in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict
or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our
ability to fund and expand our business.
Loans or additional capital contributions by our Company to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:
·                  capital contributions by our Company to a PRC subsidiary must be approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterparts;
·                  acquisition of onshore entities by us or our offshore subsidiaries must be approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterparts; and
·                  loans by us to a wholly foreign-owned subsidiary cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its branches.
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of
Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign Invested Enterprises, or Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital
into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 142 provides that the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital
of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and, unless otherwise
provided by law, such Renminbi capital may not be used for equity investments in the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the use of Renminbi capital
converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be altered without SAFE approval, and
such Renminbi capital may not, in any case, be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 could result
in severe monetary or other penalties.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain requisite government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital
contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to fund our operations in the PRC would be limited, which
could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to expand our business.
49
You may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our management.
Substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries are located in the PRC. In addition, most of our Directors and officers reside within the PRC, and the assets of
certain Directors and officers are located within the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside
the PRC upon most of our Directors and officers, including with respect to matters arising under the U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws.
Moreover, the PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan or most
other Western countries. In addition, Hong Kong has no arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments with the United States. As a result, recognition and
enforcement in the PRC or Hong Kong of judgments of a court in the United States and any of the other jurisdictions mentioned above in relation to any matter that is
not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible. In addition, although we will be subject to the Listing Rules and the Takeovers Code upon the
listing of our Shares on the Stock Exchange, the holders of Shares will not be able to bring actions on the basis of violations of the Listing Rules and must rely on the
Stock Exchange to enforce its rules.
Natural disasters and health and public security hazards in the PRC may severely disrupt our business and operations and may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In May 2008 and April 2013, earthquakes registering 8.0 and 6.6, respectively, on the Richter scale struck Sichuan Province and certain other parts of the PRC,
devastating much of the affected areas and causing tens of thousands of deaths and widespread injuries, and in September 2012, a seriesof earthquakes registering 4.8
to 5.6 on the Richter scale struck Guizhou and Yunnan causing at least 80 deaths and significant and extensive damage to factories, power lines, blackouts,
transportation and communications disruptions and other losses in the affected areas. Moreover, the PRC has encountered incidents of severe acute respiratory
syndrome and the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1 and H7N9). We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that any future natural disasters and health and public security
hazards may have on our business. Any future natural disasters and health and public security hazards may, among other things, significantly disrupt our ability to
adequately staff or otherwise operate our coal mines, limit coal transportation, as well as generally disrupt our operations. Furthermore, natural disasters and health and
public security hazards may severely restrict the level of economic activity in affected areas, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.
RISKS RELATING TO THE SPIN-OFF
We have no history operating as an independent company, and we may incur significant expenses to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate
as an independent public company.
Prior to the Spin-off, we have relied on the corporate infrastructure of CHNR to support our business functions, including information technology systems, human
resource systems and legal support. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure were allocated among all of the businesses of CHNR.
Following the Spin-off, we will no longer have access to CHNR’s
50
corporate infrastructure, and we will need to establish our own corporate infrastructure or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. The costs associated
with performing or outsourcing these functions may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Several of our senior management members may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of shares of CHNR
Several of our senior management members, including Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Edward Wong, our executive director, and Mr. Tam
Cheuk Ho, our executive director, own shares of China Natural Resources. As of December 31, 2012, Mr. Li, Mr. Wong and Mr. Tam owned 14,780,593, 400,000 and
281,926 shares of CHNR. Their ownership of shares of CHNR could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our directors and executive officers
are faced with decisions that could have different implications for CHNR and us. See “Relationship with Controlling Shareholders.”
An active trading market for our Shares may not develop, and the trading price and volume of our Shares may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to the Listing, no public market for our Shares existed. We cannot assure you that an active and liquid trading market for our Shares will develop or be sustained
after the Listing or that we will be able to maintain the listing of our Shares. If an active and liquid trading market for our Shares does not develop or is not sustained
after the Listing, the trading price and liquidity of our Shares may be materially and adversely affected.
The trading price and volume for our Shares may be highly volatile in response to factors beyond our control, including general market conditions of the capital markets
in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the price and trading volume for our Shares may be volatile for specific business or other reasons. In particular,
factors such as variations in our revenue, earnings and cash flow, announcements of new investments, acquisitions or discovery of new coal reserves, fluctuations in
the market prices for coal, as well as general economic, market or regulatory conditions, could cause large and sudden changes in the trading volume and price of our
Shares.
Future sales or perceived sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public market, including any future sale of our Shares by those Shareholders
that are currently subject to contractual or legal restrictions on Share transfers, could have a material adverse effect on the prevailing market price of our
Shares and our ability to raise capital in the future, and may result in dilution of your shareholding in our Company.
The market price of our Shares could decline as a result of future sales of substantial amounts of our Shares or other securities relating to our Shares in the public
market or the issuance of new Shares or other securities, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur. Future sales, or perceived sales, of substantial
amounts of our securities, including any future offerings, could also materially and adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the future at a time and at a price we
deem appropriate. In addition, our Shareholders may experience dilution in their holdings to the extent we issue additional securities in future offerings.
51
In connection with the Listing, each Controlling Shareholder has agreed, among other things, not to sell our Shares for six months after the Listing Date and has agreed
to retain sufficient Shares to remain as our Controlling Shareholder for six months after the Listing Date. However, we cannot assure you that our Controlling
Shareholders will not dispose of any or all of the Shares they may own now or in the future after the expiration of the applicable lock-up periods. Any future sales, or
perceived sales, of substantial amounts of our Shares by our Controlling Shareholders could cause the market price of our Shares to decrease significantly as well as
materially hinder our ability to raise capital in the future.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
This listing document contains information relating to the PRC economy, the PRC coal and power industries as well as the international coal market and other energy
markets. The information is derived from various publications, market data providers and other independent third party sources. We have also engaged Fenwei, an
experienced consultant in the energy sector in China and an Independent Third Party, to prepare a report to provide certain industry data for this section and elsewhere
in this listing document. Fenwei was paid a total of RMB320,000 in fees for this service. Fenwei prepared its report based on its in-house database, independent third
party reports and publicly available data from reputable industry organizations. Where necessary, Fenwei visited companies operating in the industry to gather and
synthesize information about market, prices and other relevant information.
We believe that the sources of the information in this section are appropriate sources for such information and have taken reasonable care in the extraction, compilation
and reproduction of the information presented in this section. We have no reason to believe that such information is false or misleading in any material respect or that
any part has been omitted that would render such information false or misleading in any material respect. Neither we, the Joint Sponsors nor any of our or their
respective directors, officers or representatives or any other person involved in the Listing have independently verified the information directly or indirectly derived from
official government sources, or make any representation as to the accuracy of the information from official government or other third party sources. Such information
may not be consistent with and may not have been compiled with the same degree of accuracy or completeness as other information compiled within or outside the
PRC. Accordingly, the information derived from official government and other third party sources contained herein may not be accurate and should not be unduly relied
upon.
INTRODUCTION
Coal is a combustible, sedimentary, organic rock composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. It is a fossil fuel and the primary energy source in the PRC. The
“rank” of coal, which is determined by the degree of change undergone by coal as it matures from peat to coal, has an important bearing on its physical and chemical
properties as well as end use. Low-rank coal, such as lignite and sub-bituminous coal, is typically softer, friable material with a dull, earthy appearance. It is
characterized by high moisture levels and low carbon content, and consequently low energy content. High-rank coal, such as coking coal and anthracite coal, is
generally harder and stronger and often has a black, vitreous luster, and generally contains more carbon, has lower moisture content, and produces more energy than
low-rank coal. The diagram below summarizes the primary types of coal and their associated end-uses.

Anthracite Coal — The Highest-Rank Type of Coal
Under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, anthracite coal is the highest-rank coal, containing volatile matter content of 10.0% or less and thus a high percentage
of carbon. According to the World Coal Institute, anthracite coal accounted for only approximately 1% of total world coal reserves in 2005. As a result of anthracite
coal’s relative quality and scarcity, it is generally able to command a higher selling price than other types of coal.
In the process of determining whether the coal belongs to anthracite coal and its relevant classification, beneficiation (or coal washing) of raw coal (the result of which is
referred to as “float coal”) is required in order to reduce the dry ash content to an acceptable level as necessary under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard. The
Chinese Coal Classification Standard categorizes anthracite coal into three classes based on volatile matter and helium content — WY1-class anthracite coal has a
volatile matter content of no more than 3.5% or helium content of no more than 2.0%; WY2-class anthracite coal has a volatile matter content of more than 3.5% and no
more than 6.5% or helium content of more than 2.0% and no more than 3.0%; and WY3-class anthracite coal has a volatile matter content of more than 6.5% and no
more than 10.0% or helium content of more than 3.0%. Under the Chinese Coal Classification Standand, in case of a conflict between the classification of anthracite
coal based on volatile matter content and helium content, the classification based on helium content
59
will be used. According to the Chinese Coal Granularity Classification Standard, large-lump anthracite coal has a diameter above 50 millimeters, mid-lump anthracite
coal has a diameter between 25 and 50 millimeters, small-lump anthracite coal has a diameter between 13 and 25 millimeters and fine anthracite coal has a diameter
below 13 millimeters.
OVERVIEW OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL INDUSTRY IN THE PRC
The PRC’s Anthracite Coal Resources
According to the latest available data from the SAWS, the PRC had anthracite coal resources of 139.2 billion tonnes in 2008, which accounted for approximately 12% of
the PRC’s total coal resources. According to SAWS, approximately 69% PRC’s anthracite coal resources was located in Shanxi and Guizhou provinces in 2008.
ANTHRACITE COAL SUPPLY & DEMAND IN THE PRC
From 2008 to 2012, domestic anthracite coal production in the PRC was insufficient to meet domestic demand, and as a result, the PRC was a net importer of
anthracite coal during the period. According to Fenwei, anthracite coal demand in the PRC is expected to continue rising in general due to estimated increases in the
demand in anthracite coal for industrial uses, and the supply deficit is expected to continue. Set forth below is the total supply and demand for anthracite coal in the
PRC for the periods indicated.

According to Fenwei, the four major anthracite coal producing provinces in the PRC are Shanxi, Henan, Guizhou and Hunan, which accounted for approximately 67% of
the total anthracite coal production volume in the PRC in 2012. Shanxi is the largest anthracite coal producer in the PRC in terms of production volume, accounting for
approximately 32% of the PRC’s total anthracite coal production volume in 2012. Based on the data from Fenwei, although Guizhou held approximately 29% of total
anthracite coal resources in the PRC, Guizhou anthracite coal production volume accounted for only 10% of total domestic production in 2012, due to the less
developed stage of exploration and production in Guizhou. Set forth below is the breakdown by province of the anthracite coal production in the PRC in 2012:
Sources: SAWS; Fenwei
The PRC’s Anthracite Coal Imports
The PRC is a net importer of anthracite coal. Based on the data from Fenwei, the PRC’s net anthracite coal imports grew at a CAGR of 23.7% from 13.3 million tonnes
in 2008 to 31.2 million tonnes in 2012. The PRC mainly imports anthracite coal from Vietnam, which accounted for 51% of the PRC’s total anthracite coal imports in
2012. Beginning in 2010, the PRC also began to import large volumes of anthracite coal from North Korea. In 2012, anthracite coal imports from North Korea accounted
for 34% of the PRC’s total anthracite coal imports, the second largest source of import after Vietnam. Other sources of imports included Australia and Russia.
By comparison, the volume of anthracite coal exports from the PRC has been low, at approximately four million tonnes per year over the period from 2008 to 2012,
based on Fenwei’s data. The PRC primarily exports anthracite coal to South Korea and Japan.
61
Uses of Anthracite Coal in the PRC
Anthracite coal has applications in a number of different industries. In the PRC, end users generally characterize anthracite coal as thermal coal, chemical coal or PCI
coal. Set forth below is a summary of the key characteristics of thermal coal, chemical coal and PCI coal:

Thermal coal
Thermal coal primarily refers to fine anthracite coal used in the electric power industry for power generation and in the building materials industry for cement production.
Fine anthracite coal may generally be used directly as thermal coal without any coal-washing or other processing.
According to Fenwei, in recent years, the installed capacity of the PRC’s electric power industry has been expanding, driven by a growing economy and increasing fixed-
asset investments. According to Fenwei, thermal power accounted for 79% of the PRC’s total power supply in 2012, of which approximately 15% was fueled by
anthracite coal. Anthracite coal used for electric power generation grew at a CAGR of 5.3% from 175.1 million tonnes in 2008 to 215.3 million tonnes in 2012.
In the building materials industry, anthracite coal is used for cement production. According to Fenwei, anthracite coal used in the building materials industry grew at a
CAGR of 7.1% from 96.9 million tonnes in 2008 to 127.4 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to remain relatively stable in the coming years.
Chemical coal
Chemical coal refers to coal used for synthetic ammonia, methanol and other chemical production. Synthetic ammonia is the raw material for urea production, and
methanol is an important base chemical and may be used directly as fuel. Anthracite coal is a key raw material for synthetic ammonia and methanol production. Based
on the data from Fenwei, anthracite coal used in the chemical industry grew at a CAGR of 3.2% from 70.0 million tonnes in 2008 to 79.3 million tonnes in 2012.
Depending on the usage and the desired technical specifications, both anthracite coal lumps and fine anthracite coal may be used as chemical coal, and coal-washing
may be required.
62
Some chemical plants have experimented with using bituminous coal or natural gas as a substitute for anthracite coal to save costs. However, the use of bituminous
coal requires the restructuring of gasification furnaces and has a negative environmental impact, while the supply of natural gas in the PRC is limited. According to
Fenwei, approximately 71% of synthetic ammonia and approximately 70% of methanol in the PRC were produced from anthracite coal in 2012.
PCI coal
PCI coal is generally used for sintering, smelting and injection purposes in the pulverized coal injection process in iron production, and it is produced from anthracite
coal fines after coal-washing to achieve certain technical specifications. Iron and steel manufacturing plants are able to reduce costs by using PCI coal for blast furnace
injection instead of coke, which is produced from coking coal. PCI coal can be made from anthracite or bituminous coal or a combination of both. According to Fenwei,
in 2012, approximately 60% of PCI coal in the PRC was made from anthracite coal, compared with 80% in 2007, and the proportion of PCI coal made from anthracite
coal is expected to continue to decline. However, anthracite coal used in the iron and steel industry grew at a CAGR of 13.5% from 37.9 million tonnes in 2008 to 62.9
million tonnes in 2012.
OVERVIEW OF THE ANTHRACITE COAL INDUSTRY IN GUIZHOU
Anthracite Coal Resources & Distribution in Guizhou
According to the latest available data from the SAWS, in 2008, Guizhou had 51.4 billion tonnes of coal resources, 78% of which were anthracite coal, accounting for
29% of the PRC’s total anthracite coal resources.
The Guizhou coal market is highly fragmented. According to statistics from the Guizhou Administration of Coal Mine Safety, in June 2011, Guizhou had 18 large coal
mines with annual production capacity of no less than 1.2 million tonnes and 70 medium-sized mines with an annual production capacity of 0.3 to 1.2 million tonnes. The
production volume of small coal mines with an annual production capacity of no more than 0.3 million tonnes accounted for 76% of the total coal production capacity in
Guizhou.
Coal Transportation in Guizhou
Guizhou province is located in southwest China. Coal in Guizhou is transported by rail, road and waterway. According to Fenwei, in 2012, the average transportation
cost in Guizhou per each tonne of coal was RMB0.5 to RMB1.0 per kilometer by road, RMB0.3 per kilometer by rail and RMB0.2 to RMB0.3 per kilometer by waterway.
Guizhou is a key province for transferring cargo from the PRC’s western provinces to its southern coastal area. There are four railway lines which run through Guizhou
province and the road network spans over 30,000 kilometers in Guizhou, including five national roads and 30 provincial
63
roads. Guiyang is at the center of Guizhou’s rail and road networks, which extend to substantially all cities and counties in the province. The inland waterway system in
Guizhou consists of five primary out-of-provincial waterways linked to the Yangtze River in northern Guizhou and the Pearl River in southern Guizhou.
According to Guizhou’s “678 highway network plan” Guizhou intends to increase the total road mileage by at least 4,500 kilometers and construct a highway in each
county by 2015. This development is expected to significantly improve the transportation of coal by road in Guizhou, particularly in the Bijie area, and it is also expected
to reduce the transportation costs. Guizhou also plans to construct two waterway systems for out-of-province cargo transport by 2015, with one end connecting the
Yangtze River in northern Guizhou and the other end connecting the Pearl River in southern Guizhou.
TARGET MARKETS FOR GUIZHOU ANTHRACITE COAL
Anthracite Coal Supply & Demand in the Target Markets
According to the SAWS, Guizhou is the largest anthracite coal producing province in southern China. In addition to local consumption, other target markets for Guizhou
anthracite coal are the neighboring provinces and municipalities of Guizhou, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Chongqing and Jiangxi. Demand for anthracite
coal in these target markets has been growing faster than supply, resulting in a widened anthracite coal supply deficit. As Guizhou has a surplus of anthracite coal, it is
in a position to supply to its neighboring provinces. Given the relative scarcity of anthracite coal and the growing economies of the target markets, Fenwei expects the
supply deficit of anthracite coal in the target markets to continue. Set forth below is a table containing the actual and estimated volume of anthracite coal production,
demand and surplus or deficit in Guizhou and the target markets. The estimation was prepared by Fenwei based primarily on the 12th Five Year Plan for the
Development of Coal Industry of each of Guizhou and such target markets.

COAL PRICING IN GUIZHOU
Recent Guizhou Anthracite Coal Prices
64
Anthracite coal prices in Guizhou rose significantly in October 2011, mainly driven by a reduction in anthracite coal supply as a result of extensive industry consolidation
in the Guizhou coal sector and strong demand growth driven by fast economic growth. The price of anthracite coal in Guizhou fell significantly in the second quarter of
2012, primarily due to a slowdown in economic growth which constrained the growth of domestic demand, an increase in anthracite coal production in Shanxi province
following restructuring and consolidation of coal enterprises, and a rise in anthracite coal imports.

Factors Affecting Guizhou Anthracite Coal Prices
According to Fenwei, prices of Guizhou anthracite coal are expected to be supported by several factors, including:
·                  limited anthracite coal imports into the region: most of the anthracite coal imports into southwestern China originate from Vietnam, which has limited anthracite
coal resources and its government has expressed its intention to restrict anthracite coal exports;
·                  a continuing supply deficit of anthracite coal in the PRC domestic market, as a result of the scarcity of anthracite coal and limited domestic production
capacity; and
·                  improvements in transportation conditions within Guizhou and between Guizhou and its neighboring provinces.
However, anthracite coal prices in Guizhou may also experience downward pressure. In particular, future improvements in rail transportation conditions in the PRC,
especially the railway from Inner Mongolia to central China, may make it less expensive to transport coal from Inner Mongolia. In addition, coal production capacity in
Shanxi may expand gradually following the completion of its coal sector consolidation.
PRC GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE COAL INDUSTRY
The 12th Five Year Plan for the PRC’s Coal Industry
On March 18, 2012, the NDRC released the 12th Five Year Plan for Development of the Coal Industry, the national plan for 2011 to 2015 on coal mine construction,
production capacity, and transportation via railway and port facilities in the PRC. The main objectives are as follows:
·                  Construct large-scale coal bases and coal enterprise groups, as well as large and modern coal mines. The goal is to have 20 large-scale coal enterprise
groups accounting for over 60% of the nation’s total coal production by 2015. In addition, ten of the 20 coal enterprise groups are expected to have total annual
production capacity of 100 million tonnes and the other ten coal enterprise groups are expected to have total annual production capacity of 50 million tonnes.
Furthermore, large-, medium- and small-sized mines are expected to account for 63%, 22% and 15%, respectively, of the nation’s total coal production by 2015.
·                  Keep coal production “controlled in the east, stable in the center and developing in the west of the PRC.” Under the 12th Five Year Plan for Development of
the Coal Industry, the “east” of PRC refers to the coastal provinces and municipals, as well as Jilin and Heilongjiang; the “center” of the PRC refers to Hunan, Hubei,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Shanxi; and the “west” of the PRC refers to the rest of the areas of the PRC. The increase in the coal production capacity in the PRC was
below the government’s plan in 2006 to 2010. Under such 12th Five Year Plan, increases in the coal production capacity are expected to continue in 2011 to 2015 in the
east, center and west of the PRC, which would account for 5.6%, 30.6% and 63.8%, respectively, of the nation’s planned production
66
capacity by 2015. The newly commenced coal mine construction in the east, center and west of the PRC is expected to account for 3.3%, 25.0% and 71.7%,
respectively, of the nation’s total newly commenced coal mine construction in 2011 to 2015. By 2015, national production capacity is projected to be 4.1 billion tonnes
per year, and the east, center and west of the PRC are expected to account for 12%, 35% and 53%, respectively, of the nation’s total production capacity.
·                  In 2015, rail transport demand for coal is predicted to be 2.6 billion tonnes, with planned capacity of 3 billion tonnes per year. Trans-provincial coal transport
volume is estimated to be 1.66 billion tonnes by 2015, of which 1.58 billion tonnes are expected to be from Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Gansu, 0.03
billion tonnes from Xinjiang, and 0.05 billion tonnes from Yunnan and Guizhou.
Consolidation Policy for the PRC’s Coal Industry
The 12th Five Year Plan for the Development of the Coal Industry states that the primary objective during 2011 to 2015 is to “promote merger and restructuring of coal
enterprise groups, to develop large-scale enterprise groups.” The State plans to accelerate resource consolidation and mergers and restructurings of coal enterprise
groups, which are expected to significantly elevate the concentration ratio of the PRC coal industry. According to the plan, from 2011 to 2015 the State will prioritize the
construction of large-scale coal bases, enterprise groups and modern mines. Moreover, under the plan, there will be no more than a total of 4,000 coal enterprise groups
nationwide and the average production capacity of each enterprise will exceed 1 million tonnes per year. From 2011 to 2015, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia,
Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan plan to accelerate the consolidation of mining properties and resources.
Coal Industry Policy in Guizhou
Guizhou coal capacity and production plan
According to the 12th Five Year Plan for the Development of Coal Industry of Guizhou, coal production is expected to reach 182.33 million tonnes by 2015.
Coal resource consolidation in Guizhou
Guizhou began consolidating its coal sector in 2005, with 346 coal mines closed that year and 425 coal mines closed between 2006 to 2007. According to the 12th Five
Year Plan for the Development of Coal Industry of Guizhou released in January 2011, the Guizhou government announced a policy to reduce the target number of coal
enterprise groups to 100 and the target number of coal mines to approximately 1,000, each with a production capacity of at least 1.5 million tonnes per year, by the end
of 2015. This policy also aims to form one “extra-large” coal enterprise group producing at least 50 million tonnes of coal per year, two “large” coal enterprise groups
producing at least 30 million tonnes of coal per year, and 10 “medium” coal enterprise groups producing at least five million tonnes of coal per year.
67
On March 22, 2013, the authorities in Guizhou issued the Notice of the “Implementation Rules on Accelerating the Progress of Merging and Restructuring Coal Mining
Enterprises of Guizhou Province” (關於印發《貴州省煤礦企業兼併重組工作實施細則》的通知), which aims to implement the aforementioned reductions of coal mining
enterprises and coal mines. Coal enterprises located in Bijie and Liupanshui counties are required to have annual production capacities of no less than 2.0 million
tonnes, and those located in the other areas of Guizhou are required to have annual production capacities of no less than 1.5 million tonnes.
68
REGULATION
OVERVIEW
The coal industry in the PRC is subject to extensive regulations. These regulations govern investments in coal businesses, mining rights, coal exploration, production,
distribution, trading and transportation, as well as safety and environmental protection. In addition, coal operations in the PRC are subject to taxes and levies.
PRC LAWS RELATING TO THE COAL INDUSTRY
Approval of Coal Mine Development Projects
In the PRC, coal mine development projects must be approved by the NDRC or its local counterparts, depending on the location and annual production capacities of the
project.
On July 16, 2004, the State Council promulgated the Decision on Institutional Reform of Investment System (國務院關於投資體制改革的決定) (the “Investment
Decision”), which significantly modified the government approval process for major investment projects in the PRC. Pursuant to the Investment Decision, applications
for coal mine development projects within the mining areas under the national plan are required to be submitted to the NDRC, and applications for other coal mine
development projects are required to be submitted to the competent investment department of the local government.
On December 8, 2005, the NDRC issued the Notice on Strengthening the Management of Related Issues Concerning Basic Construction of Coal Projects (國家發展改革
委關於加強煤炭基本建設項目管理有關問題的通知) (the “Coal Projects Notice”), which was amended on December 12, 2012. Under the Coal Projects Notice, the NDRC
delegated to its local counterparts the authority to approve coal mine development projects which are within the mining areas under the national plan which have annual
production capacities under 600,000 tonnes.
On May 15, 2013, the State Council promulgated the Decision on Cancellation and Delegation of Certain Items Subject to Administrative Examination and Approval (國
務院關於取消和下放一批行政審批項目等事項的決定) (the “Decision on Administrative Examination and Approval”). According to the Decision on Administrative
Examination and Approval, the competent investment department of the provincial governments may approve applications for coal mine development projects which are
within the mining areas under the national plan and have annual production capacities under 1,200,000 tonnes.
Mining Operations
The Coal Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國煤炭法) (the “Coal Law”), which became effective on December 1, 1996 and as amended on August 27, 2009 and April 22,
2011, sets forth certain requirements relating to coal production, including requirements relating to the exploration of mineral resources, the approval of new mines, the
issuance of production permits, the implementation of safety standards, the coal trading, the protection of mining areas from destructive exploitation, the protection of
miners and the administration and supervision of coal mining operations.
69
Under the Mineral Resources Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國礦產資源法) (the “Mineral Resources Law”), which became effective on January 1, 1997 and as amended
on August 29, 1996, all mineral resources in PRC are owned by the State. The Mineral Resources Law governs the supervision and administration of the mining and
exploration of mineral resources. Under the Mineral Resources Law, the geology and mineral resources bureau of each province, autonomous region and municipal
government is responsible for the supervision and administration of the exploration, development and exploitation of mineral resources within its jurisdiction. Businesses
engaged in the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources are required to obtain exploration rights and mining rights from the competent land and resources
authorities.
Pursuant to the Coal Law and the Mineral Resources Law, exploration and exploitation of coal is subject to the supervision by the MLR and the relevant local mineral
resource bureaus and coal administration departments. For example, coal exploration licenses and coal mining right permits are granted by the MLR or local mineral
resource bureaus. Holders of mining right permits are required to file annual reports with the relevant administrative authorities that issue the permits. A coal production
permit is required before a coal producer may produce and sell coal in the PRC. Furthermore, the production capacity of each coal mine is subject to annual review by
the NDRC or local counterparts.
Under the Procedures for the Registration of Mineral Resources Mining (礦產資源開採登記管理辦法) (the “State Council Circular No. 241”), which became effective on
February 12, 1998, holders of mining right permits are required to submit applications with the relevant registration authorities to change the scope of mining area, the
main exploited mineral categories, exploitation modes and name of the mining enterprise, as well as transferring mining rights. Mining right permits will terminate upon
their expiration unless they are extended by relevant registration authorities.
Coal mining businesses may be subject to administrative penalties for certain non-compliance. For example, conducting a coal mining business without a mining right
permit, safety production permit or coal production permit may result in cease-and-desist orders, disgorgement of profits and fines. In addition, coal mining businesses
which exceed the production limit set forth in the mining right permit or coal production permit may be subject to a one-time fine of up to RMB2.0 million on the coal
mine, a fine of no more than RMB150,000 on the mine manager, other administrative penalties and, in serious cases, revocation of coal production permit and mine
managers’ qualification certifications, as well as closure of the mine.
Under the Coal Law and the Mineral Resources Law, coal producers are required to achieve certain reserves recovery rates, and failure to achieve the rates may result
in penalties, including the revocation of coal production permits.
It is unlawful to conduct mining operations in areas authorized for exploitation by other mining operators, which may result in cease and desist orders, fines, forfeiture of
relevant products and proceeds and damage of losses suffered by authorized operators.
70
Coal mining businesses which cause harm to others in the course of operations are liable to the affected parties and are required to take remedial measures. Under the
Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Mineral Resources Law (中華人民共和國礦產資源法實施細則), a mine operator is required to follow certain procedures when
closing a mine, including submitting a mine closure geology report to the relevant authorities that approved the opening of the mine.
Mining rights are transferable subject to the approval of the relevant geological and mineral resources and land bureaus of the PRC. A mining right permit holder is
entitled to and obligated to conduct mining activities in the area specified in and within the term of the mining right permit. A mining right permit holder is also entitled to
set up necessary production facilities and acquire land use rights necessary for coal production. A mining right permit holder is required to (i) conduct reasonable
exploitation and protect and fully utilize mineral resources, (ii) pay resources taxes and resources compensation levies, (iii) comply with the laws and regulations relating
to occupation safety, soil and water conservation and reclamation and environmental protection, and (iv) submit mineral resource reserves and utilization reports to the
relevant government authorities.
Pursuant to the Coal Law, a coal mining business is required to obtain a coal production permit in order to sell self-produced coal. In addition, pursuant to the Measures
of Supervision of Coal Operation (煤炭經營監管辦法), a coal operation qualification certificate is required to be obtained before engaging in sales of coal products that
are not self-produced or self-processed.
The National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed certain amendments to the Coal Law, which became effective on June 29, 2013, including removing the
requirements of obtaining coal production permits and coal operation permits.
Pricing
Since the PRC Government eliminated price controls over the coal used for power generation in 2002, coal price has been mainly influenced by the supply and demand
of coal markets. Nonetheless, the PRC Government still has the right to implement certain temporary price intervention measures. For example, the NDRC issued the
Notice on Strengthening Adjustments of Thermal Coal Prices (國家發展改革委關於加強發電用煤價格調控的通知) on November 30, 2011, pursuant to which the NDRC
implemented a temporary price intervention measure on thermal coal sold to certain power producers by setting maximum coal prices at key ports and distribution
centers in January 2012. The temporary price intervention measure was terminated in January 2013 in accordance with the Notice on Terminating Temporary Price
Intervention Measures on Thermal Coal Prices (國家發展改革委關於解除發電用煤臨時價格幹預措施的通知) issued by the NDRC on December 18, 2012. Pursuant to the
Price Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國價格法), which became effective on May 1, 1998, temporary price intervention measures may be introduced to limit coal price
increases.
Supply of thermal coal to power plants
On March 28, 2011, the NDRC issued the “Emergency Notice to Ensure the Stable Supply of Thermal Coal and the Stabilization of the Price of Thermal Coal by NDRC”
(國家發展改革委關於切實保障電煤供應穩定電煤價格的緊急通知), which called for a stable supply of thermal coal in all coal producing provinces and districts.
Furthermore, according to the “Notice of Issuing the Provincial
71
Thermal Coal Supply Target for the Year 2010 by the General Office of the Guizhou Provincial People´s Government (Qianfubanfa (2010) No.4)” (貴州省人民政府辦公廳

煤和城市煤氣生產用煤供應工作的通知(黔府辦發〔2011〕127號)) issued on December 12, 2011 by the Guizhou government, the Guizhou government published the
annual guidance relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal by coal enterprises in Guizhou province to power plants operating in Guizhou in
2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Such guidances are aimed at ensuring adequate supply of thermal coal to power plants in Guizhou.
PRC LAWS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
General
Coal mining operations in the PRC are subject to extensive environmental regulations. Under the relevant laws, rules and regulations, a business that discharges toxic
and hazardous materials is required to comply with the applicable standards and report to and register with the relevant environmental protection authorities. Failure to
comply may result in warnings, enforcement orders and other penalties. Before a construction project commences, an environmental impact assessment report must be
submitted to the relevant environmental protection authorities for approval. An acceptance inspection by the relevant environmental protection authorities must be
obtained before the completed construction project may commence its operations.
Provisions on the Protection of the Geological Environment of Mines
According to the Provisions on the Protection of the Geologic Environment of Mines (礦山地質環境保護規定), which became effective on May 1, 2009, a mining right
permit applicant is required to submit a plan relating to the protection and restoration of the mine’s geological environment to the competent land and resources
authorities for approval. In addition, a mining right permit holder is required to pay a security deposit for the restoration of the geological environment of mines and must
be responsible for restoration of the mine’s geological environment which is affected by its mining operation.
Regulations on Land Reclamation and its Implementing Measures
Pursuant to the Regulations on Land Reclamation (土地複墾條例), which became effective on March 5, 2011 and the Implementing Measures of Regulations on Land
Reclamation (土地複墾條例實施辦法), which became effective on March 1, 2013, a coal production enterprise must take measures to restore the land that has been
damaged due to its coal mining operations. The reclaimed land may be put into use only after the reclamation requirements are fulfilled and the relevant land
72
administration authorities have completed an examination and acceptance. Failure to comply with the reclamation requirements or restore the land in the mining areas
may subject the coal production enterprise to fines, land reclamation fees, rejection of the application for land use right, revocation of the mining right permit or, in
serious cases, criminal liability.
PRC LAWS RELATING TO PRODUCTION SAFETY
The SAWS and the SACMS under the supervision of the SAWS are responsible for centralized supervision and monitoring of coal mine safety. Pursuant to the
Provisions on the Supervision of Safety Facilities for Coal Mine Construction Projects (煤礦建設項目安全設施監察規定), the safety design and procedures of a coal
mine construction project must be examined and approved by the SACMS or its local branches. Before the commencement of operation of the coal mine, coal mine
equipment and conditions must pass relevant inspections and acceptance tests performed by SACMS or its local branches. The SACMS may conduct safety
inspections of the conditions of coal production businesses regularly pursuant to the Safety Production Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國安全生產法), the Mining Safety
Law of the PRC (中華人民共和國礦山安全法) and other relevant safety regulations. Coal production businesses that fail to meet relevant safety requirements may be
subject to fines and suspensions of operations.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Measures for the Implementation of Safe Production Licenses of Coal Mine Enterprises (煤礦企業安全生產許可證實施辦法), which
became effective on May 17, 2004, coal mines in operation must have a valid production safety license issued by the SACMS or its provincial bureaus and comply with
the safe production requirements set forth in the license. The production safety license has an initial term of three years, subject to renewals upon satisfaction of
relevant safe production requirements. Moreover, pursuant to the Special Provisions of the State Council on the Prevention of Coal Mine Production Safety Accidents
(國務院關於預防煤礦生產安全事故的特別規定), which became effective on September 3, 2005, coal mine businesses are responsible for preventing accidents at coal
mines, and are required to have sufficient safety equipment, facilities and resources, appropriate accident prevention measures and a sound emergency contingency
plan. Coal mine businesses must establish policies relating to the monitoring, inspection, handling and reporting of potential safety risks. If any major potential safety
risk of production set forth in the policies is identified, coal mine businesses should suspend their operations and eliminate the risk.
On July 19, 2010, the State Council issued the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Further Improving Production Safety of Enterprises (國務院關於進一
步加強企業安全生產工作的通知) (the “Production Safety Notice”). The Production Safety Notice requires enterprises such as coal mining enterprises to improve safety
management, conduct frequent safety inspections, enhance the responsibility and accountability of persons in charge of production and improve safety education and
trainings.
The Trial Rules on Mining Production Work-Related Safety Issues (煤礦作業場所職業危害防治規定(試行)), which became effective on September 1, 2010, require coal
mining companies to submit to relevant safety authorities safety manuals, reports on evaluation of work-related risks, means adopted for risk prevention and work safety
measures.
73
Pursuant to the Notice of “Ten Prohibitions” on Coal Mine Gas Prevention (煤礦瓦斯防治工作”十條禁令”的通知), which became effective on November 25, 2011, coal
and gas outburst mines with annual production capacities of 90,000 tonnes or less are required to suspend production pending rectifications and assessments of gas
prevention capability. Coal and gas outburst mines which fail to pass the assessment are required to remain suspended pending rectifications, be consolidated with
other mines with gas prevention capacity, or close down their operations.
On December 26, 2011, the NEA issued the Administrative Measures regarding Assessment of Gas Prevention Capability of Coal Mining Enterprises (煤礦企業瓦斯防治
能力評估管理辦法) (the “Measures on Gas Prevention”). On March 5, 2012, the Office of the Guizhou Energy Bureau issued Opinions on Implementation of Assessment
of Gas Prevention Capability of Coal Mining Enterprises in Guizhou Province (貴州省煤礦企業瓦斯防治能力評估實施意見) (the “Opinions on Gas Prevention”). According
to the Measures on Gas Prevention and the Opinions on Gas Prevention, coal mining enterprises engaged in production and construction of mines with high gas
contents and coal and gas outburst mines in Guizhou province are required to apply for assessments of gas prevention capability. Gas prevention capability
assessments are required before applying for approval of construction projects of mines with high gas contents and coal and gas outburst mines or consolidating mines
with high gas contents and coal and gas outburst mines. Mines with high gas content and coal and gas outburst mines which fail to pass the assessments are required
to suspend their operations pending rectifications, consolidate with other mines with gas prevention capacity or close down their operations.
PRC LAWS RELATING TO TAXATION AND FEES
Pursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (中華人民共和國企業所得稅法) effective on January 1, 2008 and its implementation rules, domestic enterprises and
foreign invested enterprises are subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on taxable income.
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, enterprises are categorized as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. A resident enterprise refers to an
enterprise that is incorporated under the PRC law, or that is incorporated under the law of a jurisdiction outside the PRC with its de facto management body located
within the PRC. Pursuant to the Regulation on the Implementation of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (中華人民共和國企業所得稅法實施條例), which became
effective on January 1, 2008, a “de facto management body” is defined as a managing body that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the
production and business, personnel, accounting and assets of an enterprise. A non-resident enterprise refers to an enterprise which is incorporated under the law of a
jurisdiction outside the PRC with its de facto management body located outside of the PRC, but which has set up institutions or establishments in the PRC, or has
income originating from the PRC without setting up any institution or establishment in the PRC.
On August 21, 2006, the PRC and Hong Kong entered into an Arrangement between the Mainland of the PRC and Hong Kong for Avoidance of Double Taxation of
Income and Prevention of Income Tax Evasion (內地和香港特別行政區關於對所得避免雙重徵稅和防止偷漏稅的安排) (the “Income Tax Arrangement”). According to the

CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS
Our corporate structure resulted from the Corporation Transactions pursuant to which the corporate entities that have historically conducted our business were acquired
by Feishang and subsequently transferred to us. The Corporate Transactions were completed in July 2011 and involved three key steps:
·                  the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin;
·                  the acquisition of Guizhou Yongfu; and
·                  the acquisition of Guizhou Dayun.
As advised by our PRC legal advisors, Commerce & Finance Law Offices, we have obtained all the material approvals from the relevant authorities for our PRC
subsidiaries involved in the Corporation Transactions.
Acquisition of Guizhou Puxin
Guizhou Puxin was established in January 2009 under the laws of the PRC. In March 2010, Guizhou Fuyuantong acquired 100% of the equity interests in Guizhou Puxin
from Yangpu Jindin Industrial Co. Ltd. and Mr. Zhang Xiaofeng, each of which was an Independent Third Party, for a consideration of RMB150.0 million which
represented the registered capital of Guizhou Puxin. The consideration was fully paid by July 2011. At the time of the acquisition, Guizhou Puxin had the following five
majority-owned subsidiaries:

Dashi for a consideration of RMB1.0 million, which was determined by the tax authorities in Guizhou and was fully paid in September 2011.
84
OUR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES
As at the Latest Practicable Date, we had three other subsidiaries organized in the PRC. These subsidiaries are:
·                  Bijie Feishang, our wholly-owned subsidiary which was incorporated by Guizhou Puxin in October 2010 under the laws of the PRC. Bijie Feishang was set up
with the intention that it will hold and operate new coal mines that may be acquired by our Company subsequent to the completion of the Spin-off.
·                  Jinsha Juli, our wholly-owned subsidiary which was incorporated by Guizhou Puxin and Bijie Feishang in November 2012 under the laws of the PRC. Jinsha
Juli was involved in the preparatory work for the construction of our coal beneficiation plant in Jinsha county.
·                  Shenzhen Chixin, our wholly-owned subsidiary which was incorporated by Guizhou Puxin in July 2012 under the laws of the PRC. Shenzhen Chixin provides
management and consulting services to other companies within our Company.
INCREASE IN SHARE CAPITAL PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION
In preparation for the Distribution, the Directors passed resolutions in writing on      , 2013 to approve the following matters:
·                  change of the authorized share capital of our Company from US$50,000 divided into 50,000 ordinary shares of US$1.00 each to HK$100,000,000 divided into
1,000,000,000 Shares of HK$0.1 each;
·                  repurchase and cancellation of all issued shares of US$1.00 each from CHNR; and
·                  issue of a total of 124,554,580 Shares of HK$0.1 each to CHNR.
85
THE SPIN-OFF
On      , 2013 the CHNR Board approved a conditional special interim dividend to the CHNR Shareholders to be satisfied by way of a distribution in specie of the entire
issued share capital of our Company to all CHNR Shareholders in proportion to their respective shareholdings in CHNR on the Distribution Record Date. Pursuant to the
Distribution, each CHNR Shareholder will be entitled to five Shares for every CHNR Share held on the Distribution Record Date. After the completion of the Distribution,
CHNR will no longer hold any Shares in our Company.
The Spin-off does not involve any offering of new Shares or a public offering of any other securities and no funds will be raised pursuant to the Spin-off. The Distribution
is conditional on the Listing Committee granting listing of, and permission to deal in, our Shares in issue on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange. If such condition is
not satisfied, the Distribution will not be made and the Spin-off will not take place. Share certificates are expected to be dispatched to CHNR Shareholders on or before
     , 2013. Share certificates will only become valid if the Distribution becomes unconditional. The reasons for the Spin-off include the following:
·                  as CHNR’s base metals exploration and mining business is fundamentally different from our Company’s business, we believe the Spin-off could result in more
efficient and focused management for each of our Company and CHNR;
·                  following the Spin-off, each of our Company and CHNR may adopt more effective incentive compensation arrangements, including share-based compensation,
that are more directly tied to its performance;
·                  after the Spin-off, each of our Company and CHNR may adopt its own capital structure; and
·                  we believe that after the Spin-off, the trading price of the shares of each of our Company and CHNR may more accurately reflect its value, and any future
capital raised by our Company or CHNR may more accurately reflect such company’s cost of capital.
86
BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated, our coal resource and reserve estimates are based upon estimates made in accordance with the PRC law and were reviewed, reclassified
and substantiated by Behre Dolbear in April 2013 in accordance with the JORC Code. Unless otherwise specified, all technical data in this section are based on the
Competent Person’s Report included in Appendix III — “Competent Person’s Report.” The resource and reserve data of the Company included in this listing document
are determined by measuring the raw coal extracted from our coal mines. The characteristics of our coal products are assessed by measuring our raw coal after
beneficiation (or coal washing) as may be required under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard. See “— Our Coal Characteristics and Coal Products — Coal
Classification.”
OVERVIEW
We are a producer of anthracite coal based in Guizhou province of the PRC. We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, construction and development of anthracite
coal mines and the extraction and sale of anthracite coal. Our mining assets consist of seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four
have commenced commercial production, two are under construction and one is undergoing its pilot run phase. All of our anthracite coal mines are located in Guizhou
province, which, according to the latest report released by the SAWS, has the largest anthracite coal resources among the provinces in Southwest China as of
December 31, 2008. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our seven anthracite coal mines as of the date of this listing document other than
information regarding the total proved and probable reserves of our anthracite coal mine, which was as of April 30, 2013.

achieving certain production targets in accordance with Guizhou province’s coal mine consolidation policy.
87
As of April 30, 2013, we had total proved and probable coal reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes and total permitted annual production capacity of 2.34
million tonnes. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had revenues of RMB38.7 million, RMB105.2 million and RMB141.9 million, respectively, and sold 166,362 tonnes, 314,058
tonnes and 437,010 tonnes of anthracite coal, respectively.
The Chinese Coal Classification Standard categorizes anthracite coal into three classes based on volatile matter content and helium content. According to the
Competent Person’s Report, substantially all of our coal is classified as WY2-class or WY3-class anthracite coal under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, with
the majority being classified as WY3-class anthracite coal.
OUR STRENGTHS
We believe our principal strengths include the following:
Anthracite is a relatively scarce and valuable resource
Anthracite coal is a relatively scarce resource and accounted for approximately only 12% of the PRC’s total coal resources in 2008, according to the latest available
report of the SAWS. Due to its low volatile matter content and other characteristics, anthracite coal generally emits less harmful pollutants than other types of coal upon
combustion, and it has a wide range of industrial applications. Anthracite coal may be used as chemical coal for synthetic ammonia and methanol production, as well as
PCI coal for sintering, smelting and injection purposes in the pulverized coal injection process in iron production. Anthracite coal may also be used as thermal coal for
electric power generation as a cleaner energy source than other types of coal.
Our high quality coal reserves
As of April 30, 2013, we had total proved and probable coal reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes, substantially all of which, following beneficiation (or coal
washing) as required under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, is expected to qualify as anthracite coal under such standard. Subject to any required coal-
washing and processing to achieve the desired technical specifications, we expect all of our anthracite coal will be suitable for use as chemical coal, while our anthracite
coal from Baiping Coal Mine, Dayun Coal Mine and Yongsheng Coal Mine is expected to be suitable for use as PCI coal. Generally, chemical coal and PCI coal are able
to command significantly higher selling prices than thermal coal. According to China Coal Resource, the average selling price in Guizhou in 2012 of chemical coal, PCI
coal and thermal coal was RMB486.0 to RMB1,007.0 per tonne (depending on the type and characteristic of coal), RMB952.0 per tonne and RMB323.0 per tonne,
respectively. We believe the suitability of our anthracite coal reserves for use in higher-value industrial applications positions us well for future growth.
We are located in Guizhou province, which has one of the largest anthracite coal resources in the PRC
We believe our location in Guizhou province positions us favorably for future growth. Guizhou has one of the largest anthracite coal resources in the PRC. According to
the SAWS, Guizhou was
88
estimated to have over 50 billion tonnes of anthracite coal resources in 2008, ranking first among provinces in Southwest China and second among all provinces in the
PRC. Guizhou’s neighboring provinces and municipalities, including Guangdong, Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangxi and Chongqing, are large net consumers of anthracite coal.
According to the Fenwei, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangxi and Chongqing together purchased 25.3 million tonnes, 30.5 million tonnes
and 29.9 million tonnes, respectively, of anthracite coal from other provinces and overseas markets. Furthermore, Guizhou’s transportation network has been expanding,
and we expect that the cost and time of transporting anthracite coal to customers both within Guizhou and outside Guizhou will reduce in the future. Under the “678
Highway Network Plan” announced by the Guizhou Department of Transportation in 2009, Guizhou plans to construct a highway in each county in Guizhou and increase
its highway network by 4,500 kilometers by 2015. In addition, the Guizhou government has announced plans to construct two waterway transportation systems to
connect Yangtze River in northern Guizhou to the Pearl River in southern Guizhou by 2015.
We are well-positioned to capitalize on industry consolidation opportunities in Guizhou
In recent years, the Guizhou government has introduced a number of measures to encourage the consolidation of the coal mining industry. In particular, under the
“Twelfth Five-year Plan on the Development of the Coal Industry” and relevant notices issued by the local government authorities, the Guizhou government introduced a
number of incentives to encourage coal-mining enterprises that meet certain criteria to acquire smaller coal mines in Guizhou, including tax incentives, reduced mining
right premiums and certain subsidies for mine upgrades. Moreover, the Guizhou government announced in 2013 plans to, eliminate small-scaled coal mines in Guizhou
with an annual production capacity below 150,000 tonnes, reduce the total number of coal mining groups in Guizhou to below 100, and reduce the total number of coal
mines in Guizhou to approximately 1,000 by 2015. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to Mining Resource Consolidation.” Furthermore, in the past we have
successfully completed the acquisitions of coal mining companies that constitute part of our Company. See “History and Development — Our Corporate Transactions.”
As we are expected to become one of the non-state owned coal-mining companies in Guizhou that meet the requirements to act as a consolidator in connection with the
Guizhou’s coal industry consolidation process, we believe we are well-positioned to grow our business as a result of the Guizhou government’s coal industry
consolidation policy. See “Relationship with our Controlling Shareholders — Feishang Energy and Guizhou Puxin and their statuses as coal mine consolidators in
Guizhou.”
Experienced management team
Our management team has extensive experience in coal mine acquisition, management, construction, development, operation and safety. In particular, Mr. Li Feilie, our
chairman and chief executive officer, led the successful acquisition of each of our seven anthracite coal mines and has extensive experience in the acquisition and
corporate management of coal mines. Mr. Han Weibing, our executive Director and chief operating officer, has extensive knowledge and experience in coal mining
management and operations. Mr. Wan Huojin, our chief technical officer and chief engineer, has over 40 years of experience in coal mine development and operations,
and had acted as the head of Fengcheng Mining Bureau of Jiangxi Province between 2001 and 2007 before joining us. Mr. Wan also obtained several awards for
improvements to certain coal mining techniques he implemented and a number of awards in recognition of his contribution to the coal mining industry. Furthermore, Mr.
89
Wan and several other executive officers have extensive experience in managing mines with high gas contents and other difficult geologic conditions in Jiangxi
province. Moreover, each of Mr. Cai Zhenghui, Mr. Teng Biao, Mr. Liao Diansheng, Mr. Hu Lubao, Mr. Wu Ziping, Mr. Cheng Wenkun and Mr. Lan Xiaosheng has over
20 years or more years of relevant experience in the coal-mining industry. See “Our Directors and Senior Management.”
BUSINESS STRATEGIES
We aim to grow our business by focusing on the following strategies:
Achieve profitability through sales of higher margin chemical and PCI coal and increasing our production output
We intend to significantly increase our sales of chemical coal, as well as begin selling PCI coal. In the past, our ability to sell chemical or PCI coal has been
constrained by our production capacity. In particular, our annual coal production levels were determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s annual
guidance relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants operating in Guizhou, which took up a significant portion of our production
capacity and limited our ability to sell other types of anthracite coal. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to the Coal Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power
plants.” To increase our production capacity, we are aiming to commence commercial production at Yongsheng Coal Mine, Dayuan Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine in
November 2013, February 2014 and July 2015, respectively. Moreover, each of Yongsheng Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine is expected to have a permitted annual
production capacity of 600,000 tonnes upon commercial production, is located in close proximity to Baiping Coal Mine in Jinsha county. We believe the close proximity
of these three mines, which are expected to have an aggregate permitted annual production capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes upon commercial production, could create
significant economies of scale through the sharing of transportation, coal processing, logistics and other services.
Strengthen our sales and marketing networks
We intend to strengthen our sales and marketing network to build our reputation in the Guizhou anthracite coal market and develop a stable and loyal customer base. In
particular, we plan to deepen our existing relationships with our chemical coal customers and begin developing PCI coal customers. To date, we have entered into four
cooperation arrangements with large chemical companies located near our anthracite coal mines, and we intend to establish additional cooperation relationships by
increasing the size of our sales and marketing teams to target potential chemical coal and PCI coal customers.
Create a more vertically integrated business
We plan to construct a coal beneficiation plant in Jinsha county to process our anthracite coal into PCI coal as well as to produce chemical coal with certain technical
specifications. Construction of the first phase of the coal beneficiation plant, which is expected to have an annual coal-washing capacity of 600,000 tonnes, is expected
to be completed in 2014. We are also contemplating constructing a port along the Wujiang River near Yongsheng Coal Mine to facilitate the transportation
90
of the anthracite coal we produce at our mines in Jinsha county. Construction of the port, which is expected to have an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes, is expected
to be completed in 2014. We believe that with a more vertically integrated business model and increased capacity for coal processing and transportation, we will be able
to reduce our costs, better serve our existing customers and broaden our customer base.
Enhance our operational efficiency and cost control
We aim to improve our operational efficiency to control costs and increase profitability. We intend to upgrade our mining equipment and technology to increase our
recovery rate, adopt more efficient mining methods to reduce production costs, as well as increase our production capacity to achieve greater economies of scale. In
particular, we plan to increase the size of our coal mine tunnels to increase extraction efficiency, as well as gradually upgrade our mines to utilize mechanical longwall
mining methods to reduce labor costs. We are also seeking to adopt enhanced project management and budgeting systems to improve the efficiency of our coal mine
construction and coal production processes.
Enhance the environmental and occupational health and safety standards of our operations
We believe that it is our corporate social responsibility to improve our environmental and occupational health and safety standards. Moreover, improving our
environmental and occupational health and safety standards could also reduce the probability of fines, administrative penalties and other disruptions to our operations.
With respect to environmental protection, we plan to improve our wastewater disposal system, provide training to our employees to promote environmental awareness,
and set aside an annual budget for expenses relating to our environmental protection efforts. Regarding occupational health and safety, we are currently in the process
of implementing a six-part safety system at each of our operating coal mines which consists of the following components: an electronic safety monitoring system; a
wireless tracking system that tracks the location of our underground workers; emergency exits; emergency water supplies; emergency underground communication
equipment; and compressed air stations that provide emergency underground oxygen supplies.
Increase our anthracite coal production capacity in the long-term through mine optimization plans and acquisitions of high quality anthracite coal mines
With the exception of Gouchang Coal Mine, we are currently contemplating mine optimization plans to upgrade and expand the production capacity of all of our
anthracite coal mines by improving mine layout and upgrading mine infrastructure and equipment. We expect our optimization plans will begin in 2015 and, after their
expected completion in December 2018, we expect to be able to achieve an aggregate annual production capacity of 5.81 million tonnes. We also intend to selectively
pursue acquisitions of high quality anthracite coal reserves and coal mines in Guizhou. As we are expected to meet the requirements for a consolidator to take part in
Guizhou’s coal industry consolidation process, we intend to leverage our senior management’s experience and business networks in Guizhou to seek attractive
acquisition targets in the Bijie and Liupanshui regions of Guizhou province that may be acquired at competitive prices. See “Relationship with our Controlling
Shareholders — Feishang
91
Energy and Guizhou Puxin and their statuses as coal mine consolidators in Guizhou.” We evaluate potential acquisition targets based on factors such as the geographic
location of the mine, the quality and quantity of anthracite coal reserves, the stage of development of the mine, mining conditions, and potential synergies with our
existing business operations.
OUR COAL CHARACTERISTICS AND COAL PRODUCTS
Coal Classification
Under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, anthracite coal is defined as coal that has a volatile matter content of 10.0% or less. In the process of determining
whether the coal belongs to anthracite coal and its relevant classification, beneficiation (or coal washing) of raw coal (the result of which is referred to as “float coal”) is
required in order to reduce the dry ash contents to an acceptable level as necessary under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard. Following beneficiation of the raw
coal at each of our mines under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, all of the float coal at each of our mines may be classified as anthracite coal. The resource
and reserve data of the Company included in this listing document are determined by measuring the raw coal extracted from our coal mines.
The Chinese Coal Classification Standard categorizes anthracite coal into three classes based on volatile matter content and helium content. According to the
Competent Person Report, substantially all of our coal is classified as WY2-class or WY3-class anthracite coal under the Chinese Coal Classification Standard, with the
majority being classified as WY3-class anthracite coal.
Coal Characteristics
The commercial value of coal is determined in part by its characteristics, including:
·                  Heat Value. Heat value refers to the energy released by coal during combustion. In general, the carbon content of coal supplies most of its heat value. Heat
value is a key characteristic in the determination of coal quality.
·                  Moisture Content. Moisture content of coal varies by the type of coal, the region where it is mined and the location of the coal within a seam. In general, coal
with lower moisture content is more valuable, as moisture content decreases the heat value and increases the weight of the coal, thereby making it more expensive to
transport.
·                  Sulfur Content. The PRC has regulations that limit the amount of sulfur dioxide that may be emitted as a result of combustion, and the chemical composition
and concentration of sulfur in coal affects the amount of sulfur dioxide produced in combustion. Coal-fueled power plants may reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by
burning coal with low sulfur content. As a result, coal with lower sulfur content is generally more valuable than coal with high sulfur content. Coal-washing and
processing may reduce the sulfur content of coal.
92
·                  Ash Content. Ash is the inorganic residue remaining after the combustion of coal. Ash content is an important characteristic of coal because it impacts boiler
performance of electric generating plants and determines the suitability of the coal for end users.
·                  Volatile Matter Content. Volatile matter refers to the matters that are released from coal at high temperatures, other than moisture. Under the Chinese Coal
Classification Standard, coal is classified into lignite coal, sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal and anthracite coal based on volatile matter content.
The following table sets forth the weighted average coal quality of our proved and probable coal reserves at each of our mines other than information regarding volatile
matter content, which was based on simple average coal quality:

Coal Products
In the PRC, end users generally characterize anthracite coal as thermal coal, chemical coal or PCI coal. Thermal coal is generally used in the electric power industry for
power generation and in the construction industry for cement production. Chemical coal is generally used for the production of synthetic ammonia and methanol, and
PCI coal is generally used for sintering, smelting and injection purposes in the pulverized coal injection process in iron production. While certain types of anthracite coal
may be sold directly as chemical coal without coal-washing, other types of anthracite coal need to be washed and processed before they may be sold as chemical coal
in order to achieve appropriate technical specifications, including heat value, moisture content, ash content and sulfur content. In contrast, in order to be sold as PCI
coal, anthracite coal must first be washed and processed. In the PRC, chemical coal and PCI coal are able to generally command higher selling prices and higher profit
margins than thermal coal. According to China Coal Resource, the average selling price of thermal coal in Guizhou in 2012 was RMB323.0 per tonne, compared to
RMB486.0 to RMB1,007.0 per tonne for chemical coal (depending on the type and characteristic of coal) and RMB952.0 per tonne for PCI coal.
93
Subject to having been washed and processed to the extent necessary, we expect all of our anthracite coal will be suitable to be sold as thermal coal and chemical
coal, while the anthracite coal produced from our Baiping Coal Mine, Dayun Coal Mine and Yongsheng Coal Mine is expected to be suitable to be sold as PCI coal.
Prior to 2011, we sold substantially all of the coal produced from our mines as thermal coal. In each of 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 5% of our revenue from
the sale of chemical coal we produced, while our remaining revenue in each of these years was derived from the sale of thermal coal we produced and coal sourced
from third parties. Subject to market conditions, we intend to significantly increase our sales of chemical coal in the future and begin selling PCI coal in 2014. We have
entered into a memorandum of understanding with the People’s Government of Jinsha county in Guizhou province to construct a coal beneficiation plant to process our
coal into PCI coal and to produce chemical coal with certain technical specifications. Construction of the first phase of the coal beneficiation plant is expected to be
completed in 2014 and have an annual coal-washing capacity of 600,000 tonnes. We also plan to outsource coal processing to third party coal beneficiation plants as
necessary.
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we have entered into four non-binding cooperation arrangements relating to the sale of chemical coal, but we have not yet entered into
any binding agreement for the sale of chemical coal or PCI coal. Our annual coal production levels were determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s
annual guidance relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants in Guizhou, which has taken up a significant portion of our
production capacity. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to the Coal Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power plants.” We believe that by increasing our production
capacity, we will be able to sell a larger percentage of our anthracite coal as chemical or PCI coal. Our ability to effectively produce, market and sell our anthracite coal
as chemical coal or PCI coal is, however, subject to a number of uncertainties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We may not be able to
successfully produce, market and sell chemical and PCI coal, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and prospects.”
During the Track Record Period, we derived our revenue primarily from the sale of coal we produced. From time to time, we also engaged in coal trading activities by
selling coal that we purchased from third party suppliers. In 2011 and 2012, revenue from sales of third party coal was RMB33.1 million and RMB1.1 million,
respectively, representing 31.5% and 0.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. We did not engage in any coal trading activities in 2010, and we do not intend to engage
in any significant coal trading activities in the future.
OUR ANTHRACITE COAL MINES
We currently have seven anthracite coal mines. Four of our anthracite coal mines, including Baiping Coal Mine, Liujiaba Coal Mine, Zhulinzhai Coal Mine and Gouchang
Coal Mine, have commenced commercial production. However, operations at Gouchang Coal Mine have been suspended since March 2013 under Guizhou province’s
coal mine consolidation policy. With respect to our other three anthracite coal mines that have not commenced commercial production, Yongsheng
94
Coal Mine is currently undergoing its pilot run phase, while Dayuan Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine are currently under construction. Yongsheng Coal Mine, Dayuan
Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine are expected to commence commercial production in November 2013, February 2014 and July 2015, respectively.
All of our anthracite coal mines are underground anthracite coal mines located in the Zhina Coal District and the Qianbei Coal District in Guizhou province. The following
maps show the location of our anthracite coal mines as of the date of this listing document:

Mines in commercial production
Baiping Coal Mine
Baiping Coal Mine is our third largest mine as measured by proved and probable coal reserves. We operate Baiping Coal Mine through our 70%-owned subsidiary,
Baiping Mining. Baiping Coal Mine covers an area of 3.0143 square kilometers and is located in Jinsha county, Qianbei Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Baiping Coal
Mine had total proved and probable coal reserves of 22.55 million tonnes.
Baiping Coal Mine commenced commercial production in June 2009 and completed a technical system upgrade in March 2011. The current mining right permit for
Baiping Coal Mine allows for an annual production capacity of 150,000 tonnes. The mining right premium of RMB3.4 million for Baiping Coal Mine had been fully paid as
of December 31, 2010.
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, Baiping Coal Mine produced 65,046 tonnes, 159,185 tonnes and 292,000 tonnes of anthracite coal, respectively. In 2011 and 2012, the amount
of anthracite coal produced by Baiping Coal Mine exceeded its permitted annual production capacity of 150,000 tonnes under its mining right permit and coal production
permit. In 2013, we received confirmation letters from the relevant Guizhou government authority stating that it did not consider there was any over-production prior to
2012, and that it would not impose any penalties against Baiping Mining or its employees or impose any other measures (including but not limited to, revocation of the
coal production permit or suspension of coal mining operations) in respect of over-production in 2012 or thereafter, and that it would support our application for the
relevant permits with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes or more. We plan to continue producing anthracite coal at Baiping Coal Mine, and may produce
anthracite coal in excess of its permitted production capacity as our annual production levels were determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s annual
guidance relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants operating in Guizhou. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to the Coal
Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power plants.” Any change in the policies or positions adopted by the Guizhou government authorities in respect of over-production
and target production capacities to produce and sell a minimum amount of thermal coal may affect these plans as well as our compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations. We have applied for a 300,000 tonnes mining right permit for Baiping Coal Mine and we expect to obtain the permit in 2014. See “— Regulatory
Compliance.” After receiving such permit, we do not expect Baiping Coal Mine will continue to produce anthracite coal in excess of its permitted production capacity.
Liujiaba Coal Mine
We operate Liujiaba Coal Mine through our 99%-owned subsidiary, Xinsong Coal. Liujiaba Coal Mine covers an area of 3.7891 square kilometers and is located in Liuzhi
Special District, Zhina Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Liujiaba Coal Mine had total proved and probable coal reserves of 13.92 million tonnes. Commencement of
commercial production at Liujiaba Mine had been delayed as a result of Guizhou’s requirement for certain coal mines using drilling and blasting mining methods to
upgrade to semi-mechanical longwall mining methods in 2012, which required us to incur significant
97
time and expense to redesign and upgrade Liujiaba Coal Mine. Liujiaba Coal Mine commenced commercial production in December 2012 with a permitted annual
production capacity of 300,000 tonnes. The mining right premium of RMB26.0 million for Liujiaba Coal Mine had been fully paid by May 2011. Liujiaba Coal Mine
produced 25,680 tonnes of anthracite coal in 2012.
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
We operate Zhulinzhai Coal Mine through our 99%-owned subsidiary, Linjiaao Coal. Zhulinzhai Coal Mine covers an area of 1.4104 square kilometers and is located in
Liuzhi Special District, Zhina Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Zhulinzhai Coal Mine had total proved and probable coal reserves of 9.58 million tonnes. Zhulinzhai Coal
Mine commenced commercial production in April 2012 with a permitted annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes. The mining right premium for Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
is RMB19.9 million, of which RMB16.7 million had been paid by August 30, 2012 and the remaining balance of RMB3.2 million will be payable in August 2013.
Coal production at Zhulinzhai Coal Mine has been slowed down by the relocation of local residents affected by the mine’s operations, and produced only 65,111 tonnes
of anthracite coal in 2012. Moreover, since January 2013, Zhulinzhai Coal Mine has been undergoing certain mine safety upgrades, which has limited its production
output.
Gouchang Coal Mine
We operate Gouchang Coal Mine through our 99%-owned subsidiary, Gouchang Coal. Gouchang Coal Mine covers an area of 1.7198 square kilometers and is located in
Nayong county, Zhina Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Gouchang Coal Mine had total proved and probable coal reserves of 5.72 million tonnes. Gouchang Coal Mine
commenced commercial production in April 2011 with a permitted annual production capacity of 90,000 tonnes, and produced 96,068 tonnes and 53,362 tonnes of
anthracite coal in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The mining right premium of RMB11.8 million for Gouchang Coal Mine had been fully paid as of May 2012.
Gouchang Coal Mine suspended its operations from March to August 2012 to comply with certain newly implemented mine gas control requirements in Guizhou. Since
March 2013, operations at Gouchang Coal Mine have been suspended under Guizhou province’s coal mine consolidation policy pending the acquisition by us of a
nearby coal mine and Gouchang Coal Mine achieving certain production capacity targets in accordance with Guizhou province’s coal mine consolidation policy. As of
the Latest Practicable Date, Gouchang Coal Mine has not re-commenced operations. See “Regulation — PRC Laws Relating to Mining Resource Consolidation.”
Mines under construction
Yongsheng Coal Mine
Yongsheng Coal Mine is our second largest mine as measured by proved and probable coal reserves. We hold Yongsheng Coal Mine through our 70%-owned
subsidiary, Guizhou Yongfu.
98
Yongsheng Coal Mine covers an area of 18.2340 square kilometers and is located in the Qianbei Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Yongsheng Coal Mine had total
proved and probable coal reserves of 52.96 million tonnes. The current mining right permit for Yongsheng Coal Mine allows for an annual production capacity of 600,000
tonnes.
The construction of Yongsheng Coal Mine commenced in 2008. Construction progress had been delayed in 2012 mainly because we encountered several large karst
caves at the mine site, which slowed down construction. Yongsheng Coal Mine is currently undergoing its pilot run phase, and commercial production is expected to
commence in November 2013.
The mining right premium for Yongsheng Coal Mine is RMB89.5 million, of which RMB36.0 million had been paid by December 2012. The balance of RMB53.5 million
will be payable in five installments over a five-year period from 2013 to 2017.
Dayuan Coal Mine
We hold Dayuan Coal Mine through our 99%-owned subsidiary, Dayuan Coal. As of April 30, 2013, Dayuan Coal Mine had total proved and probable coal reserves of
8.26 million tonnes. The current mining right permit for Dayuan Coal Mine allows for an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes. The mining right premium of
RMB13.4 million for Dayuan Coal Mine had been fully paid as of October 2011.
The construction of Dayuan Coal Mine commenced in June 2009 and commercial production is expected to commence in February 2014. Construction progress of
Dayuan Coal Mine had been delayed as its approval process was delayed by certain changes in the governmental approval process for obtaining mining right permits.
Dayun Coal Mine
Dayun Coal Mine is our largest mine as measured by proved and probable coal reserves. We hold Dayun Coal Mine through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Guizhou
Dayun. Dayun Coal Mine covers an area of 16.9035 square kilometers and is located in Jinsha county, Qianbei Coal District. As of April 30, 2013, Dayun Coal Mine had
total proved and probable reserves of 97.29 million tonnes. The current mining right permit for Dayun Coal Mine allows for an annual production capacity of 600,000
tonnes.
The construction of Dayun Coal Mine commenced in May 2012 and commercial production is expected to commence in July 2015. Construction progress of Dayun Coal
Mine has been slowed down by the relocation of local residents affected by the mine’s construction. We expect the relocation process will be completed by the end of
2013.
The mining right premium for Dayun Coal Mine is RMB73.0 million, of which RMB38.0 million had been paid by March 2013 and the remaining balance of RMB35.0
million will be payable in three installments over a three-year period from 2014 to 2016.

OPTIMIZATION PLANS
In order to increase our production capacity, we plan to optimize all of our currently operating anthracite coal mines by improving mine layout and upgrading mine
infrastructure and equipment. We expect our optimization plans will begin in 2015 and, after their expected completion in December 2018, we expect to be able to
achieve an aggregate annual production capacity of 5.81 million tonnes. The estimated cost of the optimization plans is RMB807.5 million.
MINING RIGHTS AND OTHER PERMITS
Under PRC law, prior to June 29, 2013, each coal mine in the PRC must obtain certain permits prior to commencing commercial production, including the following key
permits:
·                                          a mining right permit;
·                                          a safe production permit; and
·                                          a coal production permit.
Typically, the safe production permit and the coal production permit will not be issued until the mining right permit has been issued, a pilot run of one to six months
following the completion of construction of the coal mine has been completed and the relevant government authorities have completed certain safety inspections. In
addition to these permits, prior to commencing commercial production, coal mines in the PRC are required to complete an environmental trial run and an environmental
acceptance inspection. In Guizhou, in general, mining right permits are issued by the Guizhou Provincial Department of Land and Resources, safe production permits
are issued by the Guizhou Administration of Coal Mine Safety and coal production permits are issued by the Energy Bureau of Guizhou Province. Once a mining right
permit has been issued, mining right premiums will be payable by the permit holder to the relevant land and resources authorities pursuant to an installment payment
plan with the authorities.
Effective on June 29, 2013, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed certain amendments to the Coal Law which among other thing, removed the
requirement of obtaining coal production permits. Detailed implementation rules have not yet been promulgated.

(1)                                     In 2011 and 2012, the actual production output of Baiping Coal Mine exceeded its permitted annual production capacity under its mining right permit and coal production permit. See “—
Our Anthracite Coal Mines — Mines in Commercial Production — Baiping Coal Mine.” We have applied for a mining right permit with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes for Baiping Coal Mine by
2013 and we expect to obtain such permit in 2014.
(2)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank.
(3)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Minsheng Bank and Bank of China.
(4)                                     The mining right has been pledged to China Merchants Bank.
(5)                                     The National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed certain amendments to the Coal Law, which became effective on June 29, 2013, including removing the requirement of
obtaining coal production permits.
Under the relevant mineral resources regulations of the PRC, if residual coal reserves which have been recorded with relevant land and resource authorities remain after
the term of a mining right permit expires, the holder of the mining right may, subject to certain conditions, apply for an extension of the mining right permit. There is no
minimum residual reserve requirement for the extension of mining right permits. If any of our mines has any residual coal reserves when the relevant mining right permit
expires, we intend to submit an application to renew the mining right permit. Commerce & Finance Law Offices, our PRC legal advisors, have advised us that, provided
that the current PRC laws, regulations and mining industry policies remain unchanged and we have complied with all substantive and procedural requirements under the
PRC laws, rules and regulations, as well as all requests of the competent authorities at the relevant time, there would not be material legal impediments in renewing our
mining right permits.
MINING OPERATIONS AND PROCESSES
The following diagram illustrates the main processes in our mining operations.
102
Mine construction
The three main stages of mine construction include:
·                                          Pre-construction work. Pre-construction work provides the foundation for future mine construction and planning for overall construction
management, and includes leveling the land on which the mine is located and stripping the topsoil, and connecting the land to the water, electricity, road transportation
and telecommunications networks.
·                                          Shaft engineering and civil engineering. After pre-construction work has been completed, we begin constructing inclined mine shafts to reach the
coal seams. We use a number of shaft engineering and civil engineering techniques in constructing our mine shaft, including drilling and blasting and slagging and
tunneling techniques. We primarily use shotcrete and rock bolt techniques to support our shaft walls.
·                                          Electrical equipment installation and complementary production system engineering: Concurrent with shaft engineering and civil engineering, we
install electrical equipment and complementary production systems, including the power supply system, draft system, drainage system, pressure ventilation system,
elevation and transportation system, gas drainage system and monitoring system.
We have entered into agreements with third party contractors for the construction of our anthracite coal mines. See “— Suppliers, Third Party Contractors and Utilities.”
Depending on the
103
mine design plan and the technical standards, it generally takes two to five years to complete the construction of an anthracite coal mine. Prior to the full
commencement of commercial production, we may be able to produce and sell a limited amount of coal produced during mine construction process.
Coal extraction
Each of our anthracite coal mines currently utilizes manual longwall mining, semi-mechanical longwall mining or mechanical longwall mining methods to extract coal.
Longwall mining refers to extracting coal from long rectangular blocks of the coal seams. Manual longwall mining refers to drilling holes in the mining face, placing
explosives and detonating the explosives to extract the coal. Mechanical and semi-mechanical longwall mining involve using a mechanical shearers in coal extraction.
Coal that has been extracted by the mechanical shearer is then loaded on to a mine conveyor system for delivery to the surface. In mechanical longwall mining, the
mine roof is held up during the extraction process by automatic hydraulic roof supports, while in semi-mechanical longwall mining, the mine roof is held up hydraulic roof
supports that are operated manually. The time required for coal extraction depends primarily on the nature of the mine, including the amount of anthracite coal reserves,
the mining method adopted, the geological conditions of the mine and the size of the mining face. We generally transport the anthracite coal extracted from our mines to
the ground surface on a daily basis. The following table sets forth the current extraction method of each of our anthracite coal mines:

Our mining operations seek to ensure that waste gas, waste water and industrial residue are disposed of in accordance with the relevant legal requirements of the PRC.
In addition, we are required by PRC law to reclaim and restore mining sites to their prior condition after completion of mining operations. Reclamation activity typically
involves the removal of buildings, equipment, machinery and other physical remnants of mining, the restoration of land features in mined-out areas, dumping sites and
other mining area, and the contouring, covering and re-vegetation of waste rock piles and other disturbed areas. We expect the waste disposal and reclamation process
will take approximately six months to complete.
104
Cash Operating Costs
Our cash operating costs consist primarily of wages and labor, costs of materials, power and maintenance. Set forth below are our cash operating costs of our coal
mines that were in commercial production in 2012. See Appendix III — “Competent Person’s Report.”

We currently sell most of our anthracite coal as thermal coal to power producers in Guizhou province. We also sell a small amount of our anthracite coal to chemical
plants. As we have not entered into any long-term sales contracts, we sell our anthracite coal in the spot market. We generally price our anthracite coal based on the
prevailing market prices in Guizhou, the anthracite coal type and quality, and our sales volume and the length of our relationship with the customer. The market prices of
anthracite coal have a significant effect on our average selling price. See “Financial Information — Market Risk Disclosure — Commodity Price Risk.” In 2010, 2011,
2012, the average selling price of the anthracite coal we produced was RMB232.4, RMB296.4 and RMB323.6 per tonne, respectively.
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 66.6%, 73.5% and 56.7%, respectively, of our total revenue and our largest customer
accounted for approximately 29.7%, 29.2% and 24.1%, respectively, of our total revenue. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, five, four and four of our five largest customers were
power producers purchasing thermal coal from us, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the length of our relationships with five largest customers ranged from one to
five years. Prior to 2011, we derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale of thermal coal. We believe that by increasing our sales of chemical coal and
beginning selling PCI coal, we may be able to reduce our dependency on a limited group of large customers. None of our Directors, their associates or our Shareholders
are related to or owns any interest in any of our five largest customers.
As of December 31, 2012, we had a dedicated sales and marketing team consisting of 12 employees. Our sales and marketing team is responsible for establishing
sales networks, providing customer support and collecting payments from customers.
105
COAL TRANSPORTATION
Substantially all of the anthracite coal we sell is transported to our customers by road. Most of our customers request us to arrange for transportation, in which case we
generally invoice them for the cost of transportation on a cost-plus basis over the mine gate price of our anthracite coal, which is the sales price of anthracite coal sold
at the producing mine. We have not entered into any long-term contracts with the providers of transportation services. All of our anthracite coal mines are accessible by
road.
We are contemplating the construction of a port along the Wujiang River, which is approximately one kilometer away from Yongsheng Coal Mine. Upon completion, the
port is expected to allow us to transport the coal produced by Yongsheng Coal Mine by waterway, as well as provide us access to key railway stations located along the
Wujiang River.
Prior to the Latest Practicable Date, we did not experience any transportation disruptions that had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
SUPPLIERS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS AND UTILITIES
The main suppliers for our mining operations include third party contractors and suppliers of ancillary materials used in our mining operations. In 2010, 2011 and 2012,
our purchases from our five largest suppliers were approximately RMB98.2 million, RMB109.0 million and RMB127.7 million, respectively, representing approximately
57.1%, 49.8% and 42.5%, respectively, of our total purchases. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19.3%, 18.2% and 15.7%,
respectively, of our total purchases. Each of our five largest suppliers is a third party contractor. As of the Latest Practicable Date, none of our Directors, their
associates or our Shareholders are related to or owns any interest in any of the five largest suppliers.
Third Party Contractors
We enter into agreements with third party contractors for the construction of our coal mines from time to time. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had 14, 20 and 28 third party
contractors, respectively. Each of these third party contractors is an Independent Third Party, and, to our knowledge, each of them have the relevant licenses and
permits to conduct the activities for which they are engaged except for one individual third party contractor we engaged in 2012. We subsequently discontinued our
engagement of such individual third party contractor in 2013. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our purchases from our contractors were RMB104.8 million, RMB145.5 million and
RMB144.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, our relationships with third party contractors ranged from one to five years.
We select our contractors through a bidding process to ensure that our contracts are entered into on competitive terms. In the bidding process, we focus on the bidders’
skills, expertise, experience and reputation, in addition to the bidding price. Our contracts with third party contractors typically require our contractors to comply with
applicable laws, rules and regulations as well as our technical and safety standards, and that they perform their work under our supervision. Moreover, our contracts with
third party contractors typically require the contractor to bear all losses or liabilities incurred as a
106
result of the contractors’ failure to maintain proper safety standards. We generally pay our contractors on a monthly basis based on the percentage of work they have
completed. Upon the completion of work by our contractors, we carry out detailed inspection prior to acceptance of the work. During the Track Record Period, we did not
experience any material suspensions or delays in mine construction as a result of any sub-standard work or improper act of our contractors. If any of our existing third
party contractors discontinues their services, we believe we will be able to engage a replacement contractor on similar terms and conditions.
As advised by our PRC legal advisors, we are not required to purchase social insurance for the employees of the contractors as they are not considered to be our
employees under the applicable PRC laws and regulations. We do not maintain any insurance policy to cover possible losses, damage or costs resulting from accidents,
fault or omission of the contractors and its employees.
Suppliers of Ancillary Materials
The key ancillary materials used in our mining operations include replacement parts, steel, cement, explosives, fuel and lubricants. We generally do not enter into long-
term supply agreements with respect to our ancillary materials and we are not dependent on any single supplier. We typically select the supplier based on various
factors, including the quality and safety standard of their products, their ability to reliably meet our supply requirements, their credit terms and their after-sales service.
We have not experienced any shortage of supplies during the Track Record Period.
Utilities
We consume a significant amount of electricity at our mining operations. All of our anthracite coal mines receive power supply from the China Southern power grid. We
have not experienced any significant interruptions in our electricity supply during the Track Record Period.
We obtain water for our mining operations from surface and subsurface supplies, including rivers, reservoirs and springs. We also reuse water discharged during our
mining operations, and filter and reuse waste water in our anthracite coal production activities. We have not experienced any significant interruptions in our water supply
during the Track Record Period.
We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to manage fluctuations in the prices of supplies and raw materials. Whether we can pass on significant increases in
the cost of supplies and raw materials will depend on market conditions.
COAL TRADING
In addition to selling anthracite coal produced from our mines, we have from time to time engaged in coal trading activities by selling coal that we purchased from third
party suppliers since January 2011. In 2011 and 2012, revenue from sales of third party coal was RMB33.1 million and RMB1.1 million, respectively, representing 31.5%
and 0.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. We do not expect sales of third party coal to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future.
107
COMPETITION
The PRC anthracite coal market is highly fragmented. We primarily compete with other anthracite coal enterprises in Guizhou. Competitive factors in the PRC anthracite
coal industry include coal quality and characteristics, stability of supply, pricing, availability and cost of transportation, reliability and timeliness of delivery and customer
service. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Competition in the PRC coal industry is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete effectively.”
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others, gas and water emissions, hazardous substances and waste
management. See “Regulation — PRC Laws Relating to Environmental Protection.” According to the relevant PRC laws and regulations governing land reclamation, coal
enterprises are required to restore the land that has been damaged by coal mining operations. See “Regulation — PRC Laws Relating to Environmental Protection —
Regulations On Land Reclamation and Its Implementing Measures.” We set aside restricted cash and place cash with the relevant government authorities for the
purpose of our future environmental rehabilitation obligations as well as the settlement of asset retirement obligations. See “Financial Information — Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates — Provision for Asset Retirement Obligations.”
Except as disclosed in this listing document, we have not committed any material breaches of any environmental laws, rules or regulations applicable to us. Our
environmental protection systems and facilities comply with applicable PRC national and local environmental protection laws, rules and regulations. As of the Latest
Practicable Date, we were not subject to any material environmental claims, lawsuits, penalties or disciplinary actions.
We emphasize environmental protection at our operations and have made significant financial commitments towards the construction of environmental protection
facilities and the establishment of a sound environmental protection management and monitoring system. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our cost of compliance with
applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations were approximately RMB6.6 million, RMB8.3 million and RMB11.6 million, respectively. In 2013, we expect to
spend an additional RMB19.2 million for compliance with environmental obligations.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to reducing our employee fatality rate and maintaining high safety standards at our anthracite coal mines. We have implemented a number of
occupational health and safety measures to ensure compliance with PRC regulatory requirements. We have installed methane gas drainage facilities and mine fans at
all of our anthracite coal mines in commercial production, and each of our anthracite coal mines in commercial production has a 24-hour control room to monitor mine
conditions, a rescue room to facilitate the rescue and recovery of victims in the event of mine accidents and a safety management team that performs regular safety
and inspections. All of our mine safety managers are experienced personnel with the relevant safety and management qualifications issued by the Guizhou government.
We also have an internal safety management manual for mine
108
operations and have adopted detailed safety procedures pursuant to the State Coal Mine Safety Guidelines. We conduct regular safety training sessions for our
employees, including mine managers, methane inspectors, blasters, electricians, coal miners and other workers, to improve their safety awareness and knowledge, and
we also arrange periodic health checks for our employees. We are currently in the process of implementing a six-part safety system at each of our operating coal mines
consisting of the following components: an electronic safety monitoring system; a wireless tracking system that tracks the location of our underground workers;
emergency exits; emergency water supplies; emergency underground communication equipment; and compressed air stations that provide emergency underground
oxygen supplies.
In 2010, we had separate accidents involving three employee fatalities at our anthracite coal mines, representing a fatality rate of 17.7 fatalities per million tonnes of
coal produced. These fatalities occurred at Baiping Coal Mine, Gouchang Coal Mine and Dayuan Coal Mine and involved violations of our work safety rules by the
employees. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Accidents at our coal mines or neighboring coal mines could materially disrupt our business and
operations and damage our reputation.” Since the accidents in 2010, we did not have any additional employee fatalities at our anthracite coal mines. According to the
SAWS, the average coal mine fatality rates in the PRC in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were 0.749, 0.564 and 0.374 fatalities per million tonnes of coal produced, respectively.
During the Track Record Period, we did not experience any incidents whereby production at any of our anthracite coal mines was suspended due to safety issues
regarding our own operations.
In 2011, the municipal government of Jinsha county selected our “culture corridor” at Baiping Coal Mine as a model facility for the promotion of safety. The “culture
corridor” is a hallway in the mine with various safety instructions, procedures and reminders posted on the walls. In addition, Yongsheng Coal Mine received the
“Advanced Enterprise for Work Safety in 2012” award from Jinsha county and our chief manager of Baiping Coal Mine also received the “Best Work Safety Employee in
2012” award from Jinsha county.
RISK MANAGEMENT
We plan to adopt a risk management policy after the Listing to manage our operational risks. Under our risk management policy, our key risk management objectives
include:
·                                          developing a comprehensive risk management strategy for our Company;
·                                          recognizing different types of risks and developing appropriate risk management strategies based on the type of risk;
·                                          identifying, monitoring and managing risk and our risk tolerance level; and
·                                          balancing risk management with the development of our Company.
109
Under our risk management policy, our Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the key risk management principles and objectives, while our chief executive
officer is responsible for establishing risk management measures and reviewing material risks within our Company. We have established a compliance and audit
department which is expected to be responsible for implementing our risk management efforts, and each of our operating PRC subsidiaries has a designated risk
management department which is expected to be responsible for coordinating and supervising our risk management efforts within the subsidiary.
QUALITY CONTROL
To ensure that our anthracite coal meets the requirements of our customers, we have established three laboratories to test the quality of our coal. The laboratories are
staffed by six quality control employees responsible for monitoring our anthracite coal production process, conducting inspection and testing of our anthracite coal and
performing on-site inspections at our anthracite coal mines.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We did not incur any significant amounts on company-sponsored research or development activities during the Track Record Period.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that our operation is not materially dependent on our ownership of any intellectual property rights. We have submitted three applications with the Trade Marks
Registry of Hong Kong for registration. See “Appendix V — Statutory and General Information — (e) Further Information About Our Business — B. Intellectual Property
Rights.”
PROPERTIES
Owned properties
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we owned three properties with a total gross floor area of 865.9 square meters, all of which are used as office space. We have
obtained building ownership certificates and the related land use right certificates for each of these properties. All of these properties are located in Guizhou.
As of the Latest Practicable Date, the carrying amount of our property interests was RMB10.0 million, representing less than 15% of our total assets. A summary of
material properties prepared by Peak Vision Appraisals Limited, an independent property valuation company, is set forth in Appendix V — “Statutory and General
Information — (h) Material Properties.”
110
Temporary structures
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we constructed 128 temporary structures with a total gross floor area of 61,686.0 square meters within the areas of our seven
anthracite coal mines for use in our mining operations. We have obtained the relevant confirmation letters issued by the local authorities confirming that they will not
impose any penalties in connection with the construction of these temporary structures, and that our subsidiaries may continue to use the temporary structures in
accordance with the current uses.
Leased properties
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we leased six properties (including two rent free properties) with a total gross floor area of approximately 597.5 square meters in
Guizhou, Hainan and Shenzhen for uses as office space. The leases underlying these properties have certain defects:
·                                          The lessors of five of these properties do not have the relevant building ownership certificates. If the lessors do not have lawful rights to these
properties, we may not be able to continue to occupy and use such properties.
·                                          The lease agreements of three of these properties have not been registered with the relevant PRC authorities, which may result in correction
orders by the relevant authorities and subject us to a fine of RMB1,000 to RMB10,000.
·                                          Two of these properties are residential properties. Our use of these properties as office space without obtaining relevant consents may subject us
to correction orders by the relevant authorities and a daily fine of RMB5 to RMB20 per square meter.
Our Directors do not believe that these four properties are critical to our operations.
With respect to the land for our anthracite coal mines, we have leased 19 parcels of collectively-owned land with a total site area of approximately 470,821.0 square
meters. These parcels of land cover all of our anthracite coal mines. Although in general the term of the leases is approximately 20 years with renewal right exercisable
by us, our use of these properties for coal mining is subject to the Guizhou government’s approval, and each approval is generally valid for only one to two years and
must be renewed thereafter. We have already obtained the relevant approvals for all 19 parcels of leased land, and we have also obtained confirmation letters from the
relevant government authorities in Guizhou confirming that they will not revoke their approval and that they will, upon the expiration of the current approvals, grant
additional approvals for our continued use of the leased land for coal mining. Our PRC legal advisors, Commerce & Finance Law Offices, have advised that we are
entitled to use these 19 parcels of leased land for coal mining in accordance with the terms in the relevant leases, approvals and confirmation letters.
111
We are in the process of obtaining the land use right certificates for the land we use in Dayun Coal Mine, which cover a total area of 132,490.0 square meters. We have
obtained the relevant confirmation letter from the relevant government authority in Guizhou confirming that the relevant land requisition is being processed and the
authority did not anticipate any material legal impediments in obtaining the land use right.
INSURANCE
We make social insurance contributions and carry basic occupational injury, medical, pension, unemployment and maternity insurance for our employees. In line with
what we believe to be industry practice, we do not maintain any fire, liability or other property insurance covering our properties, equipment or inventories, and we do not
carry any business interruption insurance, transportation insurance or third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injuries or property or
environmental damage arising from accidents on our properties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Our coal mining operations may be materially
and adversely affected by operational risks and natural disasters for which we have limited insurance.”

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Sets forth below is a summary of our material non-compliance incidents during the Track Record Period:
Non-Compliance 
In 2012, Baiping Coal Mine produced 292,000 tonnes of anthracite
coal, which significantly exceeded its annual production capacity of
150,000 tonnes as permitted under its mining right permit and coal
production permit.
Reason
The over-production was due to our
annual production levels being
determined based in large part on
the Guizhou government’s annual
guidance relating to the provision of
certain minimum amounts of thermal
coal to power plants operating in
Guizhou.
Legal Consequences/
Potential Maximum Penalties
A coal mine that produces coal in
excess of its permitted annual
production capacity may be subject
to administrative penalties, including
a fine of up to RMB2.0 million on the
relevant coal mine, a fine of up to
RMB150,000 on the mine manager
and, in serious cases, revocation of
the coal production permit and the
mine manager’s qualification
certification, as well as mine closure.
Rectification Actions/Preventive Measures
·                    In January and July 2013, the relevant
Guizhou government authority issued confirmation
letters stating that it would not impose any penalties
or other measures (including but not limited to
revocation of the coal production permit or
suspension of coal mining operations) against
Baiping Mining or its employees in respect of any
over-production in 2012 or thereafter, and that it
would support our application for the relevant
permits with an annual production capacity of
300,000 tonnes or more. We plan to continue
producing anthracite coal at Baiping Coal Mine, and
may produce anthracite coal in excess of its
permitted production capacity as our annual
production levels were determined based in large
part on the Guizhou government’s annual guidance
relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts
of thermal coal to power plants operating in
Guizhou. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to
the Coal Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power
plants.” Our PRC legal advisors, Commerce &
Finance Law Offices, have advised us that such
confirmation letters were issued by the competent
government authority and are legally valid. We have

Commerce & Finance Law Offices, have advised us that such
confirmation letters were issued by the competent government
authorities and are legally valid.
·                    Prior to commencing commercial production at each of
these four anthracite coal mines, we have undertaken to the Guizhou
Energy Bureau that we will comply with all relevant environmental laws,
rules and regulations or apply for environmental acceptance
inspections immediately following our completion of inspections for
obtaining coal production permits. We are in the process of applying for
environmental acceptance inspections for each of our coal mines that
has commenced commercial production, with the exception of
Gouchang Coal Mine, which has suspended operations. We have not
received any indication that our application for such acceptance
inspections will not be approved.

As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had 1,048, 1,139 and 1,656 employees, respectively. In order to reduce administration cost as well as due to the
suspension of the operations of Gouchang Coal Mine, we significantly reduced the number of our employees and started using mining workers provided by a third party
labor agency since March 2013.
As we believe having a well-trained and motivated workforce is important to our business, we have adopted a recruitment policy that aims to attract and retain motivated
and qualified employees. Our mining employees receive training through orientation training sessions as well as on-the-job training by our more experienced technical
personnel. Moreover, our coal mine managers receive additional technical and managerial training, and we offer certain of our employees the opportunity to attend
external training sessions held by colleges and governmental organizations.
Our employees are employed under employment contracts that set forth, among other things, the employee’s responsibilities, remuneration and grounds for termination
of employment.
In addition to our own employees, we entered into an arrangement with a third party labor agency in March 2013 to provide mining workers. These workers are employed
by the labor agency but are compensated and supervised directly by us. As of June 30, 2013, we had 893 workers provided by the third party labor agency.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as
included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company,” which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The following discussion
and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-
looking statements due to various factors, including those set forth under the sections “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this listing
document.
OVERVIEW
We are a producer of anthracite coal based in Guizhou province of the PRC. We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, construction and development of anthracite
coal mines and the extraction and sale of anthracite coal. Our mining assets consist of seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four
have commenced commercial production. In particular:
·                                          Baiping Coal Mine, Liujiaba Coal Mine and Zhulinzhai Coal Mine are in commercial production;
·                                          Gouchang Coal Mine has commenced commercial production, but its operations have been suspended since March 2013 under the Guizhou
government’s mine consolidation policy;
·                                          Yongsheng Coal Mine is in its pilot run phase; and
·                                          Dayuan Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine are undergoing construction.
As of April 30, 2013, we had total proved and probable coal reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes and total permitted annual production capacity of 2.34
million tonnes. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had revenues of RMB38.7 million, RMB105.2 million and RMB141.9 million, respectively, and sold 166,362 tonnes, 314,058
tonnes and 437,010 tonnes of anthracite coal, respectively.
OUR CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS
Our Company was incorporated on January 6, 2010 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Feishang. Prior to the Corporate Transactions, our business was conducted by
various corporate entities controlled by Feishang. On July 12, 2011, the Corporate Transactions were completed pursuant to which the corporate entities that have
historically conducted our business were transferred to us and became our Company’s subsidiaries. See “History and Development.” As Feishang controlled these
corporate entities before our Corporate Transactions and continued to control our Company after the Corporate Transactions, we have accounted for our Corporate
Transactions as business combinations under common control using merger accounting. All of the information in this listing document, including the consolidated
financial statements included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company,” has been prepared as if our Company had been in existence since January 1,
2010 and as if we had owned each of our current subsidiaries since the date on which such subsidiary came under the control of Feishang. The assets, liabilities and
results of operations of our subsidiaries were
120
consolidated using Feishang’s historical carrying amounts, and no amount was recognized in respect of goodwill or any other additional assets or liabilities, and no
adjustments were made to reflect fair values as a result of the Corporate Transactions with the exception of the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin. The financial information
and financial statements included in this listing document may not reflect what our historical financial condition and results of operations would have been if we had
actually operated on a stand-alone basis since January 1, 2010, and they are not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition and results of operations.
LIMITED OPERATING AND PRODUCTION HISTORY
We have seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou province, of which four have commenced commercial production, two are under construction and one is
undergoing its pilot run phase. Baiping Coal Mine, Gouchang Coal Mine (currently suspended), Zhulinzhai Coal Mine and Liujiaba Coal Mine commenced commercial
production in June 2009, April 2011, April 2012 and December 2012, respectively. We have a limited operating and production history for you to use as a basis for
evaluating our business. We did not have any commercial production of coal until the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin in March 2010. You should consider our prospects in
light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development, particularly companies in a highly regulated and
cyclical industry such as the PRC coal industry.
In each of 2010, 2011 and 2012, we incurred operating losses and had negative net cash flows from operating activities. We also incurred net losses in each of 2011
and 2012 and, disregarding the effects of a RMB624.1 million non-recurring bargain purchase gain relating to the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin in 2010, we would have
also incurred a net loss in 2010. We may continue to incur losses and have negative net cash flows from operating activities in the future.
FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Production Output
Our future operating results will be dependent on our ability to increase our production output. We believe the increased production output would allow us to increase our
revenue, as well as create economies of scale that could reduce our average production costs per tonne and increase our profitability. Our annual production output grew
from 159,074 tonnes in 2010 to 436,153 tonnes in 2012. We plan on increasing our production by achieving commercial production at Yongsheng Coal Mine, Dayun Coal
Mine and Dayuan Coal Mine and, in the long term, increasing our production capacity at Baiping Coal Mine, Liujiaba Coal Mine and Zhulinzhai Coal Mine. Our ability to
successfully expand our production output, however, is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, constraints on
production capacity, changing government regulations and our relationship with the local community. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — If we are
unable to successfully expand our coal production capacity, our business, profitability and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.”
Our production output is subject to seasonality. Typically, our production output in the first quarter of each year is generally lower than our production output in other
quarters, as our coal mining
121
operations are typically suspended for approximately three to five weeks during the lunar new year holidays. In addition, our production output in the third and fourth
quarters of each year is generally higher than our production output in other quarters, mainly as a result of higher demand and more favorable weather conditions for coal
extraction.
Industry Supply and Demand of Anthracite Coal
The supply and demand of anthracite coal in Guizhou have a significant impact on the sales volume and average selling price of our anthracite coal. Although we expect
the demand for anthracite coal in the PRC to generally increase in the long-term, the Guizhou anthracite coal market is highly cyclical and demand and pricing trends in
Guizhou may differ significantly from the demand and pricing trends elsewhere in the PRC. For example, although anthracite coal prices in Guizhou in 2012 were higher
than 2011, there were significant fluctuations in coal prices within the PRC in 2012. In particular, anthracite coal prices in Guizhou declined significantly in the second
quarter of 2012 as a result of a slowdown of economic growth in the PRC as well as an increase in production capacity in Shanxi province. In 2010, 2011, 2012, the
average selling price of the anthracite coal we produced was RMB232.4, RMB296.4 and RMB323.6 per tonne, respectively. In general, the Guizhou anthracite coal
markets are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:
·                                          general economic conditions in Guizhou as well as the PRC;
·                                          regional supply and demand for anthracite coal;
·                                          competition from other energy sources or alternatives to anthracite coal;
·                                          abnormal weather conditions;
·                                          speculative coal trading;
·                                          the respective economic, energy, environmental, health and safety and other policies of the Guizhou and PRC governments; and
·                                          fluctuations in the development and growth of industries with high demand for anthracite coal, including the power, chemical, iron and steel, and
building materials industries.
Product Mix
Anthracite coal is typically sold as thermal coal, chemical coal or PCI coal. Generally, thermal coal has lower average selling prices and lower margins than chemical
coal and PCI coal. According to China Coal Resource, the average selling price of thermal coal in Guizhou in 2012 was RMB323.0 per tonne, compared to RMB486.0 to
RMB1,007.0 per tonne for chemical coal (depending on the type and characteristic of coal) and RMB952.0 per tonne for PCI coal. Accordingly, our ability to market and
sell our anthracite coal as chemical coal or PCI coal will have a significant impact on our revenue and profitability.
122
Prior to 2011, we derived substantially all of our revenue from the sale of thermal coal. In each of 2011 and 2012, we derived approximately 5% of our revenue from the
sale of chemical coal we produced, while the remaining revenue in each of these years was derived from the sale of thermal coal we produced and coal sourced from
third parties. Subject to market conditions, we intend to significantly increase our sales of chemical coal in the future and begin selling PCI coal in 2014. Our ability to
sell chemical or PCI coal has been constrained as our annual production levels were determined based in large part on the Guizhou government’s annual guidance
relating to the provision of certain minimum amounts of thermal coal to power plants operating in Guizhou, which has taken up a significant portion of our production
capacity. See “Regulation — PRC Laws relating to the Coal Industry — Supply of thermal coal to power plants.” We believe that by increasing our production capacity,
we will be able to sell a larger percentage of our anthracite coal as chemical or PCI coal. However, our ability to effectively produce and sell chemical coal and PCI coal
is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We may not be able to successfully produce, market and sell
chemical and PCI coal, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and prospects.” To date, we only have entered into four non-binding cooperation
arrangements relating to the sale of chemical coal, and we have not entered into any binding agreement for the sale of chemical coal or PCI coal.
Financing Arrangements
Coal mining is a capital intensive business, and we will need a substantial amount of cash to meet our working capital requirements and expand our production capacity.
As we have not generated any net cash flows from our operating activities, we have relied on, and will continue to rely on, short-term and long-term borrowings to
finance our operations and capital expenditures. Our finance costs for bank borrowings and mining right payables (including capitalized interest) increased from
RMB21.8 million in 2010 to RMB60.9 million in 2011 and RMB89.4 million in 2012, and we expect our finance costs to continue to increase in the future. In the past, we
have financed a significant portion of our cash requirements with non-interest bearing loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie, our chairman and chief executive
officer. If these loans had been interest-bearing, our finance costs would have been significantly higher. In March 2013, we repaid a significant portion of the non-interest
bearing loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie with interest-bearing bank and other borrowings, and we do not anticipate receiving additional non-interest
bearing loans from our related parties in the future. In July 2013, we obtained from China Minsheng Bank a commitment to provide a term loan of up to RMB1.6 billion
aggregate principal amount before July 18, 2014, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in such commitment. As of the Latest Practicable Date, the total
outstanding amount of our non-interest bearing loans was RMB131.0 million.
Regulatory Environment
Coal mining is a highly regulated industry in the PRC, and the regulatory regime applicable to our operations is rapidly evolving. In particular, in response to a number of
highly-publicized mining-related accidents and fatalities, the PRC regulatory authorities have recently taken a number of measures to improve mine safety, some of
which have significantly affected our business and operations. For example, Gouchang Coal Mine was required to suspend its operations from March 2012 to
August 2012 under certain newly implemented mine gas control requirements in Guizhou. Moreover, in 2012, the Guizhou government required certain coal mines
utilizing drilling and blasting
123
mining methods to upgrade to semi-mechanical longwall mining methods, which required us to incur significant time and expense to redesign and upgrade Liujiaba Coal
Mine. In addition to mine safety measures, regulatory authorities in the PRC may also impose various taxes, duties, levies or take other actions as part of the PRC’s
overall economic, environmental or energy policies. For example, the Guizhou government levies a coal price adjustment fund levy on the coal sold by local coal
producers and the rate of the coal price adjustment fund levy is subject to changes from time to time based on prevailing government policies. Furthermore, under the
coal mine consolidation policy promulgated by the Guizhou government in March 2013, operations at Gouchang Coal Mine have been suspended since March 2013
pending the acquisition by us of a nearby coal mine and Gouchang Coal Mine achieving certain production capacity requirements in accordance with Guizhou province’s
coal mining consolidation policy. These regulatory developments have significantly affected our pricing, production capacity, production costs and capacity expansion
schedule, and we expect that our business, financial condition and results of operations will continue to be significantly affected by future regulatory developments.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our significant accounting policies are set forth in note 2.4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company.”
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount reported in
our consolidated financial statements. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and actual results could differ significantly. We have identified the following accounting
policies as critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, because the application of these policies requires significant management
judgments, estimates and assumptions, and the reporting of materially different amounts could result if different judgments were made or different estimates or
assumptions were used.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss for a long-lived asset is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell the asset and the asset’s value in use. When our management estimates the
recoverable amount of an asset, various assumptions are made, including the future cash flows expected to be associated with the asset and the applicable discount
rate. If future events do not correspond to these assumptions, the recoverable amounts may need to be revised, which may lead to impairment losses and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. We did not recognize any impairment losses in 2010, 2011 or 2012.
124
Units-of-Production Depreciation for Mining-Related Assets
Mining-related assets, including mining rights and mining-related buildings, mining structures and mining-related machinery and equipment, are depreciated or amortized
using the units-of-production method based on the actual units of coal production over the estimated coal reserves of our mines. As a result, changes in our coal
reserve estimates could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, a reduction in our estimated coal reserves would increase
depreciation and amortization expenses per unit of coal production and reduce our gross margins as well as increase our losses. See the section entitled “— Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates — Reserve Estimates.”
Useful Lives of Non-Mining Related Property, Plant and Equipment
Non-mining related property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The useful life of an asset is the period
over which the asset is expected to be available for use, and our management estimates the useful lives of our non-mining related property, plant and equipment based
on a collective assessment of technology and industry conditions as well as historical experience with similar assets. The estimated useful lives of non-mining related
property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and updated if expectations differ from previous estimates due to physical wear and tear, technical or
commercial obsolescence or legal or other limits on the use of such assets. Changes in such estimates could significantly affect our financial condition and results of
operations. In particular, a reduction in the estimated useful lives of non-mining related property, plant and equipment would increase depreciation expenses and reduce
operating income, as well as result in write-off or write-down of obsolete assets in certain cases. The estimated useful lives of our non-mining related property, plant and
equipment are as follows:
Non-mining related buildings
Non-mining related machinery and equipment
Motor vehicles
Reserve Estimates
Estimated Useful Lives
15-35 years
5-15 years
5-8 years
Proven and probable coal reserve estimates are estimates of the amount of coal that can be economically and legally extracted from our mines. In estimating our coal
reserves, our management reviews recent production and technical information of each mine, considers the potential for unforeseen geological and technical difficulties,
and makes various assumptions and estimates relating to the price of coal, production costs, transportation costs of coal and expected recovery rates. Our
management reviews our coal reserve estimates annually or when information becomes available that indicates our coal reserve estimates would need to be revised.
For example, during the course of our operations, additional geological or other information may become available that would require our management to update certain
assumptions it used in estimating our coal reserves.  Changes to coal
125
reserve estimates could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, a change in our estimated coal reserves could have the
following effects:
·                                          reduce the carrying values of certain of our assets, including mining rights, due to changes in the estimated future cash flows associated with
such assets;
·                                          increase depreciation or amortization expenses relating to assets that are depreciated or amortized using the units-of-production method based on
our estimated coal reserves;
·                                          asset retirement obligations and related accretion expenses may be affected if estimates of the expected timing and cost of our asset retirement
expenditures are affected by changes in our estimates of coal reserves; and
·                                          reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets due to changes in the estimated likelihood of recovery of the tax benefits.
Impairment of Trade and Other Receivables
We recognize a provision for impairment of our trade and other receivables when there is objective evidence that we will not be able to collect all of the amounts due
under the terms of our invoice, including the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the customer, as well as significant changes in the
technological, economic or legal environment that may have an adverse effect on the customer. Our management takes into account our historical write-off experience,
the age of the receivable, the credit history of the customer and current market conditions when making a provision, and our management will reassess our provisions at
the end of each reporting period. If the customer’s financial condition deteriorates or if its repayment ability is lower than we had anticipated, our impairment losses may
increase, and our financial condition and results of operations, as well as liquidity, would be materially and adversely affected. Historically, we have not experienced any
impairment losses from our trade and other receivables.
Income Taxes
There are certain transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. We recognize tax liabilities based on
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. If the final tax outcome of certain transactions is different from the amounts that were initially recognized, the
difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination was made.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in
our consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted and which are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognized
only to the extent it is probable that we would have sufficient future taxable income against which any deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits or unused
tax losses could be utilized. If the
126
actual or expected tax rates and laws in the future are different from our original estimates, or if our actual or expected future taxable income is lower than we had
estimated, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities would be affected in the period in which such estimates have changed.
Provision for Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations are the present value of the expenditures that we expect to incur in relation to the closure of our mines following the exhaustion of their coal
reserves, including dismantling mining structures and restoring the land. After the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, it is accreted to reflect the increase
in the present value of our expected expenditures due to the passage of time, and a corresponding accretion expense will be recognized. Asset retirement obligations
are determined based on our management’s past experience, its estimates of the timing and amount of the future expenditures, its expectations of future regulatory
requirements, as well as various assumptions regarding the applicable discount rate to be used for purposes of calculating present value. Our management regularly
reviews our asset retirement obligations, which will be revised if any of our management’s estimates, expectations or assumptions change. Changes of these estimates,
expectations and assumptions could result in an adjustment of the carrying value of the asset retirement obligations, as well as changes to the related accretion
expenses.
DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
We generate our revenue primarily from the production and sale of anthracite coal. In 2011 and 2012, we also generated a portion of our revenue from sales of anthracite
coal purchased from third parties, as we engaged in coal trading activities to take advantage of coal price fluctuations during the ramp-up of our production capacity. In
2011 and 2012, revenue from sales of third party anthracite coal was RMB33.1 million and RMB1.1 million, respectively, representing 31.5% and 0.8%, respectively, of
our revenue in those years. We do not expect to generate any significant revenue from sales of third party coal in the future.
We sell a significant portion of our anthracite coal as thermal coal to power producers in Guizhou province. As a result, we are dependent on a limited number of
customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, we derived 66.6%, 73.5% and 56.7%, respectively, of our revenue from anthracite coal
sales to our five largest customers. We believe that by diversifying our product mix to include increased sales of chemical coal and sales of PCI coal, our dependency
on a limited number of large customers will decrease.
We recognize revenue from the sale of anthracite coal when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer and when collectability is
reasonably assured. The point at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership is deemed to have passed to the customer is determined based on the terms of
the sale. Typically, we recognize revenue upon delivery to and acceptance of our anthracite coal by our customers. Unless we receive payment in full at the time
revenue is recognized for the sale, we would record the receivable in respect of the sale as a trade
127
receivable. We offer a credit term of up to three months to customers. Our trade receivables are non-interest bearing, and we do not hold any collateral over our trade
receivables. For customers with whom we have no prior trading history, we generally require immediate cash payment or advance payment.
Most of our customers request us to arrange for transportation of the anthracite coal they purchase from us. We generally charge our customers separately for the cost
of transportation and record as revenue any excess of the amount we collect over the cost of arranging the transportation. In some circumstances, the amount we
charge our customers for the cost of transportation may be less than our cost of arranging the transportation, in which case we would deduct the amount of the
deficiency against the revenue recognized for the corresponding sale.
We recognize revenue net of value-added taxes. All of the anthracite coal we sell is subject to a value-added tax of 17.0% in the PRC. Pursuant to applicable PRC
regulations, we add value-added taxes to the invoiced price of our sales, and we remit the value-added taxes we collect from our customers to the PRC tax authorities,
subject to applicable deductions. The difference between the amount of value-added taxes we collect and the amount of value-added taxes we pay is recorded in our
consolidated statements of financial position as prepayments, deposits and other receivables, or other payables and accrued liabilities, as applicable.
We are also required by the Guizhou government to pay a coal price adjustment fund levy on the anthracite coal we sell. The invoiced price of our anthracite coal sales
may be inclusive or exclusive of this levy, depending on negotiations with the customer on a case-by-case basis. Any coal price adjustment fund levy we recover from
our customers will be included in our revenue, and any coal price adjustment fund levy we are required to pay to the Guizhou government will be included in our cost of
sales.
Cost of Sales
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, cost of sales was RMB25.5 million, RMB74.3 million and RMB95.9 million, respectively. Our cost of sales consists primarily the cost of sales
of our self-produced coal, which include:
·                                          direct labor costs for personnel involved in our coal mining operations;
·                                          mining-related taxes, fees and levies, including the coal price adjustment fund levy;
·                                          depreciation and amortization expenses of mining-related assets, including the amortization expenses of our mining rights;
·                                          cost of materials, including explosives, mine roof support materials, steel, cement and diesel fuel; and
·                                          other miscellaneous cost of sales, including the cost of utilities, repair and maintenance expenses and overhead.
128
In 2011 and 2012, our cost of sales also included the cost of purchasing third party coal in connection with our coal trading activities. In 2011 and 2012, cost of
purchasing third party coal was RMB30.2 million and RMB1.1 million, respectively, representing approximately 40.7% and 1.2%, respectively, of our total cost of sales.
We believe our product mix will be one of the most important factors in determining our cost of sales as a percentage of our revenue. In particular, chemical coal and
PCI coal, which generally command significantly higher average selling prices than thermal coal, do not cost significantly more to produce than thermal coal. We
currently sell most of our anthracite coal as thermal coal, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully produce and sell chemical coal or PCI coal. See
“Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We may not be able to successfully produce, market and sell chemical and PCI coal, which could materially and
adversely affect our profitability and prospects.”
Selling and Distribution Expenses
Our selling and distribution expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for our sales staff, travel expenses and other miscellaneous selling expenses. In 2010,
2011 and 2012, selling and distribution expenses were RMB2.9 million, RMB2.9 million and RMB3.7 million, respectively, representing 7.5%, 2.8% and 2.6%,
respectively, of our revenue. As we intend to increase our marketing and sales of chemical coal, we expect our selling and distribution expenses to increase in future
periods.
Administrative Expenses
Our administrative expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our management and administrative personnel, depreciation and amortization expenses for our
non-mining related assets, losses resulting from suspensions of mining operations, professional advisor fees, travel and entertainment expenses, miscellaneous office
expenses and utilities. In 2010, our administrative expenses also included share-based compensation expenses of RMB17.0 million relating to share options granted to
Mr. Li Feilie by CHNR to purchase 1,000,000 shares of CHNR. The options were granted in January 2008 and the related share-based compensation expenses were
amortized over three years from 2008 to 2010. We did not have any share-based compensation expenses in 2011 or 2012. See note 28 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company.”
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our administrative expenses were RMB55.8 million, RMB49.4 million and RMB77.3 million, respectively, representing 144.4%, 47.0% and
54.5%, respectively, of our revenue. We expect our administrative expenses to increase in the future as our business and production capacity expands. Moreover, after
the completion of our Listing, we will become a stand-alone independent public company and will incur significantly higher levels of legal, accounting, compliance and
other administrative expenses than we did as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHNR. Also, as we intend to adopt the Share Option Scheme after the completion of the
Listing to incentivize our management and employees, we expect our share-based compensation expenses to increase significantly in the future.
129
Other Operating Expenses
Our other operating expenses primarily consist of mine pre-development expenses, administrative penalties and fines, relocation compensation paid to local residents,
as well as other miscellaneous levies and charges. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our other operating expenses were RMB9.0 million, RMB1.5 million and RMB1.6 million,
respectively, representing 23.3%, 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively, of our revenue.

Interest on interest-bearing loans is the largest component of our finance costs. Our interest-bearing loans consist of short-term and long-term bank borrowings. As of
December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had total outstanding interest-bearing loans of RMB418.7 million, RMB735.9 million and RMB1,013.5 million, respectively, with
effective interest rates ranging from 5.94% to 8.32%, 6.22% to 9.84% and 5.94% to 9.47%, respectively. We expect our interest on interest-bearing loans to increase
significantly in future periods, as we intend to increase our short-term and long-term borrowings to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In March and May 2013,
we entered into a RMB400.0 million one-year bank loan (bearing a floating annual interest rate of 20% above the one-year base lending rate published by the PBOC) with
China Minsheng Bank and a RMB300.0 million 8.00% two-year entrustment loan with Huachuang Securities, respectively, to refinance certain of our non-interest bearing
loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie.
Interest on payable for mining rights relates to our interest expense under our installment payment plans with the Guizhou Provincial Department of Land and Resources
in respect of our mining right permits. The interest rate applicable to these installment payment plans is determined annually based on the PBOC’s official benchmark
interest rates.
130
Capitalized interest relates to borrowing costs that directly relate to the acquisition or construction of coal mines that have not commenced commercial production.
These borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the cost of the coal mine and not expensed in the period they are incurred. Once commercial production has
commenced, however, these borrowing costs may no longer be capitalized and must be expensed in the period incurred. As a result, if we achieve commercial
production at additional coal mines in the future, our finance costs may increase.
Bank charges include miscellaneous fees and charges in connection with our long-term and short-term bank borrowings, as well as fees of entrustment loans. As we
replaced certain of our intra-company loans with entrustment loans since March 2013, we expect our bank charges to increase in future periods.
Accretion expenses reflect the increase in the present value of our asset retirement obligations due to the passage of time. Accretion expenses are expected to
generally increase over time and may be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions regarding the applicable discount rates as well as changes to our estimated
asset retirement obligations. See “— Critical Accounting Policies — Asset Retirement Obligations.”
Gain on Bargain Purchase of a Subsidiary
In March 2010, we acquired Guizhou Puxin for a cash consideration of RMB150.0 million, which was less than the fair value of its net assets of RMB774.1 million at the
time of the acquisition. As a result, we recognized a one-time gain on bargain purchase of RMB624.1 million in connection with the transaction. This gain is non-
recurring and non-cash and should not be viewed as indicative of our future earnings. See “History and Development.”
Net non-operating expense
Net non-operating expense primarily consists of losses on disposal of non-current assets and certain required sponsorships and contributions to the community and
certain government organizations. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our net non-operating expense was RMB1.6 million, RMB0.9 million and RMB2.2 million, respectively.
Taxation
British Virgin Islands Income Tax
Our Company is not subject to any income or capital gains tax under the current laws of the British Virgin Islands. There are currently no dividend withholding taxes in
the British Virgin Islands.
131
Hong Kong Profits Tax
We have one subsidiary, Smartact, incorporated in Hong Kong. Under current Hong Kong laws, companies incorporated in Hong Kong are subject to profits tax at a rate
of 16.5%. We have not made any provision for Hong Kong profits tax as we did not have any assessable profits arising in Hong Kong in 2010, 2011 or 2012, and
Smartact is exempt from foreign-derived income. There are currently no dividend withholding taxes in Hong Kong.
PRC Income Tax
On March 16, 2007, the PRC National People’s Congress adopted the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the PRC
Enterprise Income Tax Law, our PRC subsidiaries are subject to annual enterprise income tax at a rate equal to 25% of their taxable income. Under the PRC Enterprise
Income Tax Law, all dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to Smartact are subject to a 5% or 10% withholding tax depending on the availability of the relevant tax
treaty. No such dividends were paid in 2010, 2011 or 2012.
Prior to 2012, certain of our PRC subsidiaries, including Dayuan Coal, Gouchang Coal, Baiping Mining, Xinsong Coal and Linjiaao Coal were required by the Guizhou
local taxation bureau to pay enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% of their “deemed profits” rather than 25% of their taxable income as determined under the PRC
Enterprise Income Tax Law. The “deemed profits” of these subsidiaries, which were determined based on the actual revenue of these subsidiaries less certain “deemed
expenses” as determined by the Guizhou local taxation bureau, were significantly higher than their taxable income. As a result, in periods prior to 2012, these PRC
subsidiaries paid a higher amount of enterprise income tax than what the PRC Enterprise Income Tax law would have otherwise required. In 2012, the Guizhou local
taxation bureau confirmed in writing that these PRC subsidiaries should have only been subject to income tax at a rate of 25% of their taxable income as determined
under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law since January 2011. As a result, we recognized deferred tax assets for prior year tax losses in the amount of RMB15.3
million in 2012. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company.”
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the summary historical consolidated financial statements set forth below in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in the
Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the Company,” together with the accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the

Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011
Revenue
Our revenue increased by 34.9% from RMB105.2 million in 2011 to RMB141.9 million in 2012. This reflected a 95.3% increase in revenue from sales of self-produced
coal from RMB72.1 million in 2011 to RMB140.8 million in 2012, which was partially offset by a 96.6% decrease in revenue from sales of third party coal from RMB33.1
million in 2011 to RMB1.1 million in 2012. The increase in revenue from sales of self-produced coal resulted from an increase in sales volume as well as an increase in
average selling price. Sales volume of self-produced coal increased from 243,247 tonnes in 2011 to 435,205 tonnes in 2012, principally as a result of an increase in the
production output of Baiping Coal Mine in 2012 and the commencement of commercial production at Zhulinzhai Coal Mine in April 2012 and Liujiaba Coal Mine in
December 2012, partially offset by the suspension of production at Gouchang Coal Mine from March to August 2012 under certain newly implemented mine gas control
requirements in Guizhou. The average selling price of self-produced coal increased from RMB296.4 per tonne in 2011 to RMB323.6 per tonne in 2012, mainly due to the
higher market prices of anthracite coal in the PRC in 2012. Revenue from the sales of third party coal decreased, primarily as a result of a decrease in sales volume
from 70,811 tonnes in 2011 to 1,805 tonnes in 2012. We do not intend to engage in any significant coal trading activities in the future.
Cost of Sales
Our cost of sales increased by 29.1% from RMB74.3 million in 2011 to RMB95.9 million in 2012. This was primarily due to our increased sales volume. As a percentage
of revenue, cost of sales decreased from 70.6% in 2011 to 67.6% in 2012. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2012 principally due to a significant
reduction of our coal trading activities, which had lower profit margins than selling self-produced coal. For our self-produced coal, cost of sales as a percentage of
revenue increased from 61.1% in 2011 to 67.3% in 2012. This was mainly the result of an increase in the cost of materials, particularly the cost of explosives and mine
roof support materials.
135
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit, which is equal to revenue less cost of sales, increased by 48.9% from RMB30.9 million in 2011 to RMB46.1 million in 2012.
Our gross margin, which is equal to gross profit divided by revenue, increased from 29.4% in 2011 to 32.4% in 2012.
Selling and Distribution Expenses
Our selling and distribution expenses increased by 26.1% from RMB2.9 million in 2011 to RMB3.7 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in our sales and
marketing activities as we increased our production output. As a percentage of revenue, sales and distribution expenses decreased from 2.8% in 2011 to 2.6% in 2012.
Administrative Expenses
Our administrative expenses increased by 56.4% from RMB49.4 million in 2011 to RMB77.3 million in 2012. This increase primarily reflected higher salaries and benefits
expenses for our administrative staff, as we increased the number of our administrative staff in 2012 to support the growth of our business, losses incurred from the
suspension of production at Gouchang Coal Mine from March to August 2012, as well as expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for the Listing. As a
percentage of revenue, administrative expenses increased from 47.0% in 2011 to 54.5% in 2012.
Other Operating Expenses
Our other operating expenses increased from RMB1.5 million in 2011 to RMB1.6 million in 2012. Other operating expenses consisted mainly of administrative penalties
and fines in 2011 and miscellaneous levies and charges in 2012. As a percentage of revenue, other operating expenses decreased from 1.5% in 2011 to 1.1% in 2012.
Operating Loss
As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss increased by 59.2% from RMB23.0 million in 2011 to RMB36.6 million in 2012.
Finance Costs
Our finance costs increased by 39.9% from RMB31.8 million in 2011 to RMB44.5 million in 2012, principally due to a 70.5% increase in interest expenses on interest-
bearing loans from RMB49.0 million in 2011 to RMB83.5 million in 2012. Interest expenses on interest-bearing loans increased primarily because we significantly
increased our bank borrowings from RMB735.9 million as of December 31, 2011 to RMB1,013.5 million as of December 31, 2012, and the average interest rate on our
outstanding bank borrowings increased from 8.0% in 2011 to 8.5% in 2012. The increase in interest expenses was partially offset by a higher level of capitalized interest
in 2012 as compared to
136
2011, as well as a decrease in interest on payable for mining rights. The higher level of capitalized interest in 2012 was mainly the result of an increase in bank
borrowings for funding coal mine construction. Interest on payables for mining rights decreased in 2012 primarily because the mining right premiums for Liujiaba Coal
Mine and Gouchang Coal Mine were fully paid in 2012.
Interest Income
Our interest income increased by 85.8% from RMB0.6 million in 2011 to RMB1.0 million in 2012, mainly as a result of an increase in the average balance of our bank
deposits in 2012 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average yield of our bank deposits.
Net Non-operating Expense
Our net non-operating expense increased significantly from RMB0.9 million in 2011 to RMB2.2 million in 2012, primarily reflecting an increase in sponsorships and
contributions to the community and certain government organizations.
Loss Before Income Tax
As a result of the foregoing, our loss before income tax increased by 49.2% from RMB55.2 million in 2011 to RMB82.3 million in 2012.
Income Tax Expense/Benefit
We had an income tax benefit of RMB15.2 million in 2012, compared to an income tax expense of RMB9.8 million in 2011. Our income tax benefit in 2012 primarily
reflected the recognition of deferred tax assets of RMB15.3 million, as the Guizhou local taxation bureau confirmed in 2012 that certain of our PRC subsidiaries should
have been subject to income tax at a rate of 25% of their taxable income as determined under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law since January 2011, rather than
25% of their “deemed profits.” Prior to 2012, certain of our PRC subsidiaries were required by the Guizhou local taxation bureau to pay tax at a rate of 25% of their
“deemed profits”, which resulted in these PRC subsidiaries paying a significantly higher amount of tax than otherwise required under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax
Law. See “— Descriptions of Key Components of Our Results of Operations — Income Tax — PRC Income Tax.” Our income tax expense in 2011 mainly reflected the
enterprise income tax payable by certain of our PRC subsidiaries as determined based on their “deemed profits.”
Profit/(Loss) for the Year
As a result of the foregoing, our loss for the year increased by 3.3% from RMB64.9 million in 2011 to RMB67.1 million in 2012.
137
Profit/(Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests and Owners of our Company
Loss attributable to non-controlling interests was RMB0.7 million in 2011, compared to profit attributable to non-controlling interests of RMB8.3 million in 2012. The profit
attributable to non-controlling interests in 2012 mainly reflected the minority shareholders’ share of the financial results of Baiping Mining, which recorded a profit in
2012.
Loss attributable to owners of our Company increased by 17.4% from RMB64.2 million in 2011 to RMB75.3 million in 2012.
Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010
Revenue
Our revenue increased significantly from RMB38.7 million in 2010 to RMB105.2 million in 2011, reflecting a 86.4% increase in revenue from sales of self-produced coal
from RMB38.7 million in 2010 to RMB72.1 million in 2011, as well as the commencement of our coal trading activities in January 2011. The increase in revenue from
sales of self-produced coal was the result of an increase in sales volume as well as an increase in average selling price. Sales volume of self-produced coal increased
from 166,362 tonnes in 2010 to 243,247 tonnes in 2011, principally as a result of the commencement of commercial production at Gouchang Coal Mine in April 2011 and
an increase in production output at Baiping Coal Mine. The average selling price of self-produced coal increased from RMB232.4 per tonne in 2010 to RMB296.4 per
tonne in 2011, mainly due to the general increase in the market prices of anthracite coal in the PRC. In 2011, we generated RMB33.1 million in revenue from the sale of
70,811 tonnes of third party coal as part of our coal trading activities.
Cost of Sales
Our cost of sales increased significantly from RMB25.5 million in 2010 to RMB74.3 million in 2011. This was principally the result of our increased sales volume. As a
percentage of revenue, cost of sales increased from 65.8% in 2010 to 70.6% in 2011. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased in 2011 mainly due to the
commencement of our coal trading activities in January 2011, which had lower profit margins than selling self-produced coal. For our self-produced coal, cost of sales as
a percentage of revenue decreased from 65.8% in 2010 to 61.1% in 2011. This was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of our self-produced coal, as
well as greater economies of scale realized from our higher production volume.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased significantly from RMB13.2 million in 2010 to RMB30.9 million in 2011. Our gross margin decreased from 34.2%
in 2010 to 29.4% in 2011.
138
Selling and Distribution Expenses
Our selling and distribution expenses were RMB2.9 million in both 2010 and 2011, as we did not materially change our sales and marketing activities or the size of our
sales and marketing personnel. As a percentage of revenue, sales and distribution expenses were 7.5% in 2010 and 2.8% in 2011.
Administrative Expenses
Our administrative expenses decreased by 11.4% from RMB55.8 million in 2010 to RMB49.4 million in 2011, primarily because no share-based compensation expense
was recognized. In 2010, our administrative expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB17.0 million allocated from CHNR in connection with the
share options granted in 2008 to Mr. Li Feilie to purchase 1,000,000 shares of CHNR. This was partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits for our
administrative staff, as we increased the number of our administrative staff in 2011 to support the growth of our business. As a percentage of revenue, administrative
expenses decreased from 144.4% in 2010 to 47.0% in 2011.
Other Operating Expenses
Our other operating expenses decreased by 82.9% from RMB9.0 million in 2010 to RMB1.5 million in 2011, mainly because we were subject to less administrative
penalties and fines. Moreover, our operating expenses in 2010 were significantly affected by mine pre-development expenses we incurred totaling RMB1.7 million in
respect of Dayun Coal Mine and RMB3.2 million in compensation we paid to certain local residents at Dayuan Coal Mine. As a percentage of revenue, other expenses
decreased from 23.3% in 2010 to 1.5% in 2011.
Operating Loss
As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased by 57.9% from RMB54.5 million in 2010 to RMB23.0 million in 2011.
Finance Costs
Our finance costs increased significantly from RMB6.0 million in 2010 to RMB31.8 million in 2011. This increase was principally due to a significant increase in interest
expenses on interest-bearing loans from RMB16.0 million in 2010 to RMB49.0 million in 2011, as well as a significant increase in interest on payable for mining rights
from RMB5.8 million in 2010 to RMB11.9 million in 2011. Interest expenses on interest-bearing loans increased primarily because of an increase in our bank borrowings
from RMB418.7 million as of December 31, 2010 to RMB735.9 million as of December 31, 2011, as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding
bank borrowings from 7.1% in 2010 to 8.0% in 2011. Interest on payables for mining rights increased mainly because of the commencement of paying interest on
payables for mining rights for Dayun Coal Mine. These increases were partially offset by a higher level of capitalized interest in 2011 as compared to 2010. The higher
level of capitalized interest in 2011 was mainly the result of an increase in bank borrowings for funding coal mine construction.
139
Interest Income
Our interest income increased from RMB0.1 million in 2010 to RMB0.6 million in 2011, mainly as a result of an increase in the average level of our bank deposits and, to
a lesser extent, an increase in the average yield of our bank deposits.
Gain on Bargain Purchase of a Subsidiary
In 2010, we recognized a non-recurring gain on bargain purchase of RMB624.1 million in connection with our acquisition of Guizhou Puxin. We did not recognize a
similar gain in 2011.
Non-operating Expense, Net
Our net non-operating expense decreased by 43.7% from RMB1.6 million in 2010 to RMB0.9 million in 2011, primarily because of lower amounts in sponsorships and
contributions to the community and certain government organizations.
Profit/(Loss) Before Income Tax
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a profit before income tax of RMB562.1 million in 2010 and a loss before income tax of RMB55.2 million in 2011. Disregarding
the effects of the RMB624.1 million non-recurring time gain on the bargain purchase of Guizhou Puxin, we would have incurred a loss before income tax of RMB62.0
million in 2010.
Income Tax Expense
Our income tax expense increased by 58.8% from RMB6.1 million in 2010 to RMB9.8 million in 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in the “deemed profits” of
certain of our PRC subsidiaries. See “— Descriptions of Key Components of Our Results of Operations — Income Tax — PRC Income Tax.”
Profit/(Loss) for the Year
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a profit of RMB556.0 million in 2010 and a loss of RMB64.9 million in 2011.
Profit/(Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests and Owners of our Company
Loss attributable to non-controlling interests decreased significantly from RMB6.4 million in 2010 to RMB0.7 million in 2011. Although the Company had a profit of
RMB556.0 million in 2010, there was a loss attributable to non-controlling interests in 2010 because the non-controlling interests were mainly related to the minority
shareholders of Baiping Mining and Guizhou Yongfu, which did not benefit from the RMB624.1 million non-recurring gain on the bargain purchase of Guizhou Puxin.
Profit attributable to owners of our Company was RMB562.4 million in 2010, compared to a loss attributable to owners of our Company of RMB64.2 million in 2011.
140
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We need a substantial amount of cash to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In each of 2010, 2011 and 2012, we had negative net cash flows from
operations. In the past, we had primarily funded our operations and capital expenditures with non-interest bearing borrowings from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie,
as well as short-term and long-term bank and other borrowings. Since March 2013, we began to refinance a significant portion of the non-interest bearing borrowings from
companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie with interest-bearing bank and other borrowings, and we do not anticipate receiving additional non-interest bearing loans from our
related companies in the future. As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of RMB161.0 million and term deposits of RMB20 million, which matured
in April 2013. In July 2013, we obtained from China Minsheng Bank a commitment to provide a term loan of up to RMB1.6 billion aggregate principal amount before
July 18, 2014, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in such commitment.
Cash Flows
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated:

To date, we have experienced significant negative net cash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was RMB70.6 million in 2012, RMB62.6
million in 2011 and RMB39.7 million in 2010. In 2012 and 2011, our negative net cash flows from operating activities were mainly attributable to our loss before income
tax of RMB82.3 million in 2012 and RMB55.2 million in 2011, respectively, as adjusted for finance costs and other adjustments for non-cash items. Net cash used in
operating activities was RMB39.7 million in 2010, which primarily reflected our profit before income tax of RMB562.1 million, as adjusted for the RMB624.1 million non-
cash gain on the bargain purchase of Guizhou Puxin.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was RMB385.2 million in 2012, RMB464.7 million in 2011 and RMB239.2 million in 2010. Net cash used in investing activities
during these periods primarily
141
related to the construction and development of our coal mines and purchases of mining-related equipment and machinery. In 2011, net cash used in investing activities
also included a RMB140.1 million payment in respect of the balance of the purchase price for the acquisition of Guizhou Puxin.
Net Cash Generated from Financing Activities
Net cash generated from financing activities was RMB542.8 million in 2012, RMB524.4 million in 2011 and RMB303.7 million in 2010. Net cash from financing activities
during these periods mainly reflected the proceeds from bank borrowings and from non-interest bearing borrowings from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie.
Capital Expenditure
Our capital expenditures were RMB219.7 million, RMB341.5 million and RMB360.2 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our capital expenditures mainly related
to the construction of our coal mines, purchase of mining-related equipment and machinery and pre-payments for land use rights for our coal mines.
We expect to pay approximately an aggregate of RMB545.0 million in 2013 and 2014 for capital expenditures. These estimated capital expenditures are expected to be
used primarily for construction of Dayuan Coal Mine, Dayun Coal Mine and Yongsheng Coal Mine, the construction of a coal beneficiation plant in Jinsha county and the
construction of a port along the Wujiang River near Yongsheng coal Mine. Our current plan with respect to capital expenditures is subject to a number of uncertainties
and may change due to various reasons, including delays in construction work, unanticipated increases in cost of construction, changes in construction scope and
completion time, adverse weather conditions, unexpected changes to applicable regulatory requirements and other unforeseen difficulties. We periodically review our
capital expenditure plans and may make adjustments from time to time.
We expect to fund our capital expenditures in 2013 and 2014 through interest-bearing bank and other borrowings. See “— Indebtedness”.
Working Capital
As of December 31, 2012 and      , we had net current liabilities of RMB1,030.1 million and RMB      million, respectively. We intend to fund our cash requirements with
additional short-term and long-term bank and other borrowings. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had RMB      of unused short-term lines of credit and RMB      of
undrawn commitments under our long-term credit facilities. In July 2013, we obtained from China Minsheng Bank a commitment to provide a term loan of up to RMB1.6
billion aggregate principal amount before July 18, 2014, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in such commitment. Taking into account the financial
resources available to us, our Directors believe that we will have 125% of the working capital required to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.
142
INDEBTEDNESS
Loans From Related Companies
As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li Feilie were RMB314.2 million, RMB451.4 million and RMB672.4 million,
respectively. These loans were non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. In 2013, we repaid a significant portion of our loans from related companies
with interest-bearing bank and other borrowings. As of the Latest Practicable Date, our outstanding loans from companies controlled by Mr. Li was RMB      million.
Interest-Bearing Loans
Our interest-bearing loans consist of short-term and long-term bank and other borrowings.
As of December 31, 2012, the total outstanding amount of our short-term bank and other borrowings and the current portion of our outstanding long-term bank borrowings
were RMB443.9 million. All of our outstanding short-term bank and other borrowings were guaranteed by Mr. Li Feilie and/or companies controlled by him. Our short-term
bank and other borrowings typically have floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, the effective interest rates on our outstanding short-term bank borrowings
ranged from 6.40% to 9.00%.
As of December 31, 2012, we had total outstanding long-term bank borrowings (excluding the current portion) of RMB569.6 million. We obtained our long-term bank
borrowings from various financial institutions under several credit facilities. All of our long-term bank borrowings are guaranteed by Mr. Li Feilie and/or companies
controlled by him and certain of our long-term bank borrowings are secured by pledges of our mining rights, equity interests in Baiping Mining, Dayuan Coal, Gouchang
Coal, Linjiaao Coal, Xinsong Coal and Dayun Coal and certain of our time deposit. As of the Latest Practicable Date, the total amount of bank borrowings that were
guaranteed by Mr. Li and/or companies controlled by him was approximately RMB      million, representing approximately      % of our total borrowings. We have
obtained in-principle consents from Bank of Chongqing, China Minsheng Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of Communications, Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and Huachuang Securities to release the guarantees for at least RMB1,375.0 million of the borrowings, to be effective upon the Listing and subject to the
completion of certain administrative procedures of the banks, which is expected to be completed in approximately one to three months after the Listing. See
“Relationship With Our Controlling Shareholders — Independence From Our Controlling Shareholders — Financial Independence.” Our long-term bank borrowings
typically have floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, the effective interest rates on our outstanding long-term bank borrowings ranged from 6.40% to 8.52%.
Our long-term bank borrowings agreements contain restrictive covenants providing for certain restrictions relating to, among others, mergers and consolidations,
incurrence of additional indebtedness or guarantees, disposals of a substantial portion of our assets, significant changes in the ownership of our subsidiaries and
payment of dividends or other distributions.
143
In March 2013, we entered into several 7.38% three-year entrusted loans with an aggregate principal amount of RMB83.6 million with China Minsheng Bank, an
unrelated third party, which have been fully drawn down.
In March 2013, we entered into a RMB400.0 million 7.20% one-year loan with China Minsheng Bank, which has been fully drawn down.
In March 2013, we entered into a RMB50.0 million 8.40% one-year loan with Bank of Chongqing, which has been fully drawn down. The loan is guaranteed by Feishang
Enterprise.
In March 2013, we entered into a RMB131.0 million interest-free three-year entrusted loan with China Minsheng Bank, which has been fully dawn down.
In May 2013, we entered into a RMB300.0 million 8.00% two-year loan with Guizhou Bank, which has been fully drawn down. The loan is guaranteed by Feishang
Enterprise, Feishang Energy and Mr. Li Feilie.
In July 2013, we entered into a RMB105.0 million 7.38% three-year entrusted loan with China Minsheng Bank, which has been fully drawn down.
In July 2013, we obtained from China Minsheng Bank a commitment to provide a term loan of up to RMB1.6 billion aggregate principal amount before July 18, 2014,
subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in such commitment.
For additional information on bank and other borrowings, see note 36 to our consolidated financial statements included in Appendix I — “Accountants’ Report of the
Company.”
During the Track Record Period and as of the Latest Practicable Date, the Directors confirmed that we had no material defaults in relation to our bank borrowings or
breaches of covenants in the bank borrowings, or payment of trade or non-trade payables.
As of      , we had RMB      of unused short-term lines of credit and RMB      of undrawn commitments under our long-term credit facilities.
The Directors have confirmed that unless otherwise disclosed in the listing document there has not been any material change in our indebtedness since December 31,
2012.
Mining Rights Payables
Mining rights payables are payables under our installment payment plans with the Guizhou Provincial Department of Land and Resources for the acquisition of our
mining rights. Interest on our outstanding mining rights are determined annually by reference to the official benchmark interest rates published by the PBOC. As of
December 31, 2012, the interest rate on our outstanding mining rights payables ranged from 6.15% to 6.55%.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
As the Latest Practicable Date, except for bank borrowings disclosed above and intra-group liabilities, we did not have any loan capital or debt securities issued or
agreed to be issued, outstanding bank overdrafts and liabilities under acceptances or other similar indebtedness, debentures, mortgages, charges or loans or
acceptance credits, finance leases or hire purchase commitments or guarantees or material contingent liabilities.
LISTING EXPENSES
As of December 31, 2012, we had incurred expenses in connection with the Listing of RMB 9.7 million, which were accounted for as our administrative expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2012. We expect to further incur an additional RMB37.1 million to RMB47.6 million of expenses in connection with the Listing, which are
subject to adjustments to be agreed by the Company, the Joint Sponsors and other parties. We do not believe the additional expenses will have a material impact on our
results of operations.

(1)         Inventory turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the opening and closing balances of inventories for the year by cost of sales in that
year and multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, inventory turnover days in 2010 is calculated by dividing the
arithmetic mean of the balance of inventories as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by cost of sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on
December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(2)         The average trade and bill payable turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of opening and ending balance of trade and bill payable for the
year by cost of sales in the year and then multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average trade and bill
payables turnover days in 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill payables as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by cost of
sales for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(3)         The average trade and bill receivable turnover days are calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of opening and ending balance of trade and bill receivables for
the year by revenue in that year and then multiplying by 360 days. As we did not have any commercial production until March 18, 2010, the average trade and bill
receivables turnover days in 2010 is calculated by dividing the arithmetic mean of the balance of trade and bill receivables as of March 18 and December 31, 2010 by
revenue for the period beginning on March 18, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010, and multiplying by 280 days.
(4)         Gearing ratio is calculated by dividing total interest-bearing debt by total capital at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%. Interest-bearing debt includes
interest-bearing loans and mining rights payables. Capital includes total equity and interest-bearing debt.
(5)         Gross margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue at the end of the year and multiplying by 100%.
Inventory turnover days
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our inventory turnover days were 49 days, 26 days, and 31 days, respectively. Our inventory turnover days was higher in 2010 than in 2011 and
2012 mainly because of lower sales, which resulted in a higher level of inventory in 2010.
146
Average Trade and Bill Payable Turnover Days
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our average trade and bill payable turnover days were 660 days, 362 days, and 325 days, respectively. Our average trade and bill payable
turnover days were significantly higher in 2010 than in 2011 and 2012 primarily because we had a higher amount of payables relating to construction and other non-
operating activities, which generally have a longer payment periods than trade and bill payables relating to operating activities.
Average Trade and Bill Receivable Turnover Days
In 2010, 2011 and 2012, our average trade and bill receivable turnover days were 29 days, 61 days, and 101 days, respectively. Our average trade and bill receivable
turnover days increased significantly in 2012 mainly due to certain of our power producer customers taking a longer amount of time to settle payments due to certain
operating difficulties.

As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our gearing ratio was 47.5%, 60.4% and 68.8%, respectively. Our gearing ratio increased throughout the Track Record Period
as we increased our interest-bearing borrowings to support the growth of our business and meet our capital expenditure requirements.
Gross Margin
As of December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our gross margin was 34.2%, 29.4% and 32.4%, respectively.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the Latest Practicable Date, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into any derivative
transactions for trading purposes.
MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE
We are exposed to various types of market risks in the ordinary course of business, including credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We
have not used any derivatives or other instruments for hedging purposes.
Credit Risk
We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our trade receivables, bill receivables and our cash deposits.
147
Trade Receivables
Our trade receivables are mainly derived from anthracite coal sales and are typically unsecured. We mitigate the credit risks relating to our trade receivables by
performing credit evaluations and monitoring outstanding balances of our trade receivables regularly. We recognize impairment for trade receivables primarily based on
our historical write-off experience, the age of the outstanding balances and other factors regarding the specific customer’s credit-worthiness and current market
conditions. We have not recognized any provision for impairment of trade receivables in 2010, 2011 or 2012. Our largest five customers accounted for 66.6%, 73.5%
and 56.7% of our revenue in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our outstanding trade receivables from our largest five customers accounted for 59.4%, 84.2% and
87.2% of our total trade receivables in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Bill Receivables
Bill receivables represent letters of credit obtained by our customers to finance purchases which have been presented to banks for payment after delivery of goods to
customers. As of December 31, 2012, all of our outstanding bills receivables were guaranteed by financial institutions. Bill receivables typically have a term of maturity
of six months.
Cash and Term Deposits
We maintain our cash and cash deposits primarily with PRC state-owned banks and Hong Kong-based financial institutions which we believe are of high credit quality.
We perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions.
Commodity Price Risk
Our main exposure to commodity price risk relates to fluctuations in the average selling prices of anthracite coal, which are affected to a significant extent by the market
price of anthracite coal in Guizhou. Anthracite coal prices can fluctuate significantly and are affected by many factors beyond our control. We have not engaged in any
hedging transactions to manage our commodity price risk. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis illustrating the effects of a 10% increase or decrease in the average
selling price of our anthracite coal on our revenue and gross profit for the periods indicated:

Our financial statements are presented in, and our functional currency is, Renminbi. The Renminbi is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. The SAFE, under the
authority of the PBOC, controls the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies. The value of Renminbi is subject to changes in PRC Government policies and
international economic and political developments which affect the supply and demand of Renminbi. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the
PBOC or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the PBOC.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to the interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term obligations with floating interest rates, including certain long-term bank loans and other
borrowings and mining rights payables. We have not entered into any interest rate swaps or any other hedging transactions to manage our interest rate risks. As of
December 31, 2012, 87.5% of the total outstanding principal amounts of our bank loans, and all of our mining right payables, had floating interest rates. Set forth below
is a
149
sensitivity analysis illustrating the effects of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on our long-term interest-bearing loans and mining right payables

151
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS
OUR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR RETAINED BUSINESSES
As of the Latest Practicable Date, Mr. Li Feilie, through its 100% shareholding in Laitan Investments, indirectly held 100% of the issued share capital of Feishang, which
in turn held approximately 58.13% of the issued share capital of CHNR. Mr. Li also directly held approximately 1.2% of the issued share capital of CHNR as of the
Latest Practicable Date.
The Distribution will be satisfied wholly by way of a distribution in specie to all CHNR Shareholders of an aggregate of 124,554,580 Shares, representing 100% of the
issued share capital of our Company, in proportion to their respective shareholdings in CHNR on the Distribution Record Date. Pursuant to the Distribution, the CHNR
Shareholders will be entitled to five Shares for every CHNR Share held on the Distribution Record Date. As a result, following completion of the Spin-off, although CHNR
will no longer hold any interest in our Company, Mr. Li Feilie, Laitan Investments and Feishang will continue to be our Controlling Shareholders and the controlling
shareholders of CHNR. In addition to his interests in CHNR and our Company, Mr. Li also engages in other businesses through his approximately 60.74% interest in
Feishang Enterprise. The following is a summary of the businesses conducted by our Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Enterprise. None of these businesses
compete with our business.
Nonferrous metal and non-metal mineral mining
·                  Copper. Feishang Enterprise, through its subsidiary, holds 49% of the equity interest in Wuhu Hengxin Copper Industrial Group Co., Ltd., which in turn holds
28.74% of the equity interest in Anhui Xinke New Materials Co. Ltd., a company whose shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Wuhu Hengxin Copper
Industrial Group Co., Ltd. is engaged in the copper refining business and Anhui Xinke New Materials Co. Ltd. is involved in the production of copper-based alloy
materials.
·                  Iron, zinc and other nonferrous metals. In addition to coal mining operations which are conducted through our Company, CHNR is also engaged in the
exploration, mineral extraction, processing and sales of iron, zinc and other nonferrous metals extracted or produced at mines primarily located in Anhui province of the
PRC. These operations are conducted by Wuhu Feishang and Yunnan Feishang, through which the CHNR Group owns and has the right to operate Yangchong Mine,
Sichong Mine, Baiguochong Mine and Luojiachong Mine.
·                  Non-metals minerals. Anhui Xinke New Materials Co. Ltd., a company which is held as to 28.74% by Wuhu Hengxin Copper Industrial Group Co., Ltd. which in
turn is held as to 49% by Feishang Enterprise through its subsidiaries, also produces and sells non-metal minerals and materials such as carbon fiber reinforced metal
matrix composite, rare and precious metals, and porcelain. In addition, Feishang, through its indirect subsidiary, Wuhu Feishang Non-Metal Materials Co., Ltd., mines,
produces and sells bentonite.
152
Meager-lean coal
The Sanjiazhai Mine
Feishang Enterprise, pursuant to a trust arrangement, controls 100% of the equity interest in Guizhou Jusheng Energy Co., Ltd. which in turn owns and operates the
Sanjiazhai Mine. The Sanjiazhai Mine is a meager-lean coal mine located in Liuzhi county of Guizhou province. The Sanjiazhai Mine was acquired by Feishang
Enterprise on November 29, 2010 to provide upstream supply coal to its steel business and will be retained by Feishang Enterprise following the Spin-off. The Sanjiazhai
Mine will not form a part of our business upon completion of the Spin-off for the following reasons:
·                  The Sanjiazhai Mine produces meager-lean coal rather than anthracite coal as produced by our anthracite coal mines, and does not have a meaningful
portfolio of anthracite coal. It also has only an expected annual production capacity of 150,000 tonnes of meager-lean coal, and an expected reserve of 8.42 million
tonnes of meager-lean coal under the PRC Solid Mineral Resources/Reserves Classification Code.
·                  The Sanjiazhai Mine does not satisfy the listing requirements under Chapter 18 of the Listing Rules. As of June 30, 2013, the Sanjiazhai Mine remained in the
pilot run stage.
Our Directors believe that there is generally no competition between our core business and the operations of the Sanjiazhai Mine for the following reasons:
·                  The Sanjiazhai Mine produces meager-lean coal rather than anthracite coal, which has different uses and is expected to be used primarily by Feishang
Enterprise in its steel business.
·                  The Sanjiazhai Mine is limited in scale with an expected reserve of 8.42 million tonnes of meager-lean coal under the PRC Solid Mineral Resources/Reserves
Classification Code, compared to our Company’s proved and probable reserves of approximately 210.28 million tonnes.
Feishang Energy and Guizhou Puxin and their statuses as coal mine consolidators in Guizhou
On July 16, 2013, the Energy Bureau of Guizhou Province issued a confirmation letter which stated the following:
·                  Feishang Energy, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Feishang Enterprise, is one of the coal enterprises that have been assessed as meeting the
requirements to be a coal mine consolidator in Guizhou under the notice published by the Office of Guizhou Coal Enterprises Consolidation Leading Group on
February 28, 2013.
153
·                  as Feishang Energy has been assessed as meeting the requirements to be a coal mine consolidator and Guizhou Puxin (including its subsidiaries and their
anthracite coal mines) is an affiliated entity of Feishang Energy, Guizhou Puxin will also be deemed to meet the requirements to be a coal mine consolidator in Guizhou.
·                  Accordingly, Guizhou Puxin (including its subsidiaries and their anthracite coal mines) would not be subject to consolidation or required to be closed down
under Guizhou’s consolidation policies. In particular, Guizhou Puxin would not be the subject of or be subject to the acquisition or consolidation by other third party coal
mine consolidators in Guizhou.
·                  Upon the request of the relevant government authorities in Guizhou to acquire or consolidate another coal mine or coal enterprise in Guizhou (the
“Consolidation Opportunity”), the ultimate beneficial shareholder of Feishang Energy and Guizhou Puxin may designate either one of them to be the primary consolidator
or acquirer.
Notwithstanding that Feishang Energy will not form part of our Company following the Listing, our Directors believe that there is generally no competition between our
core business and the operations of Feishang Energy for the following reasons:
·                  Feishang Energy has provided certain non-competition undertakings in our favor, the details of which are set out in “— Deed of Non-Competition.” Such
undertakings will take effect on the Listing Date and will remain in full force and be terminated until the date on which Feishang Enterprises ceases to be qualified as a
coal mine consolidator in Guizhou.
·                  As a result of Feishang Energy’s non-competition undertakings and Guizhou Puxin’s status as a qualified consolidator of coal mines and coal enterprises in
Guizhou:
·                  Feishang Energy may not engage in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our core businesses.
·                  Feishang Energy must give us the first opportunity to utilize any Consolidation Opportunity and to use its best endeavours to procure that such opportunities
are first offered to us.
·                  We (through Guizhou Puxin) may selectively pursue Consolidation Opportunities which are appropriate for our business and operations of producing high
quality anthracite coal products.
·                  We (through Guizhou Puxin) may further exercise our right to purchase from Feishang Energy any interest in coal mines or coal enterprises which was first
offered to, but had not been acquired by, Guizhou Puxin and are acquired by Feishang Energy, as and when we consider such opportunities to be appropriate for our
business and operations of producing high quality anthracite coal products.
154
Forestry
Feishang Enterprise owns slash pine plantations in Jiangxi. Through its subsidiary, Jiangxi Feishang Forestry Co., Ltd., Feishang Enterprise engages in the production,
sales and research and development of rosin and the processing of abietic resin and turpentine. Through its subsidiary, Taihe Feishang Forestry Co., Ltd., Feishang
Enterprise engages in the production of tackifying resin, resin coating and polyamide resin.
Other businesses
Feishang Enterprise, through its indirect subsidiary, Wuhu Port Company Limited, provides port services. Wuhu Port Company Limited, in turn, through its 25.86%
interest in Wuhu Port Storage and Transportation Company Limited, a company whose shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, provides modern logistics
services comprising loading, storage, transportation and trading.
DEED OF NON-COMPETITION
The Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy have executed the Deed of Non-Competition in our favor on       2013, pursuant to which each of them has
undertaken to:
·                  not, and procure that their respective subsidiaries or parties controlled by them either solely or jointly with another Controlling Shareholder or any other party
(“Affiliates”) will not, either on their own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly, be interested or engaged in or
acquire or hold any right or interest (in each case whether as a shareholder, partner, agent or otherwise) in any business which directly or indirectly competes or may so
compete with the Core Businesses;
·                  notify our Company of any business opportunity which directly or indirectly competes or may so compete with the Core Businesses (“New Business
Opportunity”), if any of them becomes aware of such business opportunity; and
·                  use its best endeavours to procure that the New Business Opportunity is first offered to our Company on terms and conditions that are fair and reasonable.
For the purpose of the Deed of Non-Competition, “Core Businesses” shall include the acquisition and exploitation of coal mining rights (including the exploration,
construction, development and operation of coal mines) located in Guizhou province in the PRC.
155
Each of the Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy also unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to grant to us the following options and pre-emptive rights:
·                  options to purchase on the basis of valuations conducted by an independent qualified valuer jointly appointed by the relevant Controlling Shareholder,
Feishang Energy and us, subject to any relevant laws and applicable listing rules and existing third party pre-emptive rights:
·                  any interest in the relevant Controlling Shareholder’s or Feishang Energy’s business, including any business of their respective Affiliates, which directly or
indirectly competes or is likely to compete with the Core Businesses; and
·                  any interest in any business of a Controlling Shareholder or Feishang Energy or their respective Affiliates resulting from a New Business Opportunity which
has been offered to us, but has not been purchased by us, and has been retained by a Controlling Shareholder, Feishang Energy or their respective Affiliates; and
·                  pre-emptive rights to purchase on fair and reasonable terms any new or existing business of the Controlling Shareholders, Feishang Energy or any of their
respective Affiliates that directly or indirectly competes, or may so compete with the Core Businesses, subject to any relevant laws and applicable listing rules and
existing third party pre-emptive rights.
The Deed of Non-Competition does not restrict each of the Controlling Shareholders, Feishang Energy and their respective Affiliates to:
·                  hold, directly or indirectly securities of any company listed on the Stock Exchange or other recognized stock exchange which is primarily engaged in any Core
Business provided that the interests of the relevant Controlling Shareholder and its Affiliates or Feishang Energy and its Affiliate, in each case, in such company
represents in aggregate not more than 5% of the total issued share capital of such company and that the relevant Controlling Shareholder and its Affiliates or Feishang
Energy and its Affiliates, in each case, individually or together, are not in control of the board of directors of such company;
·                  hold shares and other securities in us and our subsidiaries or Feishang Energy; and/or
·                  hold shares and other securities of any company listed on the Stock Exchange or other stock exchange whose primary business is not the Core Businesses.
Furthermore, each of the Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy undertakes to us to provide an annual confirmation to us and our independent non-executive
Directors regarding their compliance and the compliance of their Affiliates (as relevant) with the Deed of Non-Competition.
We will disclose the review by our independent non-executive Directors of the compliance, and enforcement of, the Deed of Non-Competition in our annual report or by
way of announcement to the public in compliance with the requirements of the Listing Rules. In the event any New Business
156
Opportunities presented by or otherwise arising in connection with any of the Controlling Shareholders or Feishang Energy are turned down by us according to the Deed
of Non-Competition, we will disclose the decision, as well as the basis for such decision in our annual report or interim report.
The Deed of Non-Competition will take effect on the Listing Date and will remain in full force and be terminated:
·                  in respect of the Controlling Shareholders, upon the earlier of:
i.                  the date on which the relevant Controlling Shareholders and/or their Affiliates cease to be a controlling shareholder of us within the meaning of the Listing
Rules;
ii.               the date on which our Shares cease to be listed on the Stock Exchange; and
iii.            the date on which our Company ceases to engage in the Core Businesses; and
·                  in respect of Feishang Energy only, on the date on which it ceases to be qualified as a coal mine consolidator in Guizhou.
For the avoidance of doubt, CHNR, together with its subsidiaries and the parties controlled by it, will become an Affiliate of Mr. Li Feilie upon the completion of the Spin-
off and be subject to the relevant undertakings set forth above.
INDEPENDENCE FROM OUR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS
Our Directors confirm that, for the reasons set forth below, we will be able to conduct our business independently of our Controlling Shareholders and their respective
associates following the Listing and completion of the Spin-off.
Management independence
Feishang Enterprise, Feishang, Laitan Investments, CHNR and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and our Company, on the other hand, have boards of directors or
equivalent decision making bodies that function independently of each other. While Mr. Li Feilie overlaps as a director between the respective boards of directors of
Feishang Enterprise, CHNR and our Company, he will spend the necessary time and attention required as an executive Director of our Company to formulate an overall
business strategy and oversee the corporate development of our Company. There will not be any other Directors who also serve on the board of directors of CHNR upon
completion of the Spin-off.
Each of our Directors is aware of his or her fiduciary duties as a Director which require, among other things, that he or she acts for the benefit and in the best interests
of our Company and does not allow any conflict between his or her duties as a Director and his or her personal interest. In the event
157
there is a potential conflict of interest arising out of any transaction to be entered into between our Company and our Directors or their respective associates, the
interested Director(s) will, if his or her or any of his or her associates’ interest in such contract or arrangement is material, declare the nature of his or her interest in
accordance with the Articles of Association and will not vote on or be counted in the quorum for any resolution of the Board in respect of such contract or arrangement
unless so authorized by the Articles of Association.
The Directors have confirmed that they do not have any interests in any business which directly or indirectly competes or is likely to compete, directly or indirectly, with
the Core Businesses as of the date of this listing document.
Business operations
We are engaged mainly, among other things, in the production and sale of anthracite coal. We have full rights to make decisions on and to carry out our own business
and operations independently. The principal supplies and equipment we use are generally widely available and we are not dependent on the Controlling Shareholders for
such supplies and equipment. We also have direct and close contact with our customers without dependence on the Controlling Shareholders for market access.
Moreover, we have sufficient capital, equipment and employees to operate our business independently.
Operational independence
Our operational decisions are made by our Directors and senior management. We have established our own set of organizational structure made up of individual
departments, each with specific areas of responsibilities. We have also established a set of internal controls to facilitate the effective operation of our business.
Financial independence
We have established an independent finance department responsible for discharging the treasury, accounting, reporting, group credit and internal control functions
independent from the Controlling Shareholders and their subsidiaries (excluding our Company). In addition, we have established our bank accounts independent of our
Controlling Shareholders. We also make tax registrations independently of our Controlling Shareholders and pay taxes independently of our Controlling Shareholders
pursuant to applicable laws. We have employed a sufficient number of dedicated financial accounting personnel responsible for financial auditing of our accounts.
During the Track Record Period and thereafter, our Controlling Shareholders and their subsidiaries have provided certain financial assistance to our Company in the form
of shareholders’ loans and guarantees.

The Entrusted Loan was made available by Feishang Management as the entrusting party, through the Chongqing branch of China Minsheng Bank as the lender, to
Guizhou Puxin as the borrower. We intend to repay the Entrusted Loan as soon as possible, in any event no later than six months after the Listing using a combination
of working capital and/or securing new bank loans. Proceeds from the Entrusted Loan was applied to replace certain inter-company loans which were not compliant with
the relevant PRC regulations on intercompany lending.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, the total amount of loans subject to the Connected Guarantees was approximately RMB1,315.0 million, representing approximately
60.3% of the total borrowings of our Company.
For the reasons set forth below, our Directors and the Joint Sponsors are of the view that we are able to operate financially independently of our Controlling
Shareholders.
Release of Connected Guarantees
We have obtained in-principle consents from each of China Minsheng Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of Communications, Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, China Everbright Bank, Bank of Chongqing and Huachuang Securities to release all of the Connected Guarantees, to be effective upon Listing and the completion
of certain administrative procedures of the lenders, which is expected to be completed approximately three months after the Listing.
Accordingly, all Connected Guarantees given by Mr. Li Feilie, Feishang Enterprise, Wuhu Port, WFID and Feishang Energy in respect of our loans will be replaced by
guarantees to be provided by our Company in favor of the respective lending banks on similar terms within three months after the Listing. The additional timing to
release such Connected Guarantees post-Listing is required to (1) complete certain administrative procedures of the banks and (2) enter into new loan agreements and
guarantee contracts by our Company in connection with the replacement of such guarantees following the Listing.
We believe that the in-principle consents for the replacement of all of our Connected Guarantees by guarantees to be given by our Company demonstrate that we are
able to obtain new financing and extend existing financing from commercial banks on market terms without guarantee or security from our Controlling Shareholders or
their subsidiaries (excluding our Company) following the Listing.
Other forms of independent financing
China Minsheng Bank has committed to provide our Company with a term loan of up to RMB1.6 billion aggregate principal amount. Such term loan may be drawn down
before July 18, 2014. A legally-binding commitment letter was entered into by China Minsheng Bank in our favor in July 2013 and the credit facility will be provided
without the assistance of our Controlling Shareholders or their subsidiaries (excluding our Company).
The drawdown of such facility will be subject to customary conditions regarding no material adverse changes to our Company’s financial position and final internal
assessment by and administrative procedures of China Minsheng Bank.
162
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our Board will consist of not less than three independent non-executive Directors to ensure that our Board is able to effectively exercise independent judgment in its
decision-making process and provide independent advice to our Shareholders. We will ensure that our independent non-executive Directors are of sufficient caliber,
knowledge and experience, have no connections or relationship with us or our connected persons and will carry weight in our decision-making process.
We have adopted the following decision-making procedures for matters or transactions with potential conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and our
Controlling Shareholders and their subsidiaries, on the other hand:
·                  The Articles of Association require the Directors to declare material interests. The Articles of Association provide that if a Director is in any way interested in a
contract, transaction or arrangement with the Company (including one that is proposed), the Director shall declare the nature of such interest at the earliest opportunity
at which it is practicable for him or her to do so.
·                  The Articles of Association require that the Directors with material interests shall not vote nor be counted in quorum. Subject to certain exceptions, the
Articles of Association provide that a Director shall not vote (nor shall he or she be counted in the quorum) on any resolution of our Board approving any contract,
arrangement or proposal in which he or she, or any of his or her associates, is, to his or her knowledge, materially interested. If he or she votes, his or her vote will not
be counted (nor will he or she be counted in the quorum for that resolution). The Articles of Association require a Director to excuse himself or herself from voting in the
event the Director has any conflicts of interest.
·                  Audit, nomination and remuneration committees. We have established an audit committee, a nomination committee and a remuneration committee to assess
and control, and ensure our Board is appropriately advised as to, matters relating to (among other things) our relationship with our external auditors and our internal audit
function, the remuneration of the Directors and our senior management, and the composition of the Board. Our audit committee comprises non-executive Directors and
each of our nomination committee and remuneration committee comprises a majority of independent non-executive Directors. Moreover, the chairman of each of our
audit, nomination and remuneration committees is an independent non-executive Director. For the composition of, and other details relating to, these committees, see
“Directors and Senior Management.”
·                  Appointment of compliance adviser. We expect to enter into an agreement with a compliance adviser,      , to provide us with professional advice and
guidance in respect of compliance with the Listing Rules and relevant applicable laws.
163
In addition, the following measures will be adopted by us in respect of the enforceability of the Deed of Non-Competition:
·                  Compliance with Deed of Non-Competition. The independent non-executive Directors will review, on an annual basis, the Controlling Shareholders’ and
Feishang Energy’s compliance with the Deed of Non-Competition and we will disclose the results of such review and the enforcement of (if any) the Deed of Non-
Competition in our annual report or by way of announcement to the public in compliance with the requirements of the Listing Rules. Our Controlling Shareholders and
Feishang Energy have undertaken to us that they will provide all information necessary for the annual review by our independent non-executive Directors and the
enforcement of the Deed of Non-Competition. Our Controlling Shareholders and Feishang Energy have further undertaken to us that each of them will make an annual
confirmation as to compliance with the Deed of Non-Competition in our annual report.
·                  New business opportunities. Any New Business Opportunities under the Deed of Non-Competition (including to exercise or not to exercise any option under
the Deed of Non-Competition) and all other matters determined by our Board as having a potential conflict of interest with the Controlling Shareholders or Feishang
Energy will be referred to our independent non-executive Directors for discussion and decision. When necessary, these Directors will engage an independent financial
advisor to advise them on these matters. In the event any New Business Opportunities presented by or otherwise arising in connection with any of the Controlling
Shareholders or Feishang Energy are turned down by us according to the Deed of Non-Competition, we will disclose the decision, as well as the basis for such decision
in our annual report or interim report.
·                  Disclosure of new opportunities. Our annual report will include the views and decisions, with bases, of our independent non-executive Directors on whether to
take up any new opportunities under the Deed of Non-Competition (including to exercise or not to exercise any option under the Deed of Non-Competition) or other
matters having a potential conflict of interest with the Controlling Shareholders or Feishang Energy that have been referred to the independent non-executive Directors.
Moreover, any transaction that is proposed between us and any of our Controlling Shareholders will be required to comply with the then requirements of the Listing
Rules, including, where applicable, the announcement, reporting and independent shareholders’ approval requirements.
Based on the above, our Board is satisfied that there are sufficient and effective preventive measures to manage conflicts of interest and our Board is able to operate
independently of the Controlling Shareholders.

Resources Limited as at 30 April 2013 Behre Dolbear Project 13-060
Gentlemen:
Behre Dolbear Asia, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Behre Dolbear Group, Inc., located at the address noted below, herewith submits its updated Independent
Technical Review (the “Competent Person’s Report”) of Seven Coal Properties in Guizhou Province, the People’s Republic of China. Behre Dolbear Asia, Inc. is herein
referred to as “BD Asia” or “Behre Dolbear.” The original version of this report was submitted to China Natural Resources, Inc. (CHNR) in September 2011. At CHNR’s
request, this updated Competent Person’s Report is being submitted to Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited (“Feishang” or “Company”). The Company is preparing
for a proposed listing of its shares (Listing) on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK).
This Competent Person’s Report covers all seven underground coal mines of the Company (Mines) and coal mining properties (Properties) in Guizhou Province. The
Mines are currently at various stages of construction, development, and operation. Behre Dolbear’s experts visited the Mines during the period from 05 through 11
May 2011, again during the period from 22 through 26 October 2012, and again during the period from 03 through 06 May 2013.
The purpose of this Competent Person’s Report is to provide an independent technical assessment of the Company’s coal mining properties to be included in the listing
document for the Listing. This Competent Person’s Report has been prepared in accordance with the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong Limited (Listing Rules), in particular, the requirements of Chapter 18 of the Listing Rules, and therefore, constitutes a Competent Person’s Report under
the Listing Rules. The reporting standard adopted by this Competent Person’s Report is the Code for Technical Assessment and Valuation of Mineral and Petroleum
Assets and Securities for

Independent Expert Reports, as adopted by the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in 1995 and updated in 2005 (VALMIN Code). Mineral resources and ore
reserves defined for the properties have been reviewed for conformity with the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore
Reserves prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC Code) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and
Minerals Council of Australia in 1999 and revised in 2004.
This Competent Person’s Report comprises an introduction, followed by a review of the technical aspects of the above matters and a summary risk analysis. We trust
that this Competent Person’s Report adequately and appropriately highlights the critical technical aspects of the Mines and Properties under review and addresses all
risk elements of significance.
The evidence upon which the estimated coal resources and coal reserves are based includes the deposit geology, drilling, and sampling information, project economics,
and past production history. The basis upon which Behre Dolbear formed its view on the coal resource and coal reserve estimates also includes the site visits of Behre
Dolbear’s professionals to all the reviewed coal mining properties, interviews of the Company’s site personnel, analysis of the drilling and sampling database, procedures
and parameters used for the estimates, and a comparison with past production.
The Behre Dolbear project team consisted of senior-level mining professionals from Behre Dolbear’s Denver office in the United States, the Hong Kong office in China,
and the Toronto office in Canada. The scope of work conducted by Behre Dolbear included site visits to all the mining properties, technical analysis of the project
geology, coal resource and coal reserve estimates, review of the mining, production, operating and capital costs, economic analysis, environmental assessment,
occupational health and safety issues, and compilation of this Competent Person’s Report.
Neither Behre Dolbear nor any of its partners, officers, employees, or associates involved in the preparation of this Competent Person’s Report has any direct or indirect
economic, beneficial or ownership interests of any kind (whether in the past, present or contingent) in the Company, its coal mining properties, any of its assets being
reported on or any group, holding or associated company of the Company. None of Behre Dolbear’s partners, officers, employees, or associates is an officer, employee,
or proposed officer of the Company or any group, holding, or associated company of the Company. Behre Dolbear is to receive a fee for its services (the work product of
which includes this Competent Person’s Report) at its normal commercial rate and customary payment schedules. Payment of Behre Dolbear’s professional fee is not
contingent upon the outcome of this Competent Person’s Report.
Behre Dolbear confirms that it is not a group, holding, or associated company of the Company. Behre Dolbear does not have any claims outstanding with the Company,
its assets, or any group, holding or associated company of the Company.
Pursuant to the terms of Behre Dolbear’s engagement in respect of this assignment, CHNR has agreed to release, defend, and indemnify Behre Dolbear from and
against certain liabilities arising from the performance of its services. The Company has not indemnified Behre Dolbear for this assignment.
III-3
This Competent Person’s Report documents Behre Dolbear’s findings with respect to the Company’s Mines, coal-bearing properties, and coal resources and reserves of
the Mines as of 30 April 2013. This incorporates the Company’s statements with respect to past and current production costs and certain financial models provided by
the Company to Behre Dolbear.
This Competent Person’s Report is based on information compiled by Mr. Norris E. Brooks, who is a member of the Mining & Metallurgical Society of America and is a
Senior Associate of Behre Dolbear. Mr. Brooks has sufficient experience, which is relevant to the style of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and to
the activity that he is undertaking, to qualify as Competent Person, as defined in the JORC Code and Chapter 18 of the Listing Rules. Mr. Brooks, as the Competent
Person, takes overall responsibility for this Competent Person’s Report for the purpose of Chapter 18 of the Listing Rules. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Brooks’
overall responsibility as Competent Person does not in any way reduce or limit the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities of Behre Dolbear in respect of the issuance
and submission of this Competent Person’s Report.
Except as specifically noted in this Competent Person’s Report, Behre Dolbear confirms that it is not aware of any material changes to the mining operations of the
Company other than the on-going production and Mine expansion construction since the date of this report.
As of the date of this report, Behre Dolbear has reviewed and commented on the Company’s regulatory compliance, permit status, and license approval status using
criteria that are consistent with the standards of the industry. The impact of new or revised laws, rules, or restrictions that might be imposed on future exploration,
development, or operations of the Mines after the date of this report cannot be anticipated.
The sole purpose of this Competent Person’s Report is for use by the Company and its Sponsors in connection with the Listing. This Competent Person’s Report cannot
be used or relied upon for any other purpose. Neither the whole, nor any part, of this Competent Person’s Report, nor any reference thereto may be included in, with or
attached to any document or used for any other purpose without Behre Dolbear’s written consent to the form and context in which it appears.
Yours faithfully,
BEHRE DOLBEAR ASIA, INC.

In 2009 and 2010, China Natural Resources, Inc. (CHNR) acquired the entire or majority equity interest in seven underground anthracite coal mines in Guizhou Province,
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Under a Consulting Services Agreement, dated 14 March 2011, CHNR engaged Behre Dolbear Asia, Inc. (“BD Asia” or “Behre
Dolbear”) to conduct an Independent Technical Review (ITR) of CHNR’s interests in the seven coal mining operations (Mines) and the properties upon which they
operate (Properties) to support a listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. As of the transmittal date of this report, CHNR remains listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
For the development of the ITR, a team of Behre Dolbear experts visited the Mines and the Properties during the period from 05 May 2011 through 11 May 2011. That
report was prepared by relying upon information gathered during that site visit and using data and information provided by CHNR and its subsidiaries (CHNR Group). This
included extensive information regarding the Mines and the Properties, forecasted expansion and development activities, resultant production, and capital and operating
cost forecasts. Based upon the information provided by the CHNR Group at that time, Behre Dolbear believed that the plans and schedules were reasonably consistent
with generally accepted international standards for such activities.
A report titled “INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF SEVEN COAL MINES” (September 2011 ITR) was submitted to CHNR in September 2011. The purpose of the
September 2011 ITR was to comply with certain requirements under Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S.
SEC).
Under a subsequent Consulting Services Agreement, dated 04 July 2012, CHNR engaged Behre Dolbear to update the information in the September 2011 ITR. This
report (Updated ITR) provides the most recent ITR of the Mines and Properties. The Updated ITR is intended to be included in the listing document of a wholly owned
subsidiary of CHNR, Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited (Company), for the purpose of its proposed listing on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
Limited (SEHK).
The following chart sets out the structure under which the Mines and Properties and their mining related activities are owned, and their operations are held by the
Company and its subsidiaries (Group).

CORPORATE STRUCTURE
III-11
(1)                                 The remaining 1% equity interest is held by Mr. Zheng Shengjian, a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
(2)                                 The remaining 1% equity interest is held by Mr. Huang Bin, a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
(3)                                 The remaining 1% equity interest is held by Mr. Cai Songqing, a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
(4)                                 The remaining 1% equity interest is held by Mr. Li Shenggen, a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
(5)                                 The remaining 30% equity interest is held by Yangpu Wanshun Energy Co. Ltd., a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
(6)                                 The remaining 30% equity interest is held by Yangpu Wanshun Energy Co. Ltd., a third party independent of CHNR Group (including our Group).
BD Asia began its initial review of the information to be contained in the update; however, early in the review, it became apparent that many of the permitting, expansion,
and upgrading schedules presented to BD Asia in 2011 and included in the September 2011 ITR had not been met.
It is BD Asia’s opinion that the delays are due, in part, to the unpredictability of Chinese national and provincial government actions. For example:
(1)                                 Certain mining and/or development activities in all Guizhou Province coal mines have been suspended for varying periods since the issuance of the
September 2011 ITR because of serious accidents in certain (non-CHNR Group) Guizhou Province coal mines. While the government agencies must be applauded for
efforts to improve safety, these actions were not anticipated or predicted by either the CHNR Group or Behre Dolbear during development of the September 2011 ITR.
(2)                                 Certain mining and/or development activity in Guizhou Province coal mines was suspended during a meeting of the Congress of Party
Representatives of Guizhou Province and also for a national conference of Party Representatives.
(3)                                 Permitting and licensing activities were delayed because of unanticipated difficulties in relocating project-affected households.
(4)                                 Mining activity was delayed as a result of the Guizhou government’s requirement for certain coal mines using drilling and blasting mining methods to
upgrade to semi-mechanical longwall mining methods.
In light of recent experience, the Group has made appropriate adjustments in its planning and scheduling and management has benefited from those experiences.
III-12
In the new engagement, BD Asia and the Group approached the Updated ITR with a fresh perspective, and did not simply carry forward information contained in the
September 2011 ITR. The disclosure of present-day information by the Group has permitted BD Asia to make an objective, current assessment of the subject matter.
During the period from 22 through 26 October 2012, the professionals responsible for the September 2011 ITR again visited the Mines and the Properties. BD Asia’s
experts made this second visit in order to:
·                                          better understand the nature of the 2011-2012 delays.
·                                          discuss new schedules for the expansion, upgrading, and permitting activities.
·                                          ascertain the actual progress at the Mines.
·                                          gather contemporary information regarding the Mines and the Properties.
·                                          facilitate an objective and current ITR.
Because of further delays, primarily due to unpredictable state-wide government actions, the BD Asia team made another site visit to the properties during the period
from 03 through 06 May 2013 in order to gather information of the effects of the new government policies and regulations on the project and to understand the status of
the Project Affected People (PAPs).
CORPORATE RECIPIENT OF UPDATED ITR
Prior to finalization of the Updated ITR, CHNR asked BD Asia to address the Updated ITR to “Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited” and provided the following
explanation for that request:
·                                          CHNR’s Chairman, Mr. Li, holds a 59.3% stake in CHNR through Feishang Group Limited, a company that is indirectly wholly owned by Chairman
Li.
·                                          The Mines, the Properties, and their mining related activities are owned and their operations are held through Feishang Anthracite Resources
Limited, which is 100% owned by CHNR. Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited plans to list its shares on the SEHK.
·                                          The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited requires the Updated ITR (which will form part of the
listing document to be published by Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited for the purpose of the listing) to be addressed to the entity that is seeking the listing m that
is, Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited.
·                                          CHNR has confirmed that all licenses, permits, etc. in respect of the Mines and Properties are either held or being applied through the PRC
subsidiary of Smartact Limited, the direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited. Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited holds all relevant
Mines and Properties that plan to be listed on the
III-13

1.1                               BACKGROUND
1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CHNR is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. CHNR’s head office and the offices of Feishang Anthracite Resources
Limited are located in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Guangdong Province of the People’s Republic of China (“China” or “PRC”). The offices that are responsible for the
Mines and the Properties are located in Guiyang, Guizhou Province of China.
Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHNR. Feishang holds all of its anthracite coal
Mines through wholly-or majority-owned subsidiaries.
In addition to its zinc and iron mine in Wuhu, Auhui Province, PRC, CHNR’s primary business is coal mining and coal sales, which it operates through the Company.
The Company currently controls and operates three underground anthracite coal Mines in Jinsha County, two underground anthracite coal mines in Nayong County, and
two underground anthracite coal mines in Liuzhi Special District, Guizhou Province. These properties are currently in production or at the construction stage of
development except for Gouchang where operations have been suspended since March 2013. CHNR and the Company plan to upgrade the production capacity of these
seven mines to a total of 5.8 million tonnes per year (Mtpa).
In September 2011, BD Asia developed an independent technical report to support certain CHNR filings on the NASDAQ Capital Market. BD Asia has been engaged to
update the September 2011 ITR using a format that meets the Chapter 18 requirements of the SEHK. The Updated ITR is to be filed with the SEHK in support of the
proposed listing of Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHNR.

III-16
1.2                               GEOLOGY
The Mines are located in the west and north regions of Guizhou Province. They are located in two different coal districts, the Zhina (Zhijin-Nayong) Coal District to the
west of Guiyang (the capital city of Guizhou Province) and the Qianbei Coal District to the north of Guiyang. The Zhina Coal District contains the Liujiaba Coal Mine,
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine, Dayuan Coal Mine, and Gouchang Coal Mine. The Qianbei Coal District contains Dayun Coal Mine, Yongsheng Coal Mine, and Baiping Coal Mine.
Geologically, both Qianbei and Zhina Coal Districts are located in the Central Guizhou Uplift of the Yangzhi Craton (see Figure 5.1). They are surrounded by boundary
faults on all directions. The Nayong Fault zone separates the Qianbei and Zhina Coal Districts.
The Qianbei Coal District is of relatively simple to medium geological structure. It has undergone limited structural deformation since the deposition of the Permian coal-
bearing strata. These coal-bearing strata have been gently and widely folded. Fault structures are from simple to medium developed in the Company’s three mines in the
Qianbei Coal District.
Thickness and continuity of the coal seams in the Qianbei Coal District is generally consistent in each Mine. Seam thicknesses range from less than 0.83 meters (m) to
2.77m.
The Zhina Coal District is of relatively simple to medium geological structure. It has undergone limited structural deformation since the deposition of the Late Permian
coal-bearing strata. These coal-bearing strata have been gently and widely folded. Normal fault structures are from simple to medium developed in the Company’s four
mines in the Zhina Coal District.
The thickness of the coal seams is generally consistent across each Mine in the Zhina Coal District. Seam thicknesses range from less than 0.5m to 8.3m.
1.3                               RESOURCES AND RESERVES
BD Asia estimates that the seven mining properties covered by this review hold approximately 126.8 million tonnes (Mt) of Measured, 200.2 Mt of Indicated, and 83.5
Mt of Inferred in-situ Coal Resources conforming to the definitions in the 2012 edition of The Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources
and Ore Reserves. Included within the in-situ resource are approximately 29.1 Mt of Proved and 181.2 Mt of Probable Coal Reserves, also conforming to the 2012 JORC
Code.
Wuhan Zhongnan Metallurgical Mineral Exploration and Resources Environment Engineering Co., Ltd. (WZMM) was engaged to develop independent coal resource
estimations and mine designs for the seven Properties that are now held by the Company. WZMM is an independent entity licensed to conduct exploration and resource
estimation for solid mineral resources, including coal, in China. WZMM completed the Chinese Resource and Reserve work at the Properties during the period from
December 2010 through March 2011. The contents and dates of those reports are discussed herein.
III-17
Furthermore, the Company’s subsidiaries had engaged the Jiangxi Provincial Coal Mining Design Institute (JPCM) to produce life-of-mine (LOM) mine plans and
production schedules at each Mine. JPCM is an independent entity licensed for the development of such geological and mining studies. The contents and dates of
those plans and schedules are discussed herein.
In part, BD Asia has based the opinions in this ITR upon the information contained in the WZMM and JPCM studies. BD Asia analyzed the data and conclusions in
those studies to determine the accuracy and completeness of that work. Those analyses included certain statistical tests to confirm the validity of the data and certain
cross-checking calculations to corroborate the conclusions of that work. Having been satisfied with the results of the WZMM and JPCM studies, BD Asia used that
information in developing this report. Using the WZMM and JPCM studies in conjunction with its own knowledge of coal-bearing properties, BD Asia examined the
Resources and Reserves of the following Properties:
·                                          Baiping Coal Mine
·                                          Yongsheng Coal Mine
·                                          Dayun Coal Mine
·                                          Gouchang Coal Mine
·                                          Dayuan Coal Mine
·                                          Liujiaba Coal Mine
·                                          Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
Following are the general observations made by BD Asia regarding the resources and reserves for the seven Mines.
·                                          BD Asia believes that the coal resource estimation database, procedures, and parameters applied by WZMM to the Company’s properties are
reasonable and appropriate.
·                                          BD Asia believes that the data density requirements for measured and indicated block definition used by WZMM for the estimates are reasonable
for JORC Code resource estimation for coal deposits of this type.
·                                          The resource and reserves calculated by WZMM and JPCM using the Chinese standards appear to be of high quality and to accurately reflect the
underlying drilling data.
·                                          The work was well organized and WZMM and JPCM personnel have a good understanding of the potentially minable portion of the in-situ resource
at the Properties.
III-18
1.4                               CHINESE RESOURCE ESTIMATE
WZMM estimated the in-situ resource at the Company’s properties using typical manual methods and government-approved techniques. The Chinese in-situ resource
estimate has been completed for only a portion of the seams at each property, as these are the seams that meet the Chinese standards for minable coal seams based
on coal type, depth, and seam orientation. At the Company’s Properties, the primary parameters used to determine the minable portion of the seams are:
·                                          Minimum thickness
·                                          Maximum ash content
·                                          Maximum sulfur content
·                                          Minimum heating value
0.70m to 0.80m (depending on the Mine)
40%
3%
22.1 Mj/kg
Using these parameters, WZMM determined that 38 different seams at the Mines have minable potential. They plotted each seam with thickness contours and
appropriate isopachs of ash, sulfur, and thermal value to determine those areas that meet the Chinese criteria. They divided the area on these plan maps and assigned
an estimation categorization using sampling density and spacing. They digitized the area, multiplied by thickness and apparent density, adjusted the volume if the dip of
the seam was greater than 10 degrees, and then tabulated the results.
Based on the techniques applied by WZMM, it was determined that the unmined in-situ tonnage estimate for these seven Mines is approximately 418 Mt of coal
classified in the Chinese system as 331, 332, and 333 resources. The estimate is shown by seam in Table 1.1.

BD Asia’s resource and reserve expert and geologist reviewed and verified the calculations completed by WZMM. BD Asia excluded some of the areas included in the
Chinese calculations because they do not conform to the 2012 JORC Code guidelines. BD Asia also found a small number of minor mathematical errors and these were
adjusted prior to estimating the in-situ resource conforming to JORC Code guidelines. Resources in Table 1.2 are inclusive of the Reserves.

1.6                               BD ASIA JORC CODE COAL RESERVE ESTIMATE
Based on the above in-situ resource, JPCM has developed a mine design and plan for extraction of the coal. They have excluded coal underneath the local villages and
protected areas, barrier pillars required for ventilation and haulage, and they have accounted for mining losses. BD Asia adjusted JPCM’s work to account for
production, mining losses, dilution and eliminated seams or parts of seams, which, because of interburden and seam thickness, may only be partially recoverable.

The differences in the tonnages from Table 1.2 and Table 1.3 reflect mining losses, un-mined coal left in place to protect the villages and surface facilities, pillars
between old mine working, and pillars necessary to support underground operations to recover the coal.
While the Company currently has tenure of the Coal Reserves and Resources at the Gouchang Coal Mine, the mine permit and production at this property has been
suspended due to a newly introduced consolidation policy in the Province until it has been consolidated with one of the adjacent coal mines. Alternately, the government
might allow the Company to develop a new mine design which incorporates an increased production capacity and then grant a mining permit without consolidation;
however, it is unclear at the present time if the government would rescind the consolidation order and issue the Company a new mining permit. In the event that the
Province ultimately requires the consolidation, the tenure of the Resources and Reserves at Gouchang could end up under the control of a different party or the
Company could increase their holdings depending on the Company’s negotiations with the adjacent mines. Behre Dolbear therefore believes the company’s tenure at
Gouchang could be at risk.
III-21
1.7                               COAL QUALITY
The coal produced at the Mines is classified as anthracite. Anthracite is characterized by high calorific values, low volatility, low impurities, high density, high ignition
point, and a long combustion time. Anthracite is suitable for use in the chemical industry (production of synthetic ammonia and methanol) as well as for use as thermal
coal for power generation, metallurgical applications (sintering, smelting, and injection in steel mills), and production of construction materials (cement). In the PRC,
anthracite is divided into lump and fine anthracite classifications. Lump anthracite is applicable to the chemical industry while fine anthracite has its primary applications
in the power and construction industries. It can also be sold as Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) products for the iron and steel industries. Fine anthracite can also be
used in the chemical industries.
BD Asia reviewed extensive drill core data and certain examples of washability data provided by the Company. The physical and chemical characteristics described in
the reviewed data indicate that the Company’s coals can generally be categorized as WY2 and WY3 anthracite products, as defined by the State Standard of China Coal
Classification System (GB5751-86). The data indicates that the vast majority of the Company’s coal is in the WY3 category, with dry volatile matter contents ranging
from 6.5% to 10.0%. The dry ash contents of the Company’s coals indicate that beneficiation (coal washing) may be required prior to utilization in some instances.
The Group provided specific data for the Baiping C5, Dayun M8, and Yongsheng C8 coal seams that confirm their applicability as PCI products. From seam to seam,
the Company has documented physical and chemical characteristics that are consistent with PCI Grades I, II, and III in accordance with State Standard of China Coal
Classification GB/T 1852-2008 for PCI coal definition.
1.8                               MINE DESCRIPTIONS AND PLANS
Baiping Coal Mine is located in Jinsha County. The Company holds a 70% interest in Baiping Coal Mine. The Mine was opened in 2008 with 2 slopes accessing the 5
mineable coal seams dipping at 8 degrees. A shaft was added in 2009. The Mine had an original design capacity of 300 kilotonnes per year (ktpa). Baiping Coal Mine is
currently operating under a 150 ktpa mining rights permit. Mine management will ultimately apply for a mining rights permit allowing 600 ktpa from 1 mechanical longwall.
Current production comes from Seam 12, which is approximately 2.2m thick, at an average depth of 120m.
Yongsheng Coal Mine is located in Jinsha County. The Company holds a 70% interest in Yongsheng Coal Mine. The Mine is currently in development construction
with no coal production. Development consists of over 13,000m of tunnels in limestone with a 1,000m conveyor belt providing access to a nearby river that is reportedly
navigable. The development tunnels will provide mining access to as many as 5 coal seams dipping approximately 10 degrees. By definition, the Chinese government
has declared coal seams thicker than 0.70m to be mineable and the law decrees they must be mined. Three of the 5 seams defined, as mineable, are less than 1.08m
thick. Behre Dolbear believes the seams less than 1.08m thick may be mineable; however, recovery will probably be less than mandated by law. Behre Dolbear has
discounted recovery of those seams to a percentage it believes is more likely to occur.
III-22
Yongsheng holds a mining rights permit for 600 ktpa from 2 mechanical longwalls with the initial test run planned for May 2013. The current design capacity is 900 ktpa
and is expected to increase to 1,800 ktpa in 2015 with the start-up of an additional mechanical longwall. Yongsheng is divided into an east block and a west block by a
significant vertical fault. Other minor faults are scattered throughout the mining blocks.
Dayun Coal Mine is located in Jinsha County. The Company is the sole owner of Dayun Coal Mine. Construction of the Mine commenced in May 2012. Initiation of
construction was delayed over relocation disagreements with the surrounding project-affected villagers. The local issues were to be mitigated by local government
authorities and during the update, the Company indicated that these issues are being resolved. Relocation is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. Dayun Coal
Mine obtained a 600 ktpa mining rights permit in March 2011. Initial production of 600 ktpa to 900 ktpa is proposed from 1 mechanical longwall unit beginning in
July 2015, increasing to 1,800 ktpa in 2017 with the addition of a second mechanical longwall unit. The Mine area contains 4 mineable seams dipping at angles between
8 degrees and 24 degrees.
Gouchang Coal Mine is located in Nayong County. The Company holds a 99% interest in Gouchang Coal Mine. Historical coal mining has occurred in and around this
area since the 1970s. Gouchang’s mining license covers an area of 1.7198 square kilometers (km2) and it has a permitted production capacity of 90 ktpa from 5
mineable seams dipping between 23 degrees and 36 degrees, with an average mineable seam thickness of 2.06m. Actual tonnes produced for the Years 2011 and 2012
were 96 kt and 53 kt, respectively.
Due to high methane emissions (12.44m3/t to 17.18m3/t) and the possibility of methane outbursts, the Gouchang Coal Mine was idled from March to August in 2012
pending a gas prevention and gas control assessment by government-approved gas testing agencies. The required gas control assessment has since been conducted.
As a result of the test, an approval JNYMT(2012) No. 278 was issued on 20 August 2012 and production resumed soon after. Production was from a manual longwall
using drilling and blasting methods with multiple manually operated single props for roof support at the face area. At the time of its October 2012 site visit Behre Dolbear
had been informed that the government of Guizhou Province had issued a circular issued by the State Administration, Work Safety No. 178 (2010), officially disallowing,
or severely limiting, coal production from using drilling and blasting methods. However, the Company recently stated that since Gouchang Coal Mine was confirmed prior
to issuance of that circular [No. 178 (2010)] it was permitted to continue operations with the manual longwall production method. Unfortunately, the recent Notice
QianNengYuanBan [2013] No. 120 Ref No. (QFGD-2013-29002) requires consolidation of coal mines in Guizhou Province that are considered to have a high possibility
of methane outburst and that have production capacities of less than 90 ktpa. As a result, operations at Gouchang Coal Mine have temporarily been suspended since
March 2013 pending possibility of consolidation with the neighboring mine to meet government set safety standards.
III-23
Dayuan Coal Mine is located in Nayong County. The Company holds a 99% interest in Dayuan Coal Mine. Construction for the Dayuan Coal Mine was initiated in
June 2009. Currently, Dayuan holds a mining permit with production capacity of 300 ktpa. There was no commercial production at Dayuan in 2011 or 2012. The Mine will
produce coal from 5 mineable coal seams dipping at approximately 19 degrees. The Company plans to apply for a mining rights permit allowing 450 ktpa in 2014. Coal
production and development have historically been from a manual longwall using drilling and blasting. As of 21 December 2010, management was required to switch to
semi-mechanical longwall methods using a Chinese-made shearer with multiple single props for face support after completion of the first working panel. The Company
reports that this Coal Mine was selected to participate in a pilot project for this type of mining. There have been delays in mining development due to government policy
changes. The issues have been dealt with including the completion of various methane control testing programs. Mine management informed the BD Asia team that all
required licenses/permits are expected by December 2013 with commercial production starting immediately thereafter.
Liujiaba Coal Mine is located in Liuzhi Special District. The Company holds a 99% interest in Liujiaba Coal Mine. The mining rights permit covers an area of 3.7891
km2 and Liujiaba Coal Mine has a mining rights permit of 300 ktpa from 3 coal seams dipping at less than 10 degrees. Coal production at Liujiaba Coal Mine has been
delayed because the government of Guizhou Province disallowed production from drilling and blasting methods. The Company reports that Liujiaba Coal Mine has also
been selected as part of a pilot program to adopt semi-mechanical longwall production method. However, trial production using manual longwall methods with multiple
single prop face support did start in June 2012. The Company reported that this Mine obtained its coal production safety license on 20 November 2012 and also obtained
its coal production license on 25 December 2012 permitting it to start production using semi-mechanical longwall.
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine is located in Liuzhi Special District. The Company holds a 99% interest in Zhulinzhai Coal Mine. The Mine was originally opened in 1994. It has a
licensed mining area of 1.4104 km2 with 5 mineable seams. It has a history of low, sporadic production. Zhulinzhai obtained its 300 ktpa mining rights permit in
April 2011, received the remaining necessary permits in 2012 and passed the inspection approval of safety on 16 February 2012. The 300 ktpa construction was
completed in August 2011 and the Mine went into trial production. Production will come from mining 3 seams dipping at between 12 degrees and 20 degrees. Steady
state production will be from 1 mechanical longwall and 3 development units. Mining has resumed, but not to full capacity because not all PAPs have moved out.
III-24
1.9                               COAL PRODUCTION FORECASTS
Table 1.4 shows the forecasted production for each Mine through the LOM. The ramp-up of volumes in the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines result from the
completion of the optimization design by adding one more mechanical longwall unit to each mine. Dayuan, Liujiaba, and Zhulinzhai Coal Mines will have single
mechanical longwall units. Gouchang Coal Mine will continue as a manual longwall operation.

(1)                                 Includes construction and production coal.
The above forecasts assume that the measures forecasted by the Company will be undertaken by the Company to successfully expand production. In addition, these
tonnages are predicated on steady state market conditions and government policies allowing mining to continue or to commence at the Gouchang and Dayuan Coal
Mines and then remain unchanged during the next several years.
1.10                        COAL PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
The Company has indicated that prior to 2013, most of the coal produced at the operating Mines was sold as thermal coal. Starting in 2013, the Company intends to
beneficiate certain portions of the run-of-mine coal in order to enhance marketability and facilitate the sale of differing grades of coal as necessary. However, coal sales
in 2013 will continue to be primarily thermal coal with only a portion sold as chemical coal. This has been primarily driven by the Guizhou government’s requirement for
the Company to produce and sell a minimum amount of thermal coal, which has taken a significant portion of Company’s production capacity. The Company has
projected increases in chemical coal and PCI-grade coal sales after March 2014.
The Company commissioned Shanxi Fenwei Energy Consulting Co., Ltd. (Fenwei Energy) to prepare a market study on the market for Guizhou anthracite coals and
used the information developed in that market study to determine a product mix for the coals produced at the Mines.
On the basis of this market study, a majority of the coal from the Mines will be sold as either chemical coal for the production of synthetic ammonia or methanol or as
thermal coal to the electric power industry. Some PCI coal will be produced at the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines for use in the steel industry. The
projected overall product mix is shown in Table 1.5.

To attain the product mix indicated above, coal from the Comany’s Mines might require washing to achieve the appropriate dry ash content for each designated use. The
Company plans to construct a coal beneficiation facility that will process coals from the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines. The initial phase of the
beneficiation plant construction is expected to be completed by 2014. Coal volumes in excess of the beneficiation plant capacity and coal produced prior to 2014 are
planned to be outsourced to nearby beneficiation facilities owned by others as necessary. The new coal beneficiation plant is still in the design phase; its capacity and
associated costs have not been finalized.
1.11                        REGULATORY ISSUES
1.11.1              Mining Rights and Permits
All mining operations inspected by BD Asia possessed the material operation permits and mining rights at the time of the May 2013 visit and those Mines under
construction had received approvals for such construction. Those Mines in pilot run are ready to receive approvals upon safety inspection.
1.11.2              Environmental
The permits for water and air emission stipulate the environmental protection conditions for each Mine, including the frequency of site inspection by the Environmental
Protection Bureau (EPB) officers to ensure compliance with the environmental protection requirements. Each Mine has waste management plans. Mine refuse is either
used for road construction or stored in waste storage dumps. Wastewater is treated before it is discharged to the nearby water catchments.
Environmental monitoring, which includes the monitoring of wastewater quality, air quality, and general site inspections, is conducted by the government protection
personnel on weekly and monthly bases. BD Asia had the opportunity to review reports from the EPB for some Mines. The reports show compliance with the
government standards.
Though no site has reached ISO standards, Guizhou Provincial Coal Mine Design and Research Institute, the designing company responsible for environmental
assessments studies for the Company’s Mines, has passed the GB/T19001-2008/ISO 9001: 2008 Standard.
III-26
1.11.3              Occupational Health and Safety
All senior Mine management staff positions have the appropriate level of technical competence and experience and those who are not competent are reportedly being
replaced. BD Asia also observed that safety statistics and accident records of recent years are kept. Safety statistics are available at all individual sites. They reflect a
low occupational health and safety risk since measures are being applied to avoid future fatalities and accidents. Methane drainage facilities, compressed air stations,
and Mine fans are all in place and in good running order. Three-year medium-term mining plans showing current and future panel layouts were all available at the Mine
sites. BD Asia received records of all fatalities at each individual site and discussed measures to avoid future occurrences.
The Company is obliged to meet the local government regulations to improve safety standards. Gas tests have been conducted to classify the category of each Mine in
terms of methane outbursts. High methane gas outbursts Mines have installed methane drainage systems to drain methane before mining. Methane control and
monitoring systems are in place at operating Mines. Small Mines with risks of methane outburst are obliged to integrate with neighboring mines or apply for expansion to
meet government set standards.
1.11.4              Social Issues
Under international standards, each Mine has been encouraged to fully integrate the local community by improving the infrastructures around each individual site and to
improve on corporate social responsibility in order to have local support to continue the operation. BD Asia observed that corporate management, in collaboration with
the government, is investing in road improvements around the individual sites.
Some delays have been encountered at the Dayun and Zhulinzhai Coal Mines as the result of the need to relocate some of the local villagers. The government
department responsible for arbitrating company-community issues is fully involved in helping to resolve issues with Project Affected Persons (“PAPs”) at Dayun and
Zhulinzhai Coal Mines. The Company has encountered similar issues at other mines. Nevertheless, progress has been achieved at those mines and construction is
proceeding smoothly.
1.12                        FINANCIAL EVALUATION AND CASH FLOW MODEL
On 04 June 2013, BD Asia received the cash flow financial model prepared by the Company titled “Project Champion_Financial Model (June 2013) — to BDv1.xls”
(herein referred to as “Base Case Financial Model” or “BCFM”). The technical operating parameters, revenues, operating costs, taxes, and capital costs for the seven
Mines and Properties are integrated into the BCFM, resulting in the determination of the after-tax net income and cash flow for each Mine and the aggregate of the
seven projects for 18 years commencing in Year 2013 and ending 2030. Behre Dolbear’s review focused on the period between 2013 and 2019.
III-27
The objective of BD Asia’s evaluation of the BCFM was to validate the economic viability of the seven Mines and Properties in support of the Proved and Probable
Reserves reported in this ITR. This financial evaluation is not intended to represent the fair market value of the seven Mines and Properties. The focus of this
financial evaluation was on the reasonableness of the mining technical inputs into the BCFM and the effect of those inputs on the economic viability of the Mines and
Properties, thus, substantiating the categorization of the reported Proved and Probable Reserves.
The basis of the BCFM production volumes, unit production costs, and capital expenditures are the “original mine designs” and the “optimization mine designs” for the
individual seven Coal Mines and Properties. Accordingly, the final production capacity at each Mine will be accomplished in two phases. The first phase incorporates the
design parameters as per the original mine design to achieve a base production capacity. The original mine designs were prepared as individual feasibility studies
between the Years 2002 and 2010. This phase of work is in varying degrees of completion at all of the Mines.
The optimization mine design reports were produced in March 2011 and are based on the incremental increases in production above the base capacity and do not
address the original mine design parameters in any significant detail. The operating costs and capital costs are also reported on an incremental basis. In the BCFM, the
Company modified the original and optimization production volumes and unit production costs to account for more recent management plans and budgets.
BD Asia did not review the underlying assumptions regarding the current management production volumes and costs; however, the Company’s projections appear to be
generally more conservative than those outlined in the original and optimized mine plans.
Each of the seven Mines demonstrated a positive undiscounted net present value (NPV) during its LOM. Therefore, Behre Dolbear believes the Proved and Probable
Reserves for the seven Mines, as reported in this Updated ITR, have demonstrated economic viability under reasonable financial assumptions. These results are
dependent on the viability of technical inputs discussed in this report. Material changes in the operating costs, capital costs, and coal sales prices could affect these
results.
Certain variable factors could have significant effects on the financial performance of the Mines. To determine the effect of these variables, Behre Dolbear prepared
sensitivity analyses by changing the following components of the base case assumptions.
·                                          Coal sales prices
·                                          Operating costs
·                                          Capital expenditures
Of the sensitivity factors reviewed, the cash flow from the Mines was most significantly affected by variations in the coal sales prices.
III-28
1.13                        CONCLUSIONS AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Based upon BD Asia’s site visits, review of provided information and data, and discussions with the Company, BD Asia has reached the following conclusions and has
identified the following risks to the ability of the Mines to meet forecasted production and financial targets.
·                                          BD Asia confirms a significant resource base conforming to 2012 JORC Code guidelines.
·                                          BD Asia believes that the new and proposed mine plans and mining equipment will meet the forecasted production performance shown above in
Table 1.4.
·                                          BD Asia believes the following aspects of the project present the greatest risks to the Mines and the Company.
(1)                                 Surface transportation in the Mine areas is not well developed though during the May 2013 site visit the BD Asia team did observe that upgrading of
local haul roads is being undertaken.
(2)                                 Mining of the lower stacked seams, particularly those with thin interburdens, may reduce the percentage of recovery.
(3)                                 Production ramp-up time for the new, mechanized longwalls may be longer than forecasted due to lack of experience in this type of mining in the
work force and supervisory staff.
(4)                                 Further, unanticipated delays might be encountered due to government policies.
(5)                                 A reduction in PCI and chemical coal sales could have an effect on the economics; especially, if a greater proportion of the coal is sold as lower-
priced thermal coal in the long term.

4.1                               GENERAL LOCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ACCESS
4.0  DESCRIPTION
Jinsha County, under the administration of Bijie City, is located in northwest Guizhou (Figure 1.1). Total area for the county is approximately 2,528 km2. The population
is approximately 669,700.
Nayong County, under the administration of Bijie City, is located in west Guizhou (Figure 1.1). Total area for the county is approximately 2,448 km2. The population is
approximately 938,000.
Liuzhi Special District, under the administration of Liupanshui City, is located in the west Guizhou (Figure 1.1). Total area for the county is approximately 1,792 km2.
The population is approximately 652,500.
Because of their abundant coal resources, coal mining and processing are increasing as primary industries for Jinsha and Nayong Counties and Liuzhi Special District.
Smaller coal mines have been required to shut down or merge with larger coal mines.
Local infrastructure at all the Company’s Mines is not well developed, though from observation, many of the roads are being upgraded and paved. Baiping and Dayun
Coal Mines are within the administrative jurisdiction of Gaoping Town of Jinsha County and Yongsheng Coal Mine is within the administrative jurisdiction of Huajue Town
of Jinsha County. These 3 Mines are located approximately 28 kilometers (km) to 35 km southeast of Jinsha County and approximately 3 km to 6 km east of Gaoping
Town. They are approximately 45 km from the electric power plant of Jinsha County, and about 70 km from the railway stations of Zunyi County. There are conceptual
plans to provide access to water transportation on the Wujiang River. Gouchang and Dayuan Coal Mines are located in Nayong County and are accessible by the road
from Bijie to Shuicheng city. The intention is for Dayuan Coal Mine to sell its coal to a power plant located 7 km from the Mine. Liujiaba and Zhulinzhai Coal Mines are
located north of Liuzhi Special District in the mountain area of Xinhua town. The Mines are accessible by paved roads passing through communities and villages.
4.2                               CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
Guizhou is a mountainous province with higher topographic relief in the west gradually becoming lower relief toward the eastern and southern portions of the province.
The western part of the province where the Mines are located forms part of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Guizhou has a sub-tropical humid climate with few seasonal
changes. Average monthly temperatures range from 9°C to 20°C. The average annual precipitation in the region is approximately 1,267 millimeters (mm), with the
period of May through September accounting for 70% of the annual precipitation. No surface waters are within the Mine areas other than several seasonal streams that
are part of the Wujiang River basin within the Yangtze River water system. According to the China Regionalization Map for Motion Parameters (GB198306-2001), the
basic Seismic Intensity is less than Degree VI for the regions where the Mine areas are located. Earthquakes have taken place in this region historically, but their
intensities were less than Degree VI.
Generally, all of the seven Mines are subject to similar conditions.
All the Mines are located in mountainous areas away from local communities. According to the surface maps provided to Behre Dolbear, there are no government-
protected areas in any of the Mine leases visited by Behre Dolbear.

5.0 GEOLOGY
5.1      REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING
Guizhou is the most important coal producing province in South China. Approximately 150 Mt of coal were produced in Guizhou Province in 2010. More than 90% of this
coal was produced from Late Permian coal measures in West and Northwest Guizhou. The Company’s Mines are located in the above mentioned areas and are divided
into 2 different coal districts, the Zhina Coal District west of Guiyang, the capital city of Guizhou Province and Qianbei Coal District north of Guiyang. The Zhina Coal
District contains the Liujiaba (also called Xinsong) Coal Mine, the Zhulinzhai (also called Linjiaao) Coal Mine, the Dayuan Coal Mine, and the Gouchang Coal Mine. The
Qianbei Coal District contains the Dayun Coal Mine, the Yongsheng (also called Yongfu) Mine, and the Baiping Coal Mine (Figure 1.1).
Geologically, both Qianbei and Zhina Coal Districts are located in the Central Guizhou Uplift of the Yangzhi Craton (Figure 5.1). They are surrounded by boundary faults
on all directions. The Nayong Fault zone separates the Qianbei and Zhina Coal Districts. The current outline of the structural characteristics was finalized in the
Yanshan tectonic movement during the Late Mesozoic.

5.2.1 Geological Setting of Qianbei Coal District
The main structural features in the Qianbei Coal District are north-northeast folds and faults, i.e., the Erhai anticline, Huajue anticline, Huamiaogou syncline, and
Gaoping compound syncline (Figure 5.2).
Figure 5.2.    Local geological map of the Company’s Mines in Qianbei coal district, Guizhou
III-36
Stratigraphy in these coalfields, in an ascending order, consists of Middle Permian Maokou Formation (P2m), Upper Permian Longtan Formation (P3l), Changxing
Formation (P3c), Lower Triassic Yelang Formation (T1y), and Quaternary (Q) (Figure 5.3). Maokou Formation (P2m) comprises various kinds of limestone. Longtan
Formation (P3l) consists of coal-bearing sandstones, mudstones, limestones, and coal beds. Changxing Formation (P3c) is limestone that contains chert nodules,
clumps, and bands. Triassic Yelang Formation consists of limestones, argillaceous limestones, and mudstones.

The Upper Permian Longtan Formation is the only coal-bearing formation in the Company’s Qianbei Coal District properties. This formation has an overall thickness
ranging from 67m to 320m and contains 12 coal seams with a total thickness ranging from 5m to 6m. Of the 12 coal seams, 5 are considered mineable or mostly
mineable with a combined average thickness ranging from 5m to 9m.
III-37
The Qianbei Coal District is of relatively simple to medium complex geological structure. It has undergone limited structural deformation since the deposition of the
Permian coal-bearing strata. These coal-bearing strata have been gently and widely folded. Fault structures are from simple to medium developed in the Company’s
three coal mining properties of the Qianbei Coal District. The structure feature summary of these Mines is listed in the Table 5.1.

5.3      GEOLOGY OF THE COAL DEPOSITS
5.3.1  Coal-bearing Strata in the Qianbei Coal District
All minable coal seams at the Company’s Mines are contained in the Permian Longtan Formation. This formation consists of multiple cyclic marine-terrestrial
sediments, including sandstones, siltstones, mudstone, limestone, clay, and coal seams (Figure 5.7). It is rich in fern plant fossils in the clastic sediments and
brachiopod animal fossils in the limestone. It has total thicknesses ranging from 120m to 165m. There are 12 coal seams with an overall thickness ranging from 6.78m
to 16.10m. Five of the seams have overall thickness ranging from 5.08m to 9.24m. All are considered mineable or mostly minable under current technology and
economic conditions. These coal seams in the Longtan Formation are numbered from top to down. They are C4, C5, C7, C8, and C12 in the Baiping Coal Mine; C8, C9,
C10, C11, and C12 in the Yongsheng Coal Mine; and M6, M8, M11, and M12 in the Dayun Coal Mine. These coal seam designations are used in the resource
estimation for the Company’s Mines.
III-42
Figure 5.7.    A multiple cyclic marine-terrestrial sediments system during Late Permian from West Guizhou Province
The thickness of the coal seams is generally consistent in each Mine. The continuity of these coal seams is also relatively consistent over the distances. Average
seam thickness ranges from 0.83m to 2.77m. Some of the coal seams contain 1 or 2 layer partings. Separation between mineable coal seams is variable from 10m to
30m, which generally is not a problem for current mining methods. Ground control problems caused by transmitted stresses between seams are only minor. Most of the
licensed areas are above hydrostatic water levels and pumping problem is relatively minimal.

5.3.2  Coal-bearing Strata in Zhina Coal District
All minable and mostly minable coal seams at the Company’s mines in the Zhina Coal District are contained in the Late Permian Longtan Formation. This formation
consists of multiple cyclic marine-terrestrial sediments, including sandstones, siltstones, mudstone, limestone, clay, and coal seams. It is rich in fern plant fossils in the
clastic sediments and brachiopod animal fossils in the limestones. It ranges from 80m to 400m thick. Within this formation, there are 17 economic coal seams with a
thickness range of between 1m to 8m. These seams are mineable or mostly mineable under current technology and economic conditions. The mineable coal seams in
the Longtan Formation are numbered from top to down. They are M5-1, M5-2, M6-1, M6-2, and M13 in the Gouchang Coal Mine; C3, C5, C6, and C7 in the Dayuan Coal
Mine; M27, M28, and M30 in the Xinsong Coal Mine; and C6, C16, C18, C27, and C30 in the Linjiaao Coal Mine. These coal seams are used in the resource estimation
for the Company’s four Zhina Coal District mines. Additional coal seams have been identified at the Dayuan Coal Mine (C11, C22, C26, C28, C31, C32, and C34);
however, these coal seams have not been included in the resource estimate because they are considered too deep and too thin at the current level of exploration
knowledge.
The thickness of the coal seams is generally consistent across each Mine. The continuity of these coal seams is also reasonable across the explored areas within the
tenements. Average seam thickness ranges from 0.5m to 8.3m. Some of the coal seams contain 1 or 2 partings. Separation between mineable coal seams is variable
from 10m to 30m, which generally is not a problem for currently adopted mining methods. Ground control problems caused by transmitted stresses between seams are
only minor. Most of the licensed areas are above hydrostatic water levels and pumping problems are relatively minimal.

Table 5.4 lists the mineable coal seams used in the current resource estimation and their average thickness and average seam dip ranges. The thickness of all the
mineable coal seams are suitable for both mechanical longwall panel mining method or drilling and explosive mining method for the Company’s 4 Mines in the Zhina
Coal District.

included in the resource estimate because they are considered too deep and too thin at the current level of exploration knowledge. Additionally, minimal data points were
available in the Resource report provided to Behre Dolbear.
5.4                 GEOLOGICAL DATABASE FOR RESOURCE ESTIMATION
The Company (and/or its various subsidiaries) engaged WZMM to develop independent coal resource estimations and mine designs for the seven Properties held by the
Company. WZMM is an independent entity licensed for exploration and resource estimation for solid mineral resources, including coal, in China.
III-45
The database used for the coal resource estimation includes historical exploration data and data collected from the current coal mines of the Company. The dates of the
WZMM resource reports for the seven Mines range from December 2010 to March 2011. Each of the Company’s Mines has been the subject of a number of resource
estimates in the past. Those were conducted by licensed state-run entities similar to WZMM. Basic information for these studies, including topography, deposit geology,
geological mapping, and drilling data, was compiled for each coal mining license area by WZMM. Included in the database are coal seam thickness, coal quality, and
dry bulk density data.
Gouchang, Dayuan, and Baiping Coal Mines have been operational over a number of years. Historical coal resource estimates have generally been verified by mine
production. Production has also provided additional information for the current coal resource estimation. Information provided by the Company includes maps for current
underground workings and mined-out areas, coal seam thickness, and quality data. Behre Dolbear believes that the data collected from the current mining operations is
more important than the data generated from the early exploration, as data measured from underground workings is generally more reliable than data measured from drill
holes. WZMM has conducted careful verification of the data provided by the Company by underground survey and measurement before using the data for coal resource
estimation.
Nonetheless, the exploration drilling programs have been done to JORC standards: Drill holes are located at Measured and Indicated centered distances; each seam
has been cored and laboratory-analyzed; each drill hole has been geophysically logged and depths from these logs reconciled with drilling depths; gas measurements
have been done on selected holes (seam gas is generally 98% CH4 and 2% CO2); and resources have been estimated from valid data.
Dry bulk density used for coal resource estimation is different from each coal seam and each Mine that are listed in Table 5.5 in the Qianbei and Zhina Coal Districts.
These dry bulk densities are based on measurements conducted on coal specimens and have been verified by coal production. Behre Dolbear believes that these bulk
densities are reasonable for the Mines.

6.1      DIGITAL DATABASE FOR COAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION
BD Asia has reviewed in detail the coal resource reports prepared by WZMM as well as the digital maps that include original data points used for the coal resource
estimation. BD Asia selectively checked the accuracy of the calculations and found that the procedures and parameters used for the coal resource estimation are
appropriate and the calculations are correct. In addition, BD Asia professionals visited all of the seven coal mining properties reviewed in this report and reviewed the
geology of the coal deposits in the field. During the site visits, BD Asia made certain field observations to corroborate WZMM’s work, including a general review of
topographical and geological conditions at the Mines. BD Asia’s observations and discussions with Company personnel, during the field visit, provided further
information in support of WZMM’s coal resource estimations. It should be noted that BD Asia has not conducted a detailed audit of the original data used for the coal
resource estimation and has relied upon the accuracy of the original data used by WZMM and the Company. The Company controlled the data used in the WZMM
resource estimations and provided that information to BD Asia, so BD Asia had no direct contact with WZMM during development of this ITR.
The digital database used for the coal resource estimation includes historical exploration data and data collected from underground workings of the Mines. Each of the
Mines has been the subject of a number of resource estimates in the past conducted by licensed state-owned entities similar to WZMM. Basic information for these
studies, including topography, deposit geology, geological mapping, and drilling data, was compiled for each coal mining license area by WZMM. Included in the
database are coal seam thicknesses (excluding partings of more than 0.05m thick), coal quality, and dry bulk density data. Table 6.1 summarizes the resource
database used for resource estimation of the seven Mines.

The thickness of the coal seams is relatively consistent in local areas but variable over distances. Average seam thickness for the mineable seams ranges from 1.0m
to 4.6m. Coal seams are thicker and more consistent at some of the Mines and thinner and more variable at others. Some of the coal seams contain a number of
partings. Partings with thickness greater than 0.05m are excluded from the coal resource tonnage estimates. The intervals between mineable coal seams are variable.
They range from less than 3m to over 50m and are typically greater than 15m. Minimum thickness and adequate separation were parts of the criteria used to identify
which coal seams were included as part of the resource and reserve estimate for each Property.
6.3                 COAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM UNDER THE AUSTRALASIAN JORC CODE
The JORC Code is a resource and reserve classification system that has been widely used and is internationally recognized. It has also been used previously in
independent technical reports for coal resource and coal reserve statements for other Chinese public companies reporting to the HKSE. The JORC Code is used by
Behre Dolbear to report the coal resources and coal reserves of the Company’s mining properties in this report. The coal resources and coal reserves under the JORC
Code are defined as follows:
A ‘Coal Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that
there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and other geological characteristics of a Coal
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Coal Resources are sub-divided, in order of
increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
An ‘Inferred Coal Resource’ is that part of a Coal Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and
sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
III-49
An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is
reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Coal Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Coal Resources with continued exploration.
An ‘Indicated Coal Resource’ is that part of a Coal Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with
sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and
samples are gathered.
An Indicated Coal Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Coal Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Coal Reserve.
A ‘Measured Coal Resource’ is that part of a Coal Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with
confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are
gathered.
A Measured Coal Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Coal Resource or an Inferred Coal Resource. It may be converted
to a Proved Coal Reserve or under certain circumstances to a Probable Coal Reserve.
A ‘Coal Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Coal Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may
occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors.
Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.
A ‘Probable Coal Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Coal Resource. The confidence in the Modifying
Factors applying to a Probable Coal Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Coal Reserve.
A ‘Proved Coal Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured Coal Resource. A Proved Coal Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying
Factors.
III-50
Under the JORC Code, Inferred Coal Resources are deemed to be too poorly delineated to be transferred into a reserve category; and therefore, no equivalent Possible
Reserve category is used. The general relationships between exploration results, coal resources, and coal reserves under The JORC Code are summarized in Figure
6.1.
Figure 6.1.           General relationships between exploration results, coal resources, and coal reserves (after the JORC Code 2012 edition)
Generally, coal reserves are quoted as comprising part of the total coal resource body rather than the coal resources being additional to the coal reserves quoted. The
JORC Code allows for either procedure, provided the system adopted is clearly specified. In this Behre Dolbear report, all of the coal reserves are included within the
coal resource statements.
6.4                 PROCEDURES AND PARAMETERS FOR COAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION
The methods used to estimate coal resources and the parameters used to categorize the resources are generally prescribed by the relevant government authorities in
China. Coal resources for the Company’s seven coal mining properties were estimated using the geological block method on coal seam floor structural contour maps.
Procedures and parameters used for the resource estimation have followed set government guidelines and are described below.
·                  Determining the “Deposit Industry Parameters”: The economic parameters for coal resource estimation are generally referred to as “Deposit Industry
Parameters” in Chinese literature or technical reports. These parameters generally include minimum coal seam thickness, maximum ash content, maximum total sulfur
content, and minimum thermal
III-51
value. Based on the current technology and cost information for the China Natural Resources mines, a minimum coal seam thickness of 0.7m to 0.8m, a maximum ash
content of 40%, a maximum total sulfur content of 3%, and a minimum heating value of 22.1 Mj/kg, were used for the coal resource estimation. Coal seams or portions
of a coal seam meeting these requirements are considered to be mineable and have been used for resource estimation.
·                  Compiling Base Maps for Resource Estimation: Based on the exploration data and current mining operation data, a series of base maps have been
generated for each Property. These maps include a surface geology map with topographic contours and projections of underground workings, a seam floor structural
contour map for each of the coal seams used for the resource estimation and one or more cross sections through the coal mining license area. Coal seam thickness
from the drill holes, underground and surface measurements, and their locations were projected onto the structural contour maps. The mined-out areas for each seam
were also projected onto the structural contour maps.
·                  Determining the Resource Block Boundaries: Resource blocks for different resource categories were drawn on the coal seam floor structural contour maps.
Data density for different coal resource categories is based on Chinese specifications. In general, a measured resource block was defined by a data density of 500m ×
500m for the seven Properties. An indicated block was defined by data density of 1,000m × 1,000m. There is no extrapolation from the data point in defining the
measured and indicated blocks. An inferred block was defined by extrapolating half of the indicated data spacing from the data points. The horizontal mining license
boundary and its elevation limits were used to confine the resource blocks. In general, the mineable coal seams within the mining license limits have all been contained
within the resource blocks. When a coal seam is exposed at the surface, the first 20m to 50m from its surface exterior boundary are considered as weathered and are
excluded from the defined resource blocks.
·                  Calculating the Block Volume: An average dip angle of the coal seam was determined from the seam floor-structural contours and an average seam true
thickness was determined from the measurements of the seam from the underground workings, surface outcrops, and relevant drill holes. The volume (V) of a resource
block is calculated by multiplying its horizontal projection area (S) measured on the projected plan maps by the average true thickness (M) then dividing by the cosine of
its average dip angle (α). If the average dip angle was 10 degrees or less, the cos α term was not used.
V = S x
M  
 
Cos α
·                  Calculating the Block Tonnage: The block tonnage was calculated by multiplying the block volume by the average dry bulk density (typically 1.4
tonnes/m3 to 1.5 tonnes/m3). Inferred tonnage was multiplied by 0.80 to reflect the uncertainty of the estimate.
·                  Compiling the Resource Summary Table: The resources are tabulated by seam and by resource category.

6.5                 DISCUSSION — COAL RESOURCES AND RESERVES
Based on its review, BD Asia considers the coal resource estimation database, procedures, and parameters applied by WZMM to the seven Coal Mines to be
reasonable and appropriate. The coal deposit geology shows reasonably good continuities for the coal seams and geological faults were adequately considered. BD Asia
believes that the data density requirements for measured and indicated block definition used for the Company’s Mines are generally adequate to support JORC Code
resource estimation. Reasonable extrapolations from the data points for the measured and indicated resource blocks are also allowed under the JORC Code, but there is
minor extrapolation in the Company’s resource estimation. In BD Asia’s opinion, those extrapolations were not material to the accuracy of the resource estimations.
BD Asia has visited all the Mines and reviewed all the coal seam floor structural contour maps used for coal resource estimation by WZMM. Based on its review of the
sampling data, methodology, procedures, and parameters used for the estimation of coal resources, BD Asia is of the opinion that the measured, indicated, and inferred
coal resources estimated under the 1999 Chinese resource classification system for the Company’s Mines by WZMM and JPCM conform to the equivalent the JORC
Code coal resource categories.
Table 6.3 lists the comparable coal resource categories under the 1999 Chinese resource classification system and the JORC Code that has been used to convert the
coal resource estimate under the Chinese system to that meeting the JORC Code. As only the mineable coal seams or the mineable portion of a coal seam were used
for the resource estimation, the measured and indicated coal resources estimated by WZMM can be used to produce proved and probable coal reserve estimates,
respectively.

NOTE:                    The JORC Code mineral resource is generally classified based on the geological confidence level into Measured, Indicated, and Inferred. Whereas the
1999 Chinese system is based on a three-dimensional matrix or three-digit code in the form of “123.” The first digit represents economics: 1 — Economic, 2 — Marginal
Economic, and 3 — Intrinsic Economic; the second digit represents the level of feasibility study: 1 — Feasibility Study; 2 — Pre-Feasibility Study, and 3 — Scoping
Study; the third digit represents the level of geological confidence: 1 — Measured, 2 — Indicated, and 3 — Inferred. The letter “b” after the third digit represents that the
resource is in-situ and no design or mining losses have been deducted. Therefore, the 1999 Chinese resource class “111b” is the in-situ, economic, measured resource
with a feasibility level of technical study; the resource class “122b” is the in-situ, economic, indicated resource with a pre-feasibility level of technical study; and the
resource class “333” is the intrinsic economic, inferred resource with only a scoping level of technical study.
III-53
6.6      COAL RESOURCE STATEMENT
Based on their techniques, WZMM determined that the un-mined, in-situ tonnage estimate for these seven Mines is approximately 430 Mt of coal classified in the
Chinese system as 331, 332, and 333 resources. For consistency, Behre Dolbear has consolidated the original 111b and 122b into the 331 and 332 categories,
respectively, as WZMM had not re-categorized the estimates after completion of their feasibility study. The Chinese estimate, as of 01 May 2011, is shown by Coal
Mine in Table 6.4.

6.7      PROCEDURES AND PARAMETERS FOR COAL RESERVE ESTIMATION
Under the JORC guidelines, a coal resource generally refers to the in-situ coal that has a potential to be mined economically and a coal reserve comprises that portion
of the Measured and Indicated coal resource that is definitively planned to be mined and delivered to a coal beneficiation plant for processing or sold directly to the
customers at reasonably assumed economic conditions. The Company (and its various subsidiaries) engaged JPCM to produce a LOM) mine plan and production
schedules at each Mine. The JPCM plans and schedules were developed and presented during May 2011. BD Asia has reviewed the Company’s Mine production
planning processes and has estimated a coal reserve for each of the Mines reviewed in this report. These coal reserve estimates have been produced from the in-situ
coal resource estimates based on the economic Measured and Indicated resource categories for which mine plans have been generated.
The mine planning produced by JPCM is typical of those produced by firms licensed for exploration and resource estimation for solid mineral resources in China in that
the mine plan includes a factored “333” or Inferred resource that should be excluded from a reserve estimate. Also, typical in their mine plans is the duplication of the
same plan from seam to seam with slight modifications where the production scheduled was determined by annual licensed tonnage instead of detailed design and
scheduling.
For the purpose of converting the economic Measured and Indicated coal resources to coal reserves, JPCM used the overall mining dilution factor and mining recovery
factor between the in-situ coal resources and the raw production coal based on the Chinese requirements, the characteristics of coal seams, and the mining method to
be used for each seam. The design reports first convert the in-situ resource into a recoverable resource by deducting the coal contained within the barrier pillars for
ventilation and haulage entries, shafts, and under villages, rivers, and mine facilities, as shown in their mine design. Then a recovery factor, based on coal
characteristics and thickness, is applied as specified in the Chinese design standards. The Chinese standards for each Mine specified a 75% to 85% seam recovery.
Typically, 80% was used for the seams at the Company’s seven mines; however, a few seams were reduced to 75% recovery and a few increased to 85% recovery.
Finally, JPCM divided the “recoverable” resource by the target production rate to develop a production schedule.
The calculations were slightly inconsistent between the different mine design reports and BD Asia made some minor adjustments to correct those problems. In addition,
several of the Mines have seams that are less than 1m in thickness or are relatively close to the seam above. BD Asia believes the standard used by JPCM, while
meeting the Chinese requirements, is optimistic. Based upon its detailed review of the mine plans, BD Asia reduced the mine recovery for some of these seams to 45%
to 60%. For other seams, BD Asia eliminated the seam from the mine plan. BD Asia also moved all tonnage produced after Year 5 or 6 (depending on the Mine) into the
Probable Reserve classification because BD Asia believes the uncertainty in the engineering and technical analysis for the production after Year 5 is too high to allow
Proved Reserves classification under the JORC system.
BD Asia has reviewed the plans and suggests that the Company actively monitor the coal mining recovery factor and coal mining dilution factor and revise the coal
reserve estimates for these operations, according to the actual mining recovery factor and mining dilution factor achieved, when appropriate. All Inferred Resources that
are included in the JPCM’s mine plan are reported separately by BD Asia as Inferred Resource in the Reserve table.
III-55
6.8      COAL RESERVE STATEMENT
BD Asia estimates that, as of 30 April 2013, the Company’s seven Mine properties covered by this review hold approximately 29.1 Mt of Proved and 181.2 Mt of
Probable Reserves conforming to the definitions in the JORC Code guidelines. In addition, there are approximately 86.2 Mt of Inferred Resource also conforming to the
JORC Code guidelines. Table 6.6 summarizes BD Asia’s estimation of the JORC Code reserves and Inferred resources in addition to reserves at the seven Properties.
All tonnage is specified in millions of tonnes. The Mine life is estimated using only the Proved and Probable Reserves.

III-56
While the Company currently has tenure of the Coal Reserves and Resources at the Gouchang Coal Mine, the mine permit and production at this property have been
suspended due to a newly introduced consolidation policy in the Province until Gouchang Coal Mine has been consolidated with one of the adjacent coal mines.
Alternately, the government might allow the Company to develop a new mine design which incorporates increased production capacity and then grant a mining permit
without consolidation; however, it is presently unclear if the government would rescind the consolidation order and issue the Company a new mining permit. In the event
that the Province ultimately requires the consolidation, the tenure of the Resources and Reserves at Gouchang Coal Mine could end up under the control of a different
party or the Company could increase their holdings depending on the Company’s negotiations with the adjacent mines. Behre Dolbear therefore believes the Company’s
tenure at Gouchang Coal Mine could be at risk.
6.9      PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COAL RESERVES
Behre Dolbear reviewed extensive drill core data and certain examples of washability data provided by the Company. According to the float test reports produced by
WZMM, the physical and chemical characteristics indicate that the Company’s coals can generally be categorized as WY2 and WY3 anthracite, as defined by the State
Standard of China Coal Classification System (GB5751-86). It should be noted that the WY2 and WY3 anthracite classification for the Company’s coals is based on the
float test results (washed coal) and not the raw coal quality parameters as allowed under the GB5751-86 standards when classifying coals with dry ash contents in the
ranges found at the Company’s properties.
Coal quality at the Properties is generally good but variable within each seam. The seams generally contain coal with low sulfur content and high heating value. Table
6.7 shows the weighted average coal quality of the Proved and Probable Coal Reserve at each Mine.

The float coal data from WZMM washability tests indicates that the majority of the Company’s coal is in the WY3 category, with dry volatile matter contents ranging
from 6.5% to 10.0%. The float coal from Baiping Coal Mine, Zhulinzhai Coal Mine and Dayun Coal Mine can be classified as WY2 anthracite coal while the float coal
from Liujiaba Coal Mine, Gouchang Coal Mine, Yongsheng Coal Mine and Dayuan Coal Mine can be classified as WY3 anthracite coal. The raw coal dry ash data
presented in the WZMM reports indicate that beneficiation (coal washing), prior to utilization, may be required on part of the coal in order to ensure the quality of the
Company’s higher-end products.
The Company is focusing on production from the C5 coal seam from the Baiping Coal Mine, the C8 coal seam from the Yongsheng Coal Mine, and the M8 coal seam
from the Dayun Coal Mine as sources of PCI (Pulverized Coal Injection) product for the steel industry. The Company believes that as much as 72 Mt of its coal
resource can qualify for use as Grade II and Grade III PCI coal.
According to certain exploration reports, 31 samples from Baiping Coal Mine’s C5 coal seam, 52 samples from Yongsheng Coal Mine’s C8 seam, and 60 samples from
Dayun Coal Mine’s M8 seam confirm the Company’s statement that these coals will meet or exceed the GB/T 1852-2008 Standard for PCI Grade III coal products.
Some areas of these seams will yield PCI Grade II (and possibly PCI Grade I) coal when washed.
Typical analyses indicate that the ash content of raw coal issuing from operations in these seams must be reduced to facilitate categorization of these coals as PCI
products, but a number of washing studies have shown that washed coals with less than 12% dry ash content or less can be produced. Total sulfur content, phosphorus
content, volatile matter content, and total potassium and sodium contents also appear to be within the ranges required for categorization as PCI coals. BD Asia believes
that an un-quantified portion of the coal reserves in these seams will qualify as PCI Grade I, the most attractive and valuable category of PCI coal.
6.10   RESOURCE AND RESERVE RISK FACTORS
BD Asia believes that WZMM has done good work in determining the in-situ resource of the minable coal seams. BD Asia also believes that the coal resource and BD
Asia-modified reserve statements herein are acceptable based on the methods used to determine those in-situ resources by WZMM. However, there are a number of
risk factors.
·                                          BD Asia Has Not Audited the Sampling Data or Conducted Independent Sampling: BD Asia has accepted the drilling data, mine sampling
data, and coal quality analyses presented by the Company for this report. A few inconsistencies were discovered during the preparation of this report and most were
resolved as typographic errors during translation or transposition errors in preparing the documents. The exploration and resource calculations were completed by
government institutions or licensed entities in Guizhou Province. These entities have no stake in the Company and their work is generally considered reputable. Low
Risk
·                                          Mathematical Errors in the Original Calculations: BD Asia found a small number of minor mathematical errors in the original resource reports
and these were promptly corrected. BD Asia only spot checked the calculations by Mine and re-digitized only a few
III-58
areas on each of the maps provided. When corrected, they did not have any significant impact on the final resource tonnage. Given that there are 38 minable coal
seams at the seven Mines in this study, a few minor mathematical errors may still exist in the resource work. Low Risk
·                                          Reserve Conversion: The reserve conversion from the in-situ resource was completed using detailed engineering design specifications. These
studies include ventilation, electrical, pumping, environmental, methane, equipment selection, and labor considerations. The mine designs, especially those after Year 5
or 6, are more on a conceptual basis as opposed to what is generally accepted as a detailed mine layout. Mine recoveries and dilution will need to be monitored as each
Mine moves to deeper seams and reserves need to be adjusted as appropriate. Low Risk
·                                          Multiple Stacked Seams: Most of the Company’s mines have multiple stacked seams. The Company has little operational experience with
mining stacked seams. Mistakes in pillar design or layout on the lower seams may create problems that inhibit attainment of the projected recoveries from the lower
seams. Several of the seams are within 6m to 8m of the next seam, potentially creating extraction dynamics that will reduce coal recoveries. While BD Asia has
reduced the forecasted recoveries from these seams, this issue still represents a Moderate Risk.
·                                          Economics Used for the Determination of Mineable Seams: The minable seams were determined based on the overall operating and capital
costs. No allowance for higher operating costs, as the mining progresses to deeper seams, was used to determine if a seam was economically feasible and hence
classified as minable. Low to Moderate Risk
·                                          Mining Loss: BD Asia believes that the mining losses or mine recoveries used in the reserve calculations are achievable in the short term;
however, the mining losses could be significantly higher as mining progresses deeper. The level of engineering and technical design within the mine design specification
reports is not sufficient to completely support the level of recovery assumed by the Company in the later years of production. This risk to the reserve statement
increases with time. BD Asia believes the risks of reduced seam recoveries are Low for the first 10 to 15 years, Moderate for Years 16 to 30, and High-Moderate from
Year 31 to the end of the projected mining life. The Company will need to re-evaluate its reserve base as it updates engineering and mine plans, as mining progresses to
deeper seams.
·                                          Gouchang Coal Reserves and Resources: Due to a newly introduced consolidation policy in the Province, the mine permit and production at the
Gouchang Coal Mine has been suspended until it has been consolidated with one of the adjacent coal mines. Depending on the outcome of the Company’s negotiations,
the tenure of the Gouchang Coal could end up either under control of a different party or the Company could increase their holdings. Should this be the case, Gouchang
would have no JORC compliant Coal Resources and Reserves; however, Gouchang Reserves represent less than 3% of the Company’s total Coal Reserves. Moderate
Risk
III-59
6.11   RESOURCE AND RESERVE CONCLUSIONS
BD Asia estimates that, as of 30 April 2013, the Company’s seven Mine Properties covered by this review hold approximately 29.1 Mt of Proved and 181.2 Mt of
Probable Reserves conforming to the definitions in JORC Code. In addition, there are approximately 86.2 Mt of Inferred Resource also conforming to the JORC Code.
There is a high probability that a significant portion of that inferred resource could be converted into indicated resource and probable reserves with additional work.
WZMM reports only 80% of the calculated inferred tonnage resulting in a conservative estimation of the inferred tonnage.
BD Asia believes that the coal resource estimation database, procedures, and parameters applied by WZMM to the seven Mines are reasonable and appropriate. The
coal deposit geology shows reasonably good continuities for the coal seams and the faults were adequately considered in their estimation of the resource. BD Asia
believes that the data density requirements for measured and indicated block definition, used for the estimates, are generally adequate for JORC Code resource
estimation for similar coal deposits.
It is also BD Asia’s opinion that WZMM has done good work in determining the in-situ resource of the minable coal seams. As the Company produces coal, it must
monitor consumption of the in-situ resource and adjust reserve figures when warranted.
BD Asia believes that the mining losses and mine recoveries used by WZMM in the reserve calculations are achievable in the short term; however, several of the Mines
will work in seams that are less than 1m thick or are relatively close to the seam above. For these seams, BD Asia either reduced the mine recovery or the subject
seam was eliminated from the mine plan. BD Asia believes that, while meeting the Chinese requirements, the standard used by WZMM is optimistic. As mining
progresses deeper and encompasses more stacked seams, minor operational mistakes could have an impact on the recoverable coal and remaining reserves and
ultimately reduce the Mine life. BD Asia believes that the risk of a reserves shortfall, during the first 15 years for the seven Mines, is low due to the reserve tail and the
size of the in-situ resource.

7.0      MINE DESCRIPTIONS AND PLANS
7.1      GENERAL
Seven Guizhou coal mine properties are reviewed in this report. Three Properties in Jinsha County, two Properties in Nayong County, and two Properties in Liuzhi
Special District were acquired by the Company in 2009 and 2010. All of the Mines are underground anthracite mines.
Historically, these Mines have used manual mining methods for coal production. To date, all of the Mines have had generally insignificant coal production because they
have been under development and construction. The Company plans to upgrade the original mine designs between the Years 2013 and 2018 in order to increase the
production capacity for these properties. The Company intends to achieve their optimization plans through better mine layout, infrastructure, and capital support and by
introducing mechanical longwall mining methods.

7.1.1 Baiping Coal Mine
The Company holds a 70% interest in the Baiping Coal Mine. It is located in the southern part of Jinsha County approximately 47 km from the Jinsha County power
generation station. Prior to 2003, there were a number of small private mines operating along the crop line of Seam C4. Construction of Baiping Coal Mine was started in
2004 with the driving of 2 slopes to Seam C8. The Company purchased the 70% interest in Baiping Coal mine Property in 2010. Its mining license covers an area of
3.0143 km2 and it has a permitted production capacity of 150 ktpa.
Baiping Coal Mine is currently in operation with 3 slopes reaching to Seam C12. Development is progressing with a system of adits and slopes for mining in Seam C8.
Currently, mining production comes from 1 manual longwall system. Production in 2012 reached 290 ktpa. It should be noted that the Company had been given provision
by the local government to mine above the current permit limit while the expansion program is on-going. Mine expansion plans call for the introduction of 1 mechanical
longwall replacing the currently operating manual longwall. Upon completion of the expansion in 2017, this Mine will have a final design production capacity of 600 tpa.
Coal is being de-gassed prior to mining. The gas is captured into a pipeline and is exhausted to the outside in order to avoid methane bursts underground.
The Behre Dolbear team inspected Baiping Coal Mine’s underground operations, including the manual longwall face and coal transportation slope.
7.1.2 Yongsheng Coal Mine
The Company holds a 70% interest in the Yongsheng Coal Mine. It is located in southeastern Jinsha County approximately 50 km from the Jinsha County power
generation station. The area around Yongsheng Coal Mine has been historically mined by small, private, and seasonal mines operated primarily in the winter, producing
coal for local consumption. The mining license covers an area of 18.23 km 2 and currently has a permitted production capacity of 600 ktpa. The Company will seek to
increase permitted production to 1,500 ktpa.
Yongsheng Coal Mine construction was initiated in 2008. To date approximately 13,000m of tunnels and adits have been driven. The Mine area is heavily faulted. Mining
will be constrained by large-scale faulting that divides the Mine into small mining blocks. A major fault zone divides this Mine into an east section and a west section.
Two development systems are being driven to access the 2 bodies. Each section is accessed by 2 slopes and a system of tunnels and adits. The Company has
experienced some delays in the development as several large karst caves have been encountered.
The Company intends to construct a 1,000m surface conveyor belt to transport coal to the nearby Wujiang River that is reported to be navigable.
III-63
The Company anticipates trial production for the first phase of construction in the second quarter of 2013, followed by commercial production starting in November 2013.
Expansion construction is scheduled to begin in the Year 2015. Ultimately, the Mine will have 2 mechanical longwall systems.
Coal is to be de-gassed prior to mining. The gas will be captured into a pipeline and released to the outside in order to avoid the possibility of methane bursts
underground.
7.1.3 Dayun Coal Mine
The Company holds a 100% interest in the Dayun Coal Mine. It is located in southeastern Jinsha County approximately 45 km from the Jinsha County power generation
station. Construction of Dayun Coal Mine commenced in May 2012. Initiation of construction was delayed as a result of issues involving the surrounding villagers. Behre
Dolbear has been told that these local issues have been resolved through government intervention.
The area has a history of small private mines operated primarily in the winter, producing for local consumption only. Dayun Coal Mine holds a 600 ktpa mining rights
permit. The mining license covers an area of approximately 16.9035 km2.
First phase production is planned for 900 ktpa with the installation of a mechanical longwall system. Ultimately, the production is planned to increase to 1,800 ktpa using
2 mechanical longwall systems.
7.1.4 Gouchang Coal Mine
The Company holds a 99% interest in the Gouchang Coal Mine. It is located in northwest Nayong County, approximately 24 km northwest of the Nayong County Seat
(Figure 5.2). Historical coal mining has occurred in and around this area since the 1970s. Gouchang’s mining license covers an area of 1.7198 km2 and has a permitted
production capacity of 90 ktpa.
This Mine uses adits and slopes for mine development and manual longwall retreat mining for production. Recently put into production after a construction upgrade, the
main, auxiliary, and ventilation adits and slopes are developed to coal Seams No. 5, 6, and 13; however, only Seam No. 5-1 is currently being mined. Coal production
reached 96 kt in 2011.
Production in 2012 was negatively impacted by changing mine gas safety regulations in Guizhou Province. Due to high methane emissions and the possibility of
methane bursts, Gouchang Coal Mine was idled in from March to August 2012 pending a gas prevention and control assessment from government approved gas testing
agencies. As a result of the assessment, approval JNYMT(2012) No. 278 was issued on 20 August 2012 and commercial production resumed soon after. Production is
intended to be from a manual longwall using drilling and blasting methods with multiple manually operated single props for roof support at the face area even though the
government of Guizhou Province has officially disallowed production from blasting methods. The appropriate permits had been issued by the Guizhou Province
government allowing production to continue from the manual longwall system.
III-64
Planned development was expected to increase the size of the longwall panels significantly. However, as a result of the recent policy, Notice QianNengYuanBan [2013]
No. 120, Ref No. (QFGD-2013-29002) issued by the Guizhou Province on 22 March 2013, further development and operations at the Gouchang Coal Mine have again
been temporarily suspended pending consolidation with a neighboring mine to meet government set safety standards. That notice addresses consolidation of coal mines
considered to be high methane outburst mines with production capacities of less than 90 ktpa, thus, directly affecting the Gouchang Coal Mine. The future mining permit
application allowing production to increase to 450 ktpa is pending until the finalization of potential mine consolidation opportunities with a neighboring coal mine. BD
Asia’s review did not include reviewing this consolidation plan.
Coal will be de-gassed prior to mining, captured into a pipeline, and released to the outside in order to avoid the possibility of methane bursts.
Two BD Asia team members toured the underground operation and inspected the auxiliary adit and slope, haulage, gate road, and manual longwall working face in
October 2012.
7.1.5 Dayuan Coal Mine
The Company holds a 99% interest in the Dayuan Coal Mine. It is located in southwest Nayong County, 7 km from the Yangchang thermal power plant and
approximately 22 km southwest of the Nayong County Seat (Figure 5.2). It is a new coal mine, after the integration of the original Dayuan and Laluo Coal Mines. The
mining lease covers 1.649 km2. Construction at this Mine began in June 2009. The Mine recently upgraded its mining permit from 150 ktpa to 300 ktpa and expects to
further upgrade the mining permit to 450 ktpa in the second phase of the expansion program.
This Mine uses main and auxiliary horizontal adits and 2 ventilation declines for mine development and plans to use fully mechanized longwall retreat mining for
production. In the current working area under development, exploitable coal in Seams No. 4 and No. 5 has been exhausted and Seam No. 6 is being worked. The Mine
uses a scoop loader with gathering bucket to speed up the loading for development work.
Coal production and development has been from a manual longwall using drilling and blasting; however, the government of Guizhou Province had, at one point,
disallowed production from blasting methods. The Company has now switched to semi-mechanical longwall using a Chinese-made shearer with multiple single props for
face support. There have been delays in mining development due to government policy changes. These issues have been dealt with, including the completion of various
methane control testing. The 300 ktpa mining permit application was obtained on 15 March 2013 and remaining two required licenses and permits are expected by 01
September 2013 with trial production starting immediately thereafter.
The proximity of the Yangchang Thermal Power Plant makes Dayuan Coal Mine a potentially significant source of coal for that facility. However, due to the quality of the
Mine’s coal, the Company plans to haul the Mine’s product to the chemical plant for methanol production. The Mine is on a road connecting to Provincial Highway 307 at
approximately 4 km distance. Management has diverted the road from the Mine site to avoid heavy trucks passing through the local community.
III-65
Coal will be de-gassed prior to mining, with such gas captured into a pipeline and released to the atmosphere to avoid the possibility of methane bursts.
7.1.6 Liujiaba Coal Mine
The Company holds a 99% interest in the Liujiaba Coal Mine. It is located in Liuzhi Special District, approximately 21 km north of the Liuzhi County Seat (Figure 5.2).
The mining lease covers 3.7891 km2 and has a permitted production capacity of 300 ktpa.
The Mine uses main, auxiliary, and ventilation adits for development and plans to install a mechanical longwall for retreat mining for production. Trial production for the
first phase of construction began in the No. 27 coal seam in the second quarter of 2012 and is forecasted to reach the permitted capacity in 2013. Development will be
by utilizing a roadheader. There are 3 major faults in the Property covered by the mining lease. Each area, thus created, will be treated as a separate mining area, with
its own adits and ventilation system. When the Mine proves it can operate at the current permit capacity, mine production is expected to increase to 600 ktpa.
Coal production at Liujiaba Coal Mine was delayed because the government of Guizhou Province has disallowed production from drilling and blasting methods. However,
trial production started on 18 June 2012 using manual longwall with multiple single prop face support. At the time of Behre Dolbear’s site visit in October 2012, a
government agency field inspection, which is part of the safety license approval process, had been conducted; and on 20 November 2012, the Mine was granted a coal
production safety license. On 25 December 2012, a coal production license was issued and commercial production finally commenced in December 2012 with the
installation of a semi-mechanical longwall in place of the manual longwall.
Coal will be de-gassed prior to mining. Gas will be captured into a pipeline and released to the atmosphere to avoid the possibility of methane bursts. Future
consideration will be given to using the gas in a small, on-site power generation facility. A water treatment plant is in place for treating underground mine water before it
is discharged to the nearby stream.
Two Behre Dolbear team members toured the underground operation and inspected the auxiliary adit and two development working faces in October 2012.
7.1.7 Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
The Company holds a 99% interest in the Zhulinzhai Coal Mine. The Mine is located in Liuzhi Special District, approximately 20 km north of Liuzhi County Seat (Figure
5.2). Mining originally began in 1992 and the mining lease covers 1.4104 km2. The Mine currently has a permitted production capacity of 300 ktpa.
III-66
The Mine currently uses main, auxiliary, and ventilation adits with declines for development and manual longwall retreat mining for production. Production began in the
No. 16 coal seam in early 2012 and is forecasted to reach the current permitted capacity by 2015. When the No. 6 coal seam is mined, a 2-pass, top cave mining
method will be needed to mine in the thick coal seam. The Mine is expected to increase production to 450 ktpa by utilizing fully mechanized longwall retreat mining for
production.
Coal will be de-gassed prior to mining, captured into a pipeline, and released to the outside in order to avoid the possibility of methane bursts. A water treatment plant is
in place to produce potable water.
7.2      EXPANSION AND CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES
The expansion and construction of each Mine will be completed in two phases, initially achieving the original mine design followed by the optimization mine design
phase. These designs were prepared by JPCM, the entity that produced the LOM plans and production schedules at each Mine.
The phased production capacities and permitted capacities are shown in Table 7.2. The Company will require additional government approvals for the planned expansion
of production capacities at the seven Coal Mines.

capacity.
Figure 7.1.     Construction and production schedule
During the October 2012 site visit, during the May 2013 site visit, and throughout the development of this report, BD Asia’s experts intensively questioned the
management and the engineers at each Coal Mine site to determine the depth of planning and the consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen events associated
with the modified scheduling of development and expansion of each Coal Mine. This same process was repeated with the Company’s corporate management and
engineering team. BD Asia believes that individual Mine managers and the Company’s corporate management are aware of the importance of developing attainable
schedules and production targets. BD Asia believes that the Company has made a concerted effort to develop attainable schedules and production targets for this
Updated ITR. The construction schedules shown above reflect delays in the schedule to account for holidays, weather, and potential delays that could arise from safety
issues at neighboring mines. It should be noted that the expansion and optimization schedule prepared by the Company and presented above reflects the potential that
the current Guizhou Province coal mine consolidation program will likely affect approvals for any mine expansions in the Province until the end of March 2014.
III-69
8.1    HISTORICAL PRODUCTION
8.0   COAL PRODUCTION
Historical production statistics for the seven Mines are not significant in this report because most of the Mines have been under construction and development, or have
been idled for integration, or are new mines. However, some production has occurred at a few of the Mines. This production is summarized in Table 8.1. In general, it
appears that the Company achieved target production values for 2012.
8.2    FORECASTED PRODUCTION
The projected annual coal production volumes through the Year 2019 are shown in Table 8.2. The annual coal production values encompass all coal produced at each
Mine, including the coal produced during the construction and trial periods. Ramp-up periods or trial periods have been projected for each Property at each stage of
construction. Behre Dolbear believes the ramp-up periods are reasonable given the trial period and the proposed mine plans.
The above forecasts assume that the measures undertaken by the Mines to expand production are completed as forecasted by the Company. In addition, the forecasts
are predicated on steady state market conditions and government policies allowing mining to continue or commence at the Gouchang and Dayuan Coal Mines
(Gouchang Coal Mine will be idle through 2014) and then remaining unchanged during the next several years.

9.0   COAL MARKETABILITY AND PRODUCTS
9.1            MARKETABILITY OF COAL PRODUCTS
The Company commissioned Fenwei Energy to prepare a study that describes the market for Guizhou anthracite coals. The Company has used the information
developed in that market study to determine an appropriate product mix for the coals produced at the seven Mines. The salient points of the market study follow.
·                       The potential uses of coal produced at the seven Mines are shown in Table 9.1. To date, coal from the Mines has been sold exclusively as thermal coal to
the power generation industry, so the Company has not fully exploited the potential value of its anthracite products.

·                       In the PRC, anthracite reserves account for approximately 12% of the overall coal reserves. As such, Fenwei Energy believes that anthracite will continue
to be in tight supply in the future, despite the fact that industries that use anthracite are gradually changing technologies to reduce the requirement for anthracite coal or
are finding substitutes for anthracite coal.
·                       Fenwei Energy has projected that the anthracite supply and demand gap in Guizhou Province will be negative between the Years 2013 and 2020; in other
words, more anthracite will be produced in the province than is required by current demand. This is mostly driven by the projected slow growth of anthracite consumers
within the province, especially the metallurgical and chemical industries. Within Guizhou Province, the largest anthracite consumer will remain the electric power
industry.
·                       On the other hand, in the neighboring provinces of Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, Fenwei Energy has projected the future demand
for anthracite to be greater than the supply (2013 to 2020). Consequently, the anthracite requirements in these provinces will be imported from either other provinces or
foreign countries.
·                       The primary industries with the greatest demand for anthracite in these provinces are projected by Fenwei Energy to be the chemical industry and the
thermal power generation industry.
III-73
·                       The primary foreign importer of anthracite to southwestern China is Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has expressed its intention to limit anthracite
exports in the future, thus, decreasing the impact of Vietnamese anthracite imports on the southwestern China domestic markets.
·                       Other supplies of anthracite within the PRC, expressly Shanxi, are at a disadvantage for supplying customers in the southwestern provinces as a result of
the transportation distances; therefore, Guizhou anthracite producers are expected to be more attractive as sources of domestic anthracite in the southwestern
provinces than the producers of anthracite in some of the higher anthracite output provinces, such as Shanxi and Henan.
·                       The Guizhou transportation network is currently undergoing improvements and expansions for out-of provincial cargo transport. In particular, the
construction of five waterway systems will link the Yangtze River and the Pearl River to northern and southern Guizhou Province, respectively. Rail systems are also
operating within the province allowing for coal transport to the Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang Provinces. The road system is being expanded under the
12th Five-Year-Plan that will result in a highway in each county within the Guizhou Province. The construction of the Hangrui and Xiarong highways will greatly improve
the road transportation capabilities of the Bijie Area.
·                       Fenwei Energy believes the Company has several competitive advantages that will allow the Mines to become important anthracite producers within
Guizhou Province.
(1)             The Company is strategically located in a region rich in anthracite resources in Guizhou with salable reserves.
(2)             The seven Mines are able to produce products that are qualified for use in the chemical production and power generation industries.
(3)             The Guizhou Province is strategically located, allowing anthracite delivery to southwestern China.
(4)             The Company’s Mines have lower costs than those in Shanxi and Henan.
(5)             Transportation conditions are improving in the Guizhou Province that will facilitate easier coal deliveries.
(6)             The Company should not be significantly affected by the Guizhou government’s proposal to consolidate the coal mining industry within the province. According
to Fenwei Energy, the Company has met the requirements for sufficient reserves, production capacities, plans for gas control, and safety production standards.
III-74
9.2            FORECASTED PRODUCT MIX
The Company has indicated that most of its 2012 coal production was sold as thermal coal. Starting in 2013, the Company intends to beneficiate certain portions of the
run-of-mine coal as necessary to enhance marketability and facilitate the sale of differing grades of coal. However, coal sales in 2013 will continue to be primarily
thermal coal with only a portion sold as chemical coal. This product mix has been primarily driven by the Guizhou government’s requirement for the Company to produce
and sell a minimum amount of thermal coal, which has taken a significant portion of the Company’s production capacity. The Company has projected increases in
chemical coal and PCI-grade coal sales after March 2014.
The assumptions regarding the production and distribution of different coal grades are shown in Table 9.2, Table 9.3, and Table 9.4. The Company projects that, in the
long term, most of the coal will be sold as chemical-grade lump coal. A portion of the coal fines will be washed or not washed, as necessary to produce chemical grade
coal fines. In the case of the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines, a portion of the washed coal fines will be sold as PCI coal (coal mined from the coal seams
C5-Baiping, C8-Yongsheng, and M8-Dayun). The unwashed coal fines will be sold as thermal coal blends. BD Asia believes that, although the projected product mixes
may change as the physical and chemical characteristics of the various coal seams are further quantified, the coal sold from the seven Mines will consist of chemical
coal, PCI, and thermal coal grades.

CHNR has projected that a majority of the Mine’s coal will be sold either as chemical coal for the production of synthetic ammonia or methanol or as thermal coal to the
electric power industry.
In order to produce the coal products as indicated, certain coals may need to be washed to achieve the appropriate dry ash content for the designated uses. CHNR has
indicated that it intends to construct a coal washing facility that will wash coals from the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines with an ultimate capacity of 1,200
ktpa. The initial phase of the beneficiation plant construction is expected to be completed by 2014. Coal volumes in excess of the plant’s output capacity and coal
produced prior to 2014 are planned to be washed by nearby washing facilities owned by other producers at a fixed fee per tonne. The coal beneficiation plant is still in
the design phase and the capacity and associated costs have not been finalized.
Based upon its review of the washability data provided by CHNR during the September 2011 ITR, BD Asia believes it is possible for CHNR to produce raw and washed
coals that meet the requirements for CHNR’s projected coal products.
BD Asia has not independently verified the availability of the final markets for CHNR’s coal products or the demand for these coal products.
9.3                     CUSTOMERS AND TRANSPORTATION
According to the Company, its current coal production is sold to domestic power generation facilities and coal traders [via truck transportation.] At this time, the market
available to the Company’s coal is somewhat limited given the infrastructure and transportation constraints in the Guizhou Province. This has resulted in high quality
anthracite coal being sold into the lower grade thermal coal market at lower prices than would be expected if the coal was marketed and sold as chemical coal.
The Company believes the continuing improvement of the transportation infrastructure within the Guizhou Province will increase the potential customer base beginning in
2013. These improvements include roads, railways and the Wujiang River transportation project. The Company is currently developing a comprehensive sales and
business strategy that will allow it to market the coal production as higher quality coal products, such as PCI coal and chemical coal in addition to the thermal coal
products. Other than the indicated product mix discussed earlier, BD Asia has not reviewed the details of this sales and business plan.
The current transportation network used by the Company and its primary customers are shown in Table 9.5.

The Company expects construction of a port next to the Yongsheng Coal Mine and the coal washing plant site in order to improve transportation capabilities.
Construction of the port is expected to commence in 2014. BD Asia considers the port to be conceptual in nature
10.0              REGULATORY ISSUES
10.1              MINING RIGHTS
Most of the mines visited by BD Asia were acquired by the Company and/or its predecessors during 2010 and 2011 with mining rights granted by the competent
authorities of PRC. Under the “Mineral Resource Law,” all the mineral resources are owned by the state. A mining enterprise must obtain a mining or exploration permit
for conducting mining or exploration activities in a specific area in a specific license period. The usage right of surface area will belong to the local people or other lease
owners. If mining activities are to be conducted underground, the mining company is required to acquire the usage right of surface areas if such surface areas will be
affected or endangered by mining activity. The permits are generally extendable at the end of their term or can be expanded in terms of production upon government
approval. The Company provided BD Asia with details of permits with license numbers, effective dates, production capacity, and areas of the permits for the mining
rights to the mining properties reviewed for this study and a summarized status of each Mine under construction has been provided. Details of these permits are shown
in Table 10.1. A due diligence review of these permits is outside the scope of BD Asia’s review. BD Asia has relied upon the assertions of the Company as to the
validity of these mining rights.

(3)                       Baiping, Liujiaba and Zhulinzhai Coal Mines are in progress of applying for the environmental protection acceptance inspection approvals in which the
guidelines setting the limits of discharge will be informed, Nevertheless, the Mines have obtained letters from the relevant PRC governmental authorities to confirm that
no penalties would be imposed with respect to the current practice. Gouchang Coal Mine is idled, therefore no longer applicable. Yongsheng, Dayun and Dayuan Coal
Mines have not yet commenced commercial production, therefore not applicable.
Since the majority of the Mines are under construction and development stage, BD Asia has summarized the safety approval process in Figure 10.1 for Mines awaiting
permission for commercial production. Individual Mine status has also been provided to indicate corresponding stages each Mine has gone through and the remaining
stages, which those Mines under construction will have to go through before safety production and coal productions permits are finally issued. Upon the completion of
construction in accordance with the requirements in the approved “Mine Development Design” (or “Preliminary Design”) and the “Safety Guidance” when assessment of
the construction meets the mine safety standards, the Mine may submit an application to the relevant authorities for joint pilot run. The procedures are shown in Figure
10.1 showing approval stages toward commercial production.

10.2.1     Baiping Coal Mine
Baiping Coal Mine is located in Gaoping Village of Jinsha County, occupying an area of 3.0143 km2. The Coal Mine holds Business License No. 520000000006762 valid
until 14 January 2019 issued by Administration for Industry and Commerce of Guizhou Province. Behre Dolbear observed that the Mine holds most of the required
permits for production up to 150 ktpa; however, it is designed for 300 ktpa. Provision for production above the mining permit has been issued while the Mine is in
expansion stage. Mine management plans to increase production to 600 ktpa by 2015 after completion of the expansion phase. A new ventilation shaft has been
constructed for improved ventilation. The Mine holds a coal production license, Permit No. 205224240253 issued by Guizhou Bureau of Energy valid till 17 June 2020
and a safety production permit MK [0764] issued by Guizhou Province Mining Safety Bureau with validity terms of 21 May 2012 until 20 May 2015.
Mine management has instituted safety training for all workers, as they must receive government training and certification. The Mine manager and safety personnel all
have safety certification. Behre Dolbear was provided copies of these certifications. Baiping Coal Mine is among 14 recently approved mines under the newly introduced
gas prevention and control capacity assessment NengYuanMeiTan No. (2012)278.
Due to the distance and the road conditions from the nearby town, BD Asia suggested that the Company establish company emergency response teams to support its
Mines and associated facilities since the government support teams would need more than one hour to reach the Mine in case of any emergency.
From the approval “QianShuiBaoHan [2011] No.104” for Soil and Water Conservation program issued on 8 June 2011, the Mine solid waste disposal allowance is 7,500
tpa. The allowable area of responsibility is 301.42 hectares. The Mine is under an expansion program, completion of which is scheduled for spring of 2015. BD Asia
observed the need for a larger discharge area. The Mine is located in a mountainous area with limited space. As production increases, the Mine will require more space
for stockpiles that will be in the form of an enclosed structure to avoid air pollution. Currently, the Mine is recycling all the water for Mine and surface use. A bigger
wastewater treatment facility is being constructed to accommodate with the Mine’s expansion. Surface facilities will also be upgraded after underground construction is
completed. Enclosed coal storage facilities have been constructed and the company promised to improve on dust suppressions on the surface while construction is in
progress.
There are no major impacts from other projects in the Coal Mine area, though there is a mine, Laohu Coal Mine (3.14 km2), which is 500m from the east boundary of the
mine. BD Asia was informed, but did not confirm, that Laohu Coal Mine is mining in a different direction creating no conflict in mining for Baiping Coal Mine. BD Asia did
not see a mine map or mine plan of the Laohu Coal Mine.
As of 30 April 2013, Baiping Coal Mine had reached land lease agreements covering 41,994m2 with 24 households. Baiping Coal Mine has paid approximately RMB0.76
million compensation in respect of these agreements. Baiping Coal Mine obtained 10,877m2 of temporary land use rights for 1 year
III-87
from the Bureau of Land and Resources of Jinsha County on 30 May 2012, on which the Bureau of Land and Resources of Jinsha County issued Notice of Land Use
JinGuoTuZiFa [2012] No. 49 advising the Mine to follow local laws for another extended period for land use. On 14 January 2013, the Bureau of Land and Natural
Resources of Jinsha issued another notice for temporary land use of additional 31,116.54 m2, making the total Land Use Right to 41,994m2. The temporary land use
right shall be renewed every year.
10.2.2     Yongsheng Coal Mine
The Yongsheng Coal Mine is located in Gaoping town and Huajuexiang of Jinsha County. The Mine is under construction and was not in production at the time of BD
Asia’s May 2013 site visit.
The Company plans to construct a coal washing plant and elevated overland conveyor 1.5 km to a river jetty. The wash plant and conveyor are scheduled for completion
in mid-2014.
Application for pilot run was submitted in March 2013; approval was expected to be obtained by 30 May 2013; safety production and coal production permits were
expected to be obtained in September and October 2013, respectively. Thereafter, commercial production is expected to commence in November 2013.
Yongsheng Coal Mine holds Business License No. 520000000072585 valid until June 2015 issued by the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Guizhou
Province. The Company has displaced some villagers and compensated some households who were affected by its activity. Mine management has also acquired land
from those less affected and still living in the Mine area. As of 31 December 2012, Yongsheng Coal Mine had reached agreements with 212 households regarding
leases, crop compensation, etc., amounting to 119,411m2 of land and has paid RMB0.98 million for re-location of 5 households. In total, Yongsheng Coal Mine has paid
a lump sum of RMB3.34 million compensation in respect of these agreements and has also paid RMB4.7 million for land acquisition. The Mine is willing to pay RMB0.28
million to compensate the remaining household, as shown in Table 10.3.

government.
III-89
BD Asia observed that there are no government protected areas near the mining property. There is a small mine within the leased area of Yongsheng Coal Mine, which
is under construction and not operating. That mine is not expected to have an impact on Yongsheng Coal Mine.
BD Asia was told that Mine management plans to build a de-gasification and methane collection plant on the Mine site close to the main shaft and to use the Mine’s
methane discharge to produce electricity for Mine use. According to management this is a low methane mine; however, due to government requirements for safe
production, construction of the methane de-gasifying plant is mandatory
An Environmental Impact Study for Coal Mine Methane de-gasification, water source, and discharge studies were carried out by Guizhou Province Coal Mining Design
Institute in August 2008 with Approval [2007] 476 issued by Guizhou Province Environmental Protection Bureau. Also Safety Approval [2008] 91 by Provincial Coal
Mining Safety and Inspection Bureau of Guizhou Province was issued on 06 October 2008. Mining activities in this area will have an impact on the ecology and
surrounding vegetation. Soil erosion is occurring. Mine management is encouraged to carry on soil conservation while mining activities are still in process in order to
help with compliance of the Government Forestation Plan already set up in this region.
The Liuguang River, passing close to the Mine, is considered to contain surface water of Class II according to Guizhou regulatory authorities. Direct discharges into this
river are prohibited. The Mine is permitted to draw water for Mine use upstream of the river. After use, the water will be treated to reach Class II water standards and it
will be discharged downstream of the Liuguang River where the water standard is Class III according to Guizhou surface water standards.
10.2.3              Dayun Coal Mine
The 600 ktpa mining rights permit was obtained in March 2011. BD Asia was shown Business License No. 520000000064325 issued to Guizhou Dayun Mining Limited
Company on 27 July 2011 by the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Guizhou Province. The Mine has environmental approval by the Guizhou Province
Environmental Bureau No [2010]232 issued on 25 November 2010. Construction of Dayun Coal Mine commenced in May 2012.
Initiation of construction was delayed over disagreements in re-location of the surrounding villagers. Since some villagers had hesitated to be re-located, the local
government has stepped in to arbitrate this issue. The Company has planned to re-locate the villagers to Gaoping town. As of 31 December 2012, Dayun Coal Mine had
reached land lease agreements with 135 households and has paid RMB5.33 million for land compensation and leasing rights of 120,346m2 of land, Dayun has paid
approximately RMB8.3 million as land acquisition fees regarding the leases of land to the Bureau of Land and Resources of Jinsha County. Additionally, Dayun Coal
Mine had reached re-location agreements with 44 households and has paid approximately RMB5.73 million for the re-location of the PAPs. It is planning to pay an
additional RMB2.31 million as compensation for the remaining 15 households, which averages to RMB156,600 per household. Detailed compensation at the Mines,
under construction, is shown in Table 10.3.
III-90
BD Asia was recently informed that Jinsha county government has stepped in to resolve the re-location conflicts by ultimately adopting a unified re-location
compensation standard characteristic of Jinsha County. The local government is now urging the remaining villagers to speed up construction of their houses in the
proposed settlement areas. BD Asia was told that those remaining villagers have already started receiving their compensations. Nevertheless, the re-location process
will still negatively affect construction at Dayun due to the unanticipated delays by the government to completely resolve this issue. Some villagers do not accept the
unified re-location standard set by the government and others claim that their houses and land are worth more than what they are being paid. However, based on the
Company’s extensive experience at other Mines, which were faced by similar issues, Feishang hopes that re-location issues at Dayun will not have a big impact on the
development progress; it anticipates completing the re-location by November 2013.
Dayun completed Level 2 quality authentication in March 2013. After the construction assessment is approved, Dayun will submit an application for a joint pilot run, as
shown in Figure 10.1. Pilot run on-site inspection is expected to be completed in June and commence pilot run thereafter. Safety production and coal production permits
are expected to be obtained in November and December of 2013, respectively and commercial production to commence in January 2014.
Dayun Coal Mine has a construction land use Notice QFYDH [2011] No.708 issued on 31 December 2011 that indicates the total area of 132,490m2 to be used for
mining activities. The approval also indicates the need for soil and water conservation as well as the obligation to compensate the PAPs, as this is a new mining area
located in the area where villagers have been living for many years. BD Asia interviewed a group of PAPs in order to hear their views toward establishing a coal mine in
this area. The interviewed villagers appeared willing to re-locate and were welcoming the Company because it will provide employment opportunities to the people living
in this area and will convert the subsistence farming area to an industrial area; however, a few people were still not willing to re-locate due to compensation
disagreements. The local government has intervened because, in China, there are government set standards for compensation to PAPs, which some local villagers
think is not adequate. They are claiming more compensation from the Company.
Mine management has been advised to conduct a detailed environmental impact assessment before construction starts in order to evaluate the impact the Mine might
have on the people who may not need to be moved. Behre Dolbear observed that there was a small community and a school that will not be re-located. Behre Dolbear
suggested that management carefully consider the transportation route from the Dayun Coal Mine to the main paved road during the construction and production periods
in order to protect the safety of the local residents.
Seasonal rivers pass through the Mine area. According to the Guizhou water standards, these are all of Class II water quality standards that need to be preserved during
the mining period. Bijie City Environment Bureau of Guizhou Province has set the limit standard [2010]97 of discharge for Dayun Coal Mine. The standards will allow the
following discharges: COD of 46.61 tpa, Ammonia of 1.44 tpa, SO2 of 21.74 tpa, and “Smoke” of 5.77 tpa.
III-91
A safety reply QMAJJCH [2012] 3 on the preliminary design of Jinsha Gaoping Township Dayun Coal Mine was issued on 13 January 2012, in which the Mine
management was informed upon other issues as follows.
1)                  The Guizhou Coal Mine Design and Research Institute, whose design qualification rating is Class A, is qualified as the responsible body for the safety
section. The Owner, Jinsha Gaoping Dayun Coal Mine of Dayun Mining Co., Ltd, is to be responsible for the review result of the Report.
2)                  Since the mineable seams (M6, M8, M11, and M12) have not been examined for coal and gas outburst hazards, they should, therefore, be regarded as
outburst seams before an outburst hazard examination is conducted, and the relevant outburst prevention rules should be strictly followed. Also, before arranging for the
initial mining face, the coal seam advanced check should be implemented as per the outburst prevention rules and should not be worked upon until any danger of
outburst is eliminated.
3)                  The Mine is required to follow the “Provisions on Coal Mine Water Prevention and Control,” and further improve its hydrogeological investigation data,
intensify the technical exploration measures, knowing details of all water recharge resources within the region, and prepare a separate water prospecting and discharge
design plan before working on the initial mining face of each seam.
According to Circular GNMT (2011) No.414 passed on 26 December 2011, all mines in Guizhou Province with production capacities of 300 ktpa and over with possibility
of gas outbursts were required to pass a gas prevention and control test. Dayun Coal Mine and all other Coal Mines of the Company are among the fourteen approved
mines for this test according to approval JNYMT(2012)No 278 issued on 20 August 2012.
10.2.4              Gouchang Coal Mine
Gouchang Coal Mine is located in Kunzhai Town in Nayong County of Guizhou Province. The Mine area is economically underdeveloped with low population density.
Subsistence farming and animal husbandry are the main activities.
The Mine holds all necessary permits. Behre Dolbear was provided with copies of those permits. The Mine has Business License No. 520000000023520 valid until 01
July 2017 and production safety permit No. MK (0395) for 90 ktpa that is valid until 10 April 2014. Behre Dolbear observed that environmental impact approval reference
number (2007) 069 was granted to the Mine.
No villages will be affected by mining. A town road passes through the Mine surface area and according to the government requirements, mining is not permitted under
the road. The Mine is still upgrading the surface facilities; hence, surface dust control still needs to be improved.
III-92
Because of the newly introduced Notice QianNengYuanBan [2013] No.120 Ref No. (QFGD-2013-29002) for consolidation of coal mines in Guizhou Province having
production capacity of less than 90 ktpa, Gouchang Coal Mine is considering a merger with a neighboring mine. That mine is privately owned by an individual and is not
eligible to undergo merging and restructuring activities until approved by the local government. That mine has a mining right of 30 ktpa and is still a brownfield with no
detailed exploration information. As a result, there are still uncertainties for this combination; hence, Gouchang Coal Mine is expected to remain idle during 2013 and
2014. The Company plans to maintain production of 110 ktpa from 2015 to 2019, upon completion of integration.
BD Asia has been advised that as of 30 April 2013, Gouchang Coal Mine had reached land lease agreements covering 43,476m2 with the village committee and 30
households. The Company has paid RMB0.57 million in compensation with respect to these agreements. Gouchang Coal Mine obtained temporary land use right from
the Bureau of Land and Resources of Nayong County for 11,329m2 on 04 July 2012 valid until 23 May 2013. On 14 January 2013, an extra 32146.87m2 temporary land
use right was granted to Gouchang Coal Mine. In total, the Company has paid RMB0.68 Million for land compensations and temporary land use rights. The temporary
land use rights shall be renewed every year. BD Asia noted that there were no issues of land compensation and re-location at Gouchang Coal Mine.
10.2.5              Dayuan Coal Mine
Dayuan Coal Mine is located in Xinfang Town of Nayong County approximately 7 km from Yangchang thermal power plant. The Mine currently holds Business License
No. 52000000002671 valid until 21 January 2029. Recently, construction at Dayuan was delayed due to the requirement from the local government in Nayong County for
the updating of the geological report and re-application of the new mining permit. Behre Dolbear was informed that the update had been completed and the new mining
permit, C5200002011051120118585 for 300 ktpa indicated in Table 10.1 above, was recently issued on 15 March 2013.
Due to the potential effect of mining activities on the community, Dayuan Coal Mine has re-located all villagers who were to be affected by its mining activities. As of 30
April 2013, the Mine had reached compensation agreements for a total of 72.814m2 of land and had paid RMB591,417 with respect to these land compensations. It has
also reached re-location agreements with the village committee of Pingdong Village, Xinfang Town, and Nayong County and 26 households have been re-located since
construction started. A re-location expense compensation of RMB4.2 million has been paid to the relevant households. Additionally, Dayuan Coal Mine has paid
approximately RMB113,200 for the temporary land use right of 4,528m2 land valid until 10 July 2013. On 14 January 2013, Dayuan Coal Mine obtained an extra
62,318.68m2 temporary land use right. According to that confirmation letter, the temporary land use rights shall be valid for 2 years. The Company plans to pay
RMB4.03 million for land compensation in the coming years for the land expected to be disturbed through subsidence and Mine construction.
Mine management has built a methane de-gasifying plant. The location of this plant has an effect on the community. A scheme for the protection, treatment and
restoration of the geological environment was carried out by Zhongdi Geological and Mining Institute dated 25 December 2010 and approved by Bijie Environmental
Bureau with reference number [2011]52. Also, an environmental social
III-93
assessment concerning the effect and benefits of the project in this area was carried out wherein a total number of 108 people were interviewed and 97 responses were
received. The interviewees included residents near Dayuan Coal Mine and 8 local government departments. Questions asked included the impact of the project on the
community, major environmental problems in the area, negative influence on the environment of the project, economic influence of the project, and agree/disagree
supporting the project. Of the people interviewed, 85% agreed that this project would benefit the local economy, 100% of the individuals agreed the project will benefit
the local residents, and 99% of the residents agreed with setting up the project. All government agencies gave positive responses to each of the questions on the
questionnaire.
The Dayuan Coal Mine obtained an Environmental Protection Reply QHS [2011]122 on 04 August 2011 regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment of Dayuan Coal
Mine, into which Nayong Laluo Coal Mine and Nayong Dayuan Coal Mine have been integrated. The integrated Mine is now called Nayong County Dayuan Coal Mine
with a permitted capacity of 0.30 ktpa, which is to increase to 0.45 ktpa. The reply confirmed that the Environmental Impact Assessment conformed to the local
conditions and its environmental protection measures are adequate. Also, the project construction has conformed to the planning of Guizhou Province coal industry. In
this report, the Mine was advised to meet all the required industrial and mining standards of the PRC. The following recommendations were proposed:
1)                  Because the Mine shaft and shaft field boundary are within the boundaries of the villages, it was recommended to create safety protection pillars and green
belts between the Mine site and communities.
2)                  Minimize the occurrences of subsidence, strengthen environmental protection measures, and reduce solid waste dumping around the Mine area.
3)                  Apply necessary dust suppression and noise reduction measures so as to lessen the impact on the nearby community.
4)                  Strengthen environmental water protection plans and optimize the water treatment technology in the Mine’s water treatment plant. Also, to improve upon the
recovery rate of wastewater (sewage). The domestic sewage shall be recycled after reaching Grade I of Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB8978-1996)
through treatment; the Mine water shall be recycled after iron content reaches Grade I of Guizhou Provincial Standard for Discharge of Environmental Pollutants (DB52-
1999) and the other indicators should reach Emission Standards for Pollutants from Coal Industry (GB20436-2006) with usual rate not less than 50%. The remaining
wastewater (sewage) shall be discharged into the Nayong River via a special discharge pipe.
5)                  The Mine’s coal-fired boiler should be fueled with low-sulfur coal. It was recommended to construct supporting flue gas dust removal facilities. The boiler flue
gas must be discharged via a 30m chimney after reaching the Standard Period II of District II of Emission of Air Pollutants for Oil-burning Gas-fired Boiler (GB13271-
2001).
III-94
6)                  The standard total discharge limits of the pollutants at the Mine site shall be: COD of 9 tpa, NH3-N of 0.55 tpa, SO2 of 5.64 tpa, Fuse Dust of 1.45 tpa, and
Nitrogen Oxide of 1.54 tpa.
10.2.6              Liujiaba Coal Mine
Liujiaba Coal Mine is located north of Tianba Village in Xinhua Town, approximately 22 km from the Liuzhi Special District. At the time of Behre Dolbear’s site visit in
2011, the Mine was in a trial production period, which was scheduled to be completed on 18 December 2012. As of the submission of this report, Behre Dolbear was
informed that the Mine had completed the trial period and was issued a coal production safety approval on 20 November 2012. It is now under normal production. The
Mine is licensed for 300 ktpa, the mine management plan to increase production to 600 ktpa. The coal from this Mine is sold to a second party who collects the coal and
sells it to the power plants in Liupanshui City.
The Liujiaba Coal Mine currently holds an extendable Business License No. 520000000003633 issued to Liujiaba Coal Company on 01 March 2011. The environmental
and geological study was carried out by Guizhou Chuan Meiji Technical Company on 06 August 2009 and approved with Approval Permit No. [2009]185. In 2011, an
Environmental Impact Assessment was carried out and the approval QianHuanShan No. [2011]110 was issued on 07 July 2011. The Mine has a safety approval
No. [2009]128 from Guizhou Coal Mine Safety Inspection Bureau. An Environmental Social Impact assessment on this Mine was carried out by Guizhou Coal Design
Company approval [2011]67 was granted. BD Asia was told that Liujiaba Coal Mine has reached land lease agreements covering 49,278m2 with the Tianba Village
committee and 78 households. It has obtained the 49,278m2 temporary land use confirmation letter from the Bureau of Land and Resources of Liupanshui on 01
March 2013. The temporary land use right shall be renewed every 2 years.
BD Asia was impressed with the training standards for the Mine management and workers. Behre Dolbear was informed that at this Mine there are four levels of training,
i.e., country level (Mine Managers), District level (special workers — methane inspectors, blasters, electricians, and safety managers), county level (certified coal
miners), and Mine level (for all workers at the Mine).
Soil and solid waste management at the Liujiaba Coal Mine is being improved. Mine disturbed land is being re-vegetated. The Mine has created stockpile areas from
which a portion of the solid wastes is re-used for Mine infrastructure construction and a portion is also sold to cement manufacturing plants and for road construction.
Also, the Mine pays the government a fee for land reclamation each year. BD Asia was provided with copies of safety installation modifications reply QMAJSZ [2012]
32 for Liujiaba Coal Mine issued on 24 February 2012 by Guizhou Coal Mining Safety Inspection Bureau ShuiChang Department accepting the modifications proposed
by Jiangxi Province Coal Mining Design Institute. In accordance with “Safety Installation of the Coal Mine Construction Project Design Review and Final Acceptance
Standards” [AQ 1055-2008], the bureau approved the modifications and provided supplementary recommendations to the Company that included: improving the
ventilation system management; complying with the “Coal Mining Water Prevention Regulation” by improving on the Mine site; and shaft hydrological works by preparing
special water detection and drainage designs. The Mine was reviewed again and acceptance safety reply QianMeiAnJianShuiZi [2012]106 was issued on 25
October 2012. At the time of BD Asia’s May 2013 site visit, the Mine had obtained a coal production permit and was in commercial production.
III-95
10.2.7              Zhulinzhai Coal Mine
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine is located approximately 5 km from Liujiaba Coal Mine. Zhulinzhai Coal Mine shares the same roads with Liujiaba Coal Mine. The permit area for
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine is 1.4104 km2.
The Mine currently holds an extendable Business License No. 520000000003203 issued on 19 December 2012, a Coal Production License No. 205202030630 valid from
16 April 2012 until 16 April 2031, and a Safety Production Permit MK (0699) valid from 06 March 2012 until 05 March 2015. An environmental review [2011]21 carried out
on 04 April 2011 was approved in June 2011. Behre Dolbear was advised that the Mine design was approved on 17 January 2011 with Approval No. [2011]42.Coal
mining companies under construction/integration will be issued both coal production and safety approvals after a safety review has been conducted upon completion of
construction. Zhulinzhai recently obtained approval for this Safety Facilities review and is in commercial production.
The Zhulinzhai Coal Mine has not yet received a permit to draw water from and discharge water into the Yinpan River, a tributary of the Wujiang River, but it has
received a confirmation letter stating that the Mine will not be penalized for drawing water from and discharging water into that river if treatment attains the government
set standards. A discharge permit with Ref No. (203220120024) issued on 08 August 2012 by Environmental Protection Bureau of Liuzhi Special District valid until 07
August 2013 was provided to BD Asia for review. BD Asia also had the opportunity to inspect the water treatment facility at Zhulinzhai and observed that the Mine was
operating according to the government set standards. BD Asia also observed that there were no adjacent projects that could affect this project and there are no
government protected areas.
PAPs have been compensated and the remaining households affected by the current road construction are going to be compensated by the Department of Road
Construction and Maintenance. A concession has been reached whereby the mines in this area have been asked to contribute money for road construction and villagers’
compensations. Zhulinzhai and Liujiaba Coal Mines have contributed RMB1.5 million for this road construction and for compensating the affected people. As of 30
April 2013, road construction has reached an advanced stage. BD Asia observed that the people in this area welcomed the development of this Mine since it is providing
employment to the local communities. Some of the villagers have already been employed as construction workers.
BD Asia was provided with copies of completion of safety installation devices reply QMAJSZ [2012] No. 27 for Zhulinzhai Coal Mine issued on 16 February 2012 by
Guizhou Coal Mining Safety Inspection Bureau ShuiChang Department on which rectification of safety device installation was accepted and proved to have reached the
design requirements. The Mine management was advised upon other methods to drain the methane before tunnel development and mining; to improve on the gas
inspection and ventilation systems; and to make further improvements and studies on the hydrology and geological data.
Zhulinzhai Coal Mine management has reached land lease agreements covering 37,913m2 with the Tianba village committee and some households. A confirmation
letter for the temporary land use right, issued by the Bureau of Land and Resources of Liupanshui city, was granted on 01 March 2013. The
III-96
temporary land use right shall be renewed every 2 years. The Mine has paid RMB5.32 million for re-location of 69 households. Mine management has also paid
approximately RMB1.06 million for land compensation to 40 households and has set aside an extra RMB114,920 for land compensation at this Mine for those people
who might be affected by subsidence.
10.3                        OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
There have been fatalities at the individual sites prior to and after the Company acquired the Mines. Some accidents that happened before the Company acquired the
Mines were not properly documented. However, those that occurred after Feishang acquired the Mines were documented and BD Asia was informed of the causes in
each case. The Company has accidents recorded per million tonnes of coal for 5 Mines operating or under construction. Table 10.4 shows the accident records at each
site before and after Feishang acquired the Mines. A total of 7 fatalities and 31 serious injuries have occurred since 2008. Of the 7 fatalities, 2 occurred after the
Company acquired the Mines. Compensations have been given to the affected families. BD Asia observed and was impressed by the effort employed by management
to avoid future accidents at all the Company’s Mines.

11.0        OPERATING COSTS
The Mines actual and forecasted direct cash production costs are shown in Table 11.1. These costs are reported by the Company to have been prepared on the basis of
the original and optimized Mine plans as well as current management plans and have been incorporated into the BCFM, as discussed later in this report. The actual
costs provide some indication of the accuracy of the forecasts, with the exception of the Zhulinzhai Coal Mine. In general, the historical actual costs vary from the
forecasts due to the start-up nature of the three operating Mines. Generally, the Mines have not reached steady state and the costs actually incurred do not reflect the
economies of scale that should be realized when the Mines reach steady state production levels.
The high level of effort put into these forecasts is apparent in the detail provided to BD Asia. The new plans, developed since the first field visit, appear to be generally
well thought out and well executed. In general, the cost forecasts appear to be conservative with the exception of the maintenance estimate for the four Mines that were
originally planned for manual longwalls but will ultimately have mechanical longwalls installed. BD Asia believes the cost estimates for the maintenance estimate of the
mechanical longwalls could be slightly low. BD Asia believes the costs described in Table 11.1 for each Mine are reasonable and attainable.

12.0                        CAPITAL COSTS
Capital costs for the development of the seven Coal Mines are shown in detail in Table 12.1. The projected capital requirements include the underground development
and surface facilities, as well as the capital costs required for initial equipment purchases. The projected base capacity capital costs are a combination of the capital
costs as per the original mine plan designs, actual expenditures through 2011, and the Company’s budgeted costs. The Company’s budgeted costs are based on the
construction progress to date and the projected requirements to complete the base capacity construction phase. The projected capital costs for the incremental
increases in capacity above the base capacity are based on the optimized mine designs. BD Asia believes these projections appear to be well thought-out and well
developed.
No capital costs have been included for the optimization phase of the Gouchang Coal Mine.
Table 12.1 includes the estimated capital costs for the port and coal beneficiation plant. It should be noted these capital costs are conceptual, as no formal pre-
feasibility study has been completed.

BD Asia reviewed the BCFM prepared by the Company titled “Project Champion_Financial Model (June 2013) — to BDv1.xls” as received by BD Asia on 04 June 2013.
The technical operating parameters, revenues, operating costs, taxes, and capital costs for the Mines and Properties are integrated into the BCFM, resulting in the
determination of the after-tax net income and cash flow for each property and the aggregate of the seven projects for 18 years commencing in Year 2013 and ending
2030. BD Asia’s review focused on the period between 2013 and 2019.
The objective of BD Asia’s evaluation of the BCFM was to validate the economic viability of the seven Mines and Properties in support of the Proved and Probable
Reserves reported in this ITR. This financial evaluation is not intended to represent the fair market value of the seven Mines and Properties. The focus of this
financial evaluation was on the reasonableness of the mining technical inputs into the BCFM and the effect of those inputs on the economic viability of the Mines and
Properties; thus, substantiating the categorization of the reported Proved and Probable Reserves. BD Asia’s financial analysis was performed in the context of Reserves
and did not address tonnages in lesser categories.
BD Asia’s review relied upon the documents made available to BD Asia, BD Asia’s site visits, and BD Asia’s experience within the industry. BD Asia believes that the
incorporation of the technical inputs into the BCFM is consistent with generally accepted calculation methodologies used industry-wide. Additionally, BD Asia reviewed
the structure of the Company’s spreadsheet model and key mathematical formulas for accuracy and consistency with project documents and technical inputs.
It should be noted that the BCFM was presented on an after-tax basis and debt financing has been included. BD Asia did not review the terms of the debt financing or
interest calculations.
All costs and revenues are reported in “real” or constant RMBs without escalation. BD Asia recommends the use of a constant currency approach when modeling cash
flows for mining operations because:
1)                  Coal sales prices have not been annually escalated to reflect the effect of inflation; therefore, it would not be appropriate to annually escalate production
costs.
2)                  Errors or omissions in estimating production costs are further compounded in later years as the operating costs are escalated to reflect the effect of inflation.
The BCFM is based on 100% interest with the annual projected cash flows adjusted accordingly for the Company’s level of interest, as shown in Table 13.1. The NPV
for each Mine and Property is determined on the basis of the Company’s level of interest.

The BCFM is based upon certain information and assumptions with respect to future events and conditions. For the purpose of this report, BD Asia has used and relied
upon information provided by sources that BD Asia believes to be reliable. BD Asia believes that the use of such information and assumptions is reasonable for the
purposes of this report. However, actual performance might vary significantly from the assumptions and forecasts due to unanticipated events and circumstances. To
the extent that actual future conditions may differ from those assumed herein or provided by others, the actual results will vary from those forecast in the BCFM.
13.2                        TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS — BCFM INPUTS
13.2.1              Basis of BCFM Inputs
The basis of the BCFM production volumes and unit production costs are the “original mine designs” and the “optimization mine designs” for the individual seven Mines
and Properties. These designs were prepared by JPCM who produced the LOM plans and production schedules at each Mine. BD Asia believes that taken in
combination, the studies developed by WZMM and JPCM are equivalent to pre-feasibility level representations of the operational and financial aspects of the seven
Mines.
The final production capacity at each Mine (except Gouchang) will be accomplished in two phases. The first phase incorporates the design parameters as per the
original mine design to achieve a base production capacity. The original mine designs were prepared by [WZMM] and are described in the documents shown in Table
13.2.

The optimization mine design reports produced by JPCM in March 2011 are based on the incremental increases in production above the base capacity and do not
address the original mine design parameters in any significant detail. The operating costs and capital costs are also reported on an incremental basis. BD Asia was
provided with these reports and has used these reports as the basis for the review of the BCFM, as it pertains to the optimized mine design, including the production
targets, operating costs, and capital costs.
In the BCFM, the Company modified the original and optimization production volumes and unit production costs to account for more recent management plans and
budgets. In particular, these changes include:
1)                  Modifications to the unit production costs to reflect IFRS requirement of amortizing the fair value of the mining rights over the proven and probable reserves,
and others.
2)                  Lower coal production volumes during the first several years of production years to reflect the Company’s internal annual budgets and the latest condition in
Guizhou. By 2019, the BCFM production volumes are equal to the combined production volumes projected in the original and optimization mine designs.
3)                  Estimations of a product mix and associated coal product pricing. The original and optimization mine designs assume a single product.
4)                  A 15% increase in wages to reflect the Chinese social security requirements.
BD Asia did not review the underlying assumptions regarding the current management production volumes and costs; however, the management projections appear to
be more conservative than those outlined in the original and optimized mine plans.
13.2.2              Cash Flow Timeline
The BCFM is based upon an 18-year period from the Year 2013 through the Year 2030. Each of the seven Coal Mines have been modeled at its particular stage of
development, as discussed in detail earlier in this report. As of 30 April 2013, Baiping, Liujiaba, and Zhulinzhai Coal Mines were in commercial production. The remaining
Mines are under construction and in various stages of completion. Behre Dolbear believes that all the Mines under construction are well enough advanced to be
designated “Mines” in accordance with recent filing rules.
BD Asia’s review focused on the period between 2013 and 2019. Steady state operations are achieved by 2019 with the completion of all the construction phases at
each of the seven Coal Mines. These steady state production targets and operating costs are assumed in the BCFM to continue through the Year 2030.
13.2.3              LOM and Reserves
The BCFM is based on the first 18 years of Proved and Probable Reserves at the seven Coal Mines, as defined by the JORC Code and evaluated by BD Asia in this
report (Table 13.3). At the end of the BCFM analysis period of 18 years, significant tonnages of Proved and Probable Reserves are expected to remain at essentially all
of the Coal Mines.

13.2.4     Coal Production
The annual production schedule outlined in the BCFM is shown in Table 13.4. The annual production forecasts at each Mine gradually increases as the production at
each Mine is increased with the completion of the expansion and optimization phases. Steady state production is expected to be attained at all seven Coal Mines by the
Year 2019.

(1)                                 A trial period will occur at the Mines at the end of each construction phase. The coal produced during this period has been modeled in the BCFM as
a credit toward the cost of construction.
III-106
The Company has indicated that prior to 2013, most coal produced at the operating mines was sold as thermal coal. Starting in 2013, the Company intends to
beneficiate certain portions of the run-of-mine coal in order to enhance marketability and facilitate the sale of differing grades of coal. However, coal sales in 2013 will
continue to be primarily thermal coal with only a portion sold as chemical coal. This product mix has been primarily driven by the Guizhou government’s requirement for
the Company to produce and sell a minimum amount of thermal coal, which has taken a significant portion of the Company’s production capacity. The Company has
projected increases in chemical coal and PCI-grade coal sales after March 2014.
After 2014, a majority of the coal has been projected by the Company to be sold as either chemical coal for the production of synthetic ammonia or methanol or as
thermal coal to the electric power industry. Some PCI coal will be produced at the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines for use in the steel industry. The overall
product mix is shown in Table 13.5 and was discussed in detail earlier in this report.

13.2.5              Coal Sales Price and Revenues
The forecasted sales prices incorporated into the BCFM and provided by the Company are shown in Table 13.6. As per the Company, the primary source for these
prices is from the Fenwei Energy marketing report dated November 2012 and prepared for the Company. Fenwei Energy has projected that anthracite prices in Guizhou
will generally increase over the next several years as a function of the decreasing anthracite reserves within the PRC, the Guizhou, and surrounding provinces. The
thermal coal and high ash anthracite prices are based on historical prices, as per the Company. All the coal prices are Mine-mouth prices unless stated otherwise and
include all taxes with the exception of the 17% VAT.

Coal prices in the PRC are dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to: (1) regional demand; (2) regional infrastructure and transportation capabilities;
(3) whether the coal is sold domestically or exported; (4) coal quality; and (5) contracts to off-takers. For this reason, it is important to ensure the coal prices are for a
specific region rather than a general price for the overall of PRC. For comparison to the projected prices, the historical price trends reported by Fenwei Energy for the
Guizhou province and region are shown in Figure 13.1. The overall coal industry in the PRC has seen some price volatility in the past year as a function of coal supply
and demand mechanisms throughout the PRC and declines in the PRC and global economies.

(2)                                 Historical price based on actual prices achieved by the Company in 2012.
The BCFM-projected 2013 price is generally within 1% to 2% the 12-month historical average prices in 2012. Since cash flows are most sensitive to commodity prices,
Behre Dolbear has prepared a sensitivity analysis incorporating the recent average prices as the steady state price for 2013 through 2019. This sensitivity analysis is
presented later in this report.
Overall revenues from all the Mines are projected grow from RMB257.7 million in 2013 to RMB3.63 billion in 2019 (assuming 100% level of interest). The breakdown of
revenues by coal product is shown in Figure 13.2. Chemical coal sales account for 65% of the total revenues while PCI and thermal coal sales account for 24% and
11% of the total revenues, respectively. Revenues from the sale of high-ash anthracite are treated as a by-product credit to the cost of production and, as such, are not
included in the revenues total. The sale of the Company’s coal as chemical coal types is essential to the attainment of projected revenue levels.

13.2.6              Cost of Production
The BCFM cost of production is based on several factors.
·                  The weighted average of the operating costs associated with the original mine design base capacity and the incremental production capacity associated with
the optimization mine design.
·                  The Company’s management budgets.
The steady state cost of production at the seven Mines is shown Table 13.8.

(2)                                 Basis of coal washing production cost is RMB50/tonne of coal washed if coal washing is outsourced and RMB29/tonne of coal washed if coal
washing is done at the Company’s coal washing facility (after 2014).
(3)                                 By-product credit for sale of high ash anthracite.
III-112
BD Asia believes the BCFM production costs are reasonable and generally conservative when compared to the original and optimization mine plan documentation.
Coal washing costs in Table 13.8 are based on a standard washing cost of RMB28.80/tonne of coal, if the washing is done at the Company’s coal washing facility and
RMB50/tonne of coal, if the coal washing function is outsourced to nearby coal washing facilities. This cost was determined on the basis of Memorandums of
Understanding (MOU) between the Company and neighboring coal washing facilities.
In the BCFM as provided by the Company, the coal washing costs reflect the construction and operation of a coal washing facility owned and operated by the Company
that is to be located near the Yongsheng Coal Mine and will be used to wash coals from the Baiping, Yongsheng, and Dayun Coal Mines starting in 2014. This coal
beneficiation facility is still in the conceptual phase and has not been the subject of a pre-feasibility study. As such, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to reflect only
outsourcing of the coal washing function. The advantage of owning and operating a coal beneficiation facility will be lower operating costs, although additional capital
expenditures will be required to construct the facility. The Company believes the capital expenditures will be offset over time by the reduction in operating costs.
13.2.7     Other Costs and Expenses
Other costs in the BCFM include selling costs, administrative costs, and interest costs (Table 13.9). The selling costs include salaries, service fees, loading fees, and
maintenance. Transportation costs have not been included as all the coal prices are mine mouth prices and the customer bears the transportation costs.
BD Asia has not reviewed the underlying assumptions for these other costs in any detail; however, BD Asia believes these costs appear to be reasonable compared to
other similar coal projects.
13.2.8     Taxes and Government Levies
The Mines are subject to several government levies, as shown in Table 13.9. BD Asia has not verified the government levy amounts or requirements since this is out of
BD Asia’s scope of work.
III-113
The income tax rate is projected at 25% of operating profit (sales income or revenue less operating and other costs).

13.2.9     Capital Costs, Depreciation, and Amortization
Capital expenditures have been included in the BCFM for the completion of the construction phases at the seven Mines (Table 13.10). The capital expenditure timing is
consistent with the construction schedules discussed earlier in this report. BD Asia believes the BCFM capital expenditures are reasonable.
In the BCFM received from the Company, the capital expenditures are offset by the revenues generated from the sale of coal during the development and construction
phases. It should be noted that the revenues are determined on the basis of the product mix and coal sales prices discussed earlier. BD Asia believes it might be
optimistic to assume the final product mix will be accomplished during the construction phase (especially the base capacity construction phase). As evidence, almost
all coal sales, to date, have been as thermal products.
According to the Company, sustaining capital has been taken into account through accrued accounts for Coal Mine Safety Fee (RMB10/tonne) and Coal Mine
Maintenance Fee (RMB10.5/tonne) and has been included as part of the cost of sales (see Table 13.8).
Capital expenditures have been depreciated on a per tonne basis (Proved and Probable Reserves) rather than on a straight-line depreciation basis. The fair values of the
mining rights have been amortized over the Proven and Probable Reserves.

Construction Coal Net Cash
Net Capital Costs
13.2.10  Working Capital
Changes in working capital were determined for the purpose of calculating the annual cash flows. The projected increases in production, coal sales prices, and operating
expenditures during the first 8 years of the BCFM would be expected to have notable effects on working capital, especially accounts payable, accounts receivables, and
inventory. After steady state operations are achieved, changes to annual working capital would be expected to become minimal or nil. As such, the changes in working
capital are expected to have a greater effect on the cash flows in the earlier years of the analysis period.
13.2.11  Net Income and Cash Flow Determination
Net income or net profit is determined as the sales revenue less production costs, other costs, and government levies and taxes. To determine the cash flow, the net
income is adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation and working capital and cash disbursements, such as capital expenditures.
13.3  DEMONSTRATION OF ECONOMIC VIABILITY
Each of the seven Coal Mines demonstrated a positive undiscounted NPV in the between the Years 2013 and 2019. BD Asia believes the Proved and Probable
Reserves for the seven Coal Mines, as presented earlier in this report, have demonstrated economic viability under reasonable financial assumptions. These results are
dependent on the technical inputs discussed in this report. Material changes in the production operating costs, capital costs, expansion completion dates, production
tonnage, and coal sales price could affect these results.
III-115
13.4  SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
To determine the effect of changing several of the base case assumptions, BD Asia prepared a sensitivity analysis. BD Asia believes that certain factors, such as coal
sales price, operating costs, and capital costs, could have a significant effect on the financial performance of the Mines. The objective of the sensitivity analyses is to
determine the effect of varying several key parameters, as a point of comparison to the BCFM. BD Asia limited the sensitivity review only to the period between 2012
and 2019. The following parameters were evaluated.
·                  Coal sales prices generally have the greatest effect on coal mine project economics. The sensitivity to changes in coal sales prices was determined by
varying the coal sales prices shown in Table 13.6 by ±10%, ±20% and ±30%.
·                  The cash production costs were varied to determine the effect on NPV (limited to material, wages, power, maintenance, and coal washing costs). Other costs,
such as selling expenses and administrative costs, were not changed. The sensitivity to changes in the production costs was determined by varying the cash costs
shown in Table 13.8 by ±10%, ±20%, and ±30%. The non-cash costs were not changed.
·                  Since the optimization phase of construction has not been fully initiated at any of the seven Coal Mines, a series of sensitivities were completed to determine
the effect of changing the incremental capital costs associated only with the optimized mine design (Table 13.10) by ±10%, ±20%, and ±30%. The capital expenditures
associated with the original mine plans were not changed because these expenditures are nearly completed.
It should be noted that in all of these cases, the particular parameter was changed for all seven Coal Mines over the full period of review (2013 through 2019). With the
exception of coal sales prices, it is unlikely that all of the Mines would experience the same increases or decreases in production costs, capital expenditures, and coal
sales tonnages at the same time over the entire period of review. As such, these sensitivity analyses present the best or the worst case scenarios in the ranges
evaluated. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to determine the robustness of the seven Mines in their totality rather than on an individual basis and to provide an
indication of the relative effect that the various operating parameter can have on the overall economics.
III-116
As demonstrated in Figure 13.3 of the sensitivity factors reviewed, the cash flows and NPVs are more significantly affected by coal sales prices and coal sales
tonnages.
Undiscounted Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis
Analysis Period: 2013-2019
Figure 13.3 NPV (10%) sensitivity analysis — BCFM
BD Asia conducted an additional sensitivity analysis reviewing the effect of the product mix. In a worst case scenario, if the Company is unable to sell its coal as a
premium product (i.e., chemical coals or PCI coal) and all the coal is sold solely as thermal coal throughout the LOM, the overall NPV for the period between 2013
through 2019 is negative; however, a positive NPV is realized, if the analysis period is extended through 2030. This demonstrates the need for the Company to be able
to sell a significant portion of its coal into markets other than the thermal coal market.
An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of outsourcing all of the coal washing function. The advantage associated with owning and
operating a coal beneficiation facility will be lower operating costs, although additional capital expenditures will be required to construct the facility. An increase of 2%
was realized for the undiscounted NPV between 2013 and 2019, demonstrating that the reduction in operating costs offsets the increase in capital costs.

14.0 RISK ANALYSIS
In reviewing the Company’s coal mines, BD Asia has considered areas where there is perceived technical risk to the operation, particularly where the risk component
could materially impact the projected production and resulting cash flows. The assessment is necessarily subjective and qualitative. The following risk matrix definitions
have been employed by BD Asia to assign risk factors to the various aspects and components of the Company’s seven Coal Mines (Table 14.1 and Table 14.2).
Likelihood of Risk (within 7 years)
Likely — will probably occur
Possible — may occur
Unlikely — unlikely to occur

PROJECT RISK DETERMINATION FOR COAL MINES OF THE COMPANY
TABLE 14.2
Risk Description
Likelihood
The mines are located in high topographic relief areas.
Summer and winter are moderate with the rainy season in
the summer. The rest of year is dry. Risk: Climate could
affect the operations.
 
The levels of infrastructure are not well developed in any of
the Mine areas. Emergency services are generally not
quickly available. Utilities are adequate. Risk: Infrastructure
 
could constrain access to the sites.
 
 
From a geological perspective, this risk is related to
potential earth tremors. According to China National
Standard B50011-2001 “Regulations on the Design of
Earthquake Resisting Structures,” the region is at an
earthquake intensity prevention level of VI. Basic
earthquake acceleration is at 0.05 grams. Historically, the
coal field has never experienced a strong earthquake. Risk:
Earthquakes could affect the operations.
 
Essentially, the geological risk is from the likelihood of
unexpected but mild variation in the thicknesses of the
seams and interburdens. Risk: Variations in the seam
thickness could affect operations.
III-118
Risk Description
The geological risk is also related to the likelihood of
encountering unexpected anomalies, such as faults in the
coal seam. Faulting is prominent in each of the Mines;
however, the faults have been well defined and accounted
for in the Mine planning. Risk: Seam anomalies could
affect operations.
 
BD Asia has not audited the sampling data or conducted
independent sampling. The exploration and resource
calculations were completed by government entities that
have no stake in the Mines and their work is generally
considered reputable. Risk: Incorrect sampling has affected
the resource calculations.
BD Asia believes the coal resource estimation database,

BD Asia believes the coal resource estimation database,
procedures, and parameters applied by the government
agencies to be reasonable and appropriate. BD Asia
believes the mining losses used by the agency, in some
cases, are optimistic in multiple stacked seams. Risk:
Reserve conversion from in-situ resources has not been
 
completed properly.
 
 
BD Asia believes that the tenure of the Coal Resources and
Reserves at the Gouchang Coal Mine is at risk until it is
consolidated with one or more of the surround small mines
or a new mine permit is issued. RISK: Gouchang has no
JORC compliant Coal Resources and Reserves which
represents less than 3% of the Company’s total Coal
Reserves.
 
The organization and machinery setup, observed by BD
Asia in May 2013, is suitable to the geology of the
deposits. The Mine plans are appropriately designed for the
deposits. Risk: The mining methodology is inappropriate for
the conditions.
 
BD Asia believes that the Mine recoveries used in the
reserve calculations are achievable for the first 5 years of
operation. The mining losses could be somewhat higher for
deeper stacked seams due to the relatively small
interburden distances in some cases. Risk: Mine
recoveries and losses are incorrect.
 
BD Asia believes the forecasted production for the mines is
reasonable and attainable. The production ramp-up periods
appear to reasonable and well thought out. Risk: Equipment
and Mine plans are not appropriate to achieve production
projections.
III-119
Risk Description
Unforeseen external events have caused significant delays
in the past year in achieving construction and production
schedules. Risk: Projected production levels are reduced
due to unforeseen circumstances (i.e., government
regulations).
 
Coal quality data was made available to BD Asia during the
field visit and from translations of the various studies
provided to Behre Dolbear. The large number of coal seams
and the individual quality variations from Mine to Mine and
seam to seam make overall coal product quality difficult to
define. Risk: Coal quality has not been fully defined.
 
The anthracite coal to be mined at all the Mines appears to
be of relatively high quality and amenable to diverse
markets after washing. Risk: Coals do not respond to
washing.
 
When washed, the coals appear to result in comparatively
high quality products with a significant portion of the
washed coal possessing physical and chemical
characteristics that make them attractive as high value PCI
components. The extent to which these coals can be
upgraded has not been full quantified. Risk: Coal is not
marketable to markets that offer premium pricing.
 
Environmental oversight activities appear to be well
developed and supervised. Compliance with government
regulations was observed. Risk: The Company is not in
compliance with regulations.
 
The Company has developed or is developing impressive
labor and management training programs. Risk: Labor force
will be unable to efficiently operate the longwall equipment.  
 
 
Community communications have been developed. Re-
location problems at some mines are still outstanding
issues though the Company has made progress. Risk:
Villagers refusing to re-locate and demanding higher
compensation.

Management and Personnel
Changes in government policies are unpredictably affecting
Feishang’s Mine development progress. Policies introduced
in other provinces are now being applied to Guizhou
province. The recently introduced gas test review and the
integration policy in this province has caused a standoff at
Gouchang. It is possible that after completion of the newly
introduced industry consolidation, from 2013 to 31
March 2014, approval for mine expansion might be
suspended temporarily. Therefore, Feishang had to
conservatively re-schedule Phase II construction of Liujiaba
and Zhulinzhai to January 2015. Risk: Poor safety
measures and mining methods at non Feishang Mines will
cause the government to introduce more policies, thus,
having negative effects on the Company’s Mines.
 
Behre Dolbear believes the future cost projections are
achievable and reasonable. Risk: Operating costs have
been under estimated.
 
Capital cost forecasts provided to BD Asia are typical for
this type of operation. Risk: Capital expenditures have
been under estimated.
 
Changes in coal sales prices could have a significant
impact on the economics of the mines. Risk: Coal prices
do not achieve levels projected by Fenwei Energy.
 
The Company has targeted anthracite sales for uses other
than thermal coal. These coal sales will realize higher coal
sales prices. A sensitivity analysis showed that selling the
coal as thermal coal demonstrated a positive cash flow in
the long-term but not in the short-term. Risk: Coal is sold
only as thermal coal.
 
Local Mine management and supervisory staff, observed
by BD Asia, appeared to be competent in ability and
experience. The Company appears to be progressive in
management and supervisory development. Risk: The
Company and management are not competent.

Behre Dolbear believes the following aspects of the project present the highest risks.
1)                                     Surface transportation in the Mine areas is not well developed but is being improved.
2)                                     Mining of the lower stacked seams, particularly with thin interburdens, may reduce the percentage of recovery in the longer term.
III-121
3)                                     Production ramp-up time required for the new, mechanized longwalls may be increased due to lack of experience in this type of mining in the work
force and supervisory staff.
4)                                     A reduction or changes in the proportion of PCI and chemical coal sales could have an effect on the economics; especially if a greater proportion of
the coal is sold as lower-priced thermal coal.

laws, the Company may give financial assistance to a trustee for the acquisition of shares in the Company or shares in any such subsidiary or holding company to be
held for the benefit of employees of the Company, its subsidiaries, any holding company of the Company or any subsidiary of any such holding company (including
salaried Directors).
(f)                                   Disclosure of interest in contracts with the Company or any of its subsidiaries
No Director or proposed Director shall be disqualified by his office from contracting with the Company either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise nor shall any such
contract or any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company with any person, company or partnership of or in which any Director shall be a
member or otherwise interested be capable on that account of being avoided, nor shall any Director so contracting or being any member or so interested be liable to
account to the Company for any profit so realised by any such contract or arrangement by reason only of such Director holding that office or the fiduciary relationship
thereby established, provided that such Director shall, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is material, declare the nature of his interest at the earliest meeting
of the board of Directors at which it is practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice stating that, by reason of the facts specified in the
notice, he is to be regarded as interested in any contracts of a specified description which may be made by the Company.
IV-2
A Director shall not be entitled to vote on (nor shall he be counted in the quorum in relation to) any resolution of the Directors in respect of any contract or arrangement
or any other proposal in which the Director or any of his associates has any material interest, and if he shall do so his vote shall not be counted (nor is he to be counted
in the quorum for the resolution), but this prohibition shall not apply to any of the following matters, namely:
(i)                                     the giving to such Director or any of his associates of any security or indemnity in respect of money lent or obligations incurred by him or any of
them at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
(ii)                                  the giving of any security or indemnity to a third party in respect of a debt or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the
Director or any of his associates has himself/themselves assumed responsibility in whole or in part and whether alone or jointly under a guarantee or indemnity or by the
giving of security;
(iii)                               any proposal concerning an offer of shares, debentures or other securities of or by the Company or any other company which the Company may
promote or be interested in for subscription or purchase where the Director or any of his associates is/are or is/are to be interested as a participant in the underwriting or
sub-underwriting of the offer;
(iv)                              any proposal or arrangement concerning the benefit of employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries including:
(A)                               the adoption, modification or operation of any employees’ share scheme or any share incentive scheme or share option scheme under which the
Director or any of his associates may benefit;
(B)                               the adoption, modification or operation of a pension or provident fund or retirement, death or disability benefits scheme which relates both to
Directors, their associates and employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and does not provide in respect of any Director or any of his associates as such
any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the class of persons to which such scheme or fund relates; and
(v)                                 any contract or arrangement in which the Director or any of his associates is/are interested in the same manner as other holders of shares or
debentures or other securities of the Company by virtue only of his/their interest in shares or debentures or other securities of the Company.
(g)                                  Remuneration
The Directors shall be entitled to receive by way of remuneration for their services such sum as shall from time to time be determined by the Directors, or the Company
in general meeting or by the Directors, as the case may be, such sum (unless otherwise directed by the resolution by which it is determined) to be divided amongst the
Directors in such proportions and in such manner as they may agree, or failing agreement, equally, except that in such event any Director holding office for less than
IV-3
the whole of the relevant period in respect of which the remuneration is paid shall only rank in such division in proportion to the time during such period for which he has
held office. Such remuneration shall be in addition to any other remuneration to which a Director who holds any salaried employment or office in the Company may be
entitled by reason of such employment or office.
The Directors shall also be entitled to be paid all expenses, including travel expenses, reasonably incurred by them in or in connection with the performance of their
duties as Directors including their expenses of travelling to and from board meetings, committee meetings or general meetings or otherwise incurred whilst engaged on
the business of the Company or in the discharge of their duties as Directors.
The Directors may grant special remuneration to any Director, who shall perform any special or extra services at the request of the Company. Such special remuneration
may be made payable to such Director in addition to or in substitution for his ordinary remuneration as a Director, and may be made payable by way of salary,
commission or participation in profits or otherwise as may be agreed.
The remuneration of an executive Director or a Director appointed to any other office in the management of the Company shall from time to time be fixed by the
Directors and may be by way of salary, commission, or participation in profits or otherwise or by all or any of those modes and with such other benefits (including share
option and/or pension and/or gratuity and/or other benefits on retirement) and allowances as the Directors may from time to time decide. Such remuneration shall be in
addition to such remuneration as the recipient may be entitled to receive as a Director.
(h)                                 Retirement, appointment and removal
The Directors shall have power from time to time and at any time to appoint any person to be a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing
Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following annual general meeting of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election at that
meeting.
The Company may by resolution of members remove any Director (including a Managing Director or other executive Director) before the expiration of his period of office
notwithstanding anything in the Articles of Association or in any agreement between the Company and such Director (but without prejudice to any claim for
compensation or damages payable to him in respect of the termination of his appointment as Director or of any other appointment or office as a result of the termination
of his appointment as Director). The Company may by resolution of members appoint another person in his place. Any Director so appointed shall hold office during
such time only as the Director in whose place he is appointed would have held the same if he had not been removed. The Company may also by resolution of members
elect any person to be a Director, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next
following annual general meeting of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election. No person shall, unless recommended by the Directors, be eligible for election
to the office of Director at any general meeting unless, during the period, which shall be at least seven days, commencing no earlier than the day after the despatch of
the notice of the meeting appointed for such election and ending no later than seven days prior to the date of such meeting, there has been given
IV-4
to the Secretary of the Company notice in writing by a member of the Company (not being the person to be proposed) entitled to attend and vote at the meeting for
which such notice is given of his intention to propose such person for election and also notice in writing signed by the person to be proposed of his willingness to be
elected.
There is no shareholding qualification for Directors nor is there any specified age limit for Directors.
The office of a Director shall be vacated:
(i)                                     if he resigns his office by notice in writing to the Company at its registered office or its principal office in Hong Kong;
(ii)                                  if an order is made by any competent court or official on the grounds that he is or may be suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise incapable of
managing his affairs and the Directors resolve that his office be vacated;
(iii)                               if, without leave, he is absent from meetings of the Directors (unless an alternate Director appointed by him attends) for 12 consecutive months, and
the Directors resolve that his office be vacated;
(iv)                              if he becomes bankrupt or has a receiving order made against him or suspends payment or compounds with his creditors generally;
(v)                                 if he ceases to be or is prohibited from being a Director by law or by virtue of any provision in the Articles of Association;
(vi)                              if he is removed from office by notice in writing served upon him signed by not less than three-fourths in number (or, if that is not a round number, the
nearest lower round number) of the Directors (including himself) for the time being then in office; or
(vii)                           if he shall be removed from office by a resolution of members of the Company under the Articles of Association.
At every annual general meeting of the Company one-third of the Directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number
nearest to, but not less than, one-third, shall retire from office by rotation provided that every Director (including those appointed for a specific term) shall be subject to
retirement by rotation at least once every three years. A retiring Director shall retain office until the close of the meeting at which he retires and shall be eligible for re-
election thereat. The Company at any annual general meeting at which any Directors retire may fill the vacated office by electing a like number of persons to be
Directors.
IV-5
(i)                                    Borrowing powers
The Directors may from time to time at their discretion exercise all the powers of the Company to raise or borrow or to secure the payment of any sum or sums of
money for the purposes of the Company and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled amounts owing on the shares
in the Company or any part thereof.
The rights of the Directors to exercise these powers may only be varied by a special resolution of members of the Company.
(j)                                    Proceedings of the Board
The Directors may meet together for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings and proceedings as they think fit in any part of the world. 
Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or
casting vote.
2.2                               Alteration to constitutional documents
No alteration or amendment to the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association may be made except by special resolution of members of the Company.
2.3                               Variation of rights of existing shares or classes of shares
If at any time the authorised shares of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the rights attached to any class of shares for the time being
issued (unless otherwise provided for in the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act be varied or abrogated either
with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution of
members of the Company passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. To every such separate meeting all the provisions of the Articles of
Association relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the quorum for the purposes of any such separate meeting and of any adjournment
thereof shall be a person or persons together holding (or representing by proxy or duly authorised representative) at the date of the relevant meeting not less than one-
third in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
The special rights conferred upon the holders of shares of any class shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of
such shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.
2.4                               Alteration to the number of shares the Company is authorised to issue
The members of the Company may from time to time by resolution of members increase the maximum number of shares that the Company is authorised to issue.
IV-6
The Company may from time to time by resolution of members:
(a)                                 consolidate and divide all or any of its shares into shares of larger amount than its existing shares. On any consolidation of fully paid shares and
division into shares of larger amount, the Directors may settle any difficulty which may arise as they think expedient and in particular (but without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing) may as between the holders of shares to be consolidated determine which particular shares are to be consolidated into each consolidated
share, and if it shall happen that any person shall become entitled to fractions of a consolidated share or shares, such fractions may be sold by some person appointed
by the Directors for that purpose and the person so appointed may transfer the shares so sold to the purchaser thereof and the validity of such transfer shall not be
questioned, and so that the net proceeds of such sale (after deduction of the expenses of such sale) may either be distributed among the persons who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction or fractions of a consolidated share or shares rateably in accordance with their rights and interests or may be paid to the Company for the
Company’s benefit;
(b)                                 cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution of members of the Company have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any
person, and diminish the maximum number of shares the Company is authorised to issue by the number of the shares so cancelled subject to the provisions of the
Companies Act; and
(c)                                  sub-divide its shares or any of them into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum of Association, subject nevertheless to the
provisions of the Companies Act, and so that the resolution of members whereby any share is sub-divided may determine that, as between the holders of the shares
resulting from such sub-division, one or more of the shares may have any such preferred or other special rights, over, or may have such deferred rights or be subject to
any such restrictions as compared with the others as the company has power to attach to unissued or new shares,
provided that where shares are consolidated or sub-divided, the aggregate par value of the new shares must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original shares.
2.5                               Special resolution — majority required
A “special resolution of members” is defined in the Articles of Association to mean a resolution passed by a majority of not less than three-fourths of the votes of such
members of the Company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorised representatives or, where proxies are
allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which not less than 21 days’ notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been duly
given and includes a special resolution approved in writing by all of the members of the Company entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company in one or more
instruments each signed by one or more of such members, and the effective date of the special resolution so adopted shall be the date on which the instrument or the
last of such instruments (if more than one) is executed.
IV-7
In contrast, a “resolution of members” is defined in the Articles of Association to mean a resolution passed by a simple majority of the votes of such members of the
Company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorised representatives or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a
general meeting held in accordance with the Articles of Association and includes a resolution approved in writing by all the members of the Company aforesaid.
2.6                               Voting rights
Subject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any class or classes of shares, at any general meeting where a show
of hands is allowed, every member present in person (or, in the case of a member being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative) shall have on vote, and on
a poll every member present in person (or, in the case of a member being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy shall have one vote for each
share registered in his name in the register of members of the Company.
Where any member of the Company is, under the Listing Rules, required to abstain from voting on any particular resolution or is restricted to voting only for or only
against any particular resolution, any votes cast by or on behalf of such member in contravention of such requirement or restriction shall not be counted.
In the case of joint registered holders of any share, any one of such persons may vote at any meeting, either personally or by proxy, in respect of such share as if he
were solely entitled thereto; but if more than one of such joint holders be present at any meeting personally or by proxy, that one of the said persons so present being
the most or, as the case may be, the more senior shall alone be entitled to vote in respect of the relevant joint holding and, for this purpose, seniority shall be
determined by reference to the order in which the names of the joint holders stand on the register in respect of the relevant joint holding.
A member of the Company in respect of whom an order has been made by any competent court or official on the grounds that he is or may be suffering from mental
disorder or is otherwise incapable of managing his affairs may vote by any person authorised in such circumstances to do so and such person may vote by proxy.
Save as expressly provided in the Articles of Association or as otherwise determined by the Directors, no person other than a member of the Company duly registered
and who shall have paid all sums for the time being due from him payable to the Company in respect of his shares shall be entitled to be present or to vote (save as
proxy for another member of the Company), or to be counted in a quorum, either personally or by proxy at any general meeting.
At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting is to be decided by way of a poll save that the Chairman may, in good faith, allow a resolution which
relates purely to a procedural or administrative matter as prescribed under the Listing Rules to be voted on by a show of hands.
IV-8
If a recognised clearing house (or its nominee) is a member of the Company it may authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its proxy(ies) or
representative(s) at any general meeting of the Company or at any general meeting of any class of members of the Company provided that, if more than one person is
so authorised, the authorisation shall specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such person is so authorised. A person authorised pursuant to
this provision shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and powers on behalf of the recognised clearing house (or its nominee) which he represents as that
recognised clearing house (or its nominee) could exercise as if such person were an individual member of the Company holding the number and class of shares
specified in such authorisation.
2.7                               Annual general meetings
The Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other general meeting in that year and shall specify the meeting
as such in the notice calling it; and not more than 15 months (or such longer period as the Stock Exchange may authorise) shall elapse between the date of one annual
general meeting of the Company and that of the next.
2.8                               Accounts and audit
The Directors shall cause to be kept such books of account as are necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs and to show and explain
its transactions and otherwise in accordance with the Companies Act.
The Directors shall from time to time determine whether, and to what extent, and at what times and places and under what conditions, the accounts and books of the
Company, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of members of the Company (other than a Director) and no such member (not being a Director) shall have any
right to inspect any accounts or books or documents of the Company except as conferred by the Companies Act or as authorised by a resolution of the Directors.
The Directors shall, commencing with the first annual general meeting, cause to be prepared and to be laid before the members of the Company at every annual general
meeting a profit and loss account for the period, in the case of the first account, since the incorporation of the Company and, in any other case, since the preceding
account, together with a balance sheet as at the date at which the profit and loss account is made up and a Director’s report with respect to the profit or loss of the
Company for the period covered by the profit and loss account and the state of the Company’s affairs as at the end of such period, an auditor’s report on such accounts
and such other reports and accounts as may be required by law. Copies of those documents to be laid before the members of the Company at an annual general
meeting shall not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting, be sent in the manner in which notices may be served by the Company as provided in the Articles of
Association to every member of the Company and every holder of debentures of the Company provided that the Company shall not be required to send copies of those
documents to any person of whose address the Company is not aware or to more than one of the joint holders of any shares or debentures.
IV-9
The Company shall at any annual general meeting appoint an auditor or auditors of the Company who shall hold office until the next annual general meeting. The
removal of an auditor before the expiration of his period of office shall require the approval of an ordinary resolution of the members in general meeting. The remuneration
of the auditors shall be fixed by the Company at the annual general meeting at which they are appointed provided that in respect of any particular year the Company in
general meeting may delegate the fixing of such remuneration to the Directors.
2.9                               Notice of meetings and business to be conducted thereat
An annual general meeting and any extraordinary general meeting called for the passing of a special resolution of members shall be called by notice of not less than 21
days and any other extraordinary general meeting shall be called by not less than 14 days. The notice shall be inclusive of the day on which it is served or deemed to be
served and of the day for which it is given, and shall specify the time, place and agenda of the meeting, particulars of the resolutions to be considered at the meeting
and, in the case of special business, the general nature of that business. The notice convening an annual general meeting shall specify the meeting as such, and the
notice convening a meeting to pass a special resolution of members shall specify the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution of members. Notice of
every general meeting shall be given to the auditors and all members of the Company (other than those who, under the provisions of the Articles of Association or the
terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive such notice from the Company).
Notwithstanding that a meeting of the Company is called by shorter notice than that mentioned above, it shall be deemed to have been duly called if it is so agreed:
(a)                                 in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all members of the Company entitled to attend and vote thereat or their proxies;
and
(b)                                 in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the members having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together
holding not less than 95 per cent. in nominal value of the shares giving that right.
All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting and also all business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an
annual general meeting with the exception of the following, which shall be deemed ordinary business:
(a)                                 the declaration and sanctioning of dividends;
(b)                                 the consideration and adoption of the accounts and balance sheets and the reports of the Directors and the auditors and other documents required to
be annexed to the balance sheet;
(c)                                  the election of Directors in place of those retiring;
(d)                                 the appointment of auditors;
IV-10
(e)                                  the fixing of, or the determining of the method of fixing of, the remuneration of the Directors and of the auditors;
(f)                                   the granting of any mandate or authority to the Directors to offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of the unissued shares of the
Company representing not more than 20 per cent. (or such other percentage as may from time to time be specified in the Listing Rules) in nominal value of its then
existing shares and the number of any securities repurchased pursuant to sub-paragraph (g) below; and
(g)                                  the granting of any mandate or authority to the Directors to repurchase securities of the Company.
2.10                        Transfer of Shares
Transfers of shares may be effected by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in such other form as the Directors may approve which is consistent with
the standard form of transfer as prescribed by the Stock Exchange.
The instrument of transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and, unless the Directors otherwise determine, the transferee, and the transferor shall be
deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members of the Company in respect thereof. All instruments of
transfer shall be retained by the Company.
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not fully paid up or on which the Company has a lien. The Directors may also decline to register
any transfer of any shares unless:
(a)                                 the instrument of transfer is lodged with the Company accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates (which shall upon the
registration of the transfer be cancelled) and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
(b)                                 the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares;
(c)                                  the instrument of transfer is properly stamped (in circumstances where stamping is required);
(d)                                 in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four;
(e)                                  the shares concerned are free of any lien in favour of the Company; and
(f)                                   a fee of such maximum as the Stock Exchange may from time to time determine to be payable (or such lesser sum as the Directors may from time
to time require) is paid to the Company in respect thereof.
IV-11
If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of any share they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company,
send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.
The registration of transfers may, on 14 days’ notice (or on 6 business days’ notice in the case of a rights issue) being given by advertisement published on the Stock
Exchange’s website or, subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the manner in which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means
as provided in the Articles of Association or by advertisement published in the newspapers, be suspended and the register of members of the Company closed at such
times for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine, provided always that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended or the register closed
for more than 30 days in any year (or such longer period as the members of the Company may by resolution of members determine provided that such period shall not
be extended beyond 60 days in any year). In the event that there is an alteration of book closure dates, the Company shall give at least 5 business days’ notice before
the announced closure, or the new closure, whichever is earlier. If, however, there are exceptional circumstances (e.g. during a Number 8 or higher typhoon signal and
black rainstorm warning) that render the giving of such publication of advertisement impossible, the Company shall comply with these requirements as soon as
practicable.
2.11                        Power of the Company to purchase its own Shares
The Company is empowered by the Companies Act and the Articles of Association to purchase its own shares subject to certain restrictions and the Directors may only
exercise this power on behalf of the Company subject to the authority of its members in general meeting as to the manner in which they do so and to any applicable
requirements imposed from time to time by the Stock Exchange and the SFC of Hong Kong.
The Directors shall not, unless permitted pursuant to the Companies Act, purchase any of the shares in the Company unless immediately after such purchase the value
of the Company’s assets exceeds its liabilities and the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due.
2.12                        Power of any subsidiary of the Company to own Shares
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association relating to the ownership of shares by a subsidiary.
2.13                        Dividends and other methods of distributions
Subject to the Companies Act and Articles of Association, the Directors may, by resolution of directors, declare a dividend in any currency if they are satisfied, on
reasonable grounds that, immediately after the payment of the dividend, the value of the Company’s assets exceeds its liabilities and the Company is able to pay its
debts as they fall due.
IV-12
Unless and to the extent that the rights attached to any shares or the terms of issue thereof otherwise provide, all dividends shall (as regards any shares not fully paid
throughout the period in respect of which the dividend is paid) be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or
portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. For these purposes no amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated as paid up on the
share.
The Directors may from time to time pay to the members of the Company such interim dividends as appear to the Directors to be justified by the profits of the Company.
The Directors may also pay half-yearly or at other intervals to be selected by them at a fixed rate if they are of the opinion that the profits available for distribution justify
the payment.
The Directors may retain any dividends or other moneys payable on or in respect of a share upon which the Company has a lien, and may apply the same in or towards
satisfaction of the debts, liabilities or engagements in respect of which the lien exists. The Directors may also deduct from any dividend or other monies payable to any
member of the Company all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls, instalments or otherwise.
No dividend shall carry interest against the Company.
Whenever the Directors or the Company in general meeting have resolved that a dividend be paid or declared on the shares in the Company, the Directors may further
resolve: (a) that such dividend be satisfied wholly or in part in the form of an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up on the basis that the shares so allotted are to
be of the same class as the class already held by the allottee, provided that the members of the Company entitled thereto will be entitled to elect to receive such
dividend (or part thereof) in cash in lieu of such allotment; or (b) that the members of the Company entitled to such dividend will be entitled to elect to receive an
allotment of shares credited as fully paid up in lieu of the whole or such part of the dividend as the Directors may think fit on the basis that the shares so allotted are to
be of the same class as the class already held by the allottee. The Company may upon the recommendation of the Directors by resolution of members resolve in
respect of any one particular dividend of the Company that notwithstanding the foregoing a dividend may be satisfied wholly in the form of an allotment of shares
credited as fully paid without offering any right to members of the Company to elect to receive such dividend in cash in lieu of such allotment.
Unless otherwise directed by the Directors, any dividend, interest or other sum payable in cash to a holder of shares may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the
post addressed to the registered address of the member of the Company entitled, or in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of the person whose name
stands first in the register of members of the Company in respect of the joint holding or to such person and to such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing
direct. Every cheque or warrant so sent shall be made payable to the order of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands
first on the register of members of the Company in respect of such shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and the payment of any such cheque or warrant by the
bank on which it is drawn shall operate as a good discharge to the Company in respect of the dividend and/or bonus represented thereby, notwithstanding that it may
subsequently appear that the same has been stolen or that any endorsement
IV-13
thereon has been forged. The Company may cease sending such cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants by post if such cheques or warrants have been
left uncashed on two consecutive occasions. However, the Company may exercise its power to cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants
after the first occasion on which such a cheque or warrant is returned undelivered. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividends or
other moneys payable or property distributable in respect of the shares held by such joint holders.
Any dividend unclaimed for six years from the date of declaration of such dividend may be forfeited by the Directors and shall revert to the Company.
The Directors may, with the sanction of the resolution of members of the Company, direct that any dividend be satisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific
assets of any kind, and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or warrants to subscribe securities of any other company, and where any difficulty arises in regard to
such distribution the Directors may settle it as they think expedient, and in particular may disregard fractional entitlements, round the same up or down or provide that
the same shall accrue to the benefit of the Company, and may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets and may determine that cash payments shall be
made to any members of the Company upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in
trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors.
2.14                        Proxies
Any member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company shall be entitled to appoint another person who must be an individual as his proxy
to attend and vote instead of him and a proxy so appointed shall have the same right as the member to speak at the meeting. A proxy need not be a member of the
Company.
Instruments of proxy shall be in common form or in such other form that complies with the Listing Rules as the Directors may from time to time approve provided that it
shall enable a member of the Company to instruct his proxy to vote in favour of or against (or in default of instructions or in the event of conflicting instructions, to
exercise his discretion in respect of) each resolution to be proposed at the meeting to which the form of proxy relates. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to
confer authority to vote on any amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy shall, unless the
contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates provided that the meeting was originally held within
12 months from such date.
The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or his attorney authorised in writing, or if the appointor is a corporation either under
its seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign the same.
The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Directors) the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy
of such power or authority, shall be delivered at the registered office of the Company (or at such other place as may be
IV-14
specified in the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in either case, in any document sent therewith) not less than 48 hours before the
time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case of a poll taken subsequently
to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in default the instrument of proxy shall not
be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 12 months from the date named in it as the date of its execution. Delivery of
any instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a member of the Company from attending and voting in person at the meeting or poll concerned and, in such event,
the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.
2.15                        Calls on Shares and forfeiture of Shares
The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the members of the Company in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal
amount of the shares or by way of premium or otherwise) and not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times and each member of the Company
shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time and place of payment and to whom such payment shall be made) pay to the
person at the time and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the Directors may determine. A person upon whom a
call is made shall remain liable on such call notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was made.
A call may be made payable either in one sum or by instalments and shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the
call was passed. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and instalments due in respect of such share or other moneys due in
respect thereof.
If a sum called in respect of a share shall not be paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the
sum from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate, not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum, as the Directors may determine, but
the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.
If any call or instalment of a call remains unpaid on any share after the day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors may at any time during such time as any part
thereof remains unpaid serve a notice on the holder of such shares requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid together with any interest which
may be accrued and which may still accrue up to the date of actual payment.
The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which, and the place where, the
payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time and at the place appointed, the shares in respect of
which such call was made or instalment is unpaid will be liable to be forfeited.
IV-15
If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before payment of all
calls or instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all
dividends and bonuses declared in respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. A forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the
Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of.
A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member of the Company in respect of the forfeited shares but shall, notwithstanding the forfeiture,
remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were payable by him to the Company in respect of the shares, together with (if the
Directors shall in their discretion so require) interest thereon at such rate not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum as the Directors may prescribe from the date of forfeiture
until payment, and the Directors may enforce payment thereof without being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the shares forfeited, at the date
of forfeiture.
2.16                        Inspection of register of members
The register of members of the Company shall be kept in such manner as to show at all times the members of the Company for the time being and the shares
respectively held by them. The register may, on 14 days’ notice being given by advertisement published on the Stock Exchange’s website, or subject to the Listing
Rules, by electronic communication in the manner in which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as provided in the Articles of Association or by
advertisement published in the newspapers be closed at such times and for such periods as the Directors may from time to time determine either generally or in respect
of any class of shares, provided that the register shall not be closed for more than 30 days in any year (or such longer period as the members of the Company may by
resolution of members determine provided that such period shall not be extended beyond 60 days in any year).
Any register of members held in Hong Kong shall during normal business hours (subject to such reasonable restrictions as the Directors may impose) be open to
inspection by any member of the Company without charge and by any other person on payment of such fee not exceeding HK$2.50 (or such higher amount as may from
time to time be permitted under the Listing Rules) as the Directors may determine for each inspection.
2.17                        Quorum for meetings and separate class meetings
No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business, but the absence of a quorum shall not
preclude the appointment, choice or election of a chairman which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting.
Two members of the Company present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum provided always that if the Company has only one member of record the quorum shall be
that one member present in person or by proxy.
IV-16
A corporation being a member of the Company shall be deemed for the purpose of the Articles of Association to be present in person if represented by its duly
authorised representative being the person appointed by resolution of the directors or other governing body of such corporation or by power of attorney, authorise such
person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at the relevant general meeting of the Company or at any relevant general meeting of any class of members of the
Company.
The quorum for a separate general meeting of the holders of a separate class of shares of the Company is described in sub-paragraph 2.3 above.
2.18                        Rights of minorities in relation to fraud or oppression
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association concerning the rights of minority shareholders in relation to fraud or oppression.
2.19                        Procedure on liquidation
If the Company shall be wound up, and the assets available for distribution amongst the members of the Company as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the
amounts paid up on the shares in the Company, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the members of the
Company in proportion to the nominal value of such shares, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them
respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the members of the Company shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the
amounts paid up on the issued shares in the Company at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the members of the Company
in proportion to the nominal value of such shares at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them respectively. The foregoing is without prejudice to
the rights of the holders of shares issued upon special terms and conditions.
If the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may, with the authority of a special resolution of members of the Company and any other sanction required by the
Companies Act, divide amongst the members of the Company in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of
property of the same kind or not) and may, for such purpose, set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how
such division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members of the Company. The liquidator may, with the like authority or sanction, vest

subject to the Companies Act, shall think fit, but so that no member of the Company shall be compelled to accept any assets, shares or other securities in respect of
which there is a liability.

B.                                    Summary of BVI company law and taxation
1                                         Introduction
The Companies Act is derived, to a large extent, from English corporate legislation, although there are significant differences between the Companies Act and English
corporate legislation. Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Companies Act, although this summary does not purport to be a complete review of all
matters of corporate law and taxation which may differ from equivalent provisions in jurisdictions with which interested parties may be more familiar.
2                                         Incorporation
The Company was incorporated in the BVI as BVI Business Company on January 6, 2010 under the Companies Act. The Company is required to pay an annual fee to
the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the BVI which is based on the number of shares the company is authorised to issue.
3                                         Shares
One of the major features of the Companies Act is that the concept of share capital has been abolished.
Instead, a company limited by, or otherwise authorised to issue shares, can now simply state in its memorandum of association the maximum number and classes of
shares that the company is authorised to issue. Companies may also divide their shares (including those shares already in issue) into a larger number of shares or
combine them into a smaller number of shares in the same class or series, provided that the maximum number of shares the company is permitted to issue is not
exceeded. On any such division or combination of shares the aggregate par value (if any) of the new shares must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original
shares.
IV-18
The directors of a company can, at their discretion, issue shares in registered or bearer form (although in order to issue bearer shares there must be an express
authorisation in the memorandum of association and such bearer shares must be held by an approved custodian) for such consideration and on such terms as they may
determine.
Shares can be issued for consideration in any form, provided such consideration is not less than par value where the share is a par value share.
If so authorised by its memorandum of association, a company can issue more than one class of shares and, if so, the memorandum of association must also specify
the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions which attach to each class.
The Companies Act provides that companies may issue redeemable shares, shares with no rights, limited rights or preferential rights to share in distributions, or shares
with no or special or limited or conditional voting rights. They may also, subject to their memorandum of association and articles of association, issue bonus shares,
partly or nil paid shares, and fractional shares.
The Companies Act provides that a company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own shares, either in accordance with the procedure set out in the
Companies Act, or any other procedure as provided for in the memorandum of association and articles of association of the company.
Under the provisions in the Companies Act, the directors may make an offer for the company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares in the company provided
that the offer is either (a) to all shareholders and would, if successful, leave the relative voting and distribution rights unaffected, or (b) to one or more shareholders and
consented to in writing by all shareholders, or is otherwise permitted by the memorandum of association or articles of association. Where the offer is to one or more
shareholders, the directors must pass a resolution to the effect that in their opinion the purchase, redemption or other acquisition would benefit the remaining
shareholders, and the proposed offer is fair and reasonable to the company and the remaining shareholders.
Where an acquisition by a company of its own shares would be treated as a distribution, the conditions imposed on distributions (detailed in paragraph 5 below) must be
met. The purchase, redemption or other acquisition by a company of its own shares is not deemed to be a distribution where it is effected pursuant to, inter alia, a right
of a shareholder to have his shares redeemed or exchanged for money or other property of the company or where the share is redeemable at the option of the company.
4                                         Financial Assistance
There is no statutory restriction in the BVI on the provision of financial assistance by a company for the purchase of, or subscription for, its own or its holding
company’s shares. Accordingly, a company may provide financial assistance if the directors of the company consider, in discharging their duties of due care, skill and
diligence that they are acting in good faith, for a proper purpose and in the interests of the company, that such assistance can be given.
IV-19
5                                         Dividends and distributions
The directors of a company may only declare a distribution by the company if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that the company will, immediately after the
distribution, satisfy the solvency test set out in section 57(1) of the Companies Act.A company satisfies the solvency test if the value of its assets exceeds its
liabilities and it is able to pay its debts as they fall due.
6                                         Shareholders’ Remedies
The Companies Act has introduced a series of remedies available to shareholders. Where a company engages in activity which breaches the Companies Act or the
company’s memorandum of association and articles of association, the court can issue a restraining or compliance order. Shareholders can also bring derivative,
personal and representative actions under certain circumstances. The traditional English basis for shareholders’ remedies has also been incorporated into the
Companies Act - where a shareholder of a company considers that the affairs of the company have been, are being or are likely to be conducted in a manner likely to be
oppressive, unfairly discriminating or unfairly prejudicial to him, he may apply to the court for an order on such conduct.
7                                         Mergers and Consolidations
Under the Companies Act two or more companies, each a “constituent company”, may merge or consolidate.
A merger involves merging two or more companies into one of the constituent companies that will remain as the surviving company and a consolidation involves two or
more companies consolidating into a new company. Subject to the memorandum of association and articles of the company a merger or consolidation must be
authorised by a resolution of shareholders of every class of shares entitled to vote on the merger.
There are differing procedures depending on the type of merger that is taking place. Under the Companies Act a merger may occur between any of the following:
(a)                                 Two or more companies incorporated under the Companies Act;
(b)                                 One or more companies incorporated under the Companies Act and one or more companies incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
BVI where the BVI company is the surviving entity;
(c)                                  One or more companies incorporated under the Companies Act and one or more companies incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
BVI where the foreign company is the surviving entity;
(d)                                 A parent company and one or more of its subsidiaries where the companies are incorporated under the Companies Act;
IV-20
(e)                                  A parent company and one or more of its subsidiaries where one or more of the companies are incorporated under the Companies Act, one or more
are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the BVI and where the BVI company is the surviving company; or
(f)                                   A parent company and one or more if its subsidiaries where one or more of the companies are incorporated under the Companies Act, one or more
are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the BVI and where the foreign company is the surviving entity.
Under the Companies Act, a shareholder of a company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting from:
(a)                                 A merger, if the company is a constituent company, unless the company is the surviving company and the shareholder continues to hold the same
or similar shares;
(b)                                 A consolidation, if the company is a constituent company.
The Companies Act sets out the procedure that must be followed in effecting dissenters’ rights. Ultimately, if the company and the dissenter fail to agree on the price to
be paid for the shares owned by the dissenter, then the statutory procedure provides that the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenter is fixed by three appraisers.
8                                         Redemption of minority shares
Under the Companies Act and subject to the memorandum of association or articles of association of a company, shareholders of a company holding 90 per cent of the
votes of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; and shareholders of a company holding 90 per cent of the votes of the outstanding shares of each class of shares
entitled to vote as a class, may give a written instruction to the company directing it to redeem the shares held by the remaining shareholders. Upon receiving this
direction, the company must redeem the shares it has been directed to redeem and must give written notice to each shareholder stating the redemption price and the
manner by which the redemption will be effected.
The shareholders having their shares compulsorily redeemed are entitled to receive fair value for their shares and may dissent from the compulsory redemption. The
Companies Act sets out the procedure that must be followed in effecting dissenters’ rights. Ultimately, if the company and the dissenter fail to agree on the price to be
paid for the shares owned by the dissenter, then the statutory procedure provides that the fair value of the shares owned by the dissenter is fixed by three appraisers.
9                                         Disposal of assets
Under the Companies Act and subject to the memorandum of association or articles of association of a company, any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other
disposition, other than a mortgage, charge or other encumbrance or the enforcement thereof, of more than 50 per cent in value of the assets of the company, if not
made in the usual or regular course of the business carried on by the company, requires the approval of the shareholders.
IV-21
The Companies Act sets out the procedure that must be followed in relation to effecting such a disposal.
10                                  Accounting and auditing requirements
The Companies Act requires that a company shall cause to be kept proper books of account that (a) are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions; and
(b) will, at any time, enable the financial position of the company to be determined with reasonable accuracy.
11                                  Register of shareholders
A BVI Business Company may, subject to the provisions of its articles of association, maintain its principal register of members and any branch registers at such
locations, whether within or outside of the BVI, as its directors may, from time to time, think fit. However either the register of members or a copy of the register of
members of the BVI Business Company has to be kept at the office of its registered agent in the BVI.
There is no mandatory requirement under the Companies Act for a company to make any filings of shareholder information to the Registrar of Corporate Affairs in the
BVI. The names and addresses of the shareholders are, accordingly, not a matter of public record and are not available for public inspection.
12                                  Inspection of books and records
Subject to the Companies Act, a shareholder of a company will have general right under the Companies Act to inspect or obtain copies of the register of members, the
register of directors and minutes of meetings and resolutions of members and of those classes of members of which he is a member. However, subject to the
company’s memorandum of association and articles of association, the directors may, if they are satisfied that it would be contrary to the company’s interests to allow a
shareholder to inspect any document (or part of a document) refuse to permit the shareholder to inspect the document or limit the inspection of the document, including
limiting the making of copies or the taking of extracts from the records.
13                                  Special resolutions
The Companies Act does not define “special resolution.” However a company’s memorandum of association and articles of association may make provisions for varying
threshold levels of votes required to pass a resolution and require that certain matters may only be approved if passed by a certain percentage of votes.
IV-22
14                    Subsidiary owning shares in parent
The Companies Act does not prohibit a BVI company acquiring and holding shares in its parent company. The directors of any subsidiary making such acquisition must
discharge their duties of care and to act honestly and in good faith and in what the director believes to be in the best interests of the company.
Under the Companies Act:
(a)                  a director of a company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary may, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, if expressly permitted to do so by
the memorandum of association and articles of association of the company, act in a manner which he believes is in the best interests of that company’s holding
company even though it may not be in the best interests of the company.
(b)                  a director of a company that is a subsidiary, but not a wholly-owned subsidiary, may, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, if expressly
permitted to do so by the memorandum of association or articles of association of the company and with the prior agreement of the shareholders, other than its holding
company, act in a manner which he believes is in the best interests of that company’s holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the company.
(c)                   a director of a company that is carrying out a joint venture between the shareholders may, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director in
connection with the carrying out of the joint venture, if expressly permitted to do so by the memorandum of association or articles of association of the company, act in
a manner which he believes is in the best interests of a shareholder or shareholders, even though it may not be in the best interests of the company.
15                    Indemnification
BVI law in general does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, subject to the
conditions set out in the Companies Act (e.g. the officer or director has acted honestly and in good faith and in what he believed to be in the best interests of the
company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, that officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful).
16                    Liquidation
A company is placed in liquidation either by an order of the court or by a resolution of directors or shareholders. A liquidator is appointed whose duties are to collect the
assets of the company (including the amount (if any) due from the contributories (shareholders)), settle the list of creditors and discharge the company’s liability to them,
rateably if insufficient assets exist to discharge the liabilities in full, and to settle the list of contributories and divide the surplus assets (if any) amongst them in
accordance with the rights attaching to the shares.
IV-23
17                    Stamp duty on transfers
No stamp duty is payable in the BVI on transfers of shares of BVI companies.
18                    Taxation
Companies incorporated or registered under the Companies Act are currently exempt from income and corporate tax. In addition, the BVI currently does not levy capital
gains tax on companies incorporated or registered under the Companies Act.
19                    Exchange control
There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the BVI.
20                    General
Maples and Calder, our Company’s legal advisers on BVI law, have sent to our Company a letter of advice summarising aspects of BVI company law. This letter,
together with a copy of the Companies Act, is available for inspection as referred to in Appendix VI — “Documents Available for Inspection.” Any person wishing to have
a detailed summary of BVI company law or advice on the differences between it and the laws of any jurisdiction with which he/she is more familiar is recommended to
seek independent legal advice.

accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations. In particular, no Option may be offered during the period commencing one month immediately preceding the

(including but not limited to imposition of any vesting and performance target(s) and/or minimum holding period) as the Board may think fit.
V-6

made pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Option Scheme) which shall be the higher of:
(a)                  the closing price of our Shares as stated in the Stock Exchange daily quotations sheet on the relevant offer date, which must be a business day;
(b)                  the average closing price of our Shares as stated in the Stock Exchange’s daily quotations sheets for the five trading days immediately preceding the

the number of Shares to be subscribed. Each such notice must be accompanied by a remittance for the full amount of the aggregate subscription price for our Shares in
respect of which the notice is given. Within 21 days after receipt of the notice and the remittance and, where appropriate, receipt of the auditors’ certificate pursuant to
Share Option Scheme, our Company shall allot and issue the relevant Shares to the grantee (or his or her legal personal representative(s)) credited as fully paid and
issue to the grantee (or his or her legal personal representative(s)) a share certificate in respect of our Shares so allotted.

the option period provided that:
(a)                  in the event of the grantee ceasing to be an employee, Director or consultant of our Company or any subsidiary for any reason other than his or her death or
disability or the termination of his or her employment on one or more of the grounds specified in the Share Option Scheme, the grantee may exercise the Option that has
vested at the date of cessation of his or her employment (to the extent not already exercised) within the period of one month following the date of such cessation, which
date shall be the last actual working day of his employment with our Company or the relevant subsidiary whether payment in lieu of notice is made or not (if applicable);
(b)                  in the event that the grantee ceases to be an employee, Director or consultant of our Company or any subsidiary by reason of death and none of the events

shall be treated as if his her employment with the Company or the relevant subsidiary continued for the lesser of: (i) three years after the date of disability; and (b) the
remaining term of the Option, and during such time the Option shall continue to vest and remain exercisable;
(d)                  if a general offer (whether by way of take-over offer, share repurchase offer or otherwise in like manner but other than by way of scheme of arrangement) is
made to all the holders of Shares (or all such holders other than the offeror and/or any person controlled by the offeror and/or any person acting in association or in
concert with the offeror) and such offer becomes, or is declared, unconditional, the grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option in full (to the extent not already
exercised) to its full extent by giving notice to the Company at any time after the general offer becomes or is declared unconditional and up to the close of such offer;
(e)                   in the event a general offer for Shares by way of scheme of arrangement is made by any person to all the Shareholders and has been approved by the
necessary number of Shareholders at the requisite meetings, the Grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option (to the extent not already exercised) to its full extent
by giving notice to the Company at any time after the meetings whereby the scheme is approved and up to the record date for determining entitlements under such
scheme of arrangement;
(f)                    in the event a notice is given by the Company to the Shareholders to convene a Shareholders´ meeting for the purpose of approving a resolution to
voluntarily wind-up the Company, the Company shall give notice thereof to all the grantees on the same day as it dispatches to the Shareholders the notice convening
the meeting and, each grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option (to the extent not already exercised) to its full extent by giving notice to the Company, such notice
to be given not later than three business days prior to the date of the proposed meeting. The Company shall as soon as possible and in any event no later than two
business days immediately prior to the date of the proposed meeting, allot and issue such number of Shares to the grantee which falls to be issued on such exercise of
the Option, credited as fully paid. With effect from the date two business days prior to the date of such meeting, the rights of all grantees to exercise their respective
Options shall forthwith be suspended. If, for any reason, the resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the Company is not approved by the Shareholders, the rights of
the grantees to exercise their respective Options shall be restored in full, to the extent that they had not been exercised at the date such rights were suspended, as if
such resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the Company had not been proposed by the Company; and
V-8
(g)                   if, pursuant to the Companies Act, a compromise or arrangement (other than a scheme of arrangement) between our Company and our Shareholders and/or
creditors is proposed for the purposes of or in connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of our Company or our amalgamation with any other company or
companies, our Company shall give notice thereof to all grantees on the same date as we dispatch to each Shareholder and/or creditor of our Company a notice
summoning the meeting to consider such a compromise or arrangement, and thereupon each grantee shall each grantee shall be entitled to exercise the Option (to the
extent not already exercised) to its full extent by giving notice to the Company, such notice to be given not later than three business days prior to the date of the
proposed meeting. The Company shall as soon as possible and in any event no later than two business days immediately prior to the date of the proposed meeting, allot
and issue such number of Shares to the grantee which falls to be issued on such exercise of the Option, credited as fully paid. With effect from the date that is two
business days before the date of such meeting, the rights of all grantees to exercise their respective Options shall forthwith be suspended. The Board shall endeavor to
procure that the Shares issued upon the exercise of the Options in such circumstances shall for the purposes of such compromise or arrangement form part of the
issued share capital of the Company on the effective date thereof and that such Shares shall in all respects be subject to such compromise or arrangement. If, for any
reason, such compromise or arrangement is not approved by the relevant court (whether upon the terms presented to the relevant court or upon any other terms as may
be approved by such court), the rights of the grantees to exercise their respective Options shall, with effect from the date of the making of the order by the relevant
court and to the extent they had not been exercised at the date such rights were suspended, be restored in full as if such compromise or arrangement had not been
proposed by the Company.
Ranking of Shares
Voting, dividend, transfer and other rights, including but not limited to rights arising on liquidation of the Company, shall not attach to the Options themselves. However,
the Shares to be allotted upon the exercise of an Option will be subject to all the provisions of the Articles of Association for the time being in force and will rank pari
passu with the fully paid Shares in issue on the date of exercise, and accordingly will entitle the holders to participate in all dividends and other distributions paid or
made on or after the date of exercise other than any dividend or other distribution previously declared or recommended or resolved to be paid or made if the record date
therefor is before the date of exercise.

capital of the Company and any adjustments to the advantage of the Share Option Scheme participant to the exercise price or to the number of Shares subject to the
Options must be approved by the Shareholders in general meeting, and no adjustment may be made to the extent that Shares would be issued at less than their nominal
value. The capacity of the auditors or the independent financial adviser is that of experts and not of arbitrators and their certification shall be final and binding on our
Company and the grantees in the absence of manifest error. The costs of the auditors or the independent financial adviser shall be borne by the Company.

continue to be valid and exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Share Option Scheme.

accrued to any grantee and provided that the specific provisions in the Share Option Scheme which relate to the matters set out in Rule 17.03 of the Listing Rules shall
not be altered to the advantage of grantees or prospective grantees except with the prior sanction of a resolution of our Shareholders in a general meeting. Any
alterations to the terms and conditions of the Share Option Scheme which are of a material nature or any change to the terms of the Options granted shall be subject to
the approval of our Shareholders, save where the alterations take effect automatically under the existing terms of the Share Option Scheme. After any alteration, the
