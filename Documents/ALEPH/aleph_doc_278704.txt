TREVALI MINING CORPORATION
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR
FOR THE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON JUNE 17, 2015
This information is given as of May 5, 2015 unless otherwise noted
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
This management information circular (the “Circular”) is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by 
the management of Trevali Mining Corporation (the “Company”) for use at the annual and special meeting (the 
“Meeting”) of holders (collectively, the “Shareholders” or individually, a “Shareholder”) of common shares in the 
capital of the Company (“Common Shares”) to be held at the time and place and for the purposes set forth in the 
attached  Notice  of  Annual  and  Special  Meeting  of  Shareholders  (the  “Notice”).    The  solicitation  of  proxies  will 
primarily  be  made  by  sending  proxy  materials  to  Shareholders  by  mail,  and,  in  relation  to  the  delivery  of  this 
Circular, by posting this Circular on our website at www.trevali.com and our SEDAR (as defined below) profile at 
www.sedar.com pursuant to Notice and Access (N&A Notice, as defined below).  See “Notice and Access” on page 
3 of this Circular for further information.  The solicitation of proxies may be supplemented by telephone or other 
personal contact to be made without special compensation by directors, officers and employees of the Company or 
by the Company’s transfer agent and registrar.  The Company may retain other persons or companies to solicit 
proxies on behalf of management in which event customary fees for such services will be paid.  All costs of 
solicitation will be borne by the Company. 
 
The  Company  has  sent  the  N&A  Notice  (as  defined  below)  and  a  form  of  proxy  or  voting  instruction  form,  as 
applicable  (the  “Notice  Package”)  to  all  Shareholders  informing  them  that  this  Circular  is  available  online  and 
explaining how this Circular may be accessed. The Company will not directly send the Notice Package to Beneficial 
Shareholders. Instead, the Company will pay clearing agencies, securities dealers, banks and trust companies or their 
nominees (collectively, the “Intermediaries”) for distribution to Beneficial Shareholders (as defined below) whose 
Common Shares are held by or in custody of such Intermediaries.  Such Intermediaries are required to forward the 
Notice Package to Beneficial Shareholders unless a Beneficial Shareholder has waived the right to receive them.  
The Company has elected to pay for the delivery of the Notice Package to objecting Beneficial Shareholders by the 
Intermediaries.    The  Company  is  sending  the  Notice  Package  directly  to  non-objecting  Beneficial  Shareholders, 
through  the  services  of  its  transfer  agent  and  registrar,  Computershare Investor Services  Inc.   The solicitation of 
proxies from Beneficial Shareholders will be carried out by the Intermediaries or by the Company if the names and 
addresses of the Beneficial Shareholders are provided by Intermediaries.  The Company will pay the permitted fees 
and costs of Intermediaries incurred in connection with the distribution of the Notice Package.
APPOINTMENT AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES
The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy are directors and/or officers of the Company. A Shareholder has 
the right to appoint a person (who need not be a Shareholder) to attend and act for such Shareholder and on 
his, her or its behalf at the Meeting other than the persons designated in the enclosed form of proxy.  Such 
right may be exercised by inserting in the blank space provided for that purpose the name of the desired person or by 
completing another proper form of proxy and, in either case, delivering the completed and executed proxy to the 
Company’s transfer agent and registrar, Computershare Investor Services Inc., 100 University Avenue, 8th Floor, 
Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada,  M5J  2Y1,  Attention:  Stock  Transfer  Department,  not  later  than  forty-eight  (48)  hours 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before the time fixed for the Meeting or any adjournment thereof, or 
delivering it to the chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof prior to the time 
of voting.  A proxy must be executed by the registered Shareholder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in 
writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized.
2
Proxies given by Shareholders for use at the Meeting may be revoked prior to their use:
(a)
by  depositing  an  instrument  in  writing  executed  by  the  Shareholder  or  by  such  Shareholder’s 
attorney duly authorized in writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, by an officer or attorney 
thereof duly authorized indicating the capacity under which such officer or attorney is signing:
(i)
at the registered office, Suite 2300 - 1177 West Hastings Street Vancouver, BC, V6E 2K3, 
at any time up to 9:00 a.m. on Monday, June 15, 2015; or
(ii)  with the chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof; or
(b)
in any other manner permitted by law.
EXERCISE OF DISCRETION BY PROXIES
The persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote the Common Shares in respect of which they are 
appointed in accordance with the direction of the Shareholders appointing them.  In the absence of such direction, 
such Common Shares will be voted in favour of the passing of the matters set out in the Notice.  The form of 
proxy  confers  discretionary  authority  upon  the  persons  named  therein  with  respect  to  amendments  or 
variations  to matters  identified  in the  Notice and  with  respect to other  matters which  may properly  come 
before the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.  At the time of the printing of this Circular, the management of 
the Company knows of no such amendments, variations or other matters to come before the Meeting other than the 
matters  referred  to  in  the  Notice.    However,  if  any  other  matters  which  at  present  are  not  known  to  the 
management  of  the  Company  should  properly  come  before  the  Meeting,  the  proxy  will  be  voted  on  such 
matters in accordance with the best judgment of the named proxies.
ADVICE TO BENEFICIAL SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholders should note that only proxies deposited by Shareholders whose names appear on the records of 
the Company as the registered holders of Common Shares, or non-objecting beneficial owners whose names 
has been provided to the Company’s registrar and transfer agent, can be recognized and acted upon at the 
Meeting. The information set forth in this section is therefore of significant importance to a substantial number of 
Shareholders who do not hold their Common Shares in their own name (referred to in this section as “Beneficial 
Shareholders”). If Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to a Shareholder by an Intermediary, 
then in almost all cases those Common Shares will not be registered in such Shareholder’s name on the records of 
the  Company.    Such  Common  Shares  will  more  likely  be  registered  under  the  name  of  the  Shareholder’s 
Intermediary or an agent of that Intermediary.  In Canada, the vast majority of such Common Shares are registered 
under  the  name  of  CDS  &  Co.,  as  nominee  for  CDS  Clearing  and  Depository  Services  Inc.,  which  acts  as  a 
depository for many Canadian Intermediaries.  Common Shares held by Intermediaries or their nominees can only 
be voted for or against resolutions upon the instructions of the Beneficial Shareholder. Without specific instructions, 
Intermediaries are prohibited from voting Common Shares for their clients.
Applicable  regulatory  policy  requires  Intermediaries  to  seek  voting  instructions  from  Beneficial  Shareholders  in 
advance of shareholders’ meetings.  Every Intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return 
instructions, which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their Common 
Shares are voted at the Meeting.  Often the form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Shareholder by its Intermediary is 
identical to the form of proxy provided by the Company to the Intermediaries.  However, its purpose is limited to 
instructing the Intermediary how to vote on behalf of the Beneficial Shareholder.  The majority of Intermediaries 
now  delegate  responsibility  for  obtaining  instructions  from  clients  to  Broadridge  Financial  Solutions,  Inc. 
(“Broadridge”).    Broadridge  typically  mails  the  voting  instruction  forms  or  proxy  forms  to  the  Beneficial 
Shareholders  and  asks  the  Beneficial  Shareholders  to  return  the  voting  instruction  forms  or  proxy  forms  to 
Broadridge.  Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides appropriate instructions 
respecting the voting of Common Shares to be represented at the Meeting.  A Beneficial Shareholder receiving a 
proxy  or  voting  instruction  form  from  Broadridge  cannot  use  that  proxy  to  vote  Common  Shares  directly  at  the 
Meeting - the proxy must be returned to Broadridge well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the Common 
Shares voted.
3
Although  Beneficial  Shareholders  may  not  be  recognized  directly  at  the  Meeting  for  the  purposes  of  voting 
Common Shares registered in the name of their Intermediary, a Beneficial Shareholder may attend the Meeting as 
proxyholder for the Intermediary and vote their Common Shares in that capacity.  Beneficial Shareholders who wish 
to  attend  the Meeting  and  indirectly  vote their  own  Common  Shares as  proxyholder  for  the Intermediary  should 
enter their own names in the blank space on the management form of proxy or voting instruction form provided to 
them  and  return  the  same  to  their  Intermediary  (or  the  agent  of  such  Intermediary)  in  accordance  with  the 
instructions  provided  by  such  Intermediary  or  agent  well  in  advance  of  the  Meeting.  Beneficial  Shareholders 
should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediaries and their service companies.
All references to shareholders in this Circular and the accompanying form of proxy and Notice are to Shareholders 
of record unless specifically stated otherwise.
NOTICE AND ACCESS
The Company is utilizing the notice-and-access mechanism (“Notice and Access”) under National Instrument 54-
101  –  Communication  with  Beneficial  Owners  of  Securities  of  a  Reporting  Issuer  (“NI  54-101”)  in  the  case  of 
Beneficial Shareholders, and National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations (“NI 51-102”) in the 
case of registered Shareholders.
Notice  and  Access  allows  the  Company  to  deliver  this  Circular  to  Shareholders  via  specified  electronic  means 
provided that the conditions of NI 54-101 and NI 51-102 are met.
In  accordance with NI 54-101,  the  Company  set  the  Record  Date  (as defined below)  at  least  40 days  before  the 
Meeting and also filed a form of notification of the Record Date and the date of the Meeting at least 25 days before 
the Record Date.
Website Where Meeting Materials are Posted
The Notice and Access provisions are a new set of rules that allow reporting issuers to choose to delivery proxy-
related  materials  to  registered  Shareholders  and  Beneficial  Shareholders  by  posting  electronic  versions of proxy-
related materials on-line, via the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) and one other 
website, rather than mailing paper copies of such materials to Shareholders.  The Company will not rely upon the 
use of “stratification”.
In order for a reporting issuer such as the Company to avail itself of the Notice and Access process, the Company 
must send a notice to Shareholders (the “N&A Notice”), including Beneficial Shareholders, indicating the websites 
where this Circular has been posted and explaining how a Shareholder can access the Circular online or obtain a 
paper copy from the Company as well as other basic information about the Meeting including, among other things, 
the matters to be voted on at the Meeting.
Electronic copies of the Circular, the Notice, the annual audited consolidated financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“Financial Statements”) and management’s discussion and analysis of the 
Company’s results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“MD&A”) may be 
found on the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com and the Company’s website at www.trevali.com.  In 
relation  to  the  Meeting,  Shareholders  with  existing  instructions  on  their  account  to  receive  printed  materials  and 
those Shareholders with addresses outside of Canada and the United States will receive a printed copy of the Notice 
Package. All other Shareholders will receive only the required notification documentation under Notice and Access, 
which will not include a paper copy of the Circular.
Obtaining Paper Copies of Materials
The Company anticipates that using Notice and Access for delivery will directly benefit the Company through a 
substantial  reduction  in  both  postage  and  material  costs,  and  also  promote  environmental  responsibility  by 
decreasing the large volume of paper documents generated by printing proxy-related materials. Shareholders with 
questions  about  Notice  and  Access  can  call  the  Company  toll-free  in  North  America  at  1-888-770-7488. 
Shareholders  may  also  obtain  paper  copies  of  the  Circular,  Financial  Statements  and  MD&A  free  of  charge  by
4
contacting the Company at the same toll-free number.  Requests should be received at least five (5) business days in 
advance of the proxy cut-off date set out in the accompanying proxy or voting instruction form in order to receive 
the meeting materials in advance of the date of the Meeting.
NOTE TO NON-OBJECTING BENEFICIAL OWNERS
The  Notice  Package  is  being  sent  to  both  registered  and  Beneficial  Shareholders.  If  you  are  a  Beneficial 
Shareholder, and the Company or its agent has sent the Notice Package directly to you, your name and address and 
information about your holdings of Common Shares, have been obtained in accordance with applicable securities 
regulatory requirements from the Intermediary holding on your behalf. By choosing to send the Notice Package to 
you  directly,  the  Company  (and  not  the  Intermediary  holding  on  your  behalf)  has  assumed  responsibility  for  (i) 
delivering the Notice Package to you, and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting 
instructions as specified in the request for voting instructions.
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF
The Company has fixed the close of business on Tuesday, May 5, 2015 as the record date (the “Record Date”) for 
the purposes of determining Shareholders entitled to receive the Notice and vote at the Meeting.  As at the Record 
Date,  287,003,169  common  shares  in  the  capital  of  the  Company  (the  “Common  Shares”)  were  issued  and 
outstanding.  At a general meeting of the Company, on a show of hands, every Shareholder present in person shall 
have one vote and, on a poll, every Shareholder shall have one vote for each Common Share of which he, she or it is 
the holder.  The Company has no other classes of voting securities.
In accordance with the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), the Company will prepare a 
list of the holders of Common Shares on the Record Date.  Each holder of Common Shares named on the list will be 
entitled to vote the Common Shares shown opposite his, her or its name on the list at the Meeting.
To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company, there are no persons or companies who 
beneficially own, or control or direct, directly or indirectly, voting securities of the Company carrying 10% or more 
of the voting rights attached to the Common Shares.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In  this  section  “Named  Executive  Officer”  or  “NEO”  means  (a)  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  (b)  the  Chief 
Financial Officer, (c) each of the Company’s three other most highly compensated executive officers, or the three 
most  highly  compensated  individuals  acting  in  a  similar  capacity,  whose  total  compensation  was  more  than 
$150,000, or (d) any additional individual whose total compensation was more than $150,000 during the year ended 
December 31, 2014.  As at December 31, 2014, the Company had five NEOs, namely Mark Cruise, the President 
and  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”),  Anna  Ladd,  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  (“CFO”),  Paul  Keller,  the  Chief 
Operating Officer (“COO”), Steve Stakiw, the Vice President IR/Corporate Communications (“VP  IR/CC”) and 
Alan Hughes, Vice President Human Resources (“VP HR”).
All dollar amounts referenced herein are Canadian Dollars unless otherwise specified. 
 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
In  considering  executive  compensation  issues,  the  Compensation  Committee’s  goal  is  to  ensure  that  the 
compensation provided  to  executive  officers  is  determined with  regard to  the  Company’s  business strategies  and 
objectives.  In this manner, the financial interest of the executive officers is aligned with the financial interest of the 
Shareholders.
5
The  Compensation  Committee  strives  to  ensure  that  the  Company’s  executive  officers  are  paid  fairly  and 
commensurately  with  their  contributions  to  furthering  the  Company’s  strategic  directions  and  objectives.    The 
Company seeks to attract and retain top quality executives by providing total compensation that is appropriate and 
competitive with that paid by other mining companies based and operating in Canada with reference to companies 
with international operations of similar size and scope.  The Compensation Committee reviews and determines all 
elements of the executive officers’ compensation on an annual basis.
Each  executive  officer’s  position  is  evaluated  to  establish  skill  requirements  and  level  of  responsibility  and  this 
evaluation provides a basis for internal and external comparisons of positions. In addition to industry comparables, 
the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) and the Compensation Committee consider a variety of factors 
when determining both compensation policies, programs and individual compensation levels.  These factors include 
the  long  term  interests  of  the  Company  and  its  shareholders,  overall  financial  and  operating  performance  of  the 
Company  and  the  Board’s  and  the  Compensation  Committee’s  assessment  of  each  executive’s  individual 
performance and contribution towards meeting annual and longer term corporate objectives.
The general objectives of the Company’s compensation strategy are to:
(a)
(b) 
(c) 
(d)
compensate management in a manner that encourages and rewards a high level of performance 
and outstanding results with a view to increasing long-term shareholder value;  
align management’s interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; 
attract and retain highly qualified executive officers; and 
be  competitive  with  the  compensation  arrangements  of  Canadian  mining  companies  with 
international operations of generally a similar size and scope.
Compensation Committee Governance
In order to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to compensation matters, the Board 
has  established  the  Compensation  Committee  and  has  reviewed  and  approved  the  Compensation  Committee’s 
Charter.  The Compensation Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Michael Hoffman, David Huberman and 
Anton Drescher, all of whom are independent.
The Compensation Committee  meets on compensation matters at least two times a  year and when required. The 
primary  goal  of  the  Compensation  Committee  as  it  relates  to  compensation  matters  is  to  ensure  that  the 
compensation provided to the NEOs and the Company’s other executive officers is determined with regard to the 
Company’s business  strategies  and objectives,  such  that the  financial  interest of  the executive officers  is  aligned 
with the financial interest of shareholders, and to ensure that their compensation is fair, reasonable and sufficient to 
attract  and  retain  qualified  and  experienced  executives.  The  Compensation  Committee  is  given  the  authority  to 
engage and compensate any outside advisor that it determines to be necessary to carry out its duties.
The Compensation Committee is involved in setting and reviewing executive compensation in the following ways:



it  annually  reviews  executive  compensation  practices  among  the  Company’s  comparator  group  to 
benchmark  the  Company’s  executive  compensation  practices  at  the  median  (50th  percentile)  of  the 
Company’s comparators, including base salaries, and applicable targets for short-term and long-term 
incentive awards to executives along with a review of long-term incentive awards;
it annually reviews the Company’s compensation framework to ensure that it is designed to meet the 
Company’s compensation philosophy and objectives but does not encourage excessive risk taking by 
executives and other employees, including reviewing the relative weighting of fixed and variable “at 
risk” compensation;
it  annually  reviews  and  approves  (or  recommends  to  the  Board  for  approval,  where  required)  the 
Company’s  targets  for  its  annual  incentive  plan,  taking  into  consideration  the  Company’s  corporate
6
objectives and potential risks that the Corporation may face or that are inherent in the industry. The 
Committee determines the achievement of incentive plan targets;
it annually reviews and approves compensation for the executives that report directly to the CEO, and 
makes recommendations to the Board regarding compensation for the CEO;
it retains discretion to create, modify, reduce or cancel incentive awards;
it  sets  and  reviews  share  ownership  guidelines  and  whether  directors  and  executives  have  met  the 
required standard;
it reviews NEO and executive termination agreements and NEO termination obligations in relation to 
market practices and trends; and





it annually reviews benefits, retirement plans and any perquisites provided to executives
The  Compensation  Committee  is  involved  in  setting  and  reviewing  non-executive  director  compensation  in  the 
following ways:

it  reviews  and  recommends  to  the  Board  for  approval,  the  annual  director  retainer;  the  additional 
committee chair retainer; the additional Chairman of the Board retainer; the meeting fees; the value of 
any equity retainer and how such equity retainer will be provided.
As  a  whole,  the  members  of  the  Compensation  Committee  have  direct  experience  and  skills  relevant  to  their 
responsibilities  in  executive  compensation,  including  with  respect  to  enabling  the  Compensation  Committee  in 
making informed decisions on the suitability of the Company’s compensation policies and practices. Each of the 
members of the Compensation Committee have experience on the board of directors and related committees of other 
public  companies,  as  described  under  “Particulars  of  Matters  to  be  Acted  Upon  -  Election  of  Directors”  in  this 
Circular. All of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent.
Compensation Risk
The  Board  and,  as  applicable,  the  Compensation  Committee,  considers  and  assesses  the  implications  of  risks 
associated  with  the  Company’s  compensation  policies  and  practices  and  devotes  such  time  and  resources  as  is 
believed  to  be  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  The  Company’s  practice  of  compensating  its  officers  primarily 
through a mix of salary, stock options, bonus shares, restricted share units (“RSUs”), deferred share units (“DSUs”) 
and performance share units (“PSUs”) is designed to mitigate risk by: (i) ensuring that the Company retains such 
officers; and (ii) aligning the interests of its officers with the short-term and long-term objectives of the Company 
and its shareholders.
The Board, together with the Compensation Committee, uses a number of strategies to reduce the risk associated 
with compensation, including:

reviewing  and  approving  annual  corporate  objectives  and  then  assessing  performance  against  these 
objectives when awarding the individual performance component of the annual bonus;


considering  the  Company’s performance  relative  to  its  peers  when  reviewing  the  corporate  performance 
component of the executive officers’ annual bonus; and
setting  standard  vesting  terms  on  stock  option  grants  which  align  optionees’  interests  with  longer  term 
growth of  the Company  using  36-month  vesting provisions  on  any  stock  options granted  with five  year 
option terms.
As at the date of this Circular, the Board had not identified risks arising from the Company’s compensation policies 
and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
7
Financial Instruments
A  review  of  comparator  proxy  data  indicated  that  close  to  half  of  the  Company’s  comparator  companies  have 
resolutions that prohibit NEOs and directors from purchasing financial instruments designed to hedge or offset a 
decrease in long term incentive plan compensation granted.  To the Company’s knowledge, no executive officer or 
director of the Company has entered into or purchased a financial instrument.
In order to further mitigate the potential for NEOs and directors from taking inappropriate or excessive risks relating 
to compensation, the Board passed a resolution in early 2014 which prohibits NEOs and directors from purchasing 
financial instruments, such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or units of exchange funds, 
that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, 
directly or indirectly, by a NEO or director.
Executive and Director Compensation-Related Fees
The  Compensation  Committee  may  from  time  to  time  engage  independent  consultants  to  conduct  a  comparator 
group review and analysis of executive and director compensation.   
 
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2014,  the  Company  paid  a  fee  of  $4,767  to  Mercer  (Canada)  Limited  to 
purchase the 2014 Canada Mining Industry Corporate Compensation Report and the 2014 Canada Mining Industry 
Mine Site Compensation Report. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company performed an internal review and analysis of executive and 
director compensation, as discussed in benchmarking below. 
 
Benchmarking 
 
In the mining industry, ensuring competitive compensation is a critical business practice.  The Company seeks to 
provide competitive total compensation packages to its executives and directors to ensure that it attracts and retains 
talented individuals while being aligned with market practices, yet manage its compensation within Trevali’s ability 
to pay. 
 
The current comparator group was first developed in late 2012 when Trevali was a non-producing company.  The 
comparator group reflected a blend of resource companies, some smaller single mine producers and a few mid-tier 
producers.    The  companies  chosen  were  Canadian-based,  publically  traded  mining  companies  with  market 
capitalization ranging from  $100  million  to  $1  billion.   Trevali’s  market  cap  was  around  the first quartile  of  the 
resulting group.  The comparator group at that time included the following 14 companies:
Amerigo Resources Ltd. 
Scorpio Mining Corp. 
Duluth Metals Limited 
Golden Star Resources Ltd. 
Thompson Creek Metals Company
Claude Resources Inc. 
North American Palladium Ltd. 
Lake Shore Gold Corp. 
Capstone Mining Corp. 
Imperial Metals Corp.
Carpathian Gold Inc. 
Nevada Copper Corp. 
Denison Mines Corp. 
Taseko Mines Limited
Since  2012,  a  number  of  factors  have  changed,  leading  to  modifications  to  the  comparator  group  for  2015  and 
beyond.  These factors include:
  Trevali,  as  a  company,  has  made  significant  progress  in  its  lifecycle.    The  Company  has  one  fully
operational mine in Peru (Santander) with a second mine coming into production later in 2015 (Caribou);
  Trevali’s market capitalization has grown from around $180 million in 2012 to around $300 million as at 
December 31, 2014 while most companies in the previous comparator group has decreased significantly 
and several companies were acquired and thus needing to be replaced;
  A shift to use comparator companies similar to Trevali, those being Canadian-based producing companies,
with one or more mines in production;
  The  need  to  consider  companies  that  Trevali  is  compared  to  by  the  nine  investment  firms  and  equity
analysts that provide research reports on Trevali; and
8
  The eventual elimination of resource based comparator companies, but with replacement companies still
falling within a 0.25x’s to 4x’s market cap.
In late 2014, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board and the Board subsequently approved the 
following changes to the comparator group, increasing the comparator group to 15 companies.

As  a  secondary  data  source to  determine  the  competitiveness  and reasonableness of  executive  compensation,  the 
Company  continues  to  utilize  the  Mining  Industry  Salary  Surveys  conducted  by  Mercer  (Canada)  Limited.    The 
Company blends data from all sources and eliminates any compensation above or below one standard deviation of 
the average, so as not to skew market competitiveness. 
 
Elements of Compensation  
 
The Company’s executive officer total compensation is composed of three major components: base salary, a short-
term  incentive  bonus  and  long-term  share  based  and  option  based  incentives.    The  Compensation  Committee 
annually  reviews  the  various  elements  of  compensation  to  ensure  that  they  are  aligned  with  the  goals  of  the 
Company and each executive, as well as the Company’s compensation objectives and philosophy. 
 
Base Salary 
 
Each NEO receives a base salary, which constitutes a significant portion of the NEO’s compensation package. A 
preliminary  base  salary  for  each  executive is  established following  a  review of  market  data  for  similar  positions 
using the independent compensation surveys and proxy data of the Company’s comparator group of companies.  The 
selection of companies that make up the comparable group are intended to reflect a group of companies with which 
the Company competes for executives and other professionals. Actual proposed base salaries for executives other 
than the CEO are then recommended by the CEO to the Chairman of the Board and to the Compensation Committee 
based  upon  market  competitive  salary  levels;  an  assessment  of  an  executives  performance  and  the  Company’s 
performance during the year; the financial capacity of the Company; the scope of the executives responsibilities for 
the  year;  the  executives  prior  experience  and  retention  risk  referencing  the  competitive  nature  of  the  mining 
industry.  On the same basis, the proposed base salary of the CEO is recommended by the Chairman of the Board to 
the Compensation Committee who in turn recommends a final proposed base salary to the Board for approval. 
 
After  a  review  of  all  comparative  data  in  late  2014,  the  Compensation  Committee  increased  the  base  salaries  of 
certain  NEO’s  to  remain  competitive  as  reflected  in  each  NEO’s  capability  in  his/her  respective  roles,  effective 
January 1, 2015.

Short-Term Incentive Plan  
 
The second component of the executive officers’ compensation is an annual Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”), 
typically paid in cash.  All executives are eligible for annual STIP awards, after taking into account capital funding 
requirements, financial management and attainment of certain corporate objectives and personal objectives. STIP 
awards paid at the beginning of one fiscal year are typically for performance achieved against objectives set for the 
previous fiscal year. 
 
All awards, other than the CEO’s, are based on the recommendation of the CEO and are at the discretion of the 
Compensation  Committee  and  the  Board.    The  CEO  does  not  make  a  recommendation  to  the  Compensation 
Committee and the Board with respect to his own annual STIP award.  The annual STIP award for the CEO is based 
on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee to the Board. 
 
The Board approved for use in 2014, STIP targets as a percentage of base salary/fees.  The overall target may also 
be split between corporate and personal components with different weightings applied.  Each component may then 
have one or more goals with different weighting and measures. STIP awards may range from 0% to 200% of target 
base salary based on achievement of corporate and personal component objectives. In 2014, the overall target was 
weighted 100% on corporate goals with discretion from the Compensation Committee and the CEO to adjust the 
STIP for personal contributions by each executive. 
 
The  STIP  award  targets  as  a  percentage  of  base  salary/fees  and  the  split  between  the  corporate  and  personal 
component is as follows:

Corporate  objectives  were  developed  by  the  executive  management  team  and  submitted  to  the  Compensation 
Committee and the Board for modification and approval.  The approved corporate objectives were then applied to all 
NEOs.    Each  NEO  also  developed  personal  component  objectives  that  reflected  strategic  annual  operational 
objectives,  financial  improvement  of  the  business  and  effective  teamwork/communication  of  the  executive 
management team. 
 
For 2014, corporate component objectives and year-end results were as follows:
  Santander Production & Financials –  
  New Brunswick Restart Plan –  
 
  Exploration Programs –  
 
  Safety and Environmental Compliance –
Total
40% weighting 
30% weighting 
10% weighting

100%
In light of achievements during the 2014 year, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board awarded 
95% achievement of the Corporate goals. 
 
A  year-end  assessment  of  personal  component  objectives  was  also  completed  and  reviewed  for  consistency.  
Personal  component results were combined with the corporate component results to calculate an overall proposed 
STIP  achievement.    Any  calculated  STIP  awards  are  reviewed  by  the  CEO,  modified  where  appropriate  and 
recommended  to  the  Compensation  Committee  for  approval.  The  Compensation  Committee  reserves  the  right  to 
accept, modify or cancel any proposed STIP award recommendations. STIP awards are normally payable early in 
the following calendar year, typically after the close of the first quarter.

For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2014,  although  the  achievement  against  corporate  objectives  calculated  to  a 
potential  95%  payout  on  the  corporate  component,  it  was  recommended  by  the  Compensation  Committee  and 
approved by the Board that no cash STIP awards be payable to NEOs and all other employees covered under the 
STIP plan in order to preserve capital for 2015 initiatives.  The Compensation Committee agreed to consider Bonus 
Shares  (as  defined  below)  in  lieu  of  any  cash  STIP  awards.  The  amount  of  such  awards  was  approved  by  the 
Compensation Committee in January, 2015.  The STIP awards have not yet been issued.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 
The  third  component  of  NEO  compensation  is  the  granting  of  options  (“Options”)  to  purchase  Common  Shares 
under the Company’s stock option plan and/or the issuance of “bonus” Common Shares (“Bonus Shares”) and the 
granting of  RSUs, DSUs or PSUs under the Company’s share unit plan (“SUP”).  The Compensation Committee or 
the Board may grant Options, Bonus Shares, DSUs, RSUs and PSUs, or any combination thereof, on an annual basis 
to executive officers and service providers, including employees and consultants. 
 
The Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan and SUP are intended to help attract and retain employees by providing 
them with an opportunity to participate in the future success of the Company and to reinforce commitment to long-
term growth in profitability and shareholder value. The Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan and SUP are designed to 
encourage share ownership and entrepreneurship on the part of the senior management and employees. The Board 
believes that the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan and SUP aligns the interests of the NEOs and the Board with 
shareholders by linking a component of executive compensation to the longer term performance of the Common 
Shares.  
 
The  Compensation  Committee  recommended  and  the  Board  approved  for  use  in  2013  and  thereafter,  the 
establishment of  long-term incentive plan targets as a percentage of base salary/fees.  For 2015, NEOs have a target 
based on the 50th percentile (P50) of the long term incentive market data of the comparable group and could receive 
up to the 75th percentile if justified by Company performance.  Using 50th percentile long-term incentive market 
data, the 2015 long-term incentive targets for its NEOs were changed to reflect applicable market data, but remains 
at 50th percentile and terms of the grants are described below: 
 
Options  granted  under  the  Stock  Option  and  Stock  Bonus  Plan  vest  in  1/3  increments  starting  on  the  first  year 
anniversary of grant and fully vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.  Vested Options must be exercised 
no later than five years after the date of grant or they will expire.  Options are priced using the five day volume 
weighted average closing price of the Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) on the date of 
grant according to plan rules.  Bonus Share awards vest in 1/3 increments starting on the first year after grant and 
fully vest on the third anniversary date after grant.  At each vesting date, that portion of the award is settled with 
Common Shares issued from treasury. 
 
RSU awards vest 100% on the third anniversary date following grant.  There is no partial vesting before that time.  
Upon  vesting,  each  participant  receives  one  Common  Share  purchased  on  the  open  market  on  the  date  of 
redemption, or is settled in cash.  
 
The  form  of  the  incentive  award  (whether  Options,  Bonus  Shares,  RSUs  or  PSUs)  for  each  executive  and  the 
percentage split between each long-term incentive component is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee 
and  the  Board.  The  longer  term  goal,  dependent upon  market  conditions,  is  to  move  towards  a decreased use  of 
Options and an eventual shift to performance based awards. In monitoring or adjusting the recommended option 
allotments, the Board or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be, takes into account its own observations 
on  individual  performance  (where  possible),  its  assessment  of  individual  contribution  to  shareholder  value,  the
11
previous  option  grants.  The  scale  of  options  is  generally  commensurate  to  the  appropriate  level  of  base 
compensation  for  each  level  of  responsibility.  The  Board  or  the  Compensation  Committee  will  make  these 
determinations subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan and in 
accordance with the policies of  the TSX. 
 
Other Benefits 
 
The Company also has an appropriate benefits program in place, including medical and dental benefits and basic life 
insurance, which applies to all permanent employees (full and part-time) and consultants, as the Company believes 
that such a plan is a competitive requirement and therefore an important consideration in attracting the necessary 
personnel. 
 
NEO Share Ownership Guidelines 
 
In an effort to align the interests of the NEOs with those of the Company’s shareholders, in December 2012, the 
Company adopted an executive share ownership policy. 
 
Effective March 1, 2013, each NEO of the Company must purchase and hold at least $10,000 worth of Common 
Shares within one year of appointment.  In addition, the CEO must hold that number of Common Shares with a 
value of at least three times his or her base salary and each of the other NEOs must hold that number of Common 
Shares with a value of at least one times his or her base salary. This requirement is to be attained within five years of 
becoming the CEO or within three years for any other NEO and must be maintained throughout such persons tenure 
as the CEO or a NEO, as the case may be. The relevant calculations are made as at December 31 of each year.  
 
As 2013 was the first year that the executive share ownership policy was adopted, each NEO had until March 1, 
2014 to meet their minimum of $10,000 worth of Common Share ownership requirements. The CEO will have until 
March  1,  2018,  and  all  other  NEOs  will  have  until  March  1,  2016,  to  purchase  and  hold  Common  Shares 
representing  the  minimum  requirements  of  their  annual  base  salary/fees.    As  of  March  1,  2014,  all  NEOs  have 
attained  the  minimum  Common  Share  ownership  requirements.    See  the  table  below  entitled  “NEO  Share 
Ownership Requirements and Actual Share Ownership at December 31, 2014”.

The Corporation’s closing prices were as follows:  
 
Dec. 31/2009=$1.01; Dec. 31/2010=$1.58; Dec. 31/2011=$0.94; Dec. 31/2012=$1.07; Dec. 31/2013=$1.01,  Dec 
31/2014=$1.07 
 
Over  the  past  five  years,  the  Company  has  experienced  significant  changes.    Specifically  in  2011,  with  the 
acquisition  of  the  Halfmile,  Stratmat  and  Ruttan  properties  located  in  Canada,  through  the  acquisition  of  Kria 
Resources  Ltd.    In  early  January  2012,  the  Company  made  the  transition  from  a  mineral  explorer/developer  to 
producer with the development of its mine at Halfmile, New Brunswick, and on November 2, 2012 the Company 
completed the acquisition of the Caribou mill and property located in New Brunswick, through the acquisition of 
Maple Minerals Corporation. In 2013, the Company commissioned and commenced commercial production at its 
Santander mine in Peru, and 2014 represented the Company’s first full year of commercial production at Santander. 
In  addition,  the  Company  anticipates  bringing  its  Caribou  mine  into  production  in  2015.    The  Company’s 
compensation  to  the  NEOs  has  also  increased  over  this  period  to  reflect  the  growing  business  and  increased 
complexities  of  the  executive  positions;  however,  the  percentage  increase  in  the  NEOs’  compensation  is  not 
consistent with the trend of total return on investment charted for the Company in the above performance graph.  
The Company does not base its executive compensation on total return on investment.  As mentioned previously, the 
Company relies exclusively on the Compensation Committee and the Board to determine executive compensation.

Termination and Change of Control Benefits
Dr. Mark Cruise, CEO & President
The Company entered into a revised consulting agreement (the “Cruise Agreement”) dated January 1, 2013 with 
Cruise Geoservices Limited (“CGL”), a private company beneficially owned by Dr. Cruise, whereby the Company 
agreed to pay C$353,000 per year for providing management and exploration services to the Company. Effective 
June 12, 2013, the consulting agreement was revised to reflect that any potential bonus would fall under the new 
STIP plan and that any termination following a change of control would now also require cause (double trigger) for 
any termination payment to occur.  Under the Cruise Agreement, CGL is eligible to receive a cash STIP award at the 
end of each calendar year based on attainment of corporate and personal objectives and Board approval. In the event 
of  the  death  of  the  Dr.  Cruise,  CGL  is  eligible  to  receive  a  pro-rated  STIP  assuming  100%  attainment  on  any 
personal objectives and respective achievement of any corporate objectives.  The services of CGL under the Cruise 
Agreement are provided by Dr. Cruise, who acts as CEO and President of the Company.
CGL is entitled to receive the following payments if  Dr. Cruise is terminated by the Company without cause:
(a) 
(b)
(c)
(d)
payment of base fee to the date of termination and any outstanding vacation pay thereto; and 
12 months’ notice plus one additional month per completed year of service, to a maximum of an 
additional 12 months’ notice (“Working Notice”), or
a lump sum payment to Dr. Cruise in lieu of the Working Notice, equal to the base fee and STIP  
that Dr. Cruise would have otherwise earned during the Working Notice period, plus an additional 
lump  sum  payment  of  30%  in  lieu  of  lost  benefits,  the  total  lump  sum  payment  being  the 
“Termination Payment”; or
the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, may provide Dr. Cruise with a combination of 
part Working Notice and part termination payment (the “Combined Option”).
Assuming that the event of termination without cause took place on December 31, 2014, the following are estimates 
of the lump sum amounts payable by the Company to CGL in such circumstances:
Payment Type

Amount 
$353,000 
$205,917 
$167,675 
$726,592
Lump sum payment of base consultancy fee (1)
One additional month salary per completed year of service
Benefits (30% of total lump sum base fee in lieu of benefits)
Total Compensation (1) 
Notes: 
(1) 
(2) 
 
For a period of 18 months from a change of control, CGL is eligible for severance payments in the event of either an 
involuntary termination or a termination for Good Reason (as defined in the Cruise Agreement).
The total amount will vary depending on the termination date.  
Based on seven completed years of service as of December 31, 2014.
In  the  case  of  Good  Reason,  CGL  may  elect  to  terminate  the  Cruise  Agreement  and  its  engagement  with  the 
Company  by  providing  written  notice  to  the  Company  of  its  intention  to  immediately  terminate  the  Cruise 
Agreement as a result of Good Reason.  In the event of termination for Good Reason following a change in control, 
CGL would be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to three times the sum of: (a) the then annual base fees; (b) the 
average annual bonus received by Dr. Cruise from the Company during the most recent three years prior to such 
termination; and (c) immediate vesting of any outstanding and unvested Options and non-performance based awards 
under the SUP, plus an additional 30% of annual base fee for lost benefits. Any performance-based awards under the 
SUP do not fully accelerate if the performance goals have not been met.  Acceleration of any performance-based 
awards under the SUP whose performance goals have been met are proportionate to the date of the change of control 
calculated using actual performance at that time vs. proportionate measure to the date of the change of control and 
included in the above lump sum payment.

DIRECTORS’ COMPENSATION
The Company recognizes the contribution that its directors make to the Company and seeks to compensate them 
accordingly.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for making recommendations as to director compensation 
for the Board’s consideration and ultimate approval. 
 
The  Company  uses  the  same  comparator  companies  to  determine  the  competitiveness  and  composition  of  their 
director compensation as they do for their executive compensation.  The Company sets compensation based on the 
average (P50) compensation paid within the comparator group, factoring out data that lies outside of one standard 
deviation.  The Company also reviews continuing market trends from an analysis of comparator proxy information 
and data obtained from the Canadian Spencer Stuart Board Index (“CSSBI”). 
 
Based on their review, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company’s Board compensation was below 
its peer group and recommended that the Company increase its director compensation to bring it in line with that of 
its peers and market compensation trends. The monthly cash retainer was increased from $3,250 to $3,750, but the 
meeting fees were unchanged for 2015, while the equity portion of the Directors compensation was increased from 
$55,000  to  $60,000  annually.    Market  data  also  showed  that  the  majority  of  CSSBI  100  Boards  and  comparator 
companies  gave  directors  the  option  to  receive  equity  instead  of  their  cash  compensation.    The  Compensation 
Committee recommended in 2014 and the Board agreed to allow directors to voluntarily elect to take any or all of 
their cash compensation (annual cash retainer and any additional Chair retainer) in the form of DSUs. This election 
is offered on an annual basis.  For 2015, Mr. Peter Meredith elected to take to take 100% of his annual cash retainer 
and per meeting fees in equivalent DSUs and Ms. Catherine Gignac elected to take 50% of her annual cash retainer 
in equivalent DSUs. 
 
Director compensation includes:
 
 
 
 

an annual director retainer; 
an additional annual retainer for serving as a committee chair; 
attendance fees for each meeting attended in person or by conference call; 
an equity value paid by way of Options, Bonus Shares, DSUs, or a combination thereof; and 
in addition, the Company reimburses directors for their out-of-pocket costs incurred in attending Board or 
Board committee meetings.

Equity Based Compensation 
 
A  component  of  the  director’s  compensation  is  the  granting  of  Options,  and/or  the  issuance  of  Bonus  Shares 
pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan and the granting of DSUs under the 
SUP.  The Compensation Committee or the Board may grant Options, Bonus Shares, and DSUs, or any combination 
thereof,  on  an  annual  basis  to  directors.    Each  director  is  also  entitled  to  participate  in  any  security-based 
compensation arrangement or other plan adopted by the Company from time to time with the approval of the Board.  
 
The use of Bonus Shares and DSUs moves the Company towards its goal of decreasing the use of Options for non-
executive directors and promotes greater alignment between directors and shareholders. The form of the incentive 
award (whether Options, Bonus Shares, PSUs or RSUs) for each executive and the percentage split between each 
long-term incentive component is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board. 
 
Currently, Options granted under the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan vest in 1/3 increments starting one year 
after the date of the grant and must be exercised no later than five years after the date of grant.  DSUs vest for non-
U.S. directors on the first anniversary date following grant and are settled when the non-executive director ceases to 
hold office. DSUs for non-executive directors that are U.S. citizens, residents or green card holders vest, and are 
settled,  on  the  date  of  their retirement  or  death.   When settled  or redeemed,  each DSU pays  the holder  the  then 
current cash equivalent of the market price per share on date of settlement. 
 
For  2014,  it  was  determined  that  25%  of  the  annual  equity  value  would  be  awarded  in  Options;  25%  in  Bonus 
Shares and 50% in DSUs. For 2015, it was determined that 100% of the annual equity value would be awarded in 
DSUs. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company granted Options to purchase 129,000 Common Shares, 
77,400 Bonus Shares and 154,200 DSUs to non-executive directors as follows:

Director Share Ownership Guidelines 
 
In an effort to align the interests of members of the Board with those of the Company’s shareholders, in March 2013 
the Company adopted a director share ownership policy. 
 
Effective  March  1,  2013,  each  non-executive  director  of  the  Company  must  purchase  and  hold  at  least  $10,000 
worth of Common Shares within one year of appointment and within five years are to purchase and hold Common 
Shares  representing  at  least  three  times  the  amount  of  the  annual  cash  retainer  payable  to  each  non-executive 
director of the Company.  These requirements must be maintained throughout their tenure as a director.  
 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will periodically review and make recommendations to the Board as to 
what level of director shareholding requirement is appropriate for the Company.  The calculations are made as at 
December 31 of each year.
23
As 2013 was the first year that the director share ownership policy was adopted, all current non-executive directors 
had until March 1, 2014 to meet their minimum $10,000 worth of Common Shares ownership requirements and will 
have until March 1, 2018 to purchase and hold Common Shares representing at least three times the amount of their 
annual cash retainer.

Based on the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan, 
less the number of Options outstanding as at December 31, 2014.
Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan
The Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan was established by the Board on September 15, 2010, and was amended 
and restated on June 23, 2011 and June 25, 2012. In addition, certain housekeeping amendments were made to the 
Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan  and approved by shareholders of the Company  in June of 2014.  
 
The purpose of the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan is to give the Board the ability to (i) provide the Company’s 
directors, officers and services providers the opportunity to participate in the progress of the Company by granting 
to such individuals options (“Options”) to purchase Common Shares; and (ii) provide additional compensation by 
issuing to such individuals Bonus Shares.
26
The  purpose  of  granting  such  Options  and/or  Bonus  Shares  is  to  assist  the  Company  in  attracting,  retaining  and 
motivating executive officers, directors and service providers and to align the personal interests of such executive 
officers,  directors  and  service  providers  to  those  of  the  Company’s  shareholders.    The  Stock  Option  and  Stock 
Bonus Plan is intended to be competitive with the benefit programs of other companies in the mining industry, and 
has been prepared in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. 
 
Pursuant  to  the  Stock  Option  and  Stock  Bonus  Plan,  the  maximum  number  of  Common  Shares  which  may  be 
issuable pursuant to Options granted or Bonus Shares issued under the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan together 
with all of the Company’s other previously established or proposed share compensation arrangements, in aggregate, 
will not any time exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares as of the date of grant 
on a non-diluted basis. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, Options to purchase 1,651,700 Common Shares were granted under the 
Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan, representing 0.59% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.   
 
As at May 5, 2015, a total of 6,948,009 Common Shares were issuable under the Stock Option and Stock Bonus 
Plan, representing 2.4% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.  
 
Bonus Shares 
 
Pursuant to the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee can also issue up to an aggregate 
of 2,000,000 Bonus Shares per annum to those directors, officers and service providers of the Company who the 
Compensation  Committee,  in  its  sole  discretion,  deems  to  have  provided  extraordinary  contributions  to  the 
advancement of the Company.  
 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
 
Pursuant to the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee may, from time to time, grant 
stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) to any Optionee in conjunction with any grant of Options. An Optionee may 
only exercise a SAR at the same time, and to the same extent, that the Option related thereto is exercisable. On the 
exercise  of  a  SAR,  the  Optionee  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  such  number  of  Common  Shares  as  is  equal  to  the 
excess, if any, of (i) the weighted average trading price of the Common Shares entitled to be acquired upon exercise 
of such Option as of the date of exercise of the Option, over (ii) the exercise price of such Option. The provisions in 
the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan applicable to Options apply equally to SARs. No SAR may be exercised 
beyond  the  stated  expiry  date  of  the  corresponding  Option,  and  SARs  terminate  on  the  termination  of  the 
corresponding Option.  
 
As at May 5, 2015, the Company has not granted any SARs under the Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan.
INDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
As at the date of this Circular, no individual who is an executive officer, director, employee or former executive 
officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is indebted to the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries pursuant to the purchase of securities or otherwise.
No individual who is, or at any time during the financial year ended December 31, 2014 was, a director or executive

REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board and the Company’s management are committed to sound corporate governance practices, which are both 
in the interest of its shareholders and contribute to effective and efficient decision making.  National Policy 58-201
27
Corporate Governance Guidelines establishes corporate governance guidelines which apply to all public companies.  
These guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive but to be used by issuers in developing their own corporate 
governance practices.
Pursuant  to  National  Instrument  58-101  Disclosure  of  Corporate  Governance  Practices  (“NI  58-101”),  the 
Company  is  required  to  disclose  its  corporate  governance  practices.  A  description  of  the  Company’s  corporate 
governance practices, which addresses the matters set out in NI 58-101, is set out at Schedule “A” to this Circular. 
The  Board  will  continue  to  monitor  such  practices  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  when  necessary  implement  such 
additional practices as it deems appropriate.
In early 2014, the Corporate Governance Committee recommended and the Board approved a majority voting policy 
for director elections.  The policy stipulates that for any uncontested elections of directors, if the votes in favour of 
the election of a director nominee at a shareholders’ meeting represent less than the majority of the shares voted and 
withheld, the nominee will submit his or her resignation promptly after the meeting, for the Corporate Governance 
Committee’s consideration.  The Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board after 
reviewing  the  matter  and  any  extenuating  circumstances,  and  the  Board  will  act  on  the  Corporate  Governance 
Committee’s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote.  The Board’s decision 
to accept or reject the resignation offer will promptly be disclosed to the public by press release.  The nominee will 
not  participate  in  any  Corporate  Governance  Committee  or  Board  deliberations  on  the  resignation  offer.    The 
majority voting policy does not apply in circumstances involving contested director elections.

therefore is not considered an independent director.
A  majority  (7  out  of  8)  of  the  directors  are  independent  for  the 
purpose of NI 58-101.
Please refer to  the  management information circular dated May 5, 
2015 (the “Circular”) under the heading “Particulars of Matters to 
be Acted Upon - Election of Directors”.
The independent directors do not have regularly scheduled meetings 
in  the  absence  of  the  non-independent  directors  and  management, 
but can do so on an ad hoc basis, at the expense of the Company, as 
they see fit.  The independent directors met as a group, without the 
non-independent  directors  or  management  being  present,  once 
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.
The Chairman of the Board is David Huberman who is independent.
Please  refer  to  the  Circular  under  the  heading  “Particulars  of

Position Descriptions
3.  (a)  Disclose  whether  or  not  the  board  has 
developed  written  position  descriptions  for  the  chair 
and the chair of each board committee.  If the board

The  Board,  together  with  the  Company’s  CEO,  is  currently 
developing  a  Board  Policy  Manual  which  will  provide  position 
descriptions for the chair of the Board and the chair of each board 
committee,  including  the  definition  of  the  limits  to  management’s 
responsibilities.   At present, the Board has delegated the day-to-day 
management  of  the  business  and  affairs  of  the  Company  to  the 
executive  officers  of  the  Company.    Generally,  operations  in  the 
ordinary  course  or  that  are  not  in  the  ordinary  course  and  do  not 
exceed material levels of expenditures or commitment on the part of 
the  Company  have  been  delegated  to  management.    Decisions 
relating  to  matters  that  are  not  in  the  ordinary  course  and  that 
involve  material  expenditures  or  commitments  on  the  part  of  the 
Company  require  prior  approval  of  the  Board.  Any  responsibility

corporate objectives which the CEO is responsible for meeting.
Orientation and Continuing Education
4. (a) Briefly describe what measures the board takes 
to  orient  new  directors  regarding  (i)  the  role  of  the 
board,  its  committees  and  its  directors,  and  (ii)  the 
nature and operation of the issuer’s business.
(b) Briefly describe what measures, if any, the board 
takes to provide continuing education for its directors. 
If  the  board  does  not  provide  continuing  education, 
describe  how  the  board  ensures  that  its  directors 
maintain  the  skill  and  knowledge  necessary  to  meet 
their obligations as directors.
The  Nominating  and  Governance  Committee,  in  conjunction  with 
the chair of the Board and the CEO of the Company, are responsible 
for ensuring that the new directors are provided with an orientation 
and  education  program  which  includes  written  information  about 
the business and operations of the Company, documents from recent 
Board meetings, and opportunities for meetings and discussion with 
senior  management  and  other  directors.    New  directors  are  also 
given  the  opportunity  to  independently  consult  with  the  legal 
counsel to the Company to better understand their legal obligations 
as directors of the Company.
The  following  activities  are  performed  by  the  Company  to  ensure 
that  directors  maintain  the  knowledge  necessary  to  meet  their 
obligations as a Board director:

Management of the Company takes steps to ensure that its 
directors  and  officers  are  continually  updated  as  to  the  latest

and is on the mailing list of the TSX to receive updates to any of 
those  policies.    Any  such  changes  or  new  requirements  are  then 
brought to the attention of the Company’s directors either by way of 
director  or  committee  meetings  or  by  direct  communications  from 
management to the directors. 
b) 
Management  assists  directors  by  providing  them  with 
regular updates on relevant developments and other information that 
management considers of interest to the Board.   
c) 
Directors  may  attend  other  Board  committee  meetings  if 
they are not active members, to broaden their knowledge base and 
receive  additional  information  on  the  Company’s  business  and 
developments in areas where they are not commonly exposed.  
d) 
At  each  quarterly  Board  meeting,  the  CEO  makes  a 
presentation to the Board to provide a comprehensive explanation of 
the  Company’s  financial  performance,  anticipated  future  financial 
results and market trends.  
e) 
With  respect  to  novel  business,  accounting  and  industry 
issues,  management  will  arrange  for  an  industry  or  related 
professional  to  make  a  presentation  to  or  provide  advice  to  the 
Board on a topic relevant to those issues, if required.

Halfmile mine site and met with the local First Nation Community.
Ethical Business Conduct
5.(a) Disclose whether or not the board has adopted a 
written code for the directors, officers and employees.  
If the board has adopted a written code:
The  Board  expects  management  to  operate  the  business  of  the 
Company  in  a  manner  that  enhances  shareholder  value  and  is 
consistent  with  the  highest  level  of  integrity.    Management  is 
expected  to  execute  the  Company’s  business  plan  and  to  meet 
performance  goals  and  objectives  according  to  the  highest  ethical 
standards.  To this end, in May 2008, the Board adopted a Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) for its directors, officers 
and  employees.    The  Code  was  updated  by  the  Board  in  January 
2013.    Pursuant  to  the  Code,  the  Company  has  appointed  David 
Huberman,  the  Chairman  of  the  Company’s  Nominating  and 
Governance Committee, to serve as the Company’s Ethics Officer 
to  ensure  adherence  to  the  Code,  reporting  directly  to  the  Board.  
Training  in  the  Code  is  included  in  the  orientation  of  new 
employees  and,  to  ensure  familiarity  with  the  Code,  directors, 
officers and employees are asked to read the Code and are required 
to sign a Compliance Certificate annually.  Directors, officers and 
employees are required to report any known violations of the Code 
to the Ethics Officer or the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
As one measure to ensure compliance with the Code, the Board has 
established a Whistleblower Policy to discourage illegal activity and 
business conduct that damages the Company’s good name, business 
interest,  and  its  relationship  with  shareholders,  tenants  and  the 
community at large.

The  Board  has  also  adopted  a  “Share  Trading  Policy”,  which 
prescribes rules with respect to trading in securities of the Company 
where  there  is  any  undisclosed  material  information  or  a  pending 
material development.  Strict compliance with the provisions of this 
policy is required, with a view to enhancing investor confidence in 
the  Company’s  securities  and  contributing  to  ethical  business 
conduct by the Company’s personnel. 
In April 2012, the Board also created a Sustainability Committee in 
order 
to 
improving  the  environment  and  ensuring  that  its  activities  are 
carried out in a safe, sustainable and environmentally sound manner 
(see “Other Board Committees” below).

The  Board  monitors  compliance  with  the  Code  and  management 
provides  an  annual  report  to  the  Board  regarding  issues,  if  any, 
arising  under 
the  Code.  The  Nominating  and  Governance 
Committee reviews the adequacy of the Code on an annual basis.  In 
addition, the Company uses a confidential and anonymous reporting 
system  that  allows  reporting  by  anyone  having  a  concern  about 
unethical  or  illegal  activities.  All  employees  of  the  Company  are 
expected to inform their manager or supervisor of such concerns. If 
an employee is not comfortable speaking to his or her supervisor or 
is  not  satisfied  with  the  supervisor’s  response,  the  employee  is 
encouraged to speak with anyone in management of the Company 
with whom he or she is comfortable approaching.  All complaints

securities  regulatory  instruments,  in  order  to  ensure  that  directors 
exercise  independent  judgment  in  considering  transactions  and 
agreements in respect of which a director or officer has a material 
interest.    Any  interested  director  would  be  required  to  declare  the 
nature and extent of his interest and would not be entitled to vote at 
meetings of directors which evoke any such conflict.

of  the  Nominating  and  Governance  Committee,  together  with  the 
CEO,  develop  a  list  of  potential  candidates  for  review  by  the 
Nominating  and  Governance  Committee.    Given  that  the  various 
members  of  the  Board  have,  in  aggregate,  a  wide  network  of 
contacts, all members of the Board are encouraged to submit names 
of potential candidates who would make significant contributions to 
the  Company.    Through  discussion,  the  list  is  refined  by  the 
Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Nominating and Governance Committee is comprised of David

performance  of  the  Company  and  the  CEO  as  measured  against 
objectives  established  in  the  prior  year  by  the  Compensation 
Committee and the CEO and approved by the Board.  The results of 
this  annual  review  are  communicated  to  the  full  Board  who  then
