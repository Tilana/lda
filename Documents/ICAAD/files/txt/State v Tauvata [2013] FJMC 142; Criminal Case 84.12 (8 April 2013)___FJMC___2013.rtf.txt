The facts of the case are on 5th May 2012 at 7.30pm at Nasomo Vatukoula, the complainant (Adivika Bavui, 14yrs student of Nasomo), went to the bus stop about one kilometer away from her house, to wait for cousin. She was accompanied by her younger sister and six other small boys and girls.

On the way to the said bus stop complainant heard somebody called her name hence she went to check. There she saw you and one Viliame Taukeiduadua (juvenile). You began talking to the complainant and at that time her companions had left and ran towards the bus stop. Whilst being with the complainant you then got hold of her right hand and pulled her to a nearby cassava plantation. At the cassava plantation you then pushed the complainant to the ground and removed her panty and before you could insert your penis into complainant's vagina her companions returned calling for her. You heard them calling and ran away. Complainant went and relayed the incident to her mother. The matter was then reported to police.

Upon investigations you were arrested, cautioned interviewed and charged for the alleged offence.

The starting point would depend on the seriousness of the offending.

Considering the circumstance of offending, I commence your sentence at 4 years. For the aggravating features I increase your sentences by 3 years. Your sentence is now 6 years.
