<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia (La Paz, Sucre and Santa Cruz) from 4 to 10 September 2012. He held 
extensive meetings with authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches. 
</p>
<p>2. In addition to meetings with Government and State institutions at the national, 
regional, departmental and local levels, the Special Rapporteur met with the Office of the 
Ombudsman (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo) and the Permanent Council of the National 
Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination. He also had extensive 
meetings with representatives of political parties, civil society organizations, indigenous 
communities and organizations, Bolivians of African descent (Afro-Bolivians), victims of 
racism and racial discrimination, as well as with other relevant groups and individuals. 
</p>
<p>3. The visit to Bolivia by the Special Rapporteur had a special significance, given that 
it was the first official visit to the country by a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. In addition to the 
information collected during his visit on the country&#8217;s progress in the fight against racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of and built upon the recommendations made by other mandate holders who had 
visited Bolivia, as well as those made by relevant human rights mechanisms. He also 
followed upon on the relevant recommendations and commitments made by the 
Government during the seventh session of the universal periodic review, in February 2010. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
the Plurinational State of Bolivia for its full cooperation and openness in the preparation 
and conduct of the visit. He also wishes to express his appreciation to the United Nations 
country team in Bolivia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) in Bolivia for their assistance and support, as well as to the 
different civil society interlocutors that cooperated with him throughout the visit. The 
conclusions and recommendations made in the present report were based on the broad 
discussions and exchanges with Bolivia-based interlocutors and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
own analysis. He hopes that they will contribute to determining concrete ways and means 
of addressing the challenges raised in the report in an effective and human rights-compliant 
manner. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Social and political context  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Plurinational State of Bolivia is a landlocked country, bordering Brazil, Peru, 
Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. After 300 years of colonialism, Bolivia proclaimed its 
independence in 1809. In 1825, the Republic of Bolivia was established. 
</p>
<p>6. The Constitution of the Plurinational State, adopted in 2009, acknowledges Bolivia 
as a unitary, plurinational and secular State, formally known as the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia. It recognizes the coexistence of 36 different indigenous nations and peoples, and 
states that the country is founded on political, economic, legal, cultural and linguistic 
pluralism. The Constitution declares 36 indigenous languages, as well as Spanish, as 
official languages. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Demographic and ethnic composition 
</b></p>
<p>7. One of the main characteristics of Bolivia is its ethnic, cultural and linguistic 
diversity. It has the largest number of indigenous communities and population in South 
America. According to the 2001 national population and housing census, about 66.4 per 
cent of the country&#8217;s population belong to indigenous ethnic groups.1 The main indigenous 
ethnic groups are the Quechua, about 2.53 million people; the Aymara, about 20 million; 
the Chiquitano 181,900; the Guaran&#237;, 126,160; and the Moje&#241;o, around 68,800. About 
124,000 people belong to smaller indigenous groups.2 The community of Bolivians of 
African descent was not included in the census of 2001. German, Croatian, Serbian, Asian, 
Middle Eastern and other minorities also live in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. 
</p>
<p>8. A national census was scheduled for November 2012; the results of the census had 
not been published at the time of writing. The new questionnaire for the population and 
housing census will allow respondents to self-identify as belonging to any nationality, 
indigenous peoples or the community of Bolivians of African descent. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights legal instruments 
</b></p>
<p>9. At the international level, Bolivia is a State party to most United Nations human 
rights treaties. It has not yet ratified the second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death penalty or the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. 
</p>
<p>10. At the regional level, Bolivia has ratified the American Convention on Human 
Rights, the Andean Charter for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, the Inter-
American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons, the Protocol to the American 
Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty, the Inter-American Convention 
to Prevent and Punish Torture, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women, the Inter-American Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities, the 
Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Ibero-American Convention on the Rights of 
Young People. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional provisions and legislative reforms 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia 2009 provides that the 
objective and essential function of the State is &#8220;to establish a just and harmonious society, 
</p>
<p>founded on decolonization, without discrimination or exploitation, with social justice, to 
strengthen the plurinational identities.&#8221; Its article 14, paragraph II, provides that:  
</p>
<p>the State prohibits and punishes all forms of discrimination based on sex, colour, 
age, sexual orientation, gender identity, origin, culture, nationality, citizenship, 
language, religious creed, ideology, political or philosophical affiliation, marital

</b></p>
<p>status, social or economic status, occupation, level of education, disability, 
pregnancy, or others with the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the 
recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on equality, of the rights of every person. 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution ensures a wide range of collective and individual rights for 
indigenous nations and peoples, Bolivians of African descent and other relevant groups and 
individuals. These include (a) the prohibition and punishment of discrimination; (b) 
recognition of native indigenous peasants, nations and peoples, and their rights; (c) 
recognition of Afro-Bolivian people and their rights; (d) recognition of the native 
indigenous campesino justice system; (e) promotion of agrarian reform and the granting of 
land to native indigenous campesino peoples, intercultural communities of indigenous 
peoples, Bolivians of African descent and campesino communities whose members have no 
land or insufficient land; (f) provision on profit-sharing from extraction of natural resources 
in the territories of native indigenous campesino peoples and nations; and (g) the right to 
asylum or refuge on grounds of political or ideological persecution, and the principle of 
non-refoulement.3 
</p>
<p>13. As at February 2010, the Plurinational State of Bolivia had adopted the fundamental 
laws as called for by the Constitution: the Law on Judicial Authority, the Law on the 
Electoral Body, the Law on the Electoral System, the Law on the Plurinational 
Constitutional Court and the Framework Law on Autonomy and Decentralization. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislation prohibiting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of Law No. 045 against Racism and 
All Forms of Discrimination on 8 October 2010. The purpose of the Law is to establish 
mechanisms and procedures for the prevention and punishment of acts of racism and all 
forms of discrimination. It identifies relevant measures in such areas as education, 
communication, information dissemination, public and economic life. It also establishes the 
procedures and mechanisms for filing complaints by victims of racism or discrimination, 
and provides that courts at all levels should prioritize cases related to racism and 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>15. On 5 February 2011, the Government approved Supreme Decree No. 762, which 
sets out the regulations for implementing Law No. 045 and establishes prevention and 
information policies, the categories of misconduct that constitute racism and discrimination 
and respective penalties. 
</p>
<p>16. Law No. 045 also amended article 281, chapter V (crimes against human dignity), of 
the Penal Code, on the criminalization of acts of racism, such as incitement to racism and 
racial discrimination and verbal attacks on racist and discriminatory grounds.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional human rights framework and public policy 
</b></p>
<p>17. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that important changes had been made 
in recent years in the governmental structures responsible for issues relating to his mandate. 
They include, in particular, the creation of the National Committee against Racism and All 
Forms of Discrimination in 2011 (see paragraph 19 below), the Office of the Vice-Ministry 
for Decolonization and the Directorate-General for the Fight against Racism and All Forms 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>of Discrimination in 2009. Act No. 139 of 14 June 2011 declared 24 May the &#8220;National 
</p>
<p>Day against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. In February 2009, the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization was created as a part of the 
Ministry of Cultures, with the tasks of (a) coordinating the implementation of programmes 
and projects of decolonization; (b) implementing policies and actions to reassess ancestral 
knowledge of native indigenous peasants, nations and peoples, Bolivians of African descent 
and intercultural communities; (c) encouraging the elimination of practices based on 
patriarchal, racist and bureaucratic patterns; (d) developing policies for the prevention and 
eradication of racism and cultural intolerance; (e) promoting interculturalism; and (f) 
implementing training programmes in the official languages of the Plurinational State. 
</p>
<p>19. The National Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination was 
established in 2011 under Law No. 045 to prepare an assessment for a national plan of 
action against racism and all forms of discrimination, as well as to monitor and follow up 
on claims of acts of racism and discrimination. The Committee also focuses on awareness-
raising activities, for instance by preparing media programmes and messages to promote 
social tolerance. Its membership includes 61 institutions, such as State institutions at 
various levels, indigenous and Afro-Bolivian organizations, and various civil society 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>20. The Office of the Ombudsman was first set up in 1994. It was then re-established 
under the Constitution of 2009 to protect and promote the human rights enshrined in the 
Constitution, relevant laws and international instruments. Its mandate also applies to the 
rights of native indigenous peoples, inter-urban communities and Bolivians abroad. The 
Ombudsman is tasked with a broad range of duties, including dealing with complaints; 
investigating and reporting on incidents of abuses by State authorities upon a complaint or 
on the Office&#8217;s own initiative; requesting information from State authorities to carry out its 
</p>
<p>investigations and issuing recommendations, including modifications to the laws, decrees 
and non-judicial resolutions; promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination against 
women and indigenous peoples; and informing and educating the general public in 
understanding and exercising their rights. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, 
thanks to its credibility and presence throughout all nine departments of the country, the 
Office of the Ombudsman probably receives the highest number of complaints when 
compared with other complaint-receiving mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>21. In December 2011, the National Committee against Racism and All Forms of 
Discrimination adopted a preliminary draft of the plan of action against racism and all 
forms of discrimination in accordance with the Law No. 045, and entrusted its Permanent 
Council with the further elaboration of the plan of action following the observations 
received from public entities and other civil society actors. The plan of action is based upon 
an assessment conducted in 2010 and 2011 on the current situation of racism and 
discrimination in Bolivia, prepared with the participation of a broad spectrum of public and 
civil society actors and stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the elaboration and 
the initial approval of the plan of action, and commends the participatory process through 
which such an assessment was done. The plan of action defines a long-term vision of 
Bolivia as a country grounded on social justice and dignity, while setting out key strategic 
objectives in the fight against racism and discrimination for the period 2012 - 2015. In 
terms of its legal framework, the plan of action incorporates legal mandates provided under 
the new constitutional framework, and the principles and scopes of operation set forth in the 
Law No. 045. It also incorporates international human rights instruments, norms and 
standards. 
</p>
<p>22. On 15 February 2012, the Permanent Council of the National Committee against 
Racism and All Forms of Discrimination approved the plan of action, and has since held 
technical meetings with ministries to allow coordinated implementation of the 17 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>programmes in the plan of action. For the programmes under the plan of action to be 
launched, however, the approval of a supreme decree by the Executive branch, which 
would define the implementation procedures of the plan of action, is still required. 
Regardless of the pending formal approval of the plan of action, some entities have already 
initiated action under their respective competencies; for instance, the Ministry of Education 
is currently seeking to mainstream the fight against racism into curricula at different levels 
of the education system. The Ministry of Development Planning approved the 2013 
planning guidelines for public bodies across the State, in which it has included programmes 
on more than one area of development for the fight against racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, in late 2011, departmental 
committees against racism and all forms of discrimination began to be formed in Tarija and 
Chuquisaca Departments under the auspices of the departmental governments and with the 
participation of civil society organizations. The initial activities of the committees include 
working on the elaboration of departmental plans action against racism and discrimination 
with the participation of public and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>24. The National Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination and the 
Ministry of Cultures, through the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization, are responsible for 
compiling statistical information on recorded complaints and the monitoring of 
administrative and judicial processes on cases of racism and discrimination. The objective 
of the system and the database is to analyse racist and/or discriminatory behaviours and 
attitudes and to use the results in the formulation of relevant public policies; to generate 
periodic analytical reports on the implementation of Law No. 045 and trends of racism and 
discrimination in Bolivia; and to involve all levels of the Government in the work of 
recording and monitoring administrative and judicial proceedings on racism and 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>25. The national plan of action on human rights was approved by Supreme Decree No. 
29851 of 10 December 2008. This instrument, prepared by the Ministry of Justice with the 
participation of relevant institutions and civil society, includes important provisions on the 
fight against racism and racial discrimination, as well as on the protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivians. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of policy and legal measures 
</b></p>
<p>26. The fight against racism and racial discrimination is recognized as a priority policy 
matter of the State. It was noted, however, that the implementation of relevant legislation 
and plans of action still posed significant challenges owing to lack of capacity, expertise 
and adequate resources. The Government has declared its commitment to the effective 
implementation of Law No. 045 and the plan of action, and recognizes existing challenges, 
such as the lack of financial and human resources. 
</p>
<p>27. Many of the interlocutors felt that the existing political polarization within the 
country impedes effective implementation of the legislation against racism. Social 
fragmentation remains prevalent owing to the legacy of a colonial structure, the centuries-
long exclusion of indigenous peoples and communities in political and social life, and 
economic exploitation. 
</p>
<p>28. According to Government data for 2012, the statistics on complaints relating to acts 
of racism and discrimination showed a considerable increase when compared with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>period that preceded the enactment of Law No. 045 in October 2010. While only 22 
complaints on racism and discrimination were handled during the two years prior to the 
enactment of Law No. 045, between the entry into force of the Law and 30 November 
2012, the General Directorate for Combating Racism received a total of 323 complaints. 
Complaints relating to racism mainly covered cases of discrimination on the basis of 
national or ethnic origin, skin colour, clothing and the language of the victim.4 
</p>
<p>29. According to the Government, a considerable proportion of complaints on racism 
and discrimination concern incidents in public institutions: 24.35 per cent in education and 
health institutions; 17.3 per cent in executive organs; 10.89 per cent in municipal 
governments; 6.41 per cent in social organizations; and 4.4 per cent in the police.4 The 
Special Rapporteur notes that human rights training for public servants in the executive and 
judicial branches would be vital to enhance the implementation of relevant laws and 
policies, as well as to instil the culture of non-discrimination and tolerance. The 
Government pointed out that it encouraged the adoption of internal rules and procedures 
against racism and racial discrimination in all of its ministries and organs. 
</p>
<p>30. It was stressed during the meetings with State and non-State actors that regional, 
departmental and local governors and city mayors should also be a part of the fight against 
racism and racial discrimination by facilitating compliance with Law No. 045 by all 
relevant authorities and the implementation of the plan of action. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Situation of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Structural discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that progress has been made in recent years in 
the fight against racism and discrimination against indigenous peoples and ensuring their 
inclusion and integration. Still, native indigenous campesino peoples and communities 
continue to suffer from structural inequality and discrimination in access to employment, 
education and health care. Persistent socioeconomic marginalization, poverty and the 
exclusion of native indigenous campesino peoples require more vigorous action from the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>32. Many interlocutors stressed that racial prejudice and negative stereotyping against 
native indigenous campesino peoples and communities remained deeply rooted in various 
parts of society. The Special Rapporteur was particularly alarmed to hear from several 
interlocutors that racism and racial discrimination against indigenous peoples was still 
present even within public institutions.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was informed that important legal provisions had been 
introduced to eliminate racism and racial discrimination within the police. Article 6 of Law 
No. 045 provides for the police to introduce a curriculum on prevention of racism, and Law 
No. 101 of 2011 on disciplinary rules for the Bolivian police establishes a disciplinary 
regime , and identifies relevant forms of misconduct and punishment, including for acts of 
racism by police officers, that range from a fine or suspension to dismissal. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the Police Authority had issued instructions to all its units to 
ensure compliance with Law No. 045. Moreover, a special unit has been set up to receive 
cases of racist crimes. Since 2009, new rules of admission to the police academy have been 
introduced to facilitate the inclusion of people of all races and ethnic or national origins.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Human rights training is also being conducted, while manuals and guidelines for police 
officers have been developed. 
</p>
<p>34. While welcoming such steps, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the 
persistence of racial profiling of native indigenous campesino peoples, Afro-Bolivians, 
migrants and refugees by law enforcement officials, in particular by police officers. Some 
interlocutors, including indigenous peoples, themselves victims, also indicated that police 
investigations on reported racist crimes against indigenous people had been very limited. 
</p>
<p>35. It was reported that the armed forces were in the process of reform to ensure social 
inclusion and equal opportunity by removing the legacy of institutionalized racism of the 
former colonial system. The armed forces have introduced human rights trainings for 
officials and a programme of social inclusion, thereby allowing for the recruitment of 
indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups. During the meetings with the Special 
Rapporteur, it was also noted that the armed forces should play a much bigger role in the 
fight against racism in view of to its broad outreach and potential to educate young people. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to employment, education, health care and other services 
</b></p>
<p>36. Various interlocutors expressed concerns about the situation of indigenous peoples 
and communities in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, a situation mainly characterized by 
precarious health, low education levels, scarce income and a high rate of illiteracy. Such 
unfavourable socioeconomic conditions for the indigenous population are mainly due to the 
consequence of centuries of economic, social and cultural exclusion and discrimination 
based on ethnicity and social class. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
Government had made efforts to eradicate extreme poverty among indigenous peoples and 
communities, particularly in the Amazon area. It was expected that the results of the new 
population census might facilitate a reassessment of the Government&#8217;s priorities with 
</p>
<p>regard to the delivery of basic services.  
</p>
<p>37. Indigenous people are often discriminated against in the area of employment and 
remuneration and face high rates of unemployment. In a report of 2010 on the situation of 
indigenous peoples given to the Special Rapporteur, the Office of the Ombudsman 
estimated that non-indigenous men earn a salary that is 2.9 times higher than that of 
indigenous men, and 3.4 times higher than of indigenous women. The lack of education and 
qualifications further limits their access to jobs. 
</p>
<p>38. It was noted that indigenous peoples faced two challenges in their access to 
education: insufficient access to education facilities, and exclusion of their culture and 
traditions from formal education curricula. It was reported that, although Law No. 1565 on 
Education Reform of 1994 reinforces bilingual and intercultural education, its 
implementation remains weak. Access to formal education for indigenous peoples and 
communities is severely restricted, particularly in rural areas. According to the 2001 census, 
the illiteracy rate for the indigenous population reached 19.61 per cent as against 4.51 per 
cent for the non-indigenous population. Of particular concern is the situation in rural areas, 
where illiteracy rates of indigenous women largely exceeds that of men. The recent 
alphabetization campaign <i>Yo si puedo</i> produced positive outcomes. According to 
information provided by the Ministry of Education, the campaign is expected to slash the 
illiteracy rate for the entire Bolivian population. It is not yet clear, however, how the 
expected reduction will directly benefit indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>39. In the report of the Office of the Ombudsman received by the Special Rapporteur 
(see paragraph 37 above), it was estimated that 80 per cent of the indigenous population 
lacked health facilities in their communities and, where these existed, equipment was old or 
insufficient. The demand for health assistance has become acute in indigenous territories 
owing to significant environmental pollution, lack of access to water and increasing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>exposure to toxic agents as a result of the exploitation of natural resources. Access to health 
services continues to be a major challenge for indigenous peoples and communities, also 
owing to racial discrimination. Reports were received about serious cases of unfair 
treatment by health professionals who denied or delayed medical assistance to indigenous 
persons. Many interlocutors stressed the need to establish a supervisory authority to hear 
complaints on the infringement of the rights of patients, and to elaborate specific 
programmes to raise awareness among medical staff about the situation of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>40. The Government has set new priorities to improve the efficiency, accessibility and 
quality of health services. A national sectoral health plan for 2010-2015 contains important 
provisions on ensuring universal access to health services. It places emphasis on objectives 
of promoting an intercultural health-care system that combines conventional and traditional 
indigenous medicine, provides culturally appropriate health services to underserved rural 
population, and empowers rural and urban communities to participate in decision-making at 
the local, district and municipal levels on issues of health-care provision. 
</p>
<p>41. The economic exclusion of indigenous peoples was an issue often raised during the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings. A great majority of indigenous peoples and communities 
</p>
<p>are still excluded from major sectors of the economy, experiencing discrimination in their 
access to insurance, credit and banking, and communication services, as well as in housing. 
Nevertheless, the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia has been carrying out 
projects for indigenous communities through the Development Fund for the Native 
Indigenous Population and Peasant and Intercultural Communities, whose board is 
composed of indigenous organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Racial violence, access to justice and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was informed that native indigenous campesino peoples 
continue to be subjected to racial discrimination, which is particularly alarming. It was 
reported that, despite considerable progress, the issue of impunity remains a major concern 
in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, particularly with regard to the serious human rights 
violations reported during the incidents of racial violence in 2008. Acts of racism, including 
verbal attacks and physical violence against indigenous residents and representatives, were 
rampant in Sucre in 2007 and 2008 during the sessions of the Constituent Assembly. 
During the racial violence in Sucre in May 2008, some local political opposition members 
and their supporters attacked, harassed and severely humiliated indigenous persons and 
native peasants. In September 2008, in Pando Department, during the national political 
crisis, indigenous people and native peasants were subjected to racial violence as a result of 
which 13 people died, more than 80 were injured and 15 taken hostage. With regard to the 
incidents of racial violence in Pando and Sucre, it was reported that, although perpetrators 
were brought to justice, the trials had been delayed, and no concrete results had been 
reached owing to the cumbersome justice system.  
</p>
<p>43. According to the information received, ill-treatment and discrimination against 
native peasant communities, as well as lack of access to justice and basic services, still 
persist, particularly in Pando Department. Despite the attempts by the Government to 
provide compensation and assistance, many victims of the Pando massacre reportedly have 
not received reparation and medical assistance to help them overcome the physical and 
psychological damage they suffered. Concerns were expressed that some of the victims had 
been subjected to harassment even in the aftermath of the Pando massacre, allegedly by the 
perpetrators or their affiliates. 
</p>
<p>44. The need to create an effective judicial system to deliver justice services and make it 
more responsive to the demands of victims of racism and racial discrimination was stressed 
by representatives of the legislative branch, indigenous peoples and civil society, as well as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>by victims of racism and racial discrimination. Some interlocutors in the judicial branch 
stressed the need for more clarity on the policy for implementation of the plural legal 
system, as well as difficulties posed by the pluri-linguistic nature of society. It was 
recommended that indigenous languages should also be used broadly in the legal system. 
</p>
<p>45. Many victims of racism and racial discrimination and representatives of civil society 
raised concerns about the weak complaints-reporting mechanisms. It was reported that, in 
cases of racism and racial discrimination, most often people do not know where to report 
and are not able to keep track of their complaints. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the work of some organizations and 
human rights defenders in providing counselling and legal assistance to indigenous peoples 
and victims of racism was being negatively affected by lack of support from, and 
sometimes by undue restrictions imposed by, relevant authorities at different levels. 
Representatives of civil society suggested that the State should fully comply with its 
international obligations concerning human rights defenders and adopt a collaborative 
approach with regard to non-governmental organizations and human rights defenders who 
assist indigenous people in defending their rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>47. Many interlocutors pointed to the efforts made by the Government to realize a social 
policy of inclusion, given the fact that native indigenous campesino peoples and 
communities had been excluded from social, economic and political spheres to a significant 
extent as a legacy of the discriminatory policies and practices of colonization. The 
Government has, for example, paid particular attention to advancing a policy of 
decolonization as well as depatriarchalization to enhance women&#8217;s participation, and in 
particular the role of indigenous women, in the new political context in Bolivia. The 
authorities also pointed out that significant advances had been made in enhancing the 
political participation of indigenous peoples who are now represented in executive and 
legislative organs at various levels. 
</p>
<p>48. The national census planned for November 2012 was expected to bring important 
changes to the situation of indigenous people by ensuring the right to self-identification. 
The results of the census should provide important data and statistics about the situation of 
the population of indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other ethnic communities, which 
inform policymaking in all areas of concern such as education, health, employment and 
social welfare. The census is also expected to bring further improvements in the inclusion 
of indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other marginalized communities and groups in 
political, social and economic life. 
</p>
<p>49. Despite the considerable progress made in the promotion of the political inclusion of 
indigenous people, it was noted that much more had to be done in this regard. For instance, 
there were reports that not all indigenous nations and communities were represented in the 
Plurinational Assembly. It was reported that some smaller indigenous communities and 
ethnic groups, such as the Qhara Qhara, had not been provided with the right to self-
identification and to their ancestral territory. 
</p>
<p>50. According to the relevant authorities, major steps had been taken in terms of 
legislation on consultation and autonomy. The Plurinational State Constitution contains 
important provisions on the right to consultation and indigenous autonomy. The 
Government informed the Special Rapporteur a framework law on consultation was being 
discussed; that the Framework Law on Autonomy had been adopted. However, the need to 
strengthen the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to consultation was 
reiterated by some State and non-State interlocutors, in particular in the context of major 
development projects planned or under way in indigenous territories. It was reported that, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>although the Government had been conducting consultations, there was no systematic 
application of the consultation process, and consultations often did not comply with the 
standards set by the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries (Convention No. 169) of the International Labour Organization. It was noted by 
State interlocutors that the practice of conducting a consultative process was still new to 
Bolivian society and was thus a &#8220;work in progress&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Indigenous autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Plurinational State of Bolivia allows for indigenous autonomy and has signed 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and elevated the 
Declaration to the status of law by means of Act No. 3760 of 5 November 2007. The new 
Constitution grants greater self-determination to indigenous groups and communities. 
Framework Law No. 031 on Autonomy and Decentralization Framework, of 19 July 2010 
establishes procedures for indigenous communities that wish to declare their autonomy and 
set up governmental and social structures based on their own identity, culture, norms and 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>52. Many indigenous representatives nonetheless expressed their concern and frustration 
at the difficulties associated with the implementation of the procedures for access to 
indigenous autonomy. They indicated that the process for access to indigenous autonomy 
was prohibitively complex, and that more accessible mechanisms should be created.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Indigenous justice system 
</b></p>
<p>53. The adoption of the new Constitution was a significant breakthrough for indigenous 
justice. The Constitution recognizes indigenous jurisdiction at the same level as ordinary 
jurisdiction, and allows indigenous campesino peoples to administer their own justice on 
the basis of their own principles, cultural values, norms and procedures. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Constitution, indigenous jurisdiction has competence to deal with 
&#8220;cases related to rural native indigenous subjects&#8221;, although it does not define its material 
</p>
<p>and personal scope of application. Law No. 025 on Judicial Authority, adopted in June 
2010, determines the new structure of the judicial system. In addition to restructuring the 
Bolivian courts and creating a greater number of specialized jurisdictions, it creates an 
indigenous justice system, and provides that decisions adopted by indigenous jurisdiction 
are binding upon any authority or person (Law No. 025, art. 162). Law No. 073 on 
Jurisdiction Boundaries, which determines the scope of native indigenous courts and 
coordination and cooperation mechanisms between the indigenous, ordinary and agro-
environmental jurisdictions (art. 5) was adopted on 29 December 2010. 
</p>
<p>55. Various interlocutors from indigenous groups pointed out that article 10 of the Law 
on Jurisdiction Boundaries had a rather limited scope for indigenous jurisdiction, and that 
an increasing number of areas of justice go to the ordinary justice system at the expense of 
the indigenous one. Moreover, it was reported that there was a tendency among State 
authorities and officials to ignore indigenous authorities elected by indigenous tradition and 
that, despite being on an equal footing under the Constitution, in practice ordinary justice is 
often considered superior to indigenous justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Land issues and the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories  
</b></p>
<p>56. The Constitution of 2009 contains important provisions on the distribution and 
ownership of land, the rights of native indigenous campesino peoples to share in the 
benefits of the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories and the right to 
consultation. During the visit, various interlocutors informed the Special Rapporteur about 
existing challenges and the issues relating to the access to and tenure of land, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>consultation process on major extraction and construction projects and the environmental 
and social effects of activities of exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories, 
as well as the distribution of benefits from the exploitation of natural resources to affected 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>57. The right of access to, and tenure of, land, the administration of the land tenure 
system and the procedures involving the regularization, restitution, expropriation and 
distribution of land are regulated by Law No. 3545 on the Extension of Agrarian Reform 
and its regulations adopted in 2006. The reform of the land tenure system, aimed at 
increasing the allocation of land to the entire spectrum of the population, in particular to 
indigenous peoples and native peasants, is still underway. To meet claims to ancestral land 
by indigenous groups and communities, the National Land Reform Institute has enabled the 
adoption of a new category for collective land property, &#8220;tierras comunitarias de origen&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>(native community lands), subsequently called &#8220;territorios ind&#237;genas originarios 
</p>
<p>campesinos&#8221; to bring the native community lands into line with the legal framework of the 
new Constitution by granting indigenous groups exclusive rights over the use of renewable 
resources on their territories. The Government continues its work of identifying fertile land 
that may be allocated to indigenous peoples and peasants. Some, however, criticized that 
granting land titles did not fully address the reality on the ground, given that significant 
areas of fertile land remained in the hands of large landowners. 
</p>
<p>58. Concerns were expressed by various interlocutors at the negative impact of the 
exploitation of natural resources on indigenous peoples and communities, particularly in the 
Andean region.. Exploitation has resulted in environmental pollution of indigenous 
territories and hindered basic subsistence activities, and had a negative impact on the health 
of affected indigenous peoples and farmer communities. The law on hydrocarbons of 2005 
and the &#8220;Reglamento de consulta y participaci&#243;n para actividades des hidrocarbur&#237;feras&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>2007 require respect for the practices and traditions of indigenous communities and 
establish a mechanism for mandatory consultation. Concerns were, however, expressed that 
a large number of concessions for the exploitation of wood and mining exploration to 
private businesses were approved without prior consultation of the indigenous and other 
communities affected. 
</p>
<p>59. It was reported that important steps had been taken to address the above concerns. 
Under the coordination of the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization, the Office of the 
Ombudsman jointly with other relevant institutions have made a number of 
recommendations on the use of natural resources that affect the lives of indigenous peoples 
and communities, highlighting the importance of respect for the right to consultation. A 
framework law on consultation is being drafted in consultation with the Ombudsman and 
indigenous communities. The Agro-Environmental Court was established in January 2012 
to deal with cases relating to land tenure and the protection of the environment and flora, 
fauna and water resources. 
</p>
<p>60. The representatives of indigenous communities recommended that their views and 
the suggestions of affected indigenous peoples and communities should be taken into 
account, and the current process of consultation be reviewed to make it more effective. 
Moreover, they also recommended that contract provisions should be incorporated to 
ensure that affected indigenous peoples and communities receive tangible benefits from 
development projects to be carried out in indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>61. During meetings with various interlocutors from indigenous groups and civil 
society, concerns were raised with regard to the consultation on the issue of the Isiboro 
S&#233;cure Indigenous Territory and National Park, a national park covering 1.2 million 
hectares straddling the southern part of the Beni Department and the northern part of 
Cochabamba. The project of building a road through the national park has been a subject of 
dispute between the indigenous groups living in the area and the Government. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>Representatives of indigenous peoples expressed concerns about the potential negative 
impact of building a road through this ecological reserve, such as the effects on the way of 
life of indigenous people, destruction of forest, and damage to animals and plants, while 
State authorities emphasized the geopolitical and developmental benefits of the project. A 
consultation was organized by the Government with indigenous communities on the 
proposed project, although some reported it was inadequate and decided not to participate. 
Reports were received about the use of excessive force by the police during the indigenous 
march in Chaparina, Beni, in September 2011, as well as of the harassment of indigenous 
leaders during peaceful demonstrations of indigenous peoples who opposed the project. In 
this context, the Government pointed out that the Prosecutor`s Office had launched an 
investigation process to identify those responsible for the use of force during the march. 
The Government has recognized the need for an effective consultation mechanism with the 
indigenous groups affected, and reiterated its commitment to address the underlying 
structure of the problem. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Situation of the Guaran&#237; and other vulnerable indigenous communities 
</b></p>
<p>62. The situation of the Guaran&#237; population, an indigenous group mostly located in the 
eastern Chaco region, was raised during the meetings with various State and non-State 
interlocutors. It was reported that many Guarani families and communities, defined as 
&#8220;captive communities&#8221;, were still subjected to contemporary forms of slavery by 
landowners. According to the national census of 2001, the Guaran&#237; has a population of 
81,011 15 years or older, 71.7 per cent of whom reside in the department of Santa Cruz, 
10.8 per cent in Chuquisaca, 8.4 per cent in Tarija, and the rest in various other 
departments.5 It is estimated that approximately 600 Guaran&#237; families still live in conditions 
of captivity and forced labour on the various estates of the Chaco. 
</p>
<p>63. It was noted that various past and ongoing initiatives taken by successive 
Governments, organizations of indigenous peoples and civil society to eradicate servitude 
and forced labour had not produced sufficient outcomes, despite some progress. According 
to the information received, in the Chaco region, the captive communities &#8211; Guaran&#237; of all 
ages and conditions &#8211; continued to endure degrading treatment and excessive physical 
labour, for negligible pay. Many of them live under the threat of corporal punishment and 
must work to repay debts that the estate owners have forced them to contract. It was 
reported that there was a significant lack of access to justice and few public services in the 
Chaco region. Often, cases of violence against Guaran&#237; people are not duly investigated, 
and the perpetrators (mostly land-owners and their accomplices) are not prosecuted. 
According to the Government, the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization is paying special 
attention to combating impunity in cases of racial discrimination against vulnerable 
indigenous communities. On the recommendation of the Office of the Ombudsman, labour 
contracts with minimum wage level have been introduced to some extent in the Beni and 
Chaco regions, where cases of forced labour and servitude are still common. Complaints 
were received that requests for land submitted by members of the Guaran&#237; people were not 
given due consideration. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur also received information about the situation of the Ayoreo 
people, who are indigenous to the Chaco Boreal, in the border area between Paraguay and 
the Plurinational State of Bolivia. A total of 1,700 Ayoreos are grouped in 10 communities 
located in the provinces of Germ&#225;n Busch and Chiquitos, in the Department of Santa Cruz.

</p>
<p>Slavery in the Bolivian Chaco, 24 December 2009. Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>It was reported that the Ayoreo are isolated and marginalized, and no major policy measure 
has been taken to support their social and economic integration. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Situation of the Afro-Bolivian community 
</b></p>
<p>65. It is estimated that there are 30,000 to 35,000 Afro-descendants in the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, mainly in the Yungas region and in the city of La Paz (department of La 
Paz), but also in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Sucre. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
recognition of Afro-Bolivians as a distinct ethnic and cultural group and their economic, 
social, political and cultural rights as provided for under the Constitution of 2009. He 
remains concerned about the persistent cases of discrimination against Afro-Bolivian 
communities, which as a whole still live in a situation of invisibility and social exclusion, 
and suffer from widespread discrimination, in particular in the fields of education, health 
and employment.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, given that Afro-Bolivian persons were 
not included in the census conducted in 2001, there is a lack of relevant statistics and data 
on how many Afro-Bolivians actually live in the country and the percentage that has access 
to education, health and other public services. As noted above, Afro-Bolivians were 
included in the census in 2012.6 Although the situation of indigenous peoples, communities 
and other ethnic groups has improved, the situation of Afro-Bolivians has remained 
unchanged. It was reported that even in the current plurinational structure of the State, the 
representation of Afro-Bolivians remains too limited, and their voices and views are 
generally not given due consideration. 
</p>
<p>67. Representatives of the Afro-Bolivian community expressed serious concerns that 
many cases of racial discrimination, racist attacks and verbal abuse against Afro-Bolivians 
had not been addressed in accordance with the Law against Racism and All Forms of 
Discrimination (see paragraph 14 above). The Special Rapporteur was informed that a large 
number of Afro-Bolivians still suffered systematically from the lack of justice, reporting 
mechanisms and impartiality of public administration and police officials. He shares the 
concern that, although there has been a significant drop in racist expressions and language 
in the media since the adoption of Law No. 045, racist abuse and attacks against and racial 
profiling of Afro-Bolivians is still prevalent in everyday life contexts &#8211; on the street, in 
workplaces, schools, universities and other public places, and by the police. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Migrants and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>68. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), as at January 2012, a total of 716 refugees and 18 asylum seekers from 20 
countries currently live in the Plurinational State of Bolivia.7 
</p>
<p>69. The new Constitution provides for the right to seek and be granted asylum, and the 
principle of non-refoulement. The Plurinational State of Bolivia enacted its first law on 
refugee law, Law No. 251, on 20 June 2012, which represents a major step in the 
reinforcement of the protection framework of refugees. Until the adoption of the Law, the 
domestic legal instrument on the granting of asylum in the Plurinational State of Bolivia 
was Supreme Decree No. 28.329 of September 2005, which was not in line with 
international standards in key areas of refugee protection. The new law guarantees

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>international standards in procedures for determining refugee status, exclusion clauses and 
documentation. In recent years, capacity-building and training initiatives for the National 
Commission for Refugees, relevant Government officials, border agents and human rights 
institutions have been implemented in collaboration with UNHCR. 
</p>
<p>70. Despite such positive legal and policy measures, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance against refugees 
and migrants, including irregular migrants, persist. According to some interlocutors, 
negative stereotypes of refugees and migrants are deeply entrenched in the general public. 
Refugees and migrants often experience racial discrimination and xenophobia on a regular 
basis, especially in employment, health, housing and education, as well as from the police 
and immigration services. In addition, the media have, on occasion, stigmatized the 
immigrant population, refugees and asylum seekers by stereotyping them as responsible for 
certain types of common crimes reported throughout the country.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Role of the media  
</b></p>
<p>71. Various interlocutors pointed out that some organizations, journalists and media 
outlets have, at times, disseminated racist hate speech and messages of racial superiority, as 
well as racial stereotypes and expressions of hatred against indigenous, original campesino 
peoples and nations and Bolivians of African descent. It was also noted that indigenous, 
original campesino peoples and nations and Bolivians of African descent continue to be 
underrepresented in the media, which also impede their political participation and inclusion, 
given that many media outlets still discriminate against them. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that it is important that the media 
take responsibility in combating racism and racial discrimination, and contribute to 
eradicating the prejudices and stereotypes existing in society and persistent tensions, all of 
obstruct intercultural acceptance and the creation of an inclusive and pluralistic society. 
According to the Government, self-regulation by media outlets has not been sufficiently 
effective in eliminating racist contents and coverage, and progress has been poor in this 
regard. The Government has often called upon mass-media outlets to refrain from 
disseminating offensive expressions based on racial hatred, colour and origin, and is willing 
to enter into dialogue and discussion with media outlets on cases where racist content or 
messages have been disseminated.  
</p>
<p>73. Article 16 of Law No. 045 against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination 
prohibits and criminalizes the dissemination of racist expressions through the media. 
Concerns were expressed by media representatives that these provisions of Law No. 045 
may impede the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression and opinion by leading to 
media censorship. Although some media outlets have undertaken awareness-raising 
programmes about Law No. 045, disseminated messages to promote values of respect and 
equality and devoted a certain amount of coverage to anti-racism programmes, much 
remains to be done in this area. The Government authorities informed the Special 
Rapporteur that measures had been taken to increase the visibility of indigenous peoples in 
audiovisual and print media, and a monitoring system has been established to ensure 
compliance of media outlets with the relevant obligations set out in Law No. 045. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Role of education 
</b></p>
<p>74. The authorities pointed out that important aspects of the new Plurinational State 
Constitution &#8211; respect for indigenous communities, the principle of non-exclusion, the full 
recognition of interculturality and multilinguism &#8211; had been incorporated into the current </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>education system. The national plan of action for human rights of 2008 includes specific 
actions on introducing intercultural and multilingual education, and has provided a 
significant impetus to the adoption of the Education Act No. 070 of December 2010, which 
promotes the process of decolonization of education in Bolivia, as well as the strengthening 
of multiculturalism and multilinguism. In 2008, three intercultural indigenous universities 
were established by Government decision: including Tupac Katari University, an Aymara 
university located in the town of Warisata, near La Paz; Casimiro Huanca University, a 
Quechua university in the central province of Cochabamba; and Apiahuayqui Tupa 
University, a Guarani university in the southern province of Chuquisaca. The universities 
offer various programmes useful for students to apply their knowledge for the development 
of their regions, including high plains agronomy, food and textile industry studies, 
veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, forestry, fishery and hydrocarbons. Furthermore, a 
plurinational institute of languages has been established for the study and standardization of 
the languages of indigenous peoples, and to define linguistic policies. 
</p>
<p>75. It was noted, however, that educational sector reform is still in progress, and much 
needs to be done to ensure that education serves as a major instrument of social inclusion. 
Indigenous peoples, Bolivians of African descent, migrants and other marginalized groups 
continue to experience significant disadvantages in terms of educational outcomes. The 
Ministry of Education aims at delivering different levels of educational services to remote 
areas, in particular to the excluded indigenous communities or to areas where various forms 
of forced labour and servitude still exist. 
</p>
<p>76. During the meetings held with the representatives of indigenous communities and 
Afro-Bolivians, concerns were expressed about the persistence of the legacy of the former 
colonial system, in particular in in public universities, where indigenous peoples and Afro-
Bolivians still face various barriers to access, and the number of students from those 
communities is still very low. The Special Rapporteur shares the concern expressed at the 
reported incidents of racial discrimination against indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivians in 
schools and universities. In some instances, students of indigenous origin are still not able 
to attend universities in their traditional clothing owing to persisting racist attitudes and 
behaviours of other university students.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of legislative, institutional and policy measures 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that the Plurinational State of Bolivia has 
demonstrated strong commitment and made significant progress and achievements 
</b></p>
<p><b>that provide a favourable legal and policy framework for the elimination of racism 
</b></p>
<p><b>and racial discrimination in the country. These include the adoption of the new 
</b></p>
<p><b>Plurinational State Constitution in 2009 and related legal, political and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>reforms that the country has undertaken to build a pluralistic and inclusive society. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the important legislative and policy 
initiatives taken, including the adoption of Law No. 045 against Racism and All Forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Discrimination in 2010 and the development of the State policy against racism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>all forms of discrimination (plan of action for 2012-2015). These steps comply with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Racial Discrimination, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination. The Special Rapporteur would nonetheless like to point out that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>inadequate implementation of these measures and initiatives, mostly owing to </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>insufficient financial and human resources, remains a key challenge. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>connection, he urges the Government to finalize immediately the formal approval of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the plan of action against racism and all forms of discrimination, and to commence 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation by allocating adequate human and financial resources. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that, at the institutional level, important steps 
have been taken, such as the establishment of the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which is also tasked with preventing and eliminating racism, and the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination. He encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to strengthen the capacity of these institutions by ensuring that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided with the human, financial and technical resources necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns expressed about the widespread 
prejudice against and stereotypes of indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians, migrants and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other vulnerable groups and individuals, as well as at the considerable number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents of racism and racial discrimination and persistent tensions and polarization 
</b></p>
<p><b>within Bolivian society. He believes that these factors impede the creation of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive and pluralistic society. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>to enhance its awareness-raising campaigns aimed at combating racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotypes and all existing forms of discrimination, and to continue its programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>to promote intercultural dialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Structural discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the positive steps taken by the Government 
to combat racism and racial discrimination against indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other marginalized groups, and to ensure their inclusion. Indigenous peoples and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afro-Bolivians continue, however, to experience structural discrimination in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to employment, education, health care and other services. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recommends that the Government take relevant measures to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlying structural factors that allow discrimination that leads inequalities in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and that it set concrete equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>targets and monitor their implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>In the light of the serious concerns expressed about the manifestations of 
structural discrimination in a large number of health-care, education and business 
</b></p>
<p><b>services institutions against indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized communities and groups, the Special Rapporteur stresses that a 
</b></p>
<p><b>significant shift in the policies, practices and procedures of the said institutions is 
</b></p>
<p><b>required to address institutional racism and to create inclusive and responsive 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizational cultures. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take specific 
measures to create more accessible and responsive mechanisms to receive and act 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon complaints of unlawful discrimination by both public and private sector actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the basis of ethnicity. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that racial profiling, discriminatory acts, 
prejudices and negative stereotypes against indigenous peoples and communities 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain a reality, also in public institutions, including law-enforcement authorities, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary and the police. He therefore urges the Government to conduct regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>training activities and awareness-raising campaigns, and to apply non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and procedures in public sectors. The Special Rapporteur moreover 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government develop concrete strategies to increase police </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsiveness to the claims and concerns of indigenous and Afro-Bolivian 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities with regard to issues of racism and racial discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Political, economic and social rights of indigenous peoples, Afro-
</b></p>
<p><b>Bolivians and other vulnerable communities and groups 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes the important steps taken by the Government to 
enhance the political participation and representation of indigenous peoples. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages the Government to continue to promote the rights of indigenous peoples in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the political arena. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>While noting the significant advances made in the recognition of Afro-Bolivians 
as a distinct ethnic and cultural group and the granting of economic, social, political 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural rights to Afro-Bolivians under the new Constitution, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recommends that efforts be intensified to promote the political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation and representation of Afro-Bolivians. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the need for the effective implementation of 
the right of indigenous peoples to consultation, particularly in the context of planned 
</b></p>
<p><b>or ongoing development projects in indigenous territories. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>While underlining the considerable advances made in indigenous justice, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take all measures necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the traditional indigenous justice system is fully in line with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights treaties ratified by the Plurinational State of Bolivia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributes to strengthening inclusion and social cohesion within the country. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the national Government, in consultation 
with the representative organizations of indigenous peoples, to identify more 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible mechanisms to realize the aspirations of indigenous peoples to autonomy 
</b></p>
<p><b>and self-determination. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at the structural inequality of 
and discrimination against indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivians, especially in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas of education, health and employment, which persist despite the numerous 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts made by the Government. He recommends that the Government prioritize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>delivery of quality basic services to indigenous peoples and Afro-Bolivian 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, particularly in remote areas, and take far-reaching policy measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve their access to employment and eradicate discriminatory practices in 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment in both the public and private sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur moreover urges both the public and private sectors to 
address the exclusion of a considerable part of native indigenous campesino peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b>from important sectors of the economy, such as insurance, credit and banking, 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication services and housing.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the holding of the national census on 21 
November 2012, which will be an important source of data on the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other ethnic groups and communities. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that disaggregated data on the situation of indigenous peoples, Afro-
</b></p>
<p><b>Bolivians and other ethnic groups and communities collected by the census be utilized 
</b></p>
<p><b>to develop and implement appropriate policies in all areas of concern, such education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>health, social welfare and others.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government consider taking 
special measures or affirmative action to assist or protect disadvantaged groups. In </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>doing so, the Government may consider general recommendation No. 32 on special 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 
</b></p>
<p><b>2009, in which the Committee stated, inter alia, that special measures should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate to the situation to be remedied`. Appraisals of the need of such measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be carried out on the basis of accurate data, disaggregated by race, colour, 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent and ethnic or national origin and incorporating a gender perspective, on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic and cultural status and conditions of the various groups in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>population and their participation in the social and economic development of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country. Special measures should be designed and implemented on the basis of prior 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with affected communities.8 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>With regard to the situation of the Guaran&#237; people and other vulnerable 
indigenous communities, such as the Ayoreos, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Government take appropriate measures in consultation with affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities to address specifically their socioeconomic needs, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>eradicating forced labour, the restitution and clarification of land titles, ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>better access to public and economic services, providing opportunities for employment 
</b></p>
<p><b>and development, and helping in capacity-building. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Racial violence, access to justice and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns about the considerable number of 
incidents of discriminatory practices and acts of racial violence committed against 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other vulnerable groups, and the low level of 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution and sanctions in such cases. He recommends that the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>intensify its efforts and take further measures to eradicate impunity by bringing to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice perpetrators and prosecuting all cases of racial violence and discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly with regard to the incidents in Sucre of May 2008 and the massacre in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Pando of September 2008. He also urges the Government to enhance the provision of 
</b></p>
<p><b>various forms of assistance and medical services to help victims of racial violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>overcome the physical and psychological damage caused by racist incidents. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government intensify its efforts 
to prevent, investigate and prosecute all cases forced labour and servitude, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to justice to the Guaran&#237; people. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Sharing the concern about the widespread impunity for cases of racist attacks 
and verbal abuse, the Special Rapporteur stresses the need to create effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>structures to deliver smooth justice services, and to set up accessible complaints-
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteurs recommends that the Government provide 
appropriate training for judges and prosecutors in handling cases of racism and racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, given that various interlocutors reported that the cases on racism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination have not progressed owing to a lack of expertise and knowledge 
</b></p>
<p><b>of judges and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Situation of migrants and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government enhance its actions 
to address racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance against refugees 
</b></p>
<p>  
 8 CERD/C/GC/32, paras. 16-18. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>and migrants, including irregular migrants. It is important that relevant authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as the police and immigration services, implement the provisions of Refugee Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 251 and of international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that sustained public campaigns and 
initiatives be undertaken to change the social perception and public attitude towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>refugees and migrants. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the media to take responsibility in the fight 
against racism and racial discrimination and in the creation of an inclusive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>pluralistic society, and refrain from reporting racist, stereotypical, stigmatizing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory messages and contents against indigenous peoples, Afro-Bolivians and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other communities. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur recommends the 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening of codes of conducts and regulatory compliance of the media to prohibit 
</b></p>
<p><b>the propagation of racism, racial hatred, xenophobia, racial discrimination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>With regard to the concern expressed by some interlocutors at the 
incompatibility of anti-racism legislation with the protection of freedom of expression, 
</b></p>
<p><b>he emphasizes that the prohibition of the promotion of ideas of racial superiority and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of racist propaganda is compatible with the obligation to protect and respect freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>of expression and opinion in accordance with international human rights law. He, 
</b></p>
<p><b>however, believes that any incompatibility or otherwise of the Law on Racism and All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forms of Discrimination with the obligation to protect freedom of expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinion would need to be determined by the judiciary in accordance with the 
</b></p>
<p>provisions of the Constitution and in accordance with the State&#8217;s obligations under 
</p>
<p><b>international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that media organizations enhance the 
representation of native indigenous campesino peoples and nations, Bolivians of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent and other marginalized groups and communities in the media, 
</b></p>
<p><b>th</b>ereby helping to preserve indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and challenging existing 
</p>
<p><b>stereotypes and narratives that perpetuate racism and racial hatred. In this regard, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government should undertake training programmes on the media and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication to help stereotyped and underrepresented groups and communities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>make better use of powerful media tools in boosting their representation and making 
</b></p>
<p><b>their voices heard.  
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Role of education 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>While noting that such important principles as respect for indigenous 
communities, non-exclusion and the full recognition of intercultural relations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multilinguism are enshrined in the current education system in the Plurinational State 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Bolivia, the Special Rapporteur recalls that special attention should be paid to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>delivery of educational services to excluded indigenous groups and communities. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the persisting barriers to access for 
indigenous peoples to institutions of higher education, and recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government take further action to support the access to education for indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples, Afro-Bolivians and other disadvantaged communities and groups.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that schools and universities develop 
culturally-responsive practices and policies to improve access for and educational 
</b></p>
<p><b>achievements of students from disadvantaged groups and communities. It is vital that 
</b></p>
<p><b>tertiary institutions create a supportive and discrimination-free environment, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>they tailor programmes and initiatives to the specific needs of students from 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged groups and communities.  
</b></p>
<p><b> H. International cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for continued dialogue and cooperation between 
the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and relevant United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and agencies, such as OHCHR and the United Nations country team in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bolivia, other appropriate international organizations and multilateral and bilateral 
</b></p>
<p><b>donors in providing the technical assistance and expertise necessary to facilitate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective implementation of relevant legislation and policy actions in combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that technical cooperation assistance be 
extended in particular to training judges, lawyers, magistrates, police and 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigration officers and other relevant public officials in dealing with issues related 
</b></p>
<p><b>to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the country.
