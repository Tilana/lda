</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced </i>that the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, the integrity of 
</p>
<p>the judicial system and an independent legal profession are essential prerequisites for the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democracy, and for 
</p>
<p>ensuring that there is no discrimination in the administration of justice, and should therefore 
</p>
<p>be respected in all circumstances,

</p>
<p>forms an important basis for strengthening the rule of law through the administration of

<p>justice,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i>, in this regard, the inclusion in sustainable development goal 16, on the

</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the social rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners<b> </b>shall be 
</p>
<p>among the essential aims of the criminal justice system so as to ensure, as far as possible, 
</p>
<p>that offenders are willing and able to lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life upon their 
</p>
<p>return to society, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the importance of the principle that, except for those lawful limitations 
</p>
<p>that are demonstrably necessitated by incarceration, persons deprived of their liberty retain 
</p>
<p>their non-derogable human rights and all other human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>about the negative impact of overincarceration and overcrowding on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, and acknowledging that overincarceration constitutes one of 
</p>
<p>the major underlying causes of overcrowding, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware </i>of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of 
</p>
<p>children, juveniles and women in the administration of justice, in particular while they are 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty, and their vulnerability to violence, abuse, injustice and 
</p>
<p>humiliation, </p>


<p><i>Encouraging </i>continued regional and cross-regional efforts, the sharing of best 
</p>
<p>practices and the provision of technical assistance in the field of juvenile justice,

</p>
<p>decisions concerning the deprivation of liberty and, in particular, that depriving children 
</p>
<p>and juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the 
</p>
<p>shortest appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and the need to ensure that, if 
</p>
<p>they are arrested, detained or imprisoned, children should be separated from adults to the 
</p>
<p>greatest extent feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to be, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that the best interests of the child are an important consideration in 
</p>
<p>all matters concerning the child and related to the sentencing of his or her parents or, where 
</p>
<p>applicable, legal guardians or primary caregivers, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Notes with appreciation </i>the report of the United Nations High Commissioner
