<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the present report, submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/12, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</p>
<p>discusses the implications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) for the 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to life. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur surveys existing applications of ICTs for promoting, 
</p>
<p>protecting and monitoring human rights. While noting the potentially transformative role of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;civilian witnesses&#8221; in documenting human rights violations and the challenges of using the 
</p>
<p>evidence generated and transmitted by those witnesses &#8212; such as verification &#8212;, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur considers how various international human rights mechanisms currently 
</p>
<p>benefit from such material. He makes several recommendations, including that the Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights appoint a specialist in digital 
</p>
<p>evidence to assist it in making the best use of ICTs.

<p><b> I. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur last submitted a report to the General Assembly in October 
</p>
<p>2014. In that report (A/69/265), he focused on four topics relating to the protection of the 
</p>
<p>right to life, namely, the role of regional human rights systems; less lethal and unmanned 
</p>
<p>weapons in law enforcement; resumptions in the application of the death penalty; and the 
</p>
<p>role of statistical indicators. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur submitted his previous report to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>in June 2014. In that report (A/HRC/26/36), he discussed the protection of the right to life 
</p>
<p>during law enforcement and the need to bring domestic laws on the use of lethal force by 
</p>
<p>the police in line with international standards. He also called on the Council to provide the 
</p>
<p>outline of a legal framework on the use of remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones and to 
</p>
<p>remain engaged on the matter of autonomous weapons systems. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur made observations on communications sent between 
</p>
<p>1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015, and on replies received between 1 May 2014 and 30 
</p>
<p>April 2015 (A/HRC/29/37/Add.5).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. From 3 to 7 November 2014, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
</p>

</p>
<p>Rapporteur visited the Gambia  (A/HRC/29/37/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>5. Follow-up reports on missions undertaken by the Special Rapporteur to India and 
</p>
<p>Turkey are contained in A/HRC/29/37/Add.3 and 4, and the mission report to Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea is contained in A/HRC/29/37/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the submission of his previous report to the Human Rights Council, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has sent country visit requests to the Governments of Nigeria, Rwanda, 
</p>
<p>Ukraine and Yemen. He thanks the Governments of the Gambia, Iraq and Yemen for their 
</p>
<p>positive responses to his requests, and encourages the Governments of Egypt, Eritrea, Iran 
</p>
<p>(Islamic Republic of), Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda and Ukraine to accept his requests for a 
</p>
<p>visit. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> II. Use of information and communications technologies 
to secure the right to life  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background</b>2<b> 
</b></p>
<p>35. Given that many of the norms of international law concerning the right to life have 
</p>
<p>broadly been settled, the work relating to protecting this right often concerns disputed facts 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 The Special Rapporteur thanks the Centre of Governance and Human Rights, University of 
</p>
<p>Cambridge, in particular Ella McPherson and Thomas Probert, for their valuable research support. As 
</p>
<p>part of the research, descriptions of many of the applications and projects discussed have been 
</p>
<p>collated and are available from http://ictandhr.tumblr.com/. </p>


<p>or even the availability of facts. Individuals commit violations of the right to life not 
</p>
<p>because they believe it is justifiable, but because they believe they will not be called on to 
</p>
<p>justify themselves. That places a premium on fact-finding and evidence. 
</p>
<p>36. Because of the expertise that fact-finding requires, the development of human rights 
</p>
<p>methodologies has hitherto gone hand in hand with the professionalization of human 
</p>
<p>rights.3 It has evolved over what has been characterized as three generations of 
</p>
<p>communities involved in international human rights monitoring, each with its own 
</p>
<p>methods. First, there was the systematic review of available information by a distinguished 
</p>
<p>group of lawyers on behalf of intergovernmental organizations; second, came the fact-
</p>
<p>finding revolution, led by large international human rights non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>(NGOs), that dramatically broadened the field but remained attached to witness 
</p>
<p>interviewing, which offers first-hand and very detailed accounting, but which can be very 
</p>
<p>time consuming and vulnerable to interference and selection biases. Over time, the 
</p>
<p>methodology of the second generation was incorporated into the practices of the first 
</p>
<p>generation, including the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. Now, however, 
</p>
<p>the field is being transformed again by a diverse and growing array of digitally enabled 
</p>
<p>actors &#8212; the third generation &#8212;, including witnesses, monitors and activists, characterized 
</p>
<p>by greater flexibility of fact-finding methodology and output.4 Each generation has 
</p>
<p>broadened the base of those who participate in human rights investigations. No generation 
</p>
<p>has invalidated earlier work, but it is important that each is able to draw on the strengths of 
</p>
<p>the others without compromising its own capacities.  
</p>
<p>37. It has become clear that information and communications technologies (ICTs) &#8212; the 
</p>
<p>hardware and software that facilitate the production, transmission, reception, archiving and 
</p>
<p>storage of information &#8212; can play an increasing role in the protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the right to life. Information harnessed in this way can be used to secure 
</p>
<p>accountability, but the technology can also ensure visibility or mobilize support for persons 
</p>
<p>in immediate danger. 
</p>
<p>38. In his daily work of identifying and assessing claims about unlawful killings, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, like many others in the field, is increasingly dependent on information 
</p>
<p>mediated through technology. See, for example, the use of video material taken with cell 
</p>
<p>phones during the civil war in Sri Lanka to press both the State and the international 
</p>
<p>community for fuller investigation of the widespread violations of many human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the right to life, alleged to have occurred (A/HRC/17/28/Add.1). Similarly, in 
</p>
<p>preparing the report to the Human Rights Council on the safety of journalists, it became 
</p>
<p>clear how salient citizen journalists and civic media had become through their use of 
</p>
<p>technology to highlight and document violations around the world (A/HRC/20/22 and 
</p>
<p>Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>39. Increasing digital capacity is greatly enhancing the ability of ordinary people to 
</p>
<p>participate in human rights monitoring. Digital ICTs create opportunities for pluralism that 
</p>
<p>can democratize the process of human rights fact-finding, as well as offer mechanisms of 
</p>
<p>social accountability that citizens can use to hold States and others to account.5 Social 
</p>
<p>media have created a wealth of opportunities for civilians to highlight human rights 
</p>
<p>violations that they have witnessed, often unmediated by formal intergovernmental or non-
</p>
<p>governmental structures. This has far-reaching implications for the established power

<p>relations in human rights monitoring as there is a much wider community of human rights 
</p>
<p>monitors at work than ever before. It also presents opportunities in contexts that might 
</p>
<p>otherwise be closed to scrutiny. In circumstances where the physical presence of human 
</p>
<p>rights investigators can be a challenge, the sensitive use of ICTs can help to avoid 
</p>
<p>information austerity about situations that are of great interest to the human rights 
</p>
<p>community. 
</p>
<p>40. However, the development of ICTs should not be viewed as an unqualified good in 
</p>
<p>terms of the protection of human rights. Opportunities for States to carry out surveillance 
</p>
<p>on and interfere in the work of civil society have multiplied in the digital space, and the 
</p>
<p>Council should be vigilant concerning the dangers as well as the affordances of ICTs.6 The 
</p>
<p>use of technology by human rights activists and others can expose them to a range of risks, 
</p>
<p>of which many may not be aware.  
</p>
<p>41. In order to fully realize the potential of ICTs for human rights work, it is necessary 
</p>
<p>to address the issue of the digital divide in terms of both access and literacy. On the one 
</p>
<p>hand, ICTs facilitate pluralism within human rights work, allowing amateurs to 
</p>
<p>complement professionals; on the other hand, however, they can create new lines of 
</p>
<p>inclusion and exclusion that often correspond with pre-existing barriers to access to 
</p>
<p>resources and power, such as language, education, affluence or gender.7 Moreover, in 
</p>
<p>addition to providing opportunities to speak, pluralism is also about being heard. Being 
</p>
<p>heard by human rights fact-finders may depend on one&#8217;s ability to produce verifiable 
</p>
<p>information, which can in turn be determined by one&#8217;s digital literacy and digital footprint.8 
</p>
<p>The greater availability of digital information on human rights violations in one context or 
</p>
<p>region may lead to such violations being prioritized over more egregious but less visible 
</p>
<p>violations elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>42. It is clear that, if used sensibly, ICTs can enhance the protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the right to life. Various parts of the wider United Nations system have been 
</p>
<p>investing significant time and resources into accommodating the affordances of ICTs into 
</p>
<p>their methods of work. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the 
</p>
<p>Department of Peacekeeping Operations have been developing advanced techniques for 
</p>
<p>crisis monitoring and mapping. The International Criminal Court has undertaken a review 
</p>
<p>into the way it handles digital evidence. Nonetheless, it still seems that the full potential of 
</p>
<p>these new tools has not been systematically investigated and internalized by the human 
</p>
<p>rights community (see A/65/321, paras. 3&#8211;10). 
</p>
<p>43. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur considers how ICTs present, in 
</p>
<p>particular, opportunities and challenges for the core modalities of human rights work, that 
</p>
<p>is, promotion, protection and monitoring or fact-finding to ensure accountability should a 
</p>
<p>violation occur. Although the impact of ICTs and social media on advocacy spaces has 
</p>
<p>been explored elsewhere, it will be briefly discussed here, as will the role of technology in 
</p>
<p>facilitating physical protection and the necessary security measures for safety in a digital 
</p>
<p>environment, which are both significant from the perspective of the mandate. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will then address the question of using ICTs to collect information concerning 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6  The Special Rapporteur notes that, at its twenty-eighth session, the Human Rights Council decided to 
</p>
<p>appoint a special rapporteur on the right to privacy in the digital age.

<p>violations, which can foster accountability, exploring the challenges faced, including the 
</p>
<p>challenge of verification. Finally, the Special Rapporteur will consider the extent to which 
</p>
<p>digital evidence is currently used within parts of the international human rights machinery. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promotion and advocacy 
</b></p>
<p>44. Greater capabilities for information sharing and communication present obvious and 
</p>
<p>now widely used opportunities to disseminate information about human rights, either 
</p>
<p>generally, as education, or as more focused advocacy in support of legislative or policy 
</p>
<p>changes, or calling for investigation or accountability concerning individual cases. Human 
</p>
<p>rights organizations can supplement traditional communication strategies using mainstream 
</p>
<p>media, by targeting the public directly. 
</p>
<p>45. Websites, for example, are used by intergovernmental and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, as well as States, to make information about human rights norms or legal 
</p>
<p>standards available to the widest possible audience. In previous reports, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur underlined the importance of clear and publicly available legal frameworks for 
</p>
<p>preventing arbitrary killings through the use of force or the application of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/36 and A/67/275).9 ICTs clearly enable States to be more transparent towards 
</p>
<p>their populations and the international community. 
</p>
<p>46. In addition to providing information digitally, many human rights organizations 
</p>
<p>have developed expertise in using social media quickly and directly to engage members of 
</p>
<p>the public. ICTs may create new educational opportunities that foster environments 
</p>
<p>supportive of human rights. In Kenya, the PeaceTXT initiative sent peace-promoting text 
</p>
<p>messages to registered subscribers with the aim of de-escalating potential conflicts. 
</p>
<p>Elsewhere, NGOs have used secret filming to expose extreme cases of bigotry and 
</p>
<p>harassment in order to sensitize public.10  
</p>
<p>47. Digital ICTs can thus facilitate the widespread visibility of human rights, at least 
</p>
<p>among those connected through social media. Applications such as AiCandle or Pocket 
</p>
<p>Protest allow users to sign petitions, write e-mails or receive human rights information 
</p>
<p>using their mobile or smartphones and are particularly useful for urgent mobilizations.11 
</p>
<p>Messages can also be amplified using platforms such as Thunderclap. Ultimately, such 
</p>
<p>strategies can succeed in getting a case or issue on the public agenda.12  
</p>
<p>48. Questions remain as to whether these affordances are markedly changing advocacy 
</p>
<p>dynamics for the better. Campaigns compete for attention in an ever-proliferating 
</p>
<p>information context and are accessible &#8212; at least in the first instance &#8212; only to the 
</p>
<p>digitally literate.13 Meanwhile, the brevity of the messages and real-time culture of Twitter 
</p>
<p>may preclude or simplify coverage of complicated situations and the drivers of virality can

<p>sit uneasily with human rights evidence.14 Social networks are effective at increasing 
</p>
<p>participation, in part because they lessen the motivation that participation requires, which 
</p>
<p>can lead to shallow or fickle forms of activism (so-called &#8220;clicktivism&#8221;).15 However, some 
</p>
<p>have argued that such seemingly insignificant moves are significant in their accumulation, 
</p>
<p>demonstrating a &#8220;supportive environment&#8221; and &#8220;drawing awareness&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p><b> C. Prevention and protection 
</b></p>
<p>49. ICTs can contribute to the prevention of violations of the right to life, by State or 
</p>
<p>non-State actors, in a variety of ways. First of all, alert applications can provide physical 
</p>
<p>and digital protection to potentially vulnerable groups, including human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>While that enables networks to take advantage of digital connectivity, the very same 
</p>
<p>connectivity is a risk for those vulnerable to digital snooping or other forms of surveillance. 
</p>
<p>Secondly, there is need for education on digital security and safety. Surveillance can, 
</p>
<p>however, also be a preventive mechanism, and tactics ranging from live-streaming 
</p>
<p>demonstrations or police operations to using satellite imagery will be discussed below.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Alert applications 
</b></p>
<p>50. Various organizations are developing alert applications that activists, journalists and 
</p>
<p>others can use to send a signal that they are in danger. For example, Amnesty International  
</p>
<p>developed a &#8220;panic button&#8221; application &#8212; disguised as an ordinary utility &#8212; that allows 
</p>
<p>users secretly to activate an alarm by sending a text message, and, optionally, geolocation 
</p>
<p>data, that can be sent to pre-selected contacts by rapidly pressing the power button of the 
</p>
<p>phone. When activists or journalists are attacked or detained, their phones are often taken 
</p>
<p>for the lists of contacts they store. The hidden application will continue to broadcast alerts, 
</p>
<p>which are not only calls for help but also warnings to the person&#8217;s contacts that they should 
</p>
<p>take security precautions themselves.17 Other applications or devices have been developed 
</p>
<p>with the same objective.18 
</p>
<p>51. Such applications respond to the challenges posed by a lack of information and time 
</p>
<p>lags, which can restrict efforts to protect individuals at risk. Practitioners believe that there 
</p>
<p>is an approximately 48-hour window after an individual is detained or threatened during 
</p>
<p>which a large-scale response is most likely to have the greatest effect. There are numerous 
</p>
<p>examples  worldwide in which mass response to detention &#8212; coordinated using social 
</p>
<p>media or otherwise &#8212; has persuaded authorities to recalculate the merits of keeping an 
</p>
<p>individual in custody.  
</p>
<p>52. The new technologies thus fit into wider and long-standing strategies of 
</p>
<p>communicating with a trusted network when at risk and mobilizing a wide community to 
</p>
<p>respond vocally or visibly to an arbitrary act against an individual. It is important, however, 
</p>
<p>to bear in mind the potential risks of such technology which could become the basis of 
</p>
<p>identification and targeting.

<p><b> 2. Importance of digital security 
</b></p>
<p>53. While they provide additional capabilities for those working on human rights issues, 
</p>
<p>ICTs can present a number of additional risks, and to mitigate those risks, persons 
</p>
<p>potentially at risk of violations, including human rights defenders, should take the 
</p>
<p>requirements of digital security seriously. Digital security can include software to scan 
</p>
<p>computers for spyware, resources such as Security in-a-Box, as well as digital security 
</p>
<p>helplines or forums.19 
</p>
<p>54. Activists can communicate more securely using virtual private networks, encryption 
</p>
<p>programmes or Tor, a browser designed to increase the anonymity of Internet users. 
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, developers and trainers should caution users that full privacy and anonymity 
</p>
<p>online is never guaranteed. The risk of digital insecurity should also be weighed by larger 
</p>
<p>international human rights actors, both intergovernmental and non-governmental, with 
</p>
<p>regard to their interactions with smaller organizations or individuals. 
</p>
<p>55. Evaluating the merits and demerits of secure digital encryption does not fall squarely 
</p>
<p>within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. However, it is certainly a complex issue, 
</p>
<p>with the demands of human rights investigation pulling in both directions, that becomes an 
</p>
<p>issue of concern to this mandate holder when digital insecurity leads directly to 
</p>
<p>victimization, including the threats or actual commission of extrajudicial killings. The use 
</p>
<p>of mainstream social media platforms to share human rights information can pose security 
</p>
<p>risks both for &#8220;civilian witnesses&#8221; and their subjects. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Monitoring for protection 
</b></p>
<p>56. The proliferation of surveillance and recording afforded by ICTs not only greatly 
</p>
<p>enhances the opportunities to hold individuals to account, as will be discussed below, but 
</p>
<p>can also prevent the commission of violations. Awareness of surveillance can have a 
</p>
<p>significant deterrent effect if coupled with credible accountability regimes, as demonstrated 
</p>
<p>by the use of closed-circuit television surveillance to deter crime. Belief in this deterrent 
</p>
<p>effect is so strong that some activists have been known to pretend to film events, even 
</p>
<p>though their phone battery was dead, as a strategy against abduction or arrest.20  
</p>
<p>57. Perhaps the most directly applicable example of this, and one that addresses a core 
</p>
<p>interest of the Special Rapporteur &#8212; the excessive use of force by law enforcement &#8212; is 
</p>
<p>the use of body-worn cameras by police officers. A recent study of the use of such 
</p>
<p>technology in California, United States, found that officers&#8217; use of force dropped by 59 per 
</p>
<p>cent on the introduction of the cameras, and complaints concerning excessive force dropped 
</p>
<p>by nearly 90 per cent.21 Other trial projects, involving the use of smartphones as body-worn 
</p>
<p>cameras that transmit video, audio and geolocation information, are being run in Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Kenya and South Africa.22

</p>
<p>Smart Policing initiative, http://en.igarape.org.br/smart-policing/. </p>


<p>58. Just as the preventive impact of closed-circuit television works best where there is 
</p>
<p>cognition of its presence, some argue that body-worn cameras deter violations because of 
</p>
<p>their institutionalized use, whereby the police must issue a warning that incidents are being 
</p>
<p>recorded, which creates cognition of surveillance among both police and civilians.23 
</p>
<p>59. Concerns exist around possible violations of the right to privacy that body-worn 
</p>
<p>cameras may generate, leading to suggestions that they be turned off upon entering a home 
</p>
<p>or when speaking with victims. Others consider that individual officers should not have 
</p>
<p>control over their cameras, so as to reduce opportunities for selective documentation.24 
</p>
<p>Concerns also exist with respect to access to and secure storage of the footage. Although 
</p>
<p>questions remain to be answered, many feel that the deterrent effect of police body-worn 
</p>
<p>cameras warrants further deployment.25 Linked with the potential advantages of the police 
</p>
<p>recording themselves is the equally important protection of citizens&#8217; right to record the 
</p>
<p>police. 
</p>
<p>60. If body-worn cameras bring surveillance to the micro level of interpersonal 
</p>
<p>interactions, at the opposite end of the spectrum is the surveillance potential of remote 
</p>
<p>sensing imagery, either from satellites or drones. Initiatives such as the Satellite Sentinels 
</p>
<p>Project and Amnesty International&#8217;s Eyes on Darfur campaign have highlighted the 
</p>
<p>possibilities of such mechanisms. Raising awareness among potential perpetrators that 
</p>
<p>vulnerable areas are being watched could deter violations, or at least those that are visible 
</p>
<p>remotely.26 However, such surveillance is expensive and can involve rather arbitrary 
</p>
<p>decisions about which communities or places to monitor. As with other surveillance 
</p>
<p>methods, the deterrent effect of the technology is connected to both awareness of its 
</p>
<p>existence (making the accompanying media campaign significant) and the credible threat of 
</p>
<p>punitive measures.27  
</p>
<p>61. Those surveillance methods use the threat of accountability in the future to condition 
</p>
<p>behaviour in the present. It is potentially also possible to exploit the capacities of ICTs to 
</p>
<p>use information from the (recent) past to influence what happens in the present. Social 
</p>
<p>media analysis could predict hotspots of human rights violations in real time. For example, 
</p>
<p>the Hatebase database collects data on the vocabulary and incidence of hate speech on 
</p>
<p>social media based on the correlation between hate speech and the risk of genocide and is 
</p>
<p>used to predict regional violence.28  
</p>
<p>62. There are limitations, however, to the possibilities of ICTs as early warning systems. 
</p>
<p>Although &#8220;big data mining&#8221;, i.e. collecting large amounts of data, has a record of being 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 The effect of cognition of surveillance was perhaps most memorably elaborated by Jeremy Bentham, 
</p>
<p>but its criminological effects, as well as its potential dangers, have not been technologically realized 
</p>
<p>until recently.

<p>good for conflict prediction and prevention, it has been less effective for analysis and 
</p>
<p>actionable transmission.29  
</p>
<p>63. Big data mining and remote sensing work for the prevention of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations also raises methodological and ethical concerns. For example, vulnerable 
</p>
<p>populations could be put at risk by the remote documentation, and thus identification, of 
</p>
<p>their locations and situations.30 Moreover, potential inaccuracies in the statistical analysis of 
</p>
<p>human rights data arise from selection bias, duplication and constraints on data capture.31  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Towards digital due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>64. The application of surveillance to prevent violations of human rights may be so 
</p>
<p>effective as to imply that States with the capacity to take advantage of them have a 
</p>
<p>responsibility to do so. Cameras have been used in police vehicles and interrogation rooms 
</p>
<p>and consideration might be given to other contexts in which such surveillance could have a 
</p>
<p>preventive effect (for example, prisons), subject to the limitations imposed by other rights, 
</p>
<p>such as the right to privacy.  
</p>
<p>65. Other affordances of ICTs can be harnessed by States to fulfil their responsibilities 
</p>
<p>concerning prevention or precaution. For example, there have been instances of States 
</p>
<p>using text messages or calls to warn civilian populations before launching air raids. The 
</p>
<p>recording devices on certain advanced weaponry offer the potential for greater oversight, 
</p>
<p>but that will require more transparency. 
</p>
<p>66. In the digital space, however, the responsibility of due diligence extends beyond 
</p>
<p>States. Human rights monitoring organizations &#8212; both intergovernmental and non-
</p>
<p>governmental &#8212; need to give thought to the consequences of their correspondence or use 
</p>
<p>of information. Traditional understandings of &#8220;informed consent&#8221; may need to be revisited. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Monitoring and fact-finding 
</b></p>
<p>67. As noted above, the particular nature of violations of relevance to this mandate place 
</p>
<p>a premium on fact-finding. Human rights organizations have developed rigorous fact-
</p>
<p>finding methodologies, not least to protect the credibility of their evidence, and thus their 
</p>
<p>reputations. ICTs and the user-generated content they facilitate have broadened and 
</p>
<p>democratized the process of fact-finding by empowering both spontaneous and solicited 
</p>
<p>&#8220;civilian witnesses.&#8221; The most challenging dimension of this evolution is balancing 
</p>
<p>democratization with a continued, perhaps heightened, requirement for authority and thus 
</p>
<p>for verification of digital evidence. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Civilian witnesses and video evidence 
</b></p>
<p>68. The advantages of video evidence have been appreciated by campaigners for several 
</p>
<p>decades, at least since the Rodney King incident in the early 1990s. The re-purposing of 
</p>
<p>private closed-circuit television footage for public investigations has become

</p>
<p> 30 See, for example, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, &#8220;The Signal Program on Human Security and

<p>commonplace.32 At the international level, the conviction by the International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court of Thomas Lubanga, which admitted video footage of interviews of child soldiers 
</p>
<p>who had been impressed into his militia, proved that video recordings could be used to fill 
</p>
<p>an evidentiary gap.33 Of course, it is not only witnesses or subjects of violations who are 
</p>
<p>producing such information, but also perpetrators. Moreover, information does not have to 
</p>
<p>be shared publicly for it to be useful to human rights investigations. 
</p>
<p>69. While information from civilian witnesses has long been a cornerstone of human 
</p>
<p>rights fact-finding, it has traditionally been gathered by professionals. Either professionals 
</p>
<p>or their trusted contacts would be present during the production and transmission of 
</p>
<p>information from witness to fact-finder during an interview, for example. ICTs enable 
</p>
<p>civilian witnesses autonomously to produce and transmit information.  
</p>
<p>70. At its most spontaneous, civilian witnessing can occur through widely available 
</p>
<p>consumer tools or platforms. The ubiquity of smartphones enables the capture of visual and 
</p>
<p>auditory information, which can be easily transmitted through digital channels such as 
</p>
<p>social media platforms. The benefit of those production and transmission strategies is that 
</p>
<p>they do not require any particular expertise; the drawback is that they may limit the 
</p>
<p>metadata (such as source, place and time of production) which could be instrumental to 
</p>
<p>verifying the information. Alternatively, applications such as InformaCam and EyeWitness 
</p>
<p>are specifically designed to enhance the metadata supplied with photographic or video 
</p>
<p>information and to maintain the chain of custody.34  
</p>
<p>71. A number of NGOs are already offering training courses to citizen witnesses and 
</p>
<p>trainers on how to produce and transmit material with stronger evidentiary value. 
</p>
<p>WITNESS, Amnesty International, Tactical Tech and the Open Society Justice Initiative 
</p>
<p>are all conducting such activities on a global or regional scale. The training may concern 
</p>
<p>both personal protection issues, such as those concerning digital security, discussed above, 
</p>
<p>and practical information about the kind of detail to capture in witness videos (such as 
</p>
<p>licence plates, uniform numbers or landmarks) and how to share them.35  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Crowdsourcing information 
</b></p>
<p>72. Somewhere between the traditional methods of soliciting information from civilian 
</p>
<p>witnesses and the spontaneous production and transmission of information by civilian 
</p>
<p>witnesses are the practices of crowdsourcing and crowdseeding. Crowdsourcing involves 
</p>
<p>turning over tasks to a large, unspecified group recruited through an open call but that is not 
</p>
<p>necessarily representative, as such calls privilege the participation of those with resources 
</p>
<p>such as technology, money and time. Crowdseeding is a form of bounded crowdsourcing 
</p>
<p>whereby participants can be randomly sampled for representativeness and equipped with 
</p>
<p>the technology and resources necessary for gathering information. A relationship develops 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>over time between chosen witnesses and the project, with the credibility and trust that such 
</p>
<p>a relationship entails.36 
</p>
<p>73. Besides potentially widening the scope of human rights work, involving civilian 
</p>
<p>witnesses as a crowd could strengthen the effect of human rights advocacy through greater 
</p>
<p>participation and awareness as well as potential corroboration.37 However, there are risks. 
</p>
<p>By publicly mapping information, crowds may jeopardize vulnerable populations. The 
</p>
<p>techniques may also be used against the human rights community, for example to perform 
</p>
<p>&#8220;human intelligence tasks&#8221; such as matching faces to photographs of protests.38 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Satellite evidence 
</b></p>
<p>74. Satellite footage can have a transformative impact on human rights work. Central to 
</p>
<p>the deterrent effect of satellites is the knowledge that, should a violation occur, somebody is 
</p>
<p>going to use the footage to expose it. For example, earlier this year, fact-finders at Amnesty 
</p>
<p>International and Human Rights Watch undertook &#8220;change detection&#8221; analysis of satellite 
</p>
<p>images of two towns in north-eastern Nigeria that revealed extensive fire damage. The 
</p>
<p>information was cross-referenced with eyewitness testimonies to establish that the fires 
</p>
<p>were part of militant attacks in which hundreds were killed. Although that linking was 
</p>
<p>important because, on their own, satellite images do little to establish culpability and 
</p>
<p>causality, the case highlights the benefits of remote sensing for hard-to-reach areas.39 
</p>
<p>75. Satellite evidence can be combined with other digital processes, such as social media 
</p>
<p>mapping, in order to better convey information. Reports on the origins of missile or artillery 
</p>
<p>attacks or the impacts of drone strikes have relied on satellite photography.40 
</p>
<p>76. At present, much of the satellite imagery relied on for human rights work is owned 
by commercial operators. This means that, for satellite imagery to be available, there must 
</p>
<p>be a commercial interest in the area and no cloud cover; also, the imagery will tend to be of 
</p>
<p>low resolution. Military-grade satellite imagery has broader coverage and higher resolution, 
</p>
<p>but there is often a reluctance to share information (rather than classified imagery itself) 
</p>
<p>with human rights investigators, even when national security is not at stake.

<p>77. The flood of information from civilian witnesses can only have evidentiary potential 
</p>
<p>if the information can be gathered and evaluated. It is therefore important that human rights

<p>and analysis, especially given the importance of reporting credibility. However, evaluating 
</p>
<p>digital content produced by civilian witnesses can be a challenge, including with regard to 
</p>
<p>the identification of relevant information, and verification and storage of that information. 
</p>
<p>Technological developments as well as initiatives in information evaluation practices may 
</p>
<p>help to address those challenges. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Problem of volume 
</b></p>
<p>78. The proliferation of digitally produced and transmitted civilian witness information 
</p>
<p>means that identifying relevant information can be an overwhelming task. Using networks 
</p>
<p>to crowdsource the filtering process can be an intermediary step, but it will likely be 
</p>
<p>necessary to harness the analytical affordances of digital ICTs to address their own &#8220;signal-
</p>
<p>to-noise ratio&#8221; problem. One way is through the automated cleansing of large datasets of 
</p>
<p>potentially relevant information. For example, CrisisNET aims to collect and standardize 
</p>
<p>real-time digital crisis data from thousands of sources so that researchers can search quickly 
</p>
<p>and efficiently.41 Although machines cannot replace human expertise in the evaluation of 
</p>
<p>human rights information &#8212; for assessing the relevance of information for evidence is an 
</p>
<p>ultimately subjective task &#8212;, technology can help human rights monitors to concentrate on 
</p>
<p>the most important material. More research is needed in this regard. 
</p>
<p>79. There will probably always be a need to curate digital content for monitoring and 
</p>
<p>consumption by a wide audience of interested parties. Such curation will involve a 
</p>
<p>combination of automation and traditional fact-finding or verification skills. One successful 
</p>
<p>model is the WITNESS Human Rights Channel, which uses material that is verified in 
</p>
<p>partnership with the social media news agency Storyful.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Problem of transience 
</b></p>
<p>80. Because much of the material of relevance to human rights investigations could be 
</p>
<p>online for only a very limited time (owing to pressures either on the uploader or the 
</p>
<p>platform not to host content of a certain type),42 it is important that investigators have the 
</p>
<p>capacity to capture all the information that might be needed and to store it securely. The 
</p>
<p>development of guidelines for national investigators as well as human rights monitors 
</p>
<p>should be a priority.43 
</p>
<p>81. The storage of material for human rights investigations can be a security risk for 
</p>
<p>activists. Applications such as Eyewitness and International Evidence Locker have been 
</p>
<p>designed to allow witnesses to upload evidence to a cloud-based repository and to use or 
</p>
<p>delete it as best suits their circumstances. Those applications also allow secure transmission 
</p>
<p>of information to target audiences while maintaining the metadata of the information as 
</p>
<p>well as the information itself. Nonetheless, collaboration between investigators and 
</p>
<p>technology corporations will remain a vital consideration.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Problem of verification 
</b></p>
<p>82. Although sometimes raised as a major impediment to the embrace of digital 
</p>
<p>evidence, verification is not a new issue: it concerns the conventional institutional need to 
</p>
<p>establish the credibility of a source and the accuracy of its information before acting on or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 41 See http://crisis.net/about/.

</i></p>
<p><i>Media &amp; Society</i>, vol. 19, (2014), http://arabmediasociety.com/?article=844. 
</p>
<p> 43 Resources exist to guide activists concerning the archiving of their material, for example, see 
</p>
<p>http://archiveguide.witness.org/. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is 
</p>
<p>currently finalizing guidelines for investigators. </p>


<p>staking one&#8217;s reputation to a claim. While the nature of the information being verified and 
</p>
<p>the specific techniques are shifting rapidly as ICTs evolve, the fundamentals of verification 
</p>
<p>remain constant: identifying and corroborating the content and provenance of information 
</p>
<p>received. 
</p>
<p>83. Verification usually involves checking the origin, source, time and place of the 
</p>
<p>information in question, as well as the chain of custody. Fact-finders must take time to 
</p>
<p>establish the identity of the source, assess the file for metadata indicators, then cross-
</p>
<p>reference those with other sources. A new set of methods, often referred to as information 
</p>
<p>forensics, is emerging, but many elements of the process still require human expertise and 
</p>
<p>painstaking checks, akin to old-fashioned investigation. 
</p>
<p>84. The witness may provide information concerning the time, place and content in an 
</p>
<p>interview, or, alternatively, may include that information in the file. The former method 
</p>
<p>underlines the importance of cross-fertilization between the methodology of the second and 
</p>
<p>third generations of fact-finding and the extent to which the sources of one can bolster the 
</p>
<p>authority of the other, while the latter can occur either during the production process, for 
</p>
<p>example by verbalizing the location and date, or through the transmission process. The 
</p>
<p>information may also be evident through physical landmarks (such as road signs or 
</p>
<p>geological features), weather conditions, clothing, weapons or dialect captured in the digital 
</p>
<p>file, or it may also be identified through the metadata automatically embedded in the file, 
</p>
<p>such as the time stamp. That information can be corroborated and cross-referenced against 
</p>
<p>other digital files and evidence, including satellite images. Several videos of the same 
</p>
<p>incident can be time synced so as to provide a multiperspective video timeline.44  
</p>
<p>85. Recognition of the need for expertise concerning digital verification is growing. The 
</p>
<p>more knowledge about information forensics that human rights fact-finders have, the more 
</p>
<p>comfortably and quickly they will be able to use digital information from civilian 
</p>
<p>witnesses. The <i>Verification Handbook</i>, published in 2014, quickly became a reference point 
</p>
<p>for humanitarians and human rights fact-finders.45  
</p>
<p>86. Increasing verification knowledge among civilian witnesses is likely to ease the 
</p>
<p>verification process. WITNESS, for example, provides a guide on what information to 
</p>
<p>include in videos documenting human rights violations.46  
</p>
<p>87. Another strategy to facilitate verification is through initiatives that support either the 
</p>
<p>provision of information for verification or the evaluation of that information. Such 
</p>
<p>initiatives have been referred to as &#8220;verification subsidies&#8221; and may incorporate human 
</p>
<p>participation or designed technologies.47 Applications such as InformaCam automate the 
</p>
<p>addition of verification cues at production and prompt their inclusion during transmission. 
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the power of the crowd can be used retrospectively, as is done, for example, 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>allows for collaborative and transparent verification among members of a bounded crowd.  
</p>
<p>88. While the technical difficulty of verification should not be exaggerated, its 
</p>
<p>importance cannot be overstated. If used by a human rights organization, unverified 
</p>
<p>material can lead to the degradation of the organization&#8217;s credibility, but hoaxes can also 
</p>
<p>create combustible situations &#8212; so-called &#8220;digital wildfires&#8221; &#8212; that can lead to violence.49 
</p>
<p>Many States already have laws limiting freedom of expression for reasons such as 
</p>
<p>incitement of violence or panic, but they are struggling with how to apply those laws 
</p>
<p>effectively to online activities. Any regulation in that area will remain complex and 
</p>
<p>controversial; it has been suggested that the online community itself must fill the gap, with 
</p>
<p>important roles for community curators and moderators.50 The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</p>
<p>reported to the Human Rights Council in 2014 on the complex challenges for his mandate 
</p>
<p>posed by the Internet and social media (A/HRC/26/49). In addition to pointing out policies 
</p>
<p>developed by some of the major social media sites, he also highlighted the importance of 
</p>
<p>civil society initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Using digital evidence 
</b></p>
<p>89. Most of the information that can be captured through the streams described above is 
</p>
<p>&#8220;convenience data&#8221;, but its value to a human rights investigation cannot always be 
</p>
<p>immediately assessed. Moreover, it is important not to privilege images as much can also 
</p>
<p>be learned from blogs or micro-blogs, which can be used to corroborate other sources. 
</p>
<p>90. While verification subsidies potentially speed up the verification process, using them 
</p>
<p>requires digital literacy about verification among human rights fact-finders and civilian 
</p>
<p>witnesses. It is unclear how knowledge about producing and transmitting information 
</p>
<p>effectively, safely and ethically for evidence will be diffused among civilian witnesses, 
</p>
<p>particularly those who are acting in a truly spontaneous manner. Pre-emptive steps to train 
</p>
<p>human rights monitors will favour the prepared, but it is often the accidental witnesses who 
</p>
<p>are best placed to be truly informative.  
</p>
<p>91. For that reason, organizations such as WITNESS advocate for the standard inclusion 
</p>
<p>of an &#8220;eyewitness&#8221; or &#8220;proof&#8221; mode, resembling InformaCam, in preloaded photo and 
</p>
<p>video applications on smartphones and in social media platforms.51 The inclusion of those 
</p>
<p>features in mainstream applications and platforms means that civilian witnesses are more 
</p>
<p>likely to know about them and thus to use them.

<p>methodologies, otherwise advocacy organizations and civilian witnesses will find it 
</p>
<p>difficult to take full advantage of existing accountability mechanisms. As noted above, 
</p>
<p>technological evidence must not be seen as the endpoint &#8212; without meaningful 
</p>
<p>accountability it is just more sound and fury &#8212; and it is therefore vital that official channels 
</p>
<p>designed to facilitate accountability for human rights violations be open to this type of 
</p>
<p>evidence. 
</p>
<p>93. The broader United Nations community has invested in harnessing the potential of 
</p>
<p>ICTs, particularly in the area of crisis information management (A/69/517). The United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology has, in conjunction with 
</p>
<p>the ICT4Peace Foundation, coordinated the Crisis Information Management Advisory 
</p>
<p>Group, which has become a forum to discuss technological developments in humanitarian 
</p>
<p>aid and crisis information management.52 The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Affairs (OCHA) has reviewed the impact of ICT-enabled networks on humanitarian relief 
</p>
<p>and has, since then, undertaken a number of collaborative projects to take advantage of the 
</p>
<p>power of the crowd.53 Meanwhile, the Global Pulse project is a major undertaking on the 
</p>
<p>humanitarian impact of big data.54 
</p>
<p>94. In 2014, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations requested the Expert Panel on 
</p>
<p>Technology and Innovation in United Nations Peacekeeping to recommend ways in which 
</p>
<p>technology and innovation could enhance their operational effectiveness. The panel issued 
</p>
<p>its final report in February 2015,55 in which it recommended that, among other things, the 
</p>
<p>Security Council create a special technical mission to use technical audio, visual, 
</p>
<p>monitoring and surveillance technologies to inform decision-making. 
</p>
<p>95. The United Nations human rights mechanisms have not completely ignored the 
</p>
<p>advances of ICTs. Several of them have created successful social media presences as part of 
</p>
<p>their promotional engagement strategies and campaigns to reach millions of users 
</p>
<p>worldwide. Although the promotional uses of digital ICTs are significant, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will now consider the engagement of various  international and regional human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms that use ICTs for fact-finding and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Special procedures and other mechanisms of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>96. This report was in part motivated by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s investigation of video 
</p>
<p>evidence of executions at the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka (see A/HRC/17/28/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>appendix). In that instance, the Special Rapporteur was able to provide impetus to a broad 
</p>
<p>coalition pressing for accountability by independently seeking out technical experts to 
</p>
<p>comment on the metadata of the videos, the ballistics of the weapons shown in the videos 
</p>
<p>and the movement of the bodies. Given the rapid developments in the field, it is quite 
</p>
<p>possible that such expertise is easier to find today, however, the capacity of OHCHR has 
</p>
<p>not changed greatly. Special procedures mandate holders would benefit from in-house 
</p>
<p>technical knowledge for selecting the best experts for specific tasks.  
</p>
<p>97. As noted above, the verification of user-generated content is fundamental to reaping 
</p>
<p>the advantages of ICTs in terms of broadening access to and the scope of human rights 
</p>
<p>work. However, it is important that verification not be viewed as a barrier to the use of 
</p>
<p>digital evidence. The technical difficulty of verification is sometimes exaggerated and used

<p>as an excuse not to engage with such evidence. Verification should be demystified within 
</p>
<p>the international human rights machinery, so that the advantages offered by digital evidence 
</p>
<p>can be more fully embraced. 
</p>
<p>98. With respect to the dangers of ignorance concerning digital security, it is noteworthy 
</p>
<p>that many Human Rights Council mechanisms encourage individual contact through 
</p>
<p>insecure generic email addresses, with no warnings concerning security or suggestions of 
</p>
<p>alternatives. While offering such contact points is a laudable effort to broaden access to its 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, the Council is arguably failing in its duty of care by failing to adequately warn 
</p>
<p>individuals or groups of the potential risks that they may be taking. 
</p>
<p>99. Of course, the impression should not be given that the special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Council are closed off to information from the new data streams discussed in the present 
</p>
<p>report. Indeed, much of the NGO reporting on which special procedures&#8217; communications 
</p>
<p>are based derives information from such sources. However, the fact that the Council is not 
</p>
<p>yet open to weighing such evidence or reporting places it at risk, over the coming years, of 
</p>
<p>isolation from the broader human rights community with which it has done so much to 
</p>
<p>engage in the past. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National and international commissions of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>100. Various national investigations have made use of digital evidence. The finding that 
</p>
<p>the death of Ian Tomlinson during a demonstration in London in 2009 was an unlawful 
</p>
<p>killing hinged on a witness video that was tracked down and handed over to the 
</p>
<p>Independent Police Complaints Commission by an investigative reporter. Also, the ongoing 
</p>
<p>inquiry into the shootings at Marikana, South Africa, received ostensibly probative video 
</p>
<p>evidence that the South African Human Rights Commission has had synchronized by a 
</p>
<p>technological expert.56 
</p>
<p>101. At the international level, OHCHR has partnered with the Operational Satellite 
</p>
<p>Applications Programme of the United Nations, and with various external partners on an ad 
</p>
<p>hoc basis, to use both satellite and video evidence in the work of international commissions 
</p>
<p>of inquiry.57 As discussed above, when combined with other techniques of human rights 
</p>
<p>monitoring, satellite imagery can provide extremely valuable information for inclusion in 
</p>
<p>reporting to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>102. The Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea made use of both satellite imagery and clandestinely recorded videos and 
</p>
<p>photographs in order to demonstrate the existence of several political prison camps (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/63). The Commission relied on the videos and photographs to the extent that 
</p>
<p>they could confirm their authenticity, and, with respect to satellite imagery, on 
</p>
<p>commercially available footage. The Commission noted that higher resolution satellite 
</p>
<p>imagery produced by more technologically advanced States would, almost certainly, have 
</p>
<p>provided further information. Unfortunately, despite requests, those images were not made 
</p>
<p>available to the Commission (see A/HRC/25/CRP.1, para. 60&#8211;61). 
</p>
<p>103. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>has also made use of a certain amount of satellite and digital material, as one might expect 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 56 See the &#8220;Written submissions of the South African Human Rights Commission regarding &#699;Phase

<p>from a body monitoring one of the most documented conflicts in history.58 In conducting its 
</p>
<p>special inquiry into the Al-Houla killings, for example, the Commission examined satellite 
</p>
<p>imagery to review access points to an area where killings had occurred, as well as to review 
</p>
<p>statements made by interviewees and to assess claims that the Government had razed 
</p>
<p>civilian areas in Damascus and Hama.59 The Commission mentioned instances where it had 
</p>
<p>received or found video evidence supporting allegations of torture or other forms of ill-
</p>
<p>treatment or footage of killings, but noted when it could not verify those recordings.60 
</p>
<p>Video material has also been directly gathered by the United Nations Supervision Mission 
</p>
<p>in the Syrian Arab Republic and referred to in reports of the Commission.61 The 
</p>
<p>Commission also undertook preliminary reviews and conducted forensic analyses of 26,948 
</p>
<p>photographs allegedly taken between 2011 and 2013 in government detention facilities.62 In 
</p>
<p>more recent reports, the Commission cited a number of videos that had been created and 
</p>
<p>distributed by ISIS; those videos have been a challenge to the current methodology of using 
</p>
<p>videos only to substantiate events for which there are other witness testimonies, but the 
</p>
<p>Commission has given them weight as confessions.63 
</p>
<p><b> 3. International criminal accountability 
</b></p>
<p>104. Information derived from digital sources has become increasingly important to 
</p>
<p>international tribunals, including several of those established during the 1990s, and now 
</p>
<p>also the International Criminal Court. In assessing the importance of such evidence to 
</p>
<p>moving forward its work, the Court has been proactive in establishing working methods 
</p>
<p>that can accommodate such evidence. In 2012 and 2013, the Court encouraged partners to 
</p>
<p>exchange ideas and expertise on strategies to improve the capacity of investigators and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors to gather and analyse digital evidence concerning serious international crimes.64  
</p>
<p>105. One of the recommendations from that process was that the Office of the Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>should &#8220;hire specialists trained in advanced cyberinvestigation techniques and familiar with 
</p>
<p>cutting-edge technologies&#8221; and who would have &#8220;experience and credentials specific to 
</p>
<p>digital investigations, including computer and smartphone forensics, online investigations, 
</p>
<p>data storage and management, advanced cyberinvestigation techniques, and superior 
</p>
<p>knowledge of digital security.&#8221; It was suggested that this would &#8220;go a long way toward 
</p>
<p>building a robust in-house capacity for vetting digital data and extracting quality 
</p>
<p>evidence.&#8221;65 On the basis of that consultation, the Office of the Prosecutor appointed a 
</p>
<p>specialist in the verification of digital material to work as a &#8220;cyberinvestigator&#8221;, as part of 
</p>
<p>its team of other investigators from legal and law enforcement backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>106. Recognizing the transient nature of much of the relevant material, the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor has adopted the practice of surveying digital evidence that is available when the 
</p>
<p>preliminary examinations are opened. As noted above, the Court has developed guidelines 
</p>
<p>for use by investigators concerning best practices with respect to the retrieval, storage and

<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>ICTs have had a profound effect on the impact and character of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>work. However, it is important that the process not be taken too far, especially in 
</b></p>
<p><b>information-scarce environments, where it will be increasingly important to resist the 
</b></p>
<p><b>temptation to privilege digital material. While new technology may raise expectations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for information, it should be noted that traditional human rights monitoring and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting make no claim to comprehensiveness, and neither should analysis of new 
</b></p>
<p><b>ICT-enabled data streams. The latter should not be viewed as a shortcut, but rather as 
</b></p>
<p><b>part of a complementary process that fits into pre-existing strategies used by human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights actors. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>It is also important that ICTs be embraced with due acknowledgement of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks. While in many cases, technology can be a vehicle for pluralism, issues of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>digital divide remain. In order to benefit from digital protection measures, human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders need to know about them. The digitally enabled promotion of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights may contribute to a culture of awareness, but if promotion resources for those 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives are diverted away from more traditional channels, this will be to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>detriment of vulnerable groups who are not online. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>It is also important to acknowledge the importance of ownership and control of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the mechanisms of digital ICTs. The use of digital evidence often depends on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>willingness of technology corporations to host, store and facilitate searches for this 
</b></p>
<p><b>information. Moreover, in some States, access to externally owned commercial social 
</b></p>
<p><b>media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are blocked. In others, 
</b></p>
<p><b>entire communication networks have been shut down to suppress the flow of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Keeping up with digital literacy and paying for new technology can be difficult 
</b></p>
<p><b>for human rights organizations. One solution would be collaboration between ICT 
</b></p>
<p><b>specialists and human rights experts to develop, implement and even commercialize 
</b></p>
<p><b>new applications for human rights, or to negotiate low-cost or free licensing for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of existing solutions. Donors are interested in funding technological developments, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but reportedly can focus more on the technology than on the training that is required 
</b></p>
<p><b>to deploy it. However, technology can be useless or even dangerous without training. 
</b></p>
<p><b>As one observer noted, </b>&#8220;<b>sooner or later, all technology problems become education 
</b></p>
<p><b>problems.</b>&#8221;66<b> 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The collaborative framework can be extended further. Indeed, a wide range of 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations are willing to assist international human rights mechanisms in more 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully benefiting from ICTs. Coordination efforts have been made in that regard, but it 
</b></p>
<p><b>seems that the human rights community is currently far behind other international 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies </b>&#8212;<b> most notably in terms of crisis response </b>&#8212;<b> in fully realizing that 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential.</b>67<b>

</p>
<p> 67 In the humanitarian response context, Digital Humanitarian Network has produced two reports aimed 
</p>
<p>at both sides of such partnerships: see http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/guidance-
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>112. <b>What is needed to support those United Nations human rights mechanisms that 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond directly to evidence that is often gathered by third parties is in-house capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>to conduct a triage-like function on digital material, as an initial assessment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>likely value of the source, before passing it on to external experts for full verification 
</b></p>
<p><b>or other technical assessment. S</b>uch a &#8220;first opinion&#8221; and liaison capacity within the 
</p>
<p><b>secretariat of international mechanisms, including the special procedures, would 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage greater use of potentially valuable information. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Of course, technological advances in gathering evidence remain only as 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective, in real terms, as the accountability mechanisms to which they contribute and 
</b></p>
<p><b>which are, in large part, external to the technology. In that sense, the improved 
</b></p>
<p><b>information streams offered by ICTs are necessary, but not sufficient, for better 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights, including the right to life. That underlines the importance 
</b></p>
<p><b>of international human rights mechanisms, including the Human Rights Council and 
</b></p>
<p><b>its special procedures, being able to fully interact with such materials. Some human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights NGOs </b>&#8212;<b> the so-called </b>&#8220;second generation&#8221;<b> </b>&#8212;<b> are keeping pace with the 
</b></p>
<p>innovations of the &#8220;third generation<b>.</b>&#8221;<b> I</b>t is vital that the &#8220;first generation&#8221; <b>catch up</b>. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. To the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>OHCHR should appoint, on a consultancy basis and as soon as possible, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>digital content specialist to provide advice with respect to information received from 
</b></p>
<p><b>or produced by civilian witnesses and to serve as an interface with external networks 
</b></p>
<p><b>of expertise in that area. That should be seen as a stopgap solution to ensure quick 
</b></p>
<p><b>movement on that front. At the same time, OHCHR should, with the assistance of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointed specialist, set about establishing longer-term capacity. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>As international commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions are ad hoc 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies that are likely to receive a large and increasing quantity of digital evidence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration should be given to expertise for analysing such material in the staffing 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements for those mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>More broadly, OHCHR should take steps to improve awareness of and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>familiarize its staff and processes at all levels with the requirements of digital security. 
</b></p>
<p><b>That involves the development of minimum standards of due diligence with respect to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the digital security of sources. Guidelines for United Nations staff on the ethics of 
</b></p>
<p><b>using information from open sources, especially social media, should also be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed in consultation with relevant partners. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. To regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Regional human rights mechanisms should evaluate their capacity to receive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and use digital material and to promote best practices in terms of digital security. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Where necessary, they should liaise with OHCHR to increase that capacity.

</p>
<p>guidance-collaborating-volunteer-technical-communities. </p>


<p><b> C. To States 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>States should respect and, where necessary, </b>protect the individual&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p><b>make a recording of a public event, including the conduct of law enforcement officials, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and </b>to &#8220;record back&#8221; an interaction in<b> which he or she is being recorded by a State 
</b></p>
<p><b>agent. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>States should consider measures that may be taken innovatively to use ICTs to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent violations of the right to life by its agents, particularly the excessive use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>force by law enforcement officers, or in custodial settings. That could include, but is 
</b></p>
<p><b>not limited to, innovations such as body-worn cameras, with due consideration given 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the necessary safeguards of the right to privacy.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>States with advanced capacity to capture satellite imagery should consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing at least derived information to international human rights mechanisms that 
</b></p>
<p><b>have such needs, if necessary, on a confidential or non-attributable basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. To civil society organizations and academic institutions 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>While remaining open to developments from a rapidly evolving field of 
</b></p>
<p><b>technological innovation, civil society organizations should adopt an evidence-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessment of the benefits of new ICT-enabled mechanisms. In collaboration with 
</b></p>
<p><b>academics, they should concentrate resources on those areas where ICTs genuinely 
</b></p>
<p><b>afford greater capacity, while maintaining the vital work they do using other, more 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional methods. Academics and human rights organizations should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaborate to prioritize research in areas where it is needed most, for example to 
</b></p>
<p>address the &#8220;volume challenge&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>Those responsible for human rights curricula and training programmes should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider including modules on the effective use of ICTs to secure human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Larger organizations should continue to seek to assist those with more limited digital 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. To donors 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>Donors should acknowledge that technological solutions to human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>problems can only be as successful as the training that accompanies them. In addition 
</b></p>
<p><b>to expecting rigorous and honest appraisals of the utility and impact of new 
</b></p>
<p><b>applications or devices, donors should also mainstream and support efforts to improve 
</b></p>
<p><b>digital literacy and digital security awareness among those communities that most  
</b></p>
<p><b>need it. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. To technology and software corporations 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Developers should favourably consider the inclusion of an </b>&#8220;<b>eyew</b>itness&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<b>p</b>roof&#8221; function in mainstream camera applications<b> that gives users the option to 
</b></p>
<p><b>include the metadata and establish the integrity of the file, so as to make video 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence valuable, without the need to have previously downloaded a specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>application. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Social media platforms should devise a process whereby user-generated content 
</b></p>
<p><b>that may be of relevance to human rights investigations, but that has been removed 
</b></p>
<p><b>from platforms because of community standards, can remain available to fact-finders. </b></p>
