Commonwealth Government Commitment to Innovation 
Commonwealth  Government  $210  million  Innovation  strategy  is  driving  interest  in 
enhanced cyber security solutions for Australian companies. 
 
Drake and Genome recently held discussions with representatives of an Australian 
State government, and agencies supporting these governments, with regard to the 
commercial  development  of  Genome’s  human  cyber-risk  governance  solution.  
These  discussions  confirmed  that  the  Genome  cyber-risk  solution  satisfies  an 
unresolved  need  to  monitor,  report  and  mitigate  the  human  risk  factor  in 
organisations relating to innocent employees.

organisations  in  the  insurance,  accounting  and  telecommunications  industries, 
including Howden Broking Group and BDO South Africa.

On the 17th June 2016, Drake was granted a waiver to the listing rule requiring the 
company to issue new shares at 20 cents each share.  This permits the Company to 
issue shares at no less than 2 cent per share as part of the Capital Raising.

The Company has completed Due Diligence and is preparing to lodge the Notice of 
Meeting with ASIC for their review within the next fortnight. The aim is to hold the 
shareholder meeting to approve the transaction around mid to late September. 
 
The Prospectus should be finalised around the date of the shareholder meeting with 
the transaction completing late September/ early October (indicative timeframe only). 
 
 
Existing Drake Activities Update 
 
As  announced  previously,  since  the  announcement  on  11th  March  2016  of  the 
Genome acquisition, the Company has received approaches from third parties who 
have  expressed  interest  in  acquiring  Drake’s  mineral  exploration  projects.    Drake 
intends  to  continue  funding  certain  current  obligations,  if  Drake  shareholders 
approve the Acquisition of Genome, then post-Acquisition, the new board of Drake 
will undertake a review of the Company’s assets to investigate opportunities to divest 
or relinquish existing assets and projects. 
 
Conversations with these third parties are advancing.

APPENDIX 1 
OFFER TO ACQUIRE GENOME 
On  the  11  March  2016  Drake  Resources  Limited  (‘Drake’  or  ‘the  Company’)  announced 
signing a Term Sheet to acquire 100% of the issued shares in Genome Technologies Ltd 
(‘Genome’) for $11,000,000.  
Genome is an Israeli company in the cyber security sector adopting a practical approach to 
mitigate  cyber  threats  in  organisations  related  to  the  human  factor  (the  employee).  The 
human  factor  is  considered  the  weakest  point  in  an  organisations  security.  Genomes 
proprietary technology and algorithm analyses  profiles each employee’s risk level providing 
customised mitigation, intelligence and training solutions. 
The  technology  is  based  on  Predictive  Identity  Engine  (PIE)  comprising  multiple  software 
and service modules. PIE analyses the various ways a cyber-attack can potentially enter IT 
systems  and  references  the    behaviour  or  actions  of  an  employee  that  could  result  in  a 
successful infection of the organisations IT systems  
Genome Founder & CEO Amir Rasilevski said:
“We are delighted to have this opportunity with Drake Resources Limited which will 
better position our company internationally.  
 
Cyber-attacks  are  having  and  will  continue  to  pose  a  major  threat  to  the  global 
economy and are costing businesses between US$400 billion and US$500 billion a 
year.  
 
Current cyber security solutions have proven ineffective and therefore there is a need 
to adopt new approach.  
 
There  is  significant  research  highlighting  the  lack  of  human-related  factors  in  the 
existing  market  for  solutions  to  cyber-attacks,  Genome’s  advantage  over  other 
solutions is that it focuses more on human weaknesses. This is widely acknowledged 
by the market, governments and the professional services community as one of the 
biggest and emerging problems of cyber threats.”
According to market research conducted by Gartner, global spending in IT security will reach 
US$101  billion  in  2018,  while  the  cybersecurity  market  is  expected  to  grow  from  US$77 
billion  in 2015 to US$170 billion by 2020 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 
9.8% from 2015 to 2020 according to a report from Markets and Markets.
Drake Resources non-executive Chairman Brett Fraser said:
“The  cybersecurity  market  is  massive  and  continues  to  grow  with  cyber-attacks 
having a major impact from financial institutions through to government departments.
Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced the blueprint to spend $230 million on 
a cyber security strategy for Australia.
There is pressure on company boards and organisations generally to consider cyber-
attacks in their governance review since it is emerging as a significant, growing risk 
becoming more difficult to contain, quantify and insure against. Every organisation is
P a g e 3
IT enabled and every employee is a potential entry point for a cyber-attack, this is the 
reaility of business today and the focus of Genome..
Therefore,  this  Genome  transaction  will  provide  our  shareholders  with  a  fantastic 
opportunity  to  participate  in  the  exciting  cybersecurity  market  offering  strong 
prospects for growth.”
Genome  has  received  significant  interest  internationally  with  a  number of  Letters  of Intent 
(LoI)  from  organisations  in  the  telecommunication,  accounting  and  insurance  sectors  to 
adopt the Genome platform 
Once the Acquisition is finalised, Drake plans to replace all but one of the existing board and 
seek  to  appoint  new  Australian  board  members,  together  with  board  members  from 
Genome.  
Genome’s research and development arm will remain in Israel post-Acquisition. 
  
As part of the Acquisition and Drake’s proposed re-compliance with Chapters 1 and 2 of the 
ASX Listing Rules, Drake will be required to consolidate its issued capital to facilitate a share 
price of at least $0.02. 
Company details on Genome and key conditions relating to the acquisition is fully disclosed 
in the announcement. Please refer to the Company’s website or the ASX platform to read 
the full announcement.
