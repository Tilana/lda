<p><b>11/&#8230;  Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of 
the International Conference on Population and Development and their Review Conferences and 
the targets and commitments regarding the reduction of maternal mortality and universal access 
to reproductive health, including those contained in the 2000 Millennium Declaration 
(General Assembly resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (Assembly 
resolution 60/1), 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also </i>the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the Goals 5, 3, 4 and 8 
on improving maternal health, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing 
child and infant mortality and the development of a global partnership, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that increased political will and commitment, cooperation and technical 
assistance at the international and national levels are urgently required to reduce the 
unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the leading role of the World Health Organization on maternal health and the 
work under the annual World Health Assembly agenda item on the monitoring of the 
achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity is a health, development and human rights challenge, and that a human rights 
analysis of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and the integration of a human rights 
perspective in international and national responses to maternal mortality and morbidity could 
contribute positively to the common goal of reducing this rate, with a view to eliminating 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, </p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the ongoing efforts of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies to 
highlight preventable maternal mortality and morbidity as a human rights issue, including those 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, and of the special procedures, in particular in the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health (A/61/338), </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the Council has a constructive role to play in raising awareness of the 
</p>
<p>human rights aspects of the unacceptably high global rate of maternal mortality and morbidity 
and in supporting, promoting and enhancing existing national and international efforts to reduce 
this rate, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> its initiative to hold an interactive dialogue at its eighth regular session on 
maternal mortality and the human rights of women, on 5 June 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity affects women and their 
families in all regions and cultures, and that it is exacerbated by factors such as poverty, gender 
inequality, age and multiple forms of discrimination, as well as factors such as lack of access to 
adequate health facilities and technology, and lack of infrastructure, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity, noting in this regard that the World Health Organization has assessed 
that over 1,500 women and girls die every day as a result of preventable complications occurring 
before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, and that, globally, maternal mortality is the 
leading cause of death among women and of girls of reproductive age; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that most instances of maternal mortality and morbidity are preventable, 
inter alia, through family planning, skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and 
that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is a multidimensional issue that also reflects a 
failure to promote and protect effectively the human rights of women and girls, including their 
rights to life, to be equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, receive and impart 
information, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from discrimination, and to 
enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and 
reproductive health; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Requests</i> all States to renew their political commitment to eliminating preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels, and to 
redouble their efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of their human rights 
obligations, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the International Conference for </p>

 <p></p>
<p>Population Development Programme of Action and their review conferences, and the 
Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goals 5 and 3 on 
improving maternal health and promoting gender equality and empowering women, including 
through the allocation of necessary domestic resources to health systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Strongly encourages </i>States to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and 
morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements, including 
through honouring existing commitments and pronouncing new commitments, and the exchange 
of effective practices and technical assistance, as well as to integrate a human rights perspective 
into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women has on maternal 
mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations, to give increased attention and resources to 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in their engagement with the United Nations 
human rights system, including with the human rights treaty bodies, the universal periodic 
review and special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights, in 
collaboration with the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Fund, as 
well as all relevant stakeholders, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the 
World Bank, and requests that the thematic study include identification of the human rights 
dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; an overview of initiatives and 
activities within the United Nations system to address all causes of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity; identification of how the Council can add value to existing initiatives 
through a human rights analysis; identification of options for the Council to support and increase 
existing efforts in the United Nations system, including efforts to achieve Millennium 
Development Goal 5 on improving maternal health, and recommendations for better addressing 
the human rights dimension of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the 
United Nations system; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to consider the thematic study requested in paragraph 6 above at its 
fourteenth session with a view to taking further action on preventable maternal mortality and 
morbidity and human rights at that session, and invites the Office of the High Commissioner, the 
World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and the Special Rapporteur on 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health to participate in an interactive dialogue on the study in the Council.
