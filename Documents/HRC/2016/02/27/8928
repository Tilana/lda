<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifth session from 4 to 15 
May 2009.  The review of Belize was held at the 3rd meeting on 5 May 2009.  The delegation of 
Belize was headed by Ms Judith Alpuche, Chief Executive Officer, Ministry of Human 
Development and Social Transformation. At its meeting held on 7 May 2009, the Working 
Group adopted the present report on Belize .<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Belize:  Russian Federation, Malaysia and Brazil. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of  the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents 
were issued for the review of Belize: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  
was transmitted to Belize through the troika.  These questions are available on the extranet of the 
UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 3rd meeting, on 5 May 2009, Judith Alpuche, Chief Executive Officer of the 
Ministry of Human Development and Social Transformation, opened her statement by referring 
to the national report that demonstrates significant strides made towards implementation of the 
international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>6. Belize is a party to the majority of the major international human rights treaties, as well 
as inter-American human rights instruments. While the obligations arising from these treaties are 
very important, resource constraints hinder timely reporting on implementation. 
</p>
<p>7. Belize has a strong commitment to the normative human rights framework, but faces 
challenges in its full operationalization. 
</p>
<p>8. Nothwithstanding resource constraints, the Government is conscious that Belize is not yet 
a party to some treaties. Belize is actively studying them. The overlapping nature of the United 
Nations and inter-American systems, however, is to be noted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. Belize&#8217;s human rights architecture is legal and institutional in nature. The Constitution 
guarantees civil, political, cultural and social rights equally on the basis of non-discrimination to 
all persons, and ensures a just system of social security and environmental protection. 
</p>
<p>10. At the front line of the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights is the 
Ministry of Human Development and Social Transformation. 
</p>
<p>11. Four quasi-governmental bodies have been established to ensure compliance with human 
rights commitments to key vulnerable populations: the National Committee for Families and 
Children (NCFC), the National Women&#8217;s Commission (NWC), the National AIDS Commission 
(NAC) and the National Council on Aging (NCA). Additionally, the National Human 
Development Advisory Committee, a multisectoral committee comprised of government and 
civil society representatives, provides policy advice to the Government taking into account 
sustainable development and other human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>12. A vibrant and active civil society sector has been instrumental in the promotion and 
protection of human rights with particular emphasis on public education.  
</p>
<p>13. An independent Office of the Ombudsman was established in 1999. While the 
Ombudsman Act gives broad powers to the Ombudsman to investigate wrongdoing, the success 
of the office has been its openness to help ordinary Belizeans and its credibility in acting as an 
honest and objective broker. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government of Belize has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to police violence. The 
Police Internal Affairs Department is tasked with conducting transparent investigations of police 
actions and citizen complaints. Where wrongful action has been determined criminal prosecution 
and/or disciplinary actions are taken. The Department has incorporated a human rights course at 
its raining academy, administered by the Human Rights Commission of Belize.  
</p>
<p>15. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW), the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of 
Violence Against Women and the concluding observations of respective treaty bodies guide 
Belize&#8217;s efforts to ensure the human rights of women. The recent strengthening of NWC to 
improve its capacity to monitor compliance with these important conventions will enhance the 
national machinery for the promotion of gender equity, equality and the advancement of women, 
and make the process of reporting on the implementation of the conventions easier. 
</p>
<p>16. Important achievements with respect to women&#8217;s rights include: the extension of paid 
maternity leave from 12 to 14 weeks to ensure conformity with the ILO Maternity Protection 
Convention; passage of legal provisions for equal pay for equal work, recognition of the value of 
housework in divorce proceedings and legal recognition of common-law unions of 5 years or 
more for inheritance purposes. A National Gender Policy was adopted in 2003, and last month 
stakeholders met, under the auspices, of NWC to review this. 
</p>
<p>17. A National Gender-Based Violence Plan facilitates a strategic response to the persistent 
problem of gender based violence. The Women&#8217;s Department, in partnership with NGOs, 
coordinates a sustained public education campaign to raise awareness and to inform women of 
available avenues of assistance. The Government has strengthened the Domestic Violence Act to 
provide for, inter alia, harsher penalties and the broadening of the categories of persons protected 
by the Act. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18. NCFC has spearheaded the development and implementation of the National Plan of 
Action for Children and Adolescents 2004-2015. The Plan of Action, which focuses on 
education, health, child protection, HIV/AIDS, family and culture, enjoys bipartisan political 
support.  
</p>
<p>19. The Government has increased the age of marriage with parental consent from 14 to 16 
years and the age of criminal responsibility from 9 to 11 years, following recommendations from 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government has appointed a Special Envoy for Children to work in tandem with 
NCFC and the various stakeholders in safeguarding the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government has established a permanent, multi-sectoral Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Committee. The Committee emphasizes prevention and maintains a widely accessible public 
awareness campaign on human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children. It 
invests in providing protective services for victims and works on strengthening national 
prosecutorial capacity. The Trafficking in Persons Prohibition Act is under review with a view to 
enacting stiffer penalties and more robust provisions on commercial sexual exploitation of 
children and child adoption. 
</p>
<p>22. Rising levels of crime and violence continue to present significant challenges on various 
fronts. Over the last decade Belize has emphasized rehabilitation within its prison, offering 
prisoners programmes for rehabilitation, skills training and fellowship. 
</p>
<p>23. There are other challenges reflected in the national report as priorities, including 
HIV/AIDS, youth development, good governance, persons with disabilities and education. 
</p>
<p>24. The situation of the Maya of Belize is a matter of national importance. Belize intends to 
engage the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>25. On 12 October 2004, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued 
recommendations pertaining to the case <i>Maya Indigenous Communities of the Toledo District of 
Belize</i>. The parties were unable to agree on an implementation mechanism. 
</p>
<p>26. The villages of Conejo and Santa Cruz of the Toledo District sought to have their 
customary rights recognized by the Supreme Court of Belize in the<i> Cal</i> case. The Government 
respectfully refrained from taking any measures to implement the recommendations of IACHR 
as soon as the matter became the subject of litigation. 
</p>
<p>27. On 18 October 2007, the Supreme Court issued its ruling, which contained provisions 
similar to the recommendations of IACHR but pertaining only to the villages of Conejo and 
Santa Cruz. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government is committed to implementing the Court&#8217;s decision. 
</p>
<p>29. There are many complex matters affecting implementation. Parts of the land in question 
are within declared national parks; and some are settled or owned by non-Mayans. In some 
instances, cessation of existing  licenses would have a direct economic impact. More 
importantly, there is a lack of consensus among the Maya themselves and, in the case of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>village of San Antonio, the residents have indicated that they do not wish to be included in the 
exercise since they prefer individual ownership to communal ownership. 
</p>
<p>30. Some interim measures, notably a cease-and-desist order, have been instituted by the 
Government, and remain in place, to ensure that the enforcement of the judgment is not 
compromised while the legal advisers of the Parties agree on a framework for the 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>31. Thirty-eight other villages in the Toledo District have initiated a class action suit. While 
this case is pending the Government has ceased the issuing of licenses relating to forestry or 
petroleum or the sale/transfer of land, with the single exception of the license granted for seismic 
testing in the Sarstoon Temash National Park in compliance with a separate court Judgement. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32.  During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 20 delegations. A number of 
delegation thanked the Government for the comprehensive national report and for the responses 
provided to advance questions. Statements were made welcoming Belize&#8217;s commitment to the 
UPR process  and its constructive participation and consultations with stakeholders in preparing 
the national report . 
</p>
<p>33.  The United Kingdom welcomed the appointment of a new Ombudsman in January 2009 
and hoped she would be given adequate resources to fulfil her mandate and investigate human 
rights related cases. It expressed concern about continued reports of police violence and prison 
abuse and welcomed convictions of police officers involved in such incidents as well as human 
rights training at the Police Academy by the Human Rights Commission of Belize. It 
recommended that Belize (a) consider ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT-OP). It 
recognized the work of the Women&#8217;s Department and NWC in the new Domestic Violence Act 
2008 and the national gender policy, and welcomed the the Gender-Based Violence Plan, and 
recommended that Belize (b) continue to address the persisting gender inequality in the country. 
It urged the Government to recognize the social, cultural and property rights of persons 
belonging to minorities and indigenous Maya people, and take steps to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination.The United Kingdom noted that HIV/AIDS remains a major challenge in Belize 
and welcomed the multisectoral participatory approach to tackling it, with the National Aids 
Commission to coordinating a national response and action plan. It recommended that the 
Government (c) introduce human rights education for all government officials and departments 
to ensure that a human rights-based approach is mainstreamed across government policy. It 
further recommended that the Government (d) offer a standing invitation to all Special 
Procedures and seek international technical assistance as recommended by several United 
Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies. 
</p>
<p>34. Algeria encouraged the authorities to persevere in their approach establishing 
interdependence between human rights and development. It emphasized the need for assistance 
from the international community to strengthen the capacity of Belize to meet the challenges it 
faces. It recommended (a) that the improvement of the situation of certain vulnerable groups, 
especially women and children, be given priority; (b) that Belize step up programmes aimed at 
eradicating poverty and improving social indicators, including in health and education; (c) that 
the institutional and legal authorities work towards completing the process already under way for 
accession to major international instruments<b> </b>of human rights; and (d) that Belize consider<b> </b>the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>possibility of establishing a national human rights institution in conformity with the Paris 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>35. The Netherlands referred to the actions taken with regard to good governance mentioned 
in the national report, such as the new Prevention of Corruption Act, and the fact that Belize is 
party to the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. It said, however, that recent 
international reports indicate that corruption is still a problem for Belize. It welcomed efforts 
with regard to women&#8217;s rights, including the 2005 launch of the sexual and reproductive health 
policy, but said further efforts were needed to combat maternal mortality, noting that in 2007 the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women had  expressed concern about 
the high maternal mortality rate, urging Belize to take measures in this regard. It recommended 
that Belize (a) continue to strengthen its efforts to ensure that all police and security officers 
receive human rights training; (b) look into the possible ratification of the United Nations 
Convention Against Corruption; (c) take further concrete measures to enhance women's access to 
health care, in particular to sexual and reproductive services, as recommended by, among others,  
the  Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; (d) strengthen its efforts 
with regard to timely reporting to United Nations human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>36. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction that since 1999 the country had had an 
independent ombudsman, and asked what main difficulties this body had faced in carrying out its 
activities. Secondly, it noted that the central prison is managed by a non-profit, non-
governmental organization, and enquired if there is any public or State control over this 
organization&#8217;s action. Finally, highlighting that 6 per cent of Belize&#8217;s population suffer from 
some kind of disability, and that nevertheless there is no law which directly addresses protection 
of the rights of this category of the population, Russia asked if the Government planned to 
formulate such a law. 
</p>
<p>37. Italy acknowledged Belize&#8217;s progress in the field of human rights promotion and 
protection. With regard to the death penalty, Italy commended Belize for its longstanding de 
facto moratorium on executions, recommending that the Government (a) consider the complete 
abolition of capital punishment in its internal legislation. With regard to reported episodes of 
police abuse and violence, it recommended (b) that further efforts be deployed in training 
security forces in the field of human rights; (c) that allegations of misconduct, abuse and 
violence by public agents be duly and promptly investigated; and (d) that adequate action be 
taken against those responsible for such crimes. Noting the request for legislative measures to 
fully guarantee the rights of sexual minorities, and in connection with the rights of persons living 
with HIV/AIDS, Italy recommended that Belize (e) take appropriate legislative measures in 
order to ensure that no person can be subject to criminal sanctions for same-sex activity between 
consenting adults. 
</p>
<p>38. Ukraine recognized progress achieved so far, especially in the promotion of women's 
rights. Noting concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
on widespread poverty among women, particularly in rural areas and among Mayan women, it 
asked what measures had been undertaken to fulfill the recommendations made by the 
Committee in this connection. It noted that HIV/AIDS is the most serious social and health 
problem facing the country. It recommended that Belize (a) continue to implement the 
recommendations made by the Committee and on a regular basis submit the relevant reports for 
its consideration; (b) further strengthen activities to prevent the spread of HIV and stigmatization 
and discrimination against people living with HIV. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39. The United States of America expressed its hope that the process of self-evaluation which 
Belize had already profited from would continue to be of help through and after the UPR 
process. It asked about Belize&#8217;s position on the possible creation of a national human rights 
institute and recommended that the Government conduct a systematic evaluation on the merits of 
establishing a national human rights institution, as a separate institution dedicated to human 
rights would let the Ombudsman focus on more general oversight issues and would give the 
Government a body that could address a range of possible issues, such as property rights of the 
Mayan population. 
</p>
<p>40. Mexico asked how Belize would address the recommendations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child concerning the fight against trafficking in children and child pornography, 
child labour and the disciplinary measures applicable to children, within the framework of the 
consultations carried out by the Government concerning legislative instruments for the protection 
of children. It recommended Belize (a) to redouble its efforts in favour of the respect of the 
rights of indigenous peoples, in line with the dispositions contained in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; (b) to accede to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons Living with 
Disabilities; and (c) to consider adhering to their respective Optional Protocols as soon as 
possible. It emphasized the need to foster national capacities on human rights, both in technical 
and standard-setting levels. It encouraged the international community to provide the assistance 
required by Belize, as well as recommending the country (d) to continue in its pursuit of 
assistance in these areas.        
</p>
<p>41. Canada noted that UNICEF and the Committee on the Rights of the Child had expressed 
concern about the disparities and widespread poverty experienced by indigenous populations. It 
also noted recent reports alleging occasional excessive use of force by police officers, 
welcoming the information provided on the Government&#8217;s efforts to address this issue. It asked 
what measures are being undertaken to ensure that those subject to the justice system have 
adequate legal representation. It noted that Belize does not have a national human rights 
institution accredited by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for 
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. It recommended that Belize (a) implement the 
recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to prioritize effective measures to 
reduce poverty amongst indigenous and minority children; (b) strengthen the office of 
Ombudsman and the police department&#8217;s office of internal affairs in order to improve capacity to 
hear and investigate complaints; (c) provide defendants in all serious criminal processes with an 
attorney when they cannot afford one by themselves; (d) establish a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>42. Argentina noted that the Criminal Code and the Education Act of Belize allow corporal 
punishment of children within the family and schools, and recommended (a) considering the 
adoption of measures commensurate with international standards on the subject and public 
campaigns about non-violent forms of discipline. It noted that Belize prioritizes combating 
HIV/AIDS and has comprehensive policies to halt the spread of the disease. However, some 
reports show that people under 16 cannot access test services without their parents&#8217; consent. It 
recommended (b) considering the possibility of eliminating this requirement for people under the 
age of 16.  It also recommended (c) considering the ratification of the following international 
human rights instruments: CESCR, which has been signed but not ratified, and the optional 
protocols to ICCPR, CAT, CPD and CED. On indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, Argentina took note of 
the information provided on the Mayan communities of Toledo, Santa Cruz and Conejo and 
asked what additional measures Belize is considering to implement the international standards </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>under the Universal Declaration on Indigenous Rights, particularly with regard to the provision 
of land. 
</p>
<p>43. Belize recognized that accession to international human rights treaties is necessary to 
consolidate the national human rights architecture that has been constructed and continues to be 
strengthened. 
</p>
<p>44. Belize is reviewing its national, strategic and action plan on poverty with a view towards 
ensuring that the actions taken effectively address vulnerable populations with emphasis on the 
lowest quintile. Belize has a policy framework for persons with disabilities, however Belize 
acknowledges the necessity of strengthening its efforts in this area and is seeking to engage its 
civil society partners in this regard. 
</p>
<p>45. Though the prison is managed by the Kolbe Foundation, a private entity, oversight is 
maintained by the Ministry of National Security. A Government-appointed superintendent of 
prisons monitors the functioning of prisons. Furthermore, a majority of the board of governors of 
the Kolbe Foundation are appointed by the Government.  
</p>
<p>46. Belize regards the rate of maternal mortality as a matter of priority. Through proactive 
and rigorous interventions by the Maternal and Child Health Unit in the Ministry of Health  
incidents of maternal mortality have decreased over the past two years. 
</p>
<p>47. The Office of the Ombudsman is well received. The Belizean people appreciate that it is 
an objective and honest broker that deals very sensitively with the concerns of the general 
population. The main limitation to its work is one of lack of resources. 
</p>
<p>48. Several initiatives focus on children&#8217;s rights and aim at adherence to the concluding 
observations of Committee on the Rights of the Child. This includes a national plan, developed 
in partnership with the ILO, on issues of child labour and the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children. As the result of a recent review on progress made over the past eighteen months, Belize 
is now seeking to engage  NGO partners to consolidate the gains and further advance work in 
this area. 
</p>
<p>49. Maldives recognized Belize's efforts to create awareness, protect and educate children, in 
particular the National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents 2004-2015 adopted with the 
endorsement of both political parties. It encouraged Belize to seek technical assistance to fully 
implement this Plan of Action, as was recommended by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child. It noted important challenges remain, including, in terms of small States, the limitations 
on financial and human resources, and capacity-building. It agreed that meeting human rights 
reporting obligations remains a major challenge for small States, and highlighted the benefits and 
advantages of preparing a Common Core Document with the information that the State is 
required to send to each treaty report.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>50. Azerbaijan said it found the national report and presentation open and constructive as it 
highlights initiatives and efforts of the Government for the promotion and protection of human 
rights, but also existing challenges, like gender-based violence, women&#8217;s limited participation in 
public life and the high rate of HIV/AIDS. It commended Belize for its human rights-based 
approach in development planning, social services and general policy formulation and execution, 
as well as for being party to core international human rights covenants. It commended the 
national gender policy and the National Gender-Based Violence Plan 2007-2009, but urged the 
Government (a) to improve the institutional capacity of the national machinery for the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>advancement of women. It recommended Belize (b) to consider the ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. It called on relevant international 
organizations and institutions not to spare their efforts in rendering assistance to Belize in human 
rights education, human rights monitoring and other related spheres.  
</p>
<p>51. Slovenia welcomed the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act in October 2008 and 
asked what steps the Government has made to fully implement it. It was also concerned about 
reports that corporal punishment of children within schools as well as in families is lawful and 
widely practiced, and asked if Belize intends to review its legislation with a view to prohibit all 
forms of corporal punishment of children. Following the observations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, Slovenia asked what the Government intended to do to improve the equal 
enjoyment of all rights of children belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples. It 
recommended Belize (a) to submit all overdue reports to United Nations human rights 
conventions&#8217; treaty bodies and to answer to questionnaires sent by Special mandate holders, 
since no reply was sent to 13 questionnaires within the deadlines in the last years; (b) to fully 
implement the Domestic Violence Act; (c) to review its legislation in a view to prohibit all forms 
of corporal punishment of children; (d) to protect Maya customary property rights in accordance 
with Maya customary laws and land tenure practices in consultation with affected Maya people 
of the whole Toledo district. 
</p>
<p>52. Turkey noted the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNICEF on 
the high rate of children living in poverty especially in rural areas, and on the high number of 
working children. It thanked the delegation for the responses provided on the revised Strategic 
Action Plan on Poverty, welcoming its focus on vulnerable groups. It asked for further 
information on support provided to economically disadvantaged families, particularly in rural 
areas. It also asked what steps are being taken to protect children from all forms of exploitation 
and abuse. It recommended the Government (a) to take further steps to guarantee the rights of 
children to an adequate standard of living and ensure that children from economically 
disadvantaged background are not exploited or abused. Noting the unemployment rates in the 
national report and recalling observations by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women that there remains a concentration of women in low-paid sectors 
of public employment and a considerable wage gap between women and men in Belize, it asked 
whether any special programme or micro-credit scheme exists to support women's 
entrepreneurship. It recommended Belize (b) to take targeted measures or affirmative action, 
where necessary, to ensure active participation of women in the labour market and to close the 
wage gap between women and men. It further recommended the Government (c) to ratify the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.   
</p>
<p>53. Germany highlighted the ruling of the Belize Supreme Court in favour of some of the 
Mayan villages regarding their use of their land rights. It recognized the detailed information 
provided by the delegation and also the difficulties of solving the situation and implementing the 
Court&#8217;s ruling. It asked what the plans are for a way ahead because the non-solution of this issue 
affects the Toledo District economically as well as socially. It recommended Belize (a) to 
continue efforts to submit overdue reports requested by the committees of various international 
conventions to which Belize is a party, and also to seek technical assistance for the establishment 
of these reports; (b) to change the legislation concerning criminal responsibility of children and 
to raise the age limit for criminal responsibility to the age of eighteen; (c) to abolish corporal 
punishment for children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>54. Japan commended Belize for making measures against HIV/AIDS, a major national 
issue, and for establishing a National AIDS Commission. It also applauded Belize for having a 
National AIDS In The Workplace Policy designed to eliminate workplace discrimination against 
persons living with HIV/AIDS. It said it hoped that efforts will be made to ensure that these 
policies will be implemented countrywide, and that attention will be paid to ensure that those 
affected by HIV/AIDS are not subject to discrimination and violations of privacy due to a lack of 
understanding or prejudice. It said it was pleased to know that Belize is actively studying the 
international treaties and conventions, and recommended that Belize accede in a timely manner 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which it signed in 
September 2000, to further advance its human rights policy.

<p>55. Trinidad and Tobago underscored Belize&#8217;s commitment to democratic traditions and 
values, and the system of local governance that facilitates greater enfranchisement of rural 
communities, particularly of indigenous peoples. It also highlighted the establishment of an 
independent Office of the Ombudsman in 1999 and the election of the first female to that post in 
January 2009, as well as the creation of an Internal Affairs Department of the Police Service. 
Trinidad and Tobago identified with the challenges of small island developing States and small 
and vulnerable economies. In this regard, it fully endorsed the recommendation that enhanced 
capacity-building at the technical and policy levels be considered imperative to ensure that a 
human rights methodology infuses all policy and planning processes and to adequately arm the 
relevant agencies with the requisite tools needed to stand in the vanguard of the protection of 
human rights. It commended Belize for its proactive approach with respect to safeguarding the 
human rights and dignity of all Belizeans.  
</p>
<p>56. The Czech Republic expressed its appreciation for the responses to the written questions 
submitted. It welcomed the long-term National Action Plan for Children, and recommended (a) 
that Belize strengthen efforts towards its full implementation. It also recommend (b) that the age 
of criminal responsibility, as well as the minimum age for marriage, be increased so that they 
comply with international standards, and (c) that possible shortcomings in the registration 
procedure of all newborn children are rectified. In area of protection against torture, it 
recommended that Belize (d) accede to the CAT-OP and (e) submit its overdue CAT report in 
early course. In the area of protection of the rights of asylum-seekers, it recommended Belize (f) 
to review its legislation and practice with a view of ensuring effective access to asylum 
procedure and upholding of the principle of non-refoulement. With respect to the protection of 
the right to privacy and non discrimination, it recommended (g) to put and end to any 
discrimination against same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults, in particular to 
review any discriminatory legislation, and to adopt measures to promote tolerance in this regard, 
which would also facilitate more effective educational programmes for the prevention of 
HIV/AIDS. It recommended that (h) human rights training with regard to the protection of the 
human rights of vulnerable groups, in particular women, children, indigenous peoples and 
persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, be provided to law enforcement 
officials, judicial officers and and all State officials. 
</p>
<p>57. Jamaica commended Belize for the report presented and for its commitment to ensuring 
that the fundamental rights and freedoms of all its people are protected. It noted Belize had 
highlighted the need for further capacity-building and technical assistance in areas such as 
human rights education, monitoring and reporting, and encouraged the international community 
to give Belize its full support in its efforts to build a more just and equitable society. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>58. Latvia noted that Belize has signed almost all major human rights treaties and is 
committed to the protection and promotion of human rights. It raised the issue of standing 
invitations to special procedure mandate-holders, an issue they had also addressed as a written 
question before the UPR session. While no requests have been made by special procedure 
mandate-holders to visit Belize, it recommended that the Government consider extending a 
standing invitation to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>59. Belize stated that it aspires to the goal of timely reporting, however, further consideration 
of streamlining the reporting process is encouraged, taking into account the constraints that small 
States face. 
</p>
<p>60. Belize is undertaking a multi-agency project for the implementation of the Domestic 
Violence Act. Much effort has been invested in training various stakeholders, particularly the 
front-line implementers, in the new provisions of the Act. A comprehensive public education 
programme is being implemented with NGO partners. Belize is improving protection for battered 
women at its shelters.  
</p>
<p>61. The social assistance programme has been upgraded through the doubling of benefits 
received by indigent families and incorporating conditionalities, thereby establishing a 
partnership with families.. The majority of beneficiaries are from the rural areas, particularly in 
the Toledo District. Belize is actively working with the World Bank and the Inter-American 
Development Bank to explore modalities for strengthening its social protection systems. 
</p>
<p>62. The unemployment rate for women, particularly single mothers, is a matter of concern for 
the Prime Minister. As a result the Women&#8217;s Department has benefitted from an increased 
budgetary allocation to pilot a comprehensive and holistic project that provides skills training, 
job placement and family support services to single mothers in south-side Belize City. The 
recently completed first round is being evaluated; the results will be used to strengthen the 
programme and consideration will be given to implementation on a national scale.  
</p>
<p>63. The issue of use of corporal punishment on children merits thorough national debate. 
Nevertheless corporal punishment has already been abolished in children&#8217;s institutions. There are 
rules and regulations for corporal punishment in schools. The Education Act is being reviewed 
with a view towards full abolition. NGOs have taken an ongoing role in promoting the national 
dialogue on the abolition of corporal punishment in all spheres. 
</p>
<p>64. Belize reiterated the measures undertaken to implement the Supreme Court decision, 
including continuing dialogue, a moratorium on the issuing of licences for mining, logging or the  
sale or transfer of lands in the area in question and sustaining an environment of trust and 
confidence. 
</p>
<p>65. Belize is considering draft legislation to have birth registrations done in the health 
system, as a vast majority of births in Belize occur within health institutions. 
</p>
<p>66. Belize recognizes that legal representation is key to true access to justice. The Legal Aid 
Office has recently been enhanced to provide legal representation to the indigent. While this is a 
step in the right direction, Belize acknowledges that more resources need to be invested in this 
area.
