5.      
After considering summary of facts in this case, I select 6 months as the starting point. 

Aggravating Factor

The victim is your former husband making this a domestic violence offence. Also you committed this without any provocation from the other side. For these I add 06 months to reach 12 months imprisonment.

This Court can suspend a sentence below 02 years under section 26(2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 

10.
