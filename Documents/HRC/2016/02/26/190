<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report contains an analysis of the progress made by Turkey in 
</p>
<p>implementing the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, following his official visit to Turkey 
</p>
<p>from 26 to 30 November 2012 (A/HRC/23/47/Add.<footnote name="2">0 Ibid. </footnote>). The recommendations in the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s mission report were aimed at further reducing the rate of extrajudicial killings 
</p>
<p>in Turkey, fighting impunity and strengthening the overall functioning of accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>During the period under review, killings due to excessive use of force by security 
</p>
<p>officers and killings of members of vulnerable groups persisted. Some measures taken by 
</p>
<p>the State, including a draft law that would increase the powers of the police to use force, 
</p>
<p>appear to take regressive steps. The Government of Turkey has introduced measures in an 
</p>
<p>attempt to reduce domestic violence, but efforts need to be further intensified and properly 
</p>
<p>implemented. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons remain particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to violence and lack protection, in law and in practice. The fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity remains a serious challenge and the effectiveness of investigations and the length 
</p>
<p>of proceedings should be addressed. The effect of the application of the statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations and the lack of fully independent mechanisms for accountability further 
</p>
<p>aggravate the climate of impunity.

</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report contains an analysis of the progress made by Turkey in 
</p>
<p>implementing the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, following his visit to the country from 26 
</p>
<p>to 30 November 2012. The country visit report (A/HRC/23/47/Add.2) was submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session in June 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to Turkey, the Special Rapporteur documented deaths resulting from 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force by security officers; unlawful deaths from counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>operations; deaths in custody and in the context of the village guard system; and suspicious 
</p>
<p>suicides of military conscripts and law enforcement officials. He noted the challenges to 
</p>
<p>respect of the right to life by non-State actors; measures in the fight against impunity; and 
</p>
<p>the role of human rights mechanisms in upholding the right to life. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur made recommendations in the following broad areas: 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to life for vulnerable groups; the capacity of accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and the functional and operational independence of such mechanisms; law 
</p>
<p>reform to ensure greater protection of the right to life; and awareness-raising campaigns and 
</p>
<p>education to enhance protection of vulnerable groups, in particular lesbian, gay, bisexual 
</p>
<p>and transgender persons. 
</p>
<p>4. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, various reforms and measures aimed at 
</p>
<p>increasing the protection of human rights and the right to life in particular were already 
</p>
<p>under way. Since his visit, Turkey has made progress in addressing some of the concerns 
</p>
<p>and recommendations that he had expressed. However, additional measures are still 
</p>
<p>required to properly ensure the protection of the right to life of civilians and public officials 
</p>
<p>alike. In particular, vulnerable groups remain at risk of violation of their rights and the 
</p>
<p>perception and practice of impunity continues. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its resolution 26/12, the Human Rights Council urged States to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her task, 
</p>
<p>supply all necessary information requested by him or her and ensure appropriate follow-up 
</p>
<p>to his or her recommendations and conclusions, including by providing information to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the actions taken on those recommendations (para. 8). 
</p>
<p>6. In order to follow-up his country visit, the Special Rapporteur requested information 
</p>
<p>from the Government of Turkey, and from other actors, on the steps taken to implement his 
</p>
<p>recommendations. The Government responded on 28 October 2014, and a draft of the 
</p>
<p>present follow-up report was submitted to the Government for comments on 19 March 
</p>
<p>2015. The Government submitted its comments on 20 April 2015. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Turkey for its response and 
</p>
<p>comments on the present report and for providing information on the measures taken to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations contained in his country visit report. He also expresses his 
</p>
<p>gratitude to all stakeholders who contributed to the present report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from excessive use of force by security officers 
</b></p>
<p>8. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur found that the Turkish legal 
</p>
<p>framework surrounding possible deprivation of life in the context of use of force was 
</p>
<p>insufficiently precise and could result in an overly broad interpretation of the conditions 
</p>
<p>under which lethal force was permissible. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur recommended that Turkey amend article 17 of its 
</p>
<p>Constitution to bring the formulation of the right to life into line with international 
</p>
<p>standards, by providing that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, para. 95). The Special Rapporteur takes note of the information 
</p>
<p>provided by the Government that article 13 of the Constitution provides that fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms may be restricted by law and in accordance with the reasons mentioned 
</p>
<p>in the relevant articles of the Constitution. 1  A reading of articles 13 and 17 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution does not remove the risk that those provisions may be interpreted too broadly 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the provisions of the Constitution should reflect 
</p>
<p>the international understanding of the right to life, as set out in the Basic Principles on the 
</p>
<p>Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990)2 and the Code of Conduct 
</p>
<p>for Law Enforcement Officials (1979).<footnote name="3">2 CCPR/TUR/CO/1, para. 11.  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the laws regulating the use of force 
</p>
<p>by law enforcement officers be brought into line with international standards and that the 
</p>
<p>terms &#8220;necessity&#8221; and &#8220;proportionality&#8221; reflect their interpretation under international law, 
</p>
<p>whereby lethal force may only be used as a last resort to protect life (ibid., para. 96).  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that, in its response of 28 October 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Government indicated that it considered its normative regulations on the use of force to 
</p>
<p>be sufficient. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern over reports received that, as part 
</p>
<p>of the Internal Security Reforms Package, law enforcement officers will be granted wider 
</p>
<p>powers to use force. The draft law to amend various articles of the Law on the Duties and 
</p>
<p>Powers of the Police and articles of statutory decrees, which is currently before the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly of the Turkish Parliament, provides for increased police powers without 
</p>
<p>appropriate safeguards. It will allow the police to use firearms against individuals who 
</p>
<p>attack or attempt to attack buildings, residences, workplaces, vehicles and other places 
</p>
<p>where individuals or crowds are present, by using explosives, burning, suffocating, 
</p>
<p>injurious or similar weapons. The draft law provides that firearms should be used with the 
</p>
<p>aim of rendering the attack ineffective and to the degree required to render the attack 
</p>
<p>ineffective; however, it does not contain the safeguards required under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law, whereby lethal force may only be used to protect life. The draft law is in direct 
</p>
<p>contradiction to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation and has been widely criticized.4

</b></p>
<p>12. The adoption by the Council of Ministers of the Action Plan for the Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Violations of the European Convention on Human Rights5 is a commendable and welcome 
</p>
<p>step.6 The Action Plan aims to harmonize existing laws with the European Convention and 
</p>
<p>to reduce violations of rights and thus the number of cases brought against Turkey before 
</p>
<p>the European Court of Human Rights. Measures provided for under subheading 1.5, 
</p>
<p>Prevention of the use of force and arms without the presence of legal requirements, include 
</p>
<p>revision of the conditions for using force and arms regulated by Law No. 2559 on Duties 
</p>
<p>and Powers of the Police, and other relevant legislation in respect of their compliance with 
</p>
<p>the case law of the European Court and making necessary amendments thereto; ensuring 
</p>
<p>training to law enforcement officers and other personnel on the use of firearms; and 
</p>
<p>preparation of a guide setting out the conditions for the use of force and firearms in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the standards set out in the case law of the European Court. 
</p>
<p>13. The excessive use of force by law enforcement officers during assemblies and arrest 
</p>
<p>remains a serious concern, as does the use of tear gas and pepper spray.7 The force used by 
</p>
<p>the police during the Gezi Park protests in 2013 resulted in the death of nine civilians, 
</p>
<p>including a 14-year-old child, and injury to more than 8,000 people, of which 104 people 
</p>
<p>had sustained serious head injuries and 11 people lost an eye. The Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>that the Action Plan was evoked in the cases of the <i>Oya Ataman Group,</i> application No. 
</p>
<p>74552/01 (lead), which was under the supervision of the Council of Europe Committee of 
</p>
<p>Ministers.8 The Special Rapporteur also notes the measures taken by Turkey, following the 
</p>
<p>allegations of excessive use of force by the police during the Gezi Park protests.9 The 
</p>
<p>circumstances in which around 40 people, including children, died during demonstrations 
</p>
<p>across Turkey in October 2014 are still under investigation.10 
</p>
<p>14. Incorrect or excessive use of &#8220;less-lethal&#8221; weapons has resulted in serious and 
</p>
<p>permanent disability of a number of civilians in Turkey. 11  The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recommended that security officers receive further training on the principles of necessity 
</p>
<p>and proportionality, including on the appropriate use of methods other than lethal weapons 
</p>
<p>(ibid. para. 98). In that regard, the Action Plan is again a welcome step, in particular the 
</p>
<p>activities listed under subheading 2.1 on the proportionate use of force only when it is 
</p>
<p>definitely necessary during meetings, demonstrations and arrest and police custody 
</p>
<p>proceedings. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s response that in-service 
</p>
<p>training on &#8220;human rights and proportional force&#8221; and on the use of &#8220;less-lethal&#8221; 
</p>
<p>equipment, devices and defence weapons is provided to riot-control officers.12

</p>
<p>15. The Government of Turkey stated that tear gas has been used legally by the police to 
</p>
<p>suppress riots and other turbulent incidents and that its use in such events is regulated by 
</p>
<p>the Law on Development, Production, Storage and Prohibition on the Use of Chemical 
</p>
<p>Weapons (2006) (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, para. 8). The Special Rapporteur was also 
</p>
<p>informed that advanced training is being provided to personnel responsible for giving 
</p>
<p>orders to use tear gas, in March and April 2015 and he is aware of the Directive on the 
</p>
<p>Operational Principles and Procedures Charged in Social Events that finds application 
</p>
<p>across the State and is aimed at ensuring a proportionate use of force by the police. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also notes the call by the European Commission that non-compliance 
</p>
<p>with the June and July 2013 circulars from the Ministry of the Interior on the use of tear gas 
</p>
<p>by riot police and action taken in cases of social unrest should be consistently and 
</p>
<p>immediately penalized.13 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the proposed revision of and, if 
</p>
<p>necessary, amendments to the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act (Law No. 2911) 
</p>
<p>to bring it in line with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as 
</p>
<p>emphasis on the standards set out in the case law of the European Court on training 
</p>
<p>provided to law enforcement officers.14 Although the Special Rapporteur welcomes those 
</p>
<p>measures, he is seriously concerned about the draft law to amend various articles of the 
</p>
<p>Law on the Duties and Powers of the Police and articles of statutory decrees, as it will not 
</p>
<p>address the concerns raised in relation to restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly, 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force and concerns regarding public-order policing. It is unfortunate that 
</p>
<p>the draft law contains provisions granting greater powers to the police with regard to 
</p>
<p>searches and arrests, without providing for the requisite judicial oversight, and it will 
</p>
<p>substantially widen the use of firearms by police, without the requisite safeguards. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Unlawful deaths in counter-terrorism operations 
</b></p>
<p>16. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur acknowledged that the fight 
</p>
<p>against terrorism in Turkey presented a number of significant challenges, and he called on 
</p>
<p>the Government to, in particular, amend article 2 of the Law on the Fight against Terrorism 
</p>
<p>(No. 3713) to reflect the international interpretation of the principle of proportionality and 
</p>
<p>to stipulate that lethal force shall only be used as a last resort where there is an imminent 
</p>
<p>threat to life (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, para. 97). While that should have read as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;additional&#8221; article 2,15 he notes with regret that no amendment to reflect international 
</p>
<p>standards has been made to additional article 2 of the law. 
</p>
<p>17. In its response regarding the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>recommendations, the Government indicated that in-service training on the use of non-
</p>
<p>lethal equipment, devices and defence weapons was organized for riot-control officers and 
</p>
<p>that all training programmes dedicated at least two hours to human rights and the use of 
</p>
<p>proportionate force. Other information received indicated that training on the principles of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and necessity is conducted for security officers, but does not form part of 
</p>
<p>the in-service training.

<p>without hesitation, to the degree and proportion as to neutralize the threat. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>18. In his report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that operations to counter 
</p>
<p>terrorism must be in compliance with international principles; the use of force should be 
</p>
<p>resorted to only when necessary and proportionate; civilian harm should be minimized; 
</p>
<p>civilians should never be targeted; and injury or killing of civilians should be promptly and 
</p>
<p>thoroughly investigated and, where appropriate, accountability should be sought (ibid., 
</p>
<p>para. 99). 
</p>
<p>19. In its response to that recommendation, the Government of Turkey indicated that 
</p>
<p>personnel rendering service in anti-terrorism units received basic anti-terrorism training and 
</p>
<p>training in police defence tactics and methods of arrest and detention, and that a course on 
</p>
<p>human rights was also included in the curriculum. 16  The Special Rapporteur was also 
</p>
<p>informed that the personnel in charge of counter-terrorism units regularly participated in in-
</p>
<p>service courses to ensure that they protect rights and freedoms and respect human rights in 
</p>
<p>the performance of their duties to prevent terrorist-related crimes. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the Uludere/Roboski incident, in which 34 civilians were killed in an 
</p>
<p>aerial bombardment carried out by the Turkish Air Force in 2011, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>called on the State to undertake, as a priority, an effective, prompt, impartial and 
</p>
<p>transparent criminal investigation into the incident (ibid., para. 100). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes with regret and expresses concern that no gendarmerie personnel have 
</p>
<p>been prosecuted for that incident and that a verdict of non-prosecution was issued in 
</p>
<p>January 2014 on the grounds that the armed forces had committed an unavoidable error 
</p>
<p>while fulfilling their duties.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the Uludere Subcommission of the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Grand National Assembly release its overdue final report without delay and ensure 
</p>
<p>full transparency in its work by publishing the content of all the evidence used for its 
</p>
<p>findings. In its response, the Government of Turkey indicated that the Subcommission had 
</p>
<p>published its report on 27 March 2013, in which it explained that the findings of the 
</p>
<p>Subcommission were based on aerial reconnaissance and interviews and that all evidence 
</p>
<p>justifying the findings of the Subcommission were presented in the report.17 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that the report had been criticized for failing to pinpoint 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the incident and that no administrative action had been taken against any 
</p>
<p>individual for the incident. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that human rights violations continued to 
</p>
<p>occur in the context of counter-terrorism operations and that exercise of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of assembly was often viewed by the Government as attempts to weaken the 
</p>
<p>democratic order. In a positive step, Parliament recently adopted the Law on Ending 
</p>
<p>Terrorism and Strengthening Social Integration, which provides for stronger legal grounds 
</p>
<p>for the Kurdish settlement process and legal protection for members of the Kurdistan 
</p>
<p>Workers&#8217; Party (PKK) who surrender arms. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Village guard system 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur raised serious concerns about the village guard system 
</p>
<p>operating throughout Turkey. Village guards have reportedly been involved in human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, including violations of the right to life, and the lack of sufficient safeguards 
</p>
<p>against potential abuses committed by village guards as well as their functioning outside of 
</p>
<p>the standard training and disciplinary procedures applicable to law enforcement officers is 
</p>
<p>of concern (ibid., para. 29). In its comments on the country visit report, the Government of 
</p>
<p>  
 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 </b> 
</p>
<p>Turkey indicated that Law No. 442 on the Villages and the by-law of 2008 governed the 
</p>
<p>village guard system and provided an efficient oversight mechanism (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>24. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government abolish the 
</p>
<p>village guard system (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, para. 102). In 2012, the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights made a similar recommendation, 18 which was echoed 
</p>
<p>during the universal periodic review of Turkey, in 2015 (see A/HRC/WG.6/21/TUR/3, 
</p>
<p>para. 68). The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that no attempt has been made to 
</p>
<p>abolish the village guard system and that village guards remain on active duty. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>25. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the positive measures taken to 
</p>
<p>improve prison conditions and surveillance, which had contributed to a significant decrease 
</p>
<p>in deaths in custody. Nonetheless, deaths in custody continue to occur, the majority after 
</p>
<p>instances of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur recommended the establishment of a national preventive 
</p>
<p>mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, without delay (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, 
</p>
<p>para. 104). The Government stated that the Turkish Human Rights Institution was the 
</p>
<p>designated national preventive mechanism pursuant to Decree no. 2013/5711 which was 
</p>
<p>published in the Official Gazette on 28 January 2014.19 While this may be seen as a positive 
</p>
<p>measure, concerns have been raised about the independence of the Institution and its 
</p>
<p>capacity, in terms of sufficient and trained staff and the budget to fulfil its mandate. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur called for prompt reporting of deaths in custody and 
</p>
<p>independent and public investigations into such deaths. He urged Turkey to ensure that 
</p>
<p>surveillance cameras in security and detention facilities were fully operational and that 
</p>
<p>footage from the cameras was available immediately and in its entirety (ibid., paras. 103 
</p>
<p>and 105). In its response, the Government of Turkey stated that surveillance cameras had 
</p>
<p>been installed in 97 per cent of detention facilities, in all the common areas, including 
</p>
<p>interview rooms.
20
</p>
<p> It also indicated that juvenile detention centres were being equipped 
</p>
<p>with individual self-locking cells and centrally monitored camera systems. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern reports that installed surveillance 
</p>
<p>cameras are not always fully operational. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Suspicious suicides of military conscripts and law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur noted the large number of suicidal deaths of law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers and soldiers and was informed that, in some instances, the suicides 
</p>
<p>may have been falsified or forced. In 2013, the Turkish Defence Minister revealed that 
</p>
<p>between 2002 and 2012, more soldiers had committed suicide than those killed in the 
</p>
<p>performance of their duties. It was reported that 601 soldiers of the Turkish Army were 
</p>
<p>killed in conflict, while 965 soldiers were pronounced dead by suicide. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 See Report by Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, 
</p>
<p>following his visit to Turkey from 10 to 14 October 2011 (CommDH(2012)2), para. 147.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>30. Concern was expressed that formal investigations were never brought, and when 
</p>
<p>conducted, they were inadequate and did not result in the identification of perpetrators nor 
</p>
<p>prosecution. The Special Rapporteur recommended that all cases of suicide in the military 
</p>
<p>or security services be reported promptly, that they be independently and publicly 
</p>
<p>investigated and that families and lawyers be provided with full access to information and 
</p>
<p>sources of evidence (ibid., para. 103). In its response, the Government indicated that the 
</p>
<p>relevant prosecutor was promptly informed of all cases of suicide within the general 
</p>
<p>command of the gendarmerie in order to ensure that a judicial investigation is initiated, and 
</p>
<p>that administrative investigations carried out in the relevant military units were examined 
</p>
<p>by their legal advisers and the necessary steps are taken. All suicides are recorded and first-
</p>
<p>degree relatives are able to intervene at any stage of the investigations or prosecution.21 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur noted failures in transparency in cases of suicide. He called 
</p>
<p>for the establishment of an independent mechanism to receive complaints from the military 
</p>
<p>and to ensure investigations are carried out (ibid., para. 106). The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the report that the parliamentary Human Rights Inquiry Committee has started 
</p>
<p>monitoring complaints from military conscripts of ill-treatment within the military service. 
</p>
<p>The Government has also indicated that all military personnel are screened and interviewed 
</p>
<p>by guidance and counselling centres and that a 24-hour hotline had been established for 
</p>
<p>conscripts wishing to remain anonymous. Conscripts are referred to medical institutions for 
</p>
<p>treatment as necessary and relevant follow-up procedures are carried out.22 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers the activities for the prevention and effective 
</p>
<p>investigation of suicides in the military as a welcome step in the protection of the right to 
</p>
<p>life,23 in particular, the determination of negligent executives in incidents of suicide in the 
</p>
<p>military and measures to prosecute them. 
</p>
<p>33. Nonetheless, despite those positive measures, there is still no independent 
</p>
<p>mechanism to handle complaints from military conscripts; ill-treatment continues; and 
</p>
<p>lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons remain particularly vulnerable. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to respect of the right to life by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from attacks by armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>34. Attacks by various armed groups and acts of terror pose serious threats to the right to 
</p>
<p>life in Turkey, for both law enforcement officials and innocent civilians. The State has a 
</p>
<p>duty to protect civilians from such attacks; bring perpetrators to justice; and ensure that 
</p>
<p>victims of such attacks and their families receive compensation. 
</p>
<p>35. The ceasefire agreement between the Government of Turkey and the Kurdish 
</p>
<p>Workers Party (PKK) is an important step towards ending the three-decade conflict. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has, however, received information of continuing violence, including 
</p>
<p>kidnappings and armed attacks that have resulted in the death of civilians and military 
</p>
<p>personnel.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 </b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Deaths resulting from violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>36. Violations of the right to life of women in Turkey are a serious challenge and were 
</p>
<p>extensively reported to the Special Rapporteur during his visit, especially in the context of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence and &#8220;honour&#8221; killings. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur commended Turkey for ratifying the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence (Istanbul Convention); enacting legislation on the prevention of violence against 
</p>
<p>women; and making efforts to establish a national action plan to fight domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>However, despite those efforts, bold steps are required to ensure the effective and swift 
</p>
<p>implementation of the legal framework. The Special Rapporteur recommended that priority 
</p>
<p>be given to improving the functioning of the protection orders system and establishing a 
</p>
<p>mechanism to regularly monitor the functioning of the system (ibid., para. 112). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur learned that a process was under way to update the activities in the 
</p>
<p>National Action Plan for the period 2016 to 2019 and was aware that a cooperation protocol 
</p>
<p>had been signed by relevant ministries for a pilot project to utilize technical surveillance 
</p>
<p>with a view to combatting violence against women. In that regard, Turkey is also 
</p>
<p>conducting an impact analysis study of Law No. 6284 on Protection of Family and 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Violence against Women.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur recommended that security officers and members of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary be investigated and held accountable for failure to act with regard to registering 
</p>
<p>complaints and issuing and enforcing protection orders (ibid., para.113). 
</p>
<p>39. Although the 2005 Penal Code abolished de facto reduction of sentences for 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of honour killings, uneven legal interpretation of article 82 of the Penal Code 
</p>
<p>has resulting in perpetrators of honour killings receiving lighter sentences. Article 82 of the 
</p>
<p>Code regulates crimes punishable by aggravated life imprisonment and refers to &#8220;custom 
</p>
<p>killing&#8221; rather than &#8220;honour killing&#8221;; some courts have determined that honour killings do 
</p>
<p>not fall within the scope of article 82. The Special Rapporteur recommended that article 
</p>
<p>82 be understood as including honour killings under &#8220;custom&#8221; and that there should be a 
</p>
<p>uniform legal interpretation of that article in order to ensure that the highest penalty is 
</p>
<p>always applied in cases of honour killings (ibid., para. 108). In its response, the 
</p>
<p>Government indicated that Turkey was bound by the Istanbul Convention, which became 
</p>
<p>effective on 1 August 2014 and provides for measures to be adopted to ensure that motives, 
</p>
<p>such as honour, are not considered as an excuse for acts of violence.24 
</p>
<p>40. While the efforts to establish infrastructure necessary to minimizing violence against 
</p>
<p>women are commendable, the rate of violence against women in Turkey remains very high. 
</p>
<p>The violent murder of university student &#214;zgecan Aslan, in February 2015, triggered 
</p>
<p>demonstrations across Turkey protesting violence against women, and the State&#8217;s failure to 
</p>
<p>provide adequate protection to women and ensure prosecutions was brought to the attention 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur. The Government undertook to adopt an action plan to address 
</p>
<p>violence against women. It was also reported that 118,014 women had filed complaints 
</p>
<p>with the police alleging violence in 2014 &#8212; a significant increase from the 82,205 
</p>
<p>complaints registered in 2013.25 The Special Rapporteur called for continued awareness-
</p>
<p>raising campaigns and training of security officials and professionals of the judiciary on the 
</p>
<p>rights of women (ibid., para. 114). In its response, the Government provided comprehensive 
</p>
<p>information on the various measures currently being implemented in that regard. Public 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising meetings were being organized at all levels throughout the State on Law

<p>No. 6284 and its implementation, and other positive measures, including awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>and training for State officials, have been undertaken.26 
</p>
<p>41. The Women&#8217;s Shelter Project for Combating Domestic Violence (2014&#8211;2016) is 
</p>
<p>aimed at strengthening and reinforcing activities to combat violence against women in 
</p>
<p>26 provinces, through the improvement of support services to women victims of violence. It 
</p>
<p>is a capacity-building, training and cooperation project that addresses coordination and 
</p>
<p>quality of shelter service provision, among others. Enhanced collaboration by central and 
</p>
<p>local government bodies and local NGOs and strengthening capacity to combat violence 
</p>
<p>against women are some of the expected results. The United Nations in Turkey has also 
</p>
<p>supported training for judges, prosecutors, the police, armed forces and gendarmerie on 
</p>
<p>gender equality, gender-based violence, international conventions and implementation of 
</p>
<p>preventive and protective legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur highlighted the vulnerability of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transgender persons in Turkey. The Special Rapporteur recommended that Turkey enact 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and specific legislation on hate crimes in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>standards and review legislation to include language sensitive to gender identity and sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation (ibid., paras. 109 and 110). 
</p>
<p>43. Turkey indicated, in its response, that an amendment to article 122 of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code, introduced in 2014, provides for hate crimes.27 However, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes with regret that sexual orientation has not been included as a ground. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that a draft law on the establishment of 
</p>
<p>an anti-discrimination equality board was still pending before the Office of the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister. It is unfortunate that references to gender identity and sexual orientation were 
</p>
<p>removed from the bill in the early stages of drafting.28 Turkey has yet to enact hate crime-
</p>
<p>specific legislation that is inclusive of gender identity and sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>45. The Law to Protect Family and Prevent Violence Against Women is silent on gender 
</p>
<p>identity and sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>46. The challenges relating to the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>persons are exacerbated by the attitude of some family members of such individuals, as 
</p>
<p>well as the trend observed by the Special Rapporteur during his visit, whereby law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials and the judiciary seem to take a lenient attitude towards crimes 
</p>
<p>committed against such individuals. In order to address those challenges, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommended that awareness-raising campaigns and training should be 
</p>
<p>launched on the rights of those individuals (ibid., para. 114). The Government of Turkey 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur that members of the judiciary were under an obligation to 
</p>
<p>investigate and adjudicate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons.29 
</p>
<p>Despite this, it appears that discrimination and lenient attitudes continue, in practice.<footnote name="3">1 A/HRC/WG.6/21/TUR/3, para. 38; and CCPR/TUR/CO/1, para. 11.  </footnote>0 The

</p>
<p>persons are taking place in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to life of journalists 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur highlighted the vulnerability of journalists based on 
</p>
<p>information received about the risks faced by journalists in the performance of their 
</p>
<p>activities. He recommended that all complaints of violence and death threats be promptly 
</p>
<p>registered and effectively investigated, that a system to monitor the registration and 
</p>
<p>investigation of such complaints be developed and, where there is sufficient evidence of 
</p>
<p>violation, criminal investigations and prosecutions should be initiated (ibid., para. 111). 
</p>
<p>48. Commenting on the recommendation, the Government of Turkey highlighted the 
</p>
<p>system of reporting and of investigating death threats under article 158 of the Turkish 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure Code and Circular 10 from the High Council of Judges and 
</p>
<p>Prosecutors. Those provisions require prosecutors to criminally investigate all allegations 
</p>
<p>regarding death threats, regardless of the victim&#8217;s willingness to file a formal complaint. 
</p>
<p>The complaint is referred to the relevant administrative authority, which will provide 
</p>
<p>protection to the individual. Disciplinary investigations are initiated if it is found that the 
</p>
<p>administrative authority failed to provide such protection (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, 
</p>
<p>paras. 33&#8211;36). 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the joint project by Turkey and the European 
</p>
<p>Union to train approximately 400 new judges and prosecutors in &#8220;effective investigations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killings in the 1990s and mass graves 
</b></p>
<p>50. In his report, the Special Rapporteur noted that only a handful of trials have been 
</p>
<p>conducted in relation to the thousands of unresolved execution-type killings, deaths in 
</p>
<p>custody and enforced disappearances suspected to have been committed by State officials 
</p>
<p>and members of the PKK during the 1990s The Special Rapporteur was informed, and other 
</p>
<p>international bodies have also noted, the lack of a comprehensive approach to the right to 
</p>
<p>remedy and reparation for victims of human rights abuses during that period.31 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur urged the State authorities to ensure that the killings that occurred in the 1990s 
</p>
<p>are investigated in a transparent manner and that the perpetrators are brought to justice. He 
</p>
<p>expressed concern at the discovery of mass graves, which are believed to contain the 
</p>
<p>remains of victims of enforced disappearances and members of illegal militant 
</p>
<p>organizations, dating back to the 1980s. The Special Rapporteur emphasized the importance 
</p>
<p>of ensuring investigations into the graves, in conformity with the United Nations Model 
</p>
<p>Protocol for a Legal Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
</p>
<p>(Minnesota Protocol). 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur recommended the establishment of an independent body to 
</p>
<p>investigate political killings that remain unaccounted for and to make recommendations 
</p>
<p>regarding prosecutions and other transitional justice and accountability measures (see 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, para. 115). The Human Rights Committee made a similar 
</p>
<p>recommendation in 2012.32 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the Government of Turkey&#8217;s comment that 
</p>
<p>special prosecution offices tasked with investigating political and mass killings existed in 
</p>
<p>11 regions of the country (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, para. 37). However, he notes with 
</p>
<p>regret that an independent investigatory body has not been established. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur also called for an urgent forensic investigation into the mass 
</p>
<p>graves, in compliance with the Minnesota Protocol, and for the involvement of the families 
</p>
<p>of the victims in said investigation (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, para. 116). In its response, 
</p>
<p>Turkey indicated that on the application of the &#350;anliurfa office of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Association, a delegation from the Turkish Human Rights Institution undertook on-site 
</p>
<p>investigations in &#350;anliurfa and Siverek into allegations that human bones had been found 
</p>
<p>during an excavation. A report of the investigation was published on the website of the 
</p>
<p>Institution and sent to the relevant authorities.33 
</p>
<p><b> B. Effectiveness of investigations and length of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur stated that impunity for killings manifested itself in slow or 
</p>
<p>inadequate investigations and prosecutions and was widely believed to be due to lack of 
</p>
<p>political will, exacerbated by a deferential approach to the executive by prosecutors, as well 
</p>
<p>as shortcomings in the independent and effective functioning of the judiciary, inadequate 
</p>
<p>forensic services and lack of an independent complaints mechanism regarding law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials. He recommended that crime scene investigation procedures be 
</p>
<p>improved and monitored so that violations by State actors are investigated independently 
</p>
<p>and that the Forensic Medicine Institute be endowed with independence, and its capacity 
</p>
<p>increased to conduct forensic and autopsy procedures in a swift, effective, impartial and 
</p>
<p>transparent manner (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, paras. 58, 118 and 119). 
</p>
<p>55. The Government indicated that the Forensic Medicine Institute was subordinate to 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice, and that it carried out its work impartially. The participation of 
</p>
<p>impartial experts assigned by parties was permitted and the Institute is a member of the 
</p>
<p>European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). The Government explained that 
</p>
<p>prosecutors tasked the Gendarmerie to conduct preliminary investigations where the crime 
</p>
<p>is alleged to have been perpetrated by the Police, and vice versa. It stated that, in instances 
</p>
<p>where both the Police and Gendarmerie are jointly implicated, the prosecutor would carry 
</p>
<p>out the investigation and collect all the evidence (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, paras. 18 and 
</p>
<p>19). However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that, in practice, the same police or 
</p>
<p>gendarmerie units alleged to have committed the violation often undertake the collection 
</p>
<p>and recording of forensic evidence. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes that no reform has been undertaken in relation to the 
</p>
<p>functioning of the Forensic Medicine Institute. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the application of the statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations for unlawful killings further aggravated the climate of impunity. He 
</p>
<p>recommended that the statute of limitations be removed for all violations of the right to life 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, paras. 62 and 117). The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact 
</p>
<p>that the statute of limitations, due to a recent amendment, no longer applies to the crime of 
</p>
<p>torture. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 </b> 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that the provision removing the statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations for prosecution of torture would not be applied retrospectively, thereby limiting 
</p>
<p>access to justice for thousands of killings and enforced disappearances that occurred in the 
</p>
<p>1990s. In its comment, Turkey indicated that prosecutors and judges, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the principles established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>were required to interpret the provision in a broad manner, which would ensure that the 
</p>
<p>interpretation precludes the application of the provisions on statutory limitations for all acts 
</p>
<p>considered as crimes against humanity, genocide and torture (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.6, 
</p>
<p>para. 22). In the light of that information, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to learn 
</p>
<p>that a military prosecutor had handed down the decision to close a case concerning the 
</p>
<p>aerial bombardment by the Turkish Air Force in 1994 of two villages in the southeast, in 
</p>
<p>which dozens of villagers were killed, on the grounds that the statute of limitations had 
</p>
<p>been exceeded, despite the ruling by the European Court, which found violations of the 
</p>
<p>right to life, and lack of an effective investigation. 34 
</p>
<p><b> C. De facto immunity of public officials 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the lack of clarity as to whether 
</p>
<p>administrative permission was required from the relevant Governor in order to initiate legal 
</p>
<p>proceedings against public officials in instances of unlawful killings. He recommended that, 
</p>
<p>if no such administrative authorization was required, the Government should make that fact 
</p>
<p>more widely known and that prosecutors should immediately cease the practice of waiting 
</p>
<p>for such authorization before initiating proceedings (see A/HRC/23/47/Add.2, paras. 64, 65 
</p>
<p>and 123). 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was informed that initiation of investigations and 
</p>
<p>prosecutions of law enforcement officials is still subject, in practice, to the requirement of 
</p>
<p>administrative authorization. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the unnecessarily slow pace of 
</p>
<p>investigations and prosecutions of law enforcement officials, which seems to continue 
</p>
<p>despite the concerns that have been raised. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in some cases, public officials suspected 
</p>
<p>of having committed human rights violations have been promoted. He urged the 
</p>
<p>Government to ensure that officials under investigation for a violation of the right to life are 
</p>
<p>not allowed to remain on active duty nor receive a promotion (ibid., paras. 67 and 124). In 
</p>
<p>its response, Turkey indicated that, under article 65 of the Personnel Law of the Turkish 
</p>
<p>Armed Forces, military personnel suspended from duty or detained on remand may not be 
</p>
<p>promoted, and further action is taken based on the outcome of the legal proceedings.35 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that suspension of promotion and benefits should 
</p>
<p>apply to all public officials suspected of having committed a violation of the right to life 
</p>
<p>and should not be limited to those individuals who have been suspended from duty or 
</p>
<p>detained on remand. 
</p>
<p>63. In his report, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the importance of creating an 
</p>
<p>independent complaints mechanism to combat impunity among public officials. He 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the Government&#8217;s efforts to create such a mechanism, including the draft 
</p>
<p>law on Law Enforcement Monitoring Mechanism 2012, but expressed concern about the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 34 European Court of Human Rights, <i>Benzer &amp; Others </i>v.<i> Turkey </i>(Application no. 23502/06), judgement 
</p>
<p>of 12 November 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>organizational independence of the commission to be created pursuant to the draft law. He 
</p>
<p>urged Turkey to ensure the organizational independence and the impartiality of the 
</p>
<p>oversight commission to be created, and recommended that a similar monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanism be established to examine complaints regarding all acts of the Turkish Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces and the military duties of the Gendarmerie (ibid., paras. 62 and 125). 
</p>
<p>64. The Government of Turkey stated that the Boards of Inspection and Internal 
</p>
<p>Monitoring Units attached to the General Command of the Gendarmerie examined 
</p>
<p>complaints relating to the military duties of the Gendarmerie.36 The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the internal oversight procedures within the Gendarmerie, but again urges the 
</p>
<p>Government of Turkey to establish a complaint mechanism that is both functionally and 
</p>
<p>operationally independent to ensure accountability for the violations of the right to life. He 
</p>
<p>notes that the Ministry of the Interior has taken some positive steps towards the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an Independent Law Enforcement Complaints Commission in the context 
</p>
<p>of the European Union pre-accession programme. However, concern remains regarding the 
</p>
<p>independence of the Commission as it will be composed primarily of members from the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior, as such close ties with the executive branch risks hampering the 
</p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s ability to execute effective oversight.37 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reprisals 
</b></p>
<p>65. In his report, the Special Rapporteur noted that the climate of impunity was 
</p>
<p>reinforced by the practice of reprisals against witnesses, families of the victims and human 
</p>
<p>rights organizations, by the filing of countercharges. Often the countercharge cases proceed 
</p>
<p>more swiftly than the investigation into the original case. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recommended that Turkey take steps to reverse and stop the trend of reprisals against 
</p>
<p>complainants and ensure investigation into and accountability for all cases of threats and 
</p>
<p>coercion (ibid., paras. 70, 71 and 126). The Special Rapporteur continues to receive reports 
</p>
<p>of reprisal action being taken against complainants of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was informed of threats and intimidation against victims, 
</p>
<p>their families, witnesses and human rights advocates, resulting in unwillingness on their 
</p>
<p>part to participate in legal proceedings due to fear of harm. The Special Rapporteur urged 
</p>
<p>Turkey to strengthen witness and victim protection as a priority (ibid., paras. 73 and 127). 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the implementation of the European Union 
</p>
<p>Twinning Project on strengthening witness protection capacities in Turkey, through which 
</p>
<p>witness hearing rooms are to be built for each court located in the main cities of 
</p>
<p>81 provinces. The rooms will allow for two-way simultaneous audio and visual 
</p>
<p>transmission, which will allow the identity of the witnesses to remain anonymous and 
</p>
<p>protect them from risk of harm.38  
</p>
<p><b> E. Prosecutorial and judicial discretion 
</b></p>
<p>68. Problems with accountability in Turkey are sometimes exacerbated by the 
</p>
<p>inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial and judicial discretion. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 State response, October 2014. 
</p>
<p> 37 See Biriz Berksoy, <i>Military, Police and Intelligence in Turkey: Recent transformations and needs for 
</i></p>
<p><i>reform</i>, TESEV Democratization Programme, Policy Report Series (June 2013), p. 24, available from 
</p>
<p>http://www.tesev.org.tr/assets/publications/file/01082013160934.pdf.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 </b> 
</p>
<p>made recommendations aimed at overcoming some of those challenges and strengthening 
</p>
<p>accountability measures, including that, in cases of unlawful killing, the prosecutor should 
</p>
<p>always bring charges for killing and never for a lesser crime and should not misuse certain 
</p>
<p>arguments to reduce sentences (ibid., paras. 75, 120 and 121).  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the clarification by the Government that 
</p>
<p>prosecutors are required to act in accordance with the duties and powers entrusted by the 
</p>
<p>Code of Criminal Procedure, and that it is not possible to bring charges for a lesser crime in 
</p>
<p>instances of killing.39 However, he is still concerned about reports received that public 
</p>
<p>officials often receive lighter sentences when found guilty of torture, ill-treatment or even 
</p>
<p>fatal shootings.40 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the practice of misusing arguments of 
</p>
<p>mitigating factors continues, especially in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>victims. The broad framing of article 29 of the Criminal Code without a definition or 
</p>
<p>guidelines on the meaning of &#8220;unjust act&#8221; could allow for a subjective interpretation and 
</p>
<p>abuse of the provisions of the article. With regard to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>persons, the courts sometimes reduce the sentence of the perpetrator by deciding that the 
</p>
<p>victim&#8217;s sexual orientation or gender identity itself constitutes an &#8220;unjust act&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that accountability for violations to the 
</p>
<p>right to life is further hindered by the workload and backlog of cases in the judicial system, 
</p>
<p>which creates additional barriers to accessing remedies for violations. The Government of 
</p>
<p>Turkey has taken various positive steps in that regard, including increasing the number of 
</p>
<p>chambers and members of the Court of Cassation and the Council of State; creating district 
</p>
<p>and regional courts of appeal (which are not yet operational); and improving the legal aid 
</p>
<p>system. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Role of human rights mechanisms in upholding the right 
to life 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Creation of the Turkish Human Rights Institution 
</b></p>
<p>72. In his country visit report, the Special Rapporteur considered the creation of the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Human Rights Institution as potentially an important step in strengthening the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, including the right to life. However, there was concern about 
</p>
<p>the independence of the institution. The Special Rapporteur underlined the importance of 
</p>
<p>ensuring the independence of the Institution, in law and in practice, and recommended that 
</p>
<p>the legal framework be reviewed to assess the level of conformity with the principles 
</p>
<p>relating to the status of national institutions (Paris Principles) (see General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 48/134, annex) (ibid., paras. 82, 83 and 128). 
</p>
<p>73. The Government of Turkey provided a comprehensive outline of the measures that, 
</p>
<p>in its view, are in place to ensure the independence of the Institution, 41  including the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an independent institution vested with legal personality, and the 
</p>
<p>administrative and financial autonomy to use its powers and perform its duties 
</p>
<p>independently of any other body, authority or person. The Government stated that the 
</p>
<p>functions of the Turkish Human Rights Institution included all those specified in the Paris 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 39 State response, October 2014. 
</p>
<p> 40 See Amnesty International &#8220;Turkey: Ali Ismail Korkmaz convictions fail to bring justice&#8221;, public 
</p>
<p>statement (21 January 2015). 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Principles, namely, protection of all human rights, in particular civil, political, economic 
</p>
<p>and social rights. It stated that the law establishing the Institution conferred upon it the 
</p>
<p>powers and duties which enable effective communication with the social forces (of civilian 
</p>
<p>society) involved in the protection and promotion of human rights to ensure the 
</p>
<p>representation of those forces in the Institution in a pluralist manner. The Government 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the Turkish Human Rights Institution is in compliance with the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles. 
</p>
<p>74. Nonetheless, there have been indications that the law establishing the Turkish 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Institution is still widely regarded as falling short of the Paris Principles, 
</p>
<p>especially in relation to its independence from the executive branch. United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms have recommended that the law be amended to guarantee the organic 
</p>
<p>and financial independence of the national human rights institution, in full compliance with 
</p>
<p>the Paris Principles. 42  Concerns have also been expressed that the Subcommittee on 
</p>
<p>Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Institutions has not reviewed the Turkish Human Rights Institution, nor has the Institution 
</p>
<p>requested a review. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Creation of the Ombudsman Institution 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Ombudsman Institution is accountable to Parliament and is tasked with 
</p>
<p>receiving and investigating complaints and making recommendations on the functioning of 
</p>
<p>the public administration. The Special Rapporteur considers the Institution as an important 
</p>
<p>entity and urged the Ombudsman to uphold genuine commitment to protecting human 
</p>
<p>rights and to conduct impartial and independent investigations. 
</p>
<p>76. The Government of Turkey stated that violations of fundamental human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the rights of women, children and detainees were given priority by the Institution 
</p>
<p>and that the Ombudsman played an important function in ensuring the accountability and 
</p>
<p>transparency of the administration. It highlighted that complaints received by the Institution 
</p>
<p>related mainly to public administration, education and training, labour as well as social 
</p>
<p>security. As of September 2014, the Ombudsman had reportedly examined over 6,097 of 
</p>
<p>11,580 complaints received in its first two years of operation. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur recommended that Turkey consider amending the Law on 
</p>
<p>the Ombudsman Institution to enable it to examine violations committed in all instances by 
</p>
<p>the Turkish Armed Forces (ibid., para. 129). The law has not yet been amended to include 
</p>
<p>such violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur recommended that Turkey consider ratifying the 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of Persons from Enforced Disappearance and 
</p>
<p>the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ibid., paras. 130 and 131). Turkey 
</p>
<p>has not yet ratified either of those international treaties. Turkey has reiterated its 
</p>
<p>determination to ensure continued cooperation with the special procedures of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations.43 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4

<p><b>18 </b> 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Turkey continues to face various challenges in relation to the protection of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to life. Actions by State and non-State actors continue to pose a threat to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>lives of innocent civilians and public officials alike. Vulnerable groups remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly at risk. The lack of fully independent mechanisms for accountability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the great challenges experienced in the judicial system feed into the practice as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the perception of impunity in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Despite the challenges, a number of positive measures have already been put in 
</b></p>
<p><b>place. The Action Plan for the Prevention of Violations of the European Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Human Rights is a welcome initiative and should be fully implemented. Measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken to protect women from violence and unlawful killings are a welcome first step, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but they need to be fully implemented in order to ensure effective protection, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice. Protection of other vulnerable groups, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transgender persons, is seriously lacking, in law and in practice. Law reform must 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to bring domestic laws into full compliance with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. The continued commitment of the Government of Turkey to work with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and international bodies to strengthen the human rights situation in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country is welcomed. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation</b>44<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>Turkey should amend article 17 of its Constitution to bring the formulation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to life in line with international standards, by providing that no one shall be 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrarily deprived of his or her life or similar wording to that effect.</b> 
</p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>2. <b>The laws regulating the use of force by law enforcement officers (Law No. 2559 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the Duties and Powers of the Police; Law No. 2803 on the Organization, duties and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Powers of the Gendarmerie, and related regulation) should be brought in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards. Both proportionality and necessity are crucial components of 
</b></p>
<p>these standards. The terms &#8220;necessity&#8221; and &#8220;proportionality&#8221; in these texts should 
</p>
<p><b>reflect their interpretation under international law: lethal force may be made only as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a last resort to protect life. Regulations on the stop warning procedure and on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportionate use of less lethal weapons should be promulgated and conform to these 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards.</b> 
</p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>(Additional) Article 2 of Law No. 3713 to Fight Terrorism should likewise be 
</b></p>
<p>amended to reflect the international interpretation of the term &#8220;proportionality&#8221; and 
</p>
<p><b>should stipulate that lethal force shall only be used as a last resort where there is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>imminent threat to life. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>4. <b>Security officers should receive further training on the principles of necessity 
</b></p>
<p><b>and proportionality, including on the appropriate use of methods other than lethal 
</b></p>
<p><b>weapons. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>There can be no justification for human rights violations in the name of 
</b></p>
<p><b>counter-terrorism measures. Operations to counter terrorism may resort to force only 
</b></p>
<p><b>when it is necessary and proportionate, as defined under international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law. Civilian harm should be minimized and civilians never be targeted. Injury or 
</b></p>
<p><b>killing of civilians should be subject to prompt and thorough investigation and, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, accountability. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>An effective, prompt, impartial and transparent criminal investigation into the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uludere/Roboski incident should be undertaken as a matter of great priority. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals responsible should be held liable and sanctioned accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibility should include those implicated in the chain of command, irrespective 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their position. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 </b> 
</p>
<p>7. <b>The Uludere Sub-Commission at the TGNA should release its overdue final 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports without delay as well as ensure full transparency in its work and publish the 
</b></p>
<p><b>content of all evidence used for its findings. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>The Government should abolish the village guard system. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>All cases of suicide in the military or security services and deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be reported promptly, as well as independently and publicly investigated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish the actual cause of death. Families and lawyers should have full access to this 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and to any other sources of evidence as well as the possibility for cross-
</b></p>
<p><b>check examinations. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>10. The National Preventive Mechanism should be set up in line with Turkey&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been implemented. 
</p>
<p>11. <b>It should be ensured that surveillance cameras are fully operational in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>security and detention facilities, including at military custody sites, and their footage 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be entirely and immediately available when it may provide evidence of abuse. 
</b></p>
<p> Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>There should be an independent channel through which military conscripts can 
</b></p>
<p><b>complain of abuse or ill-treatment and these cases should be investigated. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to life and non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>13. <b>There can be no justification under any circumstances for acts of terrorism. All 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups engaged in terrorism should cease such activity with immediate effect. 
</b></p>
<p> Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>Article 82 (k) of the Penal Code should be understood to include honour 
</b></p>
<p>killings under &#8220;custom&#8221;. Uniform legal interpretation of the provisions of this article 
</p>
<p><b>should be provided to ensure the highest penalty is always applied in cases of honour 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Turkey should enact comprehensive and specific legislation on hate crimes in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with international standards, in particular, articles 19 and 20 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has partially been implemented. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>To reduce the vulnerable situation of LGBT individuals, Turkish legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be reviewed to include language sensitive to gender identity and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>All complaints of violence and death threats should be promptly registered by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the security officers, as well as fully and effectively investigated. Turkey should </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop a monitoring system on the registration and investigation of such complaints. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Where there is sufficient evidence of violations, the professionals of the judiciary 
</b></p>
