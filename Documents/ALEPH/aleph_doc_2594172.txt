Filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)
Registration No. 333-210686
Prospectus Supplement No. 2
to prospectus dated April 20, 2016
This prospectus supplement no. 2 supplements and amends our prospectus dated April 20,
2016, as previously supplemented by prospectus supplement no. 1 dated May 16, 2016, which
we refer to collectively as the “prospectus.” The prospectus relates to the offer and resale of up to
25,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, by the selling stockholder,
River North Equity, LLC (“River North”). All of such shares represent shares that River North has
agreed to purchase from us pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Equity Purchase
Agreement we entered into with them on March 16, 2016 (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the right to “put,”
or sell, up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock to River North. This arrangement is
also sometimes referred to in the prospectus as the “Equity Line.” We will not receive any
proceeds from the resale of shares of common stock by River North. We will, however, receive
proceeds from the sale of shares directly to River North pursuant to the Equity Line.
On August 15, 2016, we filed a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a copy of which is attached hereto, although
the exhibits to such report have been omitted. The information contained in the attached Form
10-Q report supplements and amends the information contained in the prospectus.
This prospectus supplement no. 2 should be read in conjunction with, and delivered with, the
prospectus and is qualified by reference to the prospectus except to the extent that the
information in this prospectus supplement no. 2 supersedes the information contained in the
prospectus.
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace operated by the OTC Markets Group,
Inc., or “OTCQB,” under the ticker symbol “ECPN.” On August 11, 2016, the average of the high
and low sales prices of our common stock was $0.145 per share.
Investing in our common stock involves significant risk. See the “Risk Factors” section of
the prospectus.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission
has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if the prospectus or this
prospectus supplement no. 2 is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is
a criminal offense.
The date of this prospectus supplement no. 2 is August 15, 2016.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING EXPLORATION STAGE STATUS
We are considered an “exploration stage” company under the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, Description of Property by Issuers
Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations (“Industry Guide 7”), because
we do not have reserves as defined under Industry Guide 7.  Reserves are defined in
Industry Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit which can be economically and legally
extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.  The establishment of
reserves under Industry Guide 7 requires, among other things, certain spacing of
exploratory drill holes to establish the required continuity of mineralization and the
completion of a detailed cost or feasibility study.
Because we have no reserves as defined in Industry Guide 7, we have not exited the
exploration stage and continue to report our financial information as an exploration stage
entity as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).  Although
for purposes of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 915, Development Stage
Entities, we have exited the development stage and no longer report inception to date
results of operations, cash flows and other financial information, we will remain an
exploration stage company under Industry Guide 7 until such time as we demonstrate
reserves in accordance with the criteria in Industry Guide 7.
Because we have no reserves, we have and will continue to expense all mine construction
costs, even though these expenditures are expected to have a future economic benefit in
excess of one year.  We also expense our reclamation and remediation costs at the time
the obligations are incurred.  Companies that have reserves and have exited the
exploration stage typically capitalize these costs, and subsequently amortize them on a
units-of-production basis as reserves are mined, with the resulting depletion charge
allocated to inventory, and then to cost of sales as the inventory is sold.  As a result of
these and other differences, our financial statements will not be comparable to the
financial statements of mining companies that have established reserves and have exited
the exploration stage.

Table of Contents
SEC INDUSTRY GUIDE 7 DEFINITIONS
The following definitions are taken from the mining industry guide entitled “Description of
Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations”
contained in the Securities Act Industry Guides published by the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission, as amended.
Exploration
State
The term “exploration state” (or “exploration stage”) includes all issuers engaged in
 
the search for mineral deposits (reserves) which are not in either the development
or production stage.
  
The term “development stage” includes all issuers engaged in the preparation of
Development
an established commercially mineable deposit (reserves) for its extraction which
 
Stage
are not in the production stage. This stage occurs after completion of a feasibility
study.
Mineralized
Material
Probable
(Indicated)
Reserve
Production
Stage
Proven
(Measured)
Reserve
Reserve
The term “mineralized material” refers to material that is not included in the reserve
 
as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or
legal extraction.
  
The term “probable reserve” or “indicated reserve” refers to reserves for which
quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that
used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and
 
measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The
degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough
to assume continuity between points of observation.
  
The term “production stage” includes all issuers engaged in the exploitation of a
 
mineral deposit (reserve).
  
The term “proven reserve” or “measured reserve” refers to reserves for which (a)
quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or
drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling
 
and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely
and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral
content of reserves are well-established.
  
The term “reserve” refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be
economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination. Reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable
standards that demonstrates the economic extraction. (“Bankable standards”
 
implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in
the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing.) A
reserve includes adjustments to the in-situ tons and grade to include diluting
materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain certain “forward-looking” statements as
such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations
and releases, which represent the registrant’s expectations or beliefs, including but not
limited to, statements concerning the registrant’s operations, economic performance,
financial condition, growth and acquisition strategies, investments, and future operational
plans. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of
historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,”
“intend,” “could,” “estimate,” “might,” “plan,” “predict” or “continue” or the negative or
other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-
looking statements. These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and
uncertainties, certain of which are beyond the registrant’s control, and actual results may
differ materially depending on a variety of important factors, including uncertainty related
to acquisitions, governmental regulation, managing and maintaining growth, the
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, volatility of stock price, commercial
viability of any mineral deposits and any other factors identified in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, 2016, or discussed herein or in the
Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company
does not intend or undertake to update the information in this Form 10-Q if any forward-
looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Business, Operations and Organization
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of El Capitan Precious Metals,
Inc, a Nevada corporation, (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim
financial information. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”) for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. Interim
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the
fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, or for any subsequent period. These interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on January 11, 2016 (the
“2015 Form 10-K”). The consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2015, has been
derived from the audited financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K.
Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure
contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the 2015 Form
10-K have been omitted.
The Company is an exploration stage company as defined by the SEC Industry Guide 7 as
the Company has no established reserves as required under the Industry Guide 7. We are
principally engaged in the exploration of precious metals and other minerals on the El
Capitan property located near Capitan, New Mexico (the “El Capitan Property”). The
Company is in mineral exploration state activities and has obtained permitting from the
State of New Mexico Minerals and Mining Division to expand the Company’s mineral
exploration activities and the process of entering into the production stage of operations.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc., a Delaware corporation; Gold
and Minerals Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation; and El Capitan, Ltd, an Arizona
corporation. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
The Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively hereinafter
referred to as the “Company,” “our” or “we.”
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period
presentation.
Basis of Presentation and Going Concern
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method
of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP"), and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company currently has a minimum source of revenue to cover its costs.
 The Company has incurred a loss of $1,272,698 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016
and has a working capital deficit of $1,537,932 as of June 30, 2016. The negative working
capital position includes a noncash derivative instrument liability of $231,856. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
To continue as a going concern, the Company is dependent on achievement of cash flow
and future profits from entering the production stage of operations. The Company does
not have adequate liquidity to fund its current operations, meet its obligations and
continue as a going concern. The Company has secured working capital loans as set forth
below to assist in financing its activities in the near term.
Loan Date
 
December 2015 $92,000
January 2016    156,000
March 2016
   73,800
Net Proceeds
The Company is also pursuing other financing alternatives, including short-term
operational strategic financing or equity financing, to fund its activities until it can achieve
cash flow and profits from its operations. See Note 6 for additional information.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash, investments,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, approximate their carrying
amounts because of the short maturities of these instruments or because of restrictions.
Management Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods.
Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the
estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Cash
The Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less as cash. At times, cash in banks may be in excess of the FDIC limits.
The Company has no cash equivalents.
Inventory
Inventories include mineralized material stockpile, concentrate and iron ore inventories, as
described below. Inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable
value, in the case of mineralized material stockpile and concentrate inventories and
minimal cost is attributable to the iron ore inventories. The net realizable value of
mineralized material stockpile inventories represents the estimated future sales price of
the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to
complete production and bring the product to sale. Concentrate inventories are carried at
the lower of full cost of production or net realizable value based on current metals prices.
Write-downs of inventory will be reported as a component of production costs applicable
to sales.

Ore Stockpile Inventory
Ore stockpile inventory represents mineralized materials that have been mined and are
available for further processing. Costs are allocated to mineralized material stockpile
inventories based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current
mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the mineralized material.
Concentrates
Concentrates inventory include metal concentrates located either at the Company’s El
Capitan Property mine site or in transit to a customer’s site for additional processing
and/or refining. Inventories consist of mineralized material that contains mainly gold and
silver mineralization. Concentrate inventories are carried at the lower of full cost of
production or market based on current metals prices.
Iron Ore
The high grade iron ore material is inventoried and valued at the lower of cost or market.
Any proceeds from the sale of iron ore will offset the cost of mining the mineralized ore.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of two certificates of deposits in favor of the New Mexico
Minerals and Mining Division for a total of $74,503. The amount was increased $59,495
during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 with the issuance of the Company’s
expanded mining permit and is posted as a financial assurance for required reclamation
work to be completed on mined acreage.
Exploration Property Costs
Exploration property costs are expensed as incurred until such time as economic
reserves are quantified. To date the Company has not established any proven or probable
reserves on the El Capitan Property. The Company has capitalized $1,864,608 of
exploration property acquisition costs reflecting its investment in the El Capitan Property.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow or,
market risks.
The Company reviews the terms of convertible debt, equity instruments and other
financing arrangements to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments,
including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted
for separately as a derivative financial instrument. Also, in connection with the issuance of
financing instruments, the Company may issue freestanding options or warrants that may,
depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than
as equity. The Company may also issue options or warrants to non-employees in
connection with consulting or other services.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes
in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For warrant-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value
the derivative instruments. To the extent that the initial fair values of the freestanding
and/or bifurcated derivative instrument liabilities exceed the total proceeds received, an
immediate charge to income is recognized, in order to initially record the derivative
instrument liabilities at their fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
The discount from the face value of the convertible debt or equity instruments resulting
from allocating some or all of the proceeds to the derivative instruments, together with the
stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through
periodic charges to income, using the effective interest method.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. If
reclassification is required, the fair value of the derivative instrument, as of the
determination date, is reclassified. Any previous charges or credits to income for changes
in the fair value of the derivative instrument are not reversed. Derivative instrument
liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or
not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve
months of the balance sheet date.
The Company had derivative financial instruments with a fair value of $231,856 at June 30,
2016.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognized stock-based compensation aggregating $328,070 and $593,253
for common stock options and common stock issued to administrative personnel and
consultants during the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
When revenue is generated from operations, it will be recognized in accordance with
FASB ASC 605. In general, the Company will recognize revenue when (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue generated and costs incurred under an arrangement will be reported on a net
basis in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45. There was nominal revenue generated for the
nine months ended June 30, 2016 from test loads of iron ore to the construction
contractor.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Other than as set forth below, management does not believe that any recently issued, but
not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on
the accompanying financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 “Interest – Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.” ASU No. 2015-03
provides that an entity: (1) present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability rather than as an asset;
and (2) report amortization of debt issuance costs as interest expense. Company has
adopted ASU No. 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, which has no material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11,
“Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” Topic 330, “Inventory,”
currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market
could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an
approximately normal profit margin. The amendments do not apply to inventory that is
measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments
apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-
out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure in scope inventory at the lower of
cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the
ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal,
and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured
using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this Update more closely
align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in
International Financial Reporting Standards. For public business entities, the amendments
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted of ASU 2015-11 as of December 31, 2015,
which has no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In November 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Income
Taxes (Topic 740) Related to the Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which will
require entities to present deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) as
noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  The ASU simplifies the current guidance (ASC
740-10-45-4), which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current and
noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. 
The Board decided to allow all entities to early adopt the ASU for financial statements that
had not been issued.  The Company has adopted ASU 2015-17 as of December 31, 2015,
which has no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”)  2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10).” The
amendments require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in
the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the
equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The
amendments also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income
the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair
value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the
amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and the
requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the
fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized
cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company does not expect to early adopt this guidance and does not believe
that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09
amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted any interim or annual period. If early adopted, an
entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6 – NOTES PAYABLE
Agreements with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC
Under an agreement with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”) dated February 28,
2014, Logistica agreed to remit a $400,000 payment on the Company’s behalf that
represented the remaining balance of the Company’s purchase price for a heavy ore
trailing separation line to be used for processing of mineralized material at the El Capitan
Property mine site. The Company previously remitted $100,000 toward the purchase of
such equipment. In consideration for Logistica remitting such payment, the Company
agreed to deliver a $400,000 promissory note to Logistica and issued 2,500,000 shares of
common stock to a designee of Logistica under the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.
The promissory note accrues interest at 4.5%, with principal and accrued interest
payments to be made out of the Company’s proceeds from sale of iron extracted from
mineralized material as part of the Company’s exploration activities. The relative fair value
of the common stock was determined to be $222,222 and was recorded as a discount to
the promissory note that was amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the
note through August 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015,
amortization expense of $158,559 was recognized. The outstanding balance under this
note payable was $400,000 and the unamortized discount on the note payable was $0 as
of June 30, 2016. Accrued interest on the note at June 30, 2016 was $42,066.
On January 5, 2016, the Company entered into a new agreement with Logistica. Under the
agreement the Company will provide to Logistica concentrated ore to their specifications
at the mine site. Logistica will transport, process, and refine the precious metals
concentrates to sell to precious metals buyers. This agreement is in addition to and
complements the previously announced agreement for the sale of iron ore for use in
construction. The terms of the new agreement provide for the recovery of hard costs
related to the concentrates by both parties prior to the distribution of profits. The
agreement also provides for the future issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s
restricted common stock and the elimination of a $100,000 accrued liability to Logistica for
prior services rendered. The issuance date of shares is anticipated to occur in August
2016. The new agreement supersedes the previous agreements with Logistica.
October 17, 2014 Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement
On October 17, 2014, the Company entered into a private Note and Warrant Purchase
Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company borrowed
$500,000 against delivery of a promissory note (the “2014 Note”) in such amount and
issued warrants to purchase 882,352 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Note
and Warrant Purchase Agreement. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 8% per
annum, was initially due on July 17, 2015 and is secured by a first priority security interest
in all right, title and interest of the Company in and to the net proceeds received by the
Company from its sale of tailings separated from iron recovered by the Company at the El
Capitan Property. On August 24, 2015, the 2014 Note was mutually extended from July 17,
2015 to January 17, 2016. In consideration of the extension, the Company amended the
common stock purchase warrant to purchase 4,714,286 shares (subject to adjustment) of
the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.07 per share. The warrant dated
October 17, 2014 was cancelled. On January 19, 2016, the amended 2014 Note was
extended from January 17, 2016 to September 19, 2016. In consideration of the extension,
the Company issued to the investor a fully vested three year common stock purchase
warrant to purchase 471,429 shares (subject to adjustment) of common stock of the
Company at an exercise price of $0.051 per share, the closing price on the date of the
agreed extension agreement. The fair value of the warrants was determined to be $16,775
using Black-Scholes option price model and was expensed during the three months
ended March, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under the amended 2014

insurance premiums in the amount of $6,742 at an interest rate of 8.752% with equal
payments of $2,283, including interest, due monthly beginning February14, 2016 and
continuing through April 14, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under this
note payable was $0.
August 31, 2015 Working Capital Loan
On August 31, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party financing
source pursuant to which the lender committed to loan the Company $100,000 for working
capital. As an incentive for the financing, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of
restricted common stock. The investor decided not to accept the shares because of
income tax implications and they were returned to the Company’s transfer agent and
returned to the treasury. The agreement had an annual interest rate of 2% and was due
November 15, 2015. The agreement provided for payment of one-half (1/2) of the gross
revenues that the Company may receive from its mining activities towards the principal
and accrued interest. The note, including accrued interest, was satisfied in its entirety in
December 2015 in exchange for 3,500,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common
stock. The principal and accrued interest retired aggregated $100,482 and the fair value of
the stock was $187,250. The Company recorded a loss on the debt conversion of $86,768.
December 2, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement
On December 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for two
$114,400 convertible notes with an accredited investor for an aggregate principal amount
of $228,800 with an annual interest rate of 9%. Each note contains an original issue
discount (“OID”) of $10,400 and related legal and due diligence costs of $12,000. The net
proceeds from the first note received by the Company was $92,000. The second note was
cancelled. The maturity date on the first note is December 2, 2017. An amendment to the
note on January 12, 2016, allows the Company to prepay in full the unpaid principal and
interest on the note, upon notice, any time prior to June 8, 2016. Any prepayment is at
140% face amount outstanding and accrued interest. The redemption must be closed and
paid for within three business days of the Company sending the redemption demand. The
note may not be prepaid after the June 8, 2016. The note became convertible into shares
of the Company’s common stock at any time beginning on June 9, 2016. The conversion
price is equal to 55% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock as
reported on the QTCQB for the 10 prior trading days (and may include the day of the
Notice of Conversion under certain circumstances). The Company agreed to reserve an
initial 5,033,000 shares of common stock for conversions under the note. The Company
also agreed to adjust the share reserve to ensure that it equals at least four times the total
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the note from time to
time. The Company currently has shares on reserve for the convertible note. The
Company recognized the fair value of the embedded conversion feature as a derivative
liability on June 9, 2016 of $136,276 when the note became convertible.
The note contained an embedded conversion option and was separated from the Note
and accounted for as a derivative instrument at fair value and discount to the Note and is
expensed over the life of the Note under the effective interest method. The initial carrying
value of the of the embedded conversion option exceeded the net proceeds received and
created a derivative loss of $132,068 in the period ending December 31, 2015. The
Company recorded a loan discount of $114,400 and the discount included OID interest of
$10,400 and related loan costs of $12,000. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the
discount amortization was $54,351. On June 9, 2016, the Company issued 2,878,127
shares of common stock to the investor in satisfaction of $50,000 principal and $2,256 in
accrued interest on the convertible note payable. As of June 30, 2016, the balance
outstanding on the Note was $64,400, accrued interest was $3,453 and the loan discount
was $60,049.

January 26, 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement
On January 26, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) for an $180,000 convertible note with an accredited
investor, with an annual interest rate of 7%. The note contains an OID of $18,000 and
related legal costs of $6,000. The net proceeds received by the Company were $156,000.
The maturity date of the note is January 26, 2017. Interest is due on or before the maturity
date. The Company may redeem the note by prepaying the unpaid principal and interest
on the note, upon notice, any time prior to 180 days after the Effective Date. If redemption
is (i) prior to the 30th day the note is in effect (including the 30th day), the redemption will
be 105% of the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest; (ii) if the redemption is on
the 31st day up to and including the 60th day the note is in effect, the redemption price will
be 115% of the unpaid principle amount of the note along with any accrued interest; (iii) if
the redemption is on the 61st day up to and including the 120th day the note is in effect,
the redemption price will be 135% of the unpaid principle amount of the note along with
any accrued interest; if the redemption is on the 121st day up to and including the 180th
day the note is in effect, the redemption price will be 150% of the unpaid principle amount
of the note along with any accrued interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for
within three business days of the Company sending the redemption demand. The note
may not be prepaid and redeemed after the 180th day. The note is convertible into shares
of the Company’s common stock at any time beginning on the date which is 181 days
following the Effective Date. The conversion price is equal to 55% of the lowest trading
price of the Company’s common stock as reported on the QTCQB for the 10 prior trading
days and may include the day of the Notice of Conversion under certain circumstances.
The Company agreed to reserve an initial 10,800,000 shares of common stock for
conversions under the note (the “Share Reserve”). We also agreed to adjust the Share
Reserve to ensure that it always equals at least three times the total number of shares of
common stock that is actually issuable if the entire note were to be converted. The note
has an embedded conversion option which qualifies for derivative accounting and
bifurcation under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging. Pursuant to ASC 815, the
Company will recognize the fair value of the embedded conversion feature as a derivative
liability when the Note becomes convertible on July 25, 2016.
The OID interest of $18,000 and related loan costs of $6,000 was recorded as a discount to
the note and is being amortized over the life of the loan as interest expense. For the nine
months ended June 30, 2016, the discount amortization was $9,876, the loan discount
balance was $14,124, the note balance was $180,000 and accrued interest was $5,351.
March 16, 2016 River North Convertible Notes
On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) with River North Equity, LLC (“River North”), pursuant to which
the Company may from time to time, in its discretion, sell shares of its common stock to
River North for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000. Unless terminated earlier,
River North’s purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date
on which River North shall have purchased Company shares pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 or March 16, 2018. The
Company has no obligation to sell any shares under the Purchase Agreement. See Note
10, March 16, 2016 Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement.
As partial consideration for the Purchase Agreement, on March 16, 2016, the Company
issued to River North a “commitment” convertible promissory note (the “Commitment
Note”) in the principal amount of $35,000. The Commitment Note accrues interest at a rate
of 10% per annum and matures on March 16, 2017. Upon the registration statement
contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement being declared effective, $10,000 of
the principle balance of the Commitment Note and accrued interest thereon was
extinguished and deemed to have been repaid. At June 30, 2016 the note balance was
$25,000 and accrued interest was $726.
After 180 days following the date of the Commitment Note, or earlier upon the occurrence
of an event of default that remains uncured, the Commitment Note may be converted into
shares of the Company’s common stock at the election of River North at a conversion
price per share equal 60% of the Current Market Price, which is defined as the lowest
closing bid price for the common stock as reported by Bloomberg, LP for the 10 trading
days ending on the trading day immediately before the conversion.

On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with River
North pursuant to which the Company issued a convertible promissory note (the “Bridge
Note”) to River North, in the original principal amount of $90,000, in consideration of the
payment by River North of a purchase price equal to $73,800, with $9,000 retained by River
North as original issue discount and $7,200 for related legal and due diligence costs. The
Company issued the Bridge Note on March 16, 2016. The Bridge Note accrues interest at a
rate of 10% per annum and matures on March 16, 2017. For the nine months ended June
30, 2016, the discount amortization was $4,337, and at June 30, 2016 the loan discount
balance was $11,863, the note balance was $90,000 and accrued interest was $2,614.
The Bridge Note provides for conversion rights and events of default on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the Commitment Note; provided however that an event of
default under the Bridge Note will also be triggered if the Company fails to use at least 15%
of the proceeds from each sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement to prepay a
portion of the Bridge Note after the conversion date is reached.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, on April 11,
2016, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-210686)

NOTE 7 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
U.S. accounting standards require disclosure of a fair-value hierarchy of inputs the
Company uses to value an asset or a liability. In September 2006, the FASB issued new
accounting guidance, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. The Company previously partially adopted this guidance for all
instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. In the second quarter of fiscal
2010, the Company adopted the remaining provisions of the guidance for all non-financial
assets and liabilities that are not re-measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The
adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
Fair value standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Additionally, the standards establish a three-level fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires that the
Company maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. The three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as
of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or
liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an
ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-
traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.
Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1,
which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from
objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies
that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
The following table sets forth by level with the fair value hierarchy the Company’s assets
and liabilities measured at fair value as of:

Purchase Contract with Glencore AG
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a life-of-mine off take agreement with
Glencore AG (“Glencore”) for the sale of iron extracted from mineralized material at the El
Capitan Property (such agreement is referred to herein as the “Glencore Purchase
Contract”). Under the terms of the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company agreed to
sell to Glencore, and Glencore agreed to purchase from the Company, iron that meets the
applicable specifications from the El Capitan Property mine. Payment for the iron is to be
made pursuant an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Company. The purchase price
is based on an index price less an applicable discount. Either party may terminate the
Glencore Purchase Contract following a breach by the other party that remains uncured
for a specified period after receipt of written notice. Because of current market iron ore
prices, the contract has not been implemented or terminated.
Agreements with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC
In anticipation of, and in conjunction with, the Glencore Purchase Contract, the Company
entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and corresponding
Iron Ore Processing Agreement (the “Processing Agreement”) with Logistica U.S.
Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”), each effective as of February 28, 2014. Pursuant to these
agreements, Logistica agreed to, among other things, provide the logistics required for the
Company to fulfill its obligations under the Glencore Purchase Contract, to assist the
Company in financing the costs of processing and delivering iron under the Glencore
Purchase Contract, and to provide and/or manage the processing that iron. Because of
current market iron ore prices, the contract was not implemented.
The contracts with Logistica were superseded by a new agreement entered into on
January 5, 2016. See Note 6.
Master Agreement with Logistica
Under the Master Agreement, the Company agreed that Logistica will be the exclusive
logistics agent for the purpose of moving iron extracted from mineralized material at the El
Capitan Property from the El Capitan Property to Glencore’s designated exporting port or
final destination. Logistics services include operational supplement chain management
and supervision of all logistics providers and operations from the El Capitan Property
mine to the vessel loading port. Logistics services do not include obtaining and
maintaining operating, environmental and mining permits, and land and mineral rights,
which are the responsibility of the Company. Also under the Master Agreement, Logistica
is required to use its best efforts to establish an operating credit line capable of funding all
processing and delivery costs and, upon opening and funding such a credit line, will
disburse as needed all operating costs contemplated under the Glencore Purchase
Contract. The Company is required to reimburse Logistica for all such amounts, without
interest, out of payments received from Glencore in respect of the purchase of the iron.
In consideration for Logistica’s funding and logistic services, the Company will pay
Logistica a percentage of the Company’s profits from the sale of iron under the Glencore
Purchase Contract. If any sale of iron under the Glencore Purchase Contract results in a
loss instead of a profit, as a result of a decrease in index pricing of iron or otherwise, then
the Company is required to make up the shortfall out of profits from any precious metals
processing and refining business, to the extent of available profits there from, or
otherwise. If iron index prices drop below the price in place at inception of the Glencore
Purchase Contract by more than 5%, then the Company will be required to provide
Logistica with a greater percentage of profits commensurate with and equivalent to
Logistica’s loss of profit share due to the reduction in iron index prices. At inception of the
Glencore Purchase Contract, the Platts 62% FE CFR China iron index price was $121.24
and at June 30, 2016 was approximately $51.00. In the event of a future sale of the El
Capitan Property, the Company must either ensure that its agreements with Logistica are
assumed by the purchaser or pay Logistica a termination fee.

Either party may terminate the Master Agreement following a breach by the other party that
remains uncured for 60 days after receipt of written notice. The Master Agreement will
otherwise continue indefinitely.
Because of current market iron ore prices, the contract has not been implemented and has
not been terminated.
The contracts with Logistica were superseded by a new agreement entered into on
January 5, 2016. See Note 6.
Processing Agreement with Logistica
Under the Processing Agreement, Logistica has agreed to deliver iron processing
equipment to the El Capitan Property and to use it best efforts to process, to contract
specification, stock pile and load for delivery iron that the Company has contracted to sell
to Glencore under the Glencore Purchase Contract. In order to do so, Logistica will act as
the Company’s turn-key contractor for all of the Company’s iron processing and delivery
activities at the El Capitan Property. In consideration for such services, the Company will
pay Logistica a set price per metric ton of iron that is processed in accordance with the
Glencore Purchase Contract specifications and purchased by Glencore. As additional
compensation for entering into the Processing Agreement, the Company issued 4,000,000
shares of common stock to a designee of Logistica under the Company’s 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan valued at $800,000. The shares vested immediately upon grant and the
$800,000 was expensed in full during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.
Either party may terminate the Processing Agreement following a breach by the other
party that remains uncured for 60 days after receipt of written notice. The Processing
Agreement will otherwise continue indefinitely.
Because of the drop in the market iron ore prices under the contract price, the contract
has not been implemented during the current fiscal year and has not been terminated as
of June 30, 2016.
On January 5, 2016, the Company entered into a new agreement with Logistica U.S.
Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”). Under the agreement the Company will provide to Logistica
concentrated ore to their specifications at the mine site. Logistica will transport, process,
and refine the precious metals concentrates to sell to precious metals buyers. This
agreement is in addition to and complements the previously announced agreement for the
sale of iron ore for use in construction. The terms of the new agreement provide for the
recovery of hard costs related to the concentrates by both parties prior to the distribution
of profits. The agreement also provides for the future issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the
Company’s restricted common stock and the elimination of a $100,000 accrued liability to
Logistica for prior services rendered. The issuance date of shares is anticipated to occur
in August 2016. The new agreement supersedes the previous agreements with Logistica.

NOTE 10 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
March 16, 2016 Equity Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement
On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) with River North Equity, LLC (“River North”), pursuant to which
the Company may from time to time, in its discretion, sell shares of its common stock to
River North for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000. Unless terminated earlier,
River North’s purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date
on which River North shall have purchased Company shares pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 or March 16, 2018. The
Company has no obligation to sell any shares under the Purchase Agreement.
As provided in the Purchase Agreement, the Company may require River North to
purchase shares of common stock from time to time by delivering a put notice to River
North specifying the total purchase price for the shares to be purchased (the “Investment
Amount”); provided there must be a minimum of 10 trading days between delivery of each
put notice. This arrangement is also sometimes referred to herein as the “Equity Line.”
The Company may determine the Investment Amount, provided that such amount may not
be more than the average daily trading volume in dollar amount for the Company’s
common stock during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the Company
delivers the applicable put notice. Additionally, such amount may not be lower than $5,000
or higher than $150,000 without prior approval of River North. The number of shares
issuable in connection with each put notice will be computed by dividing the applicable
Investment Amount by the purchase price for such common stock. River North will have
no obligation to purchase shares under the Purchase Agreement to the extent that such
purchase would cause River North to own more than 9.99% of the Company’s common
stock.
For each share of the Company’s common stock purchased under the Purchase
Agreement, River North will pay a purchase price equal to 85% of the Market Price, which
is defined as the average of the two lowest closing bid prices on the OTCQB Marketplace,
as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P., during the five consecutive Trading Days
including and immediately prior to the date on which the applicable put notice is delivered
to River North (the “Pricing Period”). If the Company is not deposit/withdrawal at
custodian (“DWAC”) eligible, River North will pay a purchase price equal to 80% of the
Market Price, and if the Company is under Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) “chill”
status, River North will pay a purchase price equal to 75% of the Market Price. On the first
trading day after the Pricing Period, River North will purchase the applicable number of
shares subject to customary closing conditions, including without limitation a requirement
that a registration statement remain effective registering the resale by River North of the
shares to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as contemplated by the
Registration Rights Agreement described below.
The Purchase Agreement contains covenants, representations and warranties of the
Company and River North that are typical for transactions of this type. In addition, the
Company and River North have granted each other customary indemnification rights in
connection with the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by
the Company at any time. The Purchase Agreement is not transferable and any benefits
attached thereto may not be assigned.
Also on March 16, 2016, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company also
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with River North requiring the Company to
prepare and file, within 45 days of the effective date of the Registration Rights Agreement,
a registration statement registering the resale by River North of the shares to be issued
under the Purchase Agreement for the shares, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective, and to keep such registration
statement effective until (i) three months after the last closing of a sale of shares under the
Purchase Agreement, (ii) the date when River North may sell all the shares under Rule 144
without volume limitations, or (iii) the date River North no longer owns any of the shares.
As of June 30, 2016, we have sold 1,166,844 shares of common stock to River North under
the 2016 Agreement for aggregate proceeds of $45,995, and have the right, subject to
certain conditions, to sell to River North $4,954,005 of newly-issued shares of the
Company common stock pursuant to the 2016 Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of
applicable closing conditions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements and related notes which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, and with our audited financial statements and the “Risk Factors” section
included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 11, 2016.
Company Overview; Recent Developments
The Company is an exploration stage company as defined by the SEC’s Industry Guide 7
as the Company has no established reserves as required under Industry Guide 7. We have
owned interests in several properties located in the southwestern United States in the
past. We are principally engaged in the exploration of precious metals and other minerals
on the El Capitan property located near Capitan, New Mexico (the “El Capitan Property”).
We have recorded nominal revenues in the nine months ended June 30, 2016 consisting
of revenue for test loads of iron ore to a construction contractor.
We commenced planned mineral exploration activity in the quarter ended December 2015
under our modified mining permit. However, we have not yet demonstrated the existence
of proven or probable reserves at our El Capitan Property.  As a result, and in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for exploration stage
companies, all expenditures for exploration and evaluation of our property are expensed
as incurred.
Basis of Presentation and Going Concern
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method
of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP"), and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company currently has a minimum source of revenue to cover its costs.
 The Company has incurred a loss of $1,272,698 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016
and has a working capital deficit of $1,537,932 as of June 30, 2016. The negative working
capital position includes a noncash derivative instrument liability of $231,856. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
To continue as a going concern, the Company is dependent on achieving cash flow and
generating future profits from entering the production stage of operations. The Company
does not have adequate liquidity to fund its current operations, meet its obligations and
continue as a going concern. The Company has secured working capital loans as set forth
below to assist in financing its activities in the near term.
Loan Date
 
December 2015 $92,000
January 2016    156,000
March 2016
   73,800
Net Proceeds
The Company is also pursuing other financing alternatives, including short-term
operational strategic financing or equity financing, to fund its activities until it can achieve
cash flow and profits from its operations. See Note 6 for additional information.
On March 16, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) and a related Registration Rights Agreement with River North
Equity, LLC (“River North”), pursuant to which the Company may from time to time, in its
discretion, sell shares of its common stock to River North for aggregate gross proceeds of
up to $5,000,000, subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. As of
June 30, 2016, we had sold shares of common stock to River North under the Purchaser
Agreement for aggregate proceeds of $45,995. Subsequent to June 30, 2016 and prior to
the filing of this report, the Company sold additional shares of common stock to River
North under the Purchase Agreement for additional aggregate proceeds of $190,128. As of
the filing of this report, we have the right, subject to certain conditions, to sell to River
North newly-issued shares of the Company common stock pursuant to the 2016 Purchase
Agreement for additional aggregate proceeds of $4,763,877, subject to the satisfaction of
applicable closing conditions. See Note 10, March 16, 2016 Equity Purchase Agreement
and Registration Rights Agreement.

The Company is also pursuing other financing alternatives, including short-term

to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenues
We realized no revenue from exploration activities on deliveries of iron ore during the
three months ended June 30, 2016. No revenues were recorded during the comparable
prior year period.
Expenses and Net Loss
Our operating expenses increased $4,000 from $388,779 for the three months ended June
30, 2015 to $392,779 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase is mainly
attributable to increases in mining and exploration costs of $111,51 and legal and
accounting expense of $10,502. These increases were offset by a decrease in other
general and administrative expenses of $116,656. The decrease consists mainly of
decreases in costs associated with options and warrants of $39,795, financing cost of
$67,550 and a reclassification of depreciation expense of $16,435. The depreciation was
charged to this category in the prior reporting period and in the current period related
mine depreciation is charged to mine and exploration costs. The increase in legal was
incurred for services provided in connection with negotiating and documenting the
Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement entered into on March 16, 2016
with River North and related SEC filings.
Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $543,086 from a net
loss of $496,381 incurred for the comparable three month period ended June 30, 2015. The
increase in net loss of $46,705 for the current period is mainly attributable to the increases
in other expenses of $42,705. The increase in other expenses is mainly comprised by the
increase in loss on derivatives of $82,256, and offset by increase in gain on debt
extinguishment of $20,648 and decrease in interest expense of $18,903.
Nine Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenues
We realized nominal revenue from exploration activities on deliveries of iron ore test loads
to a construction contractor for material approval during the nine months ended June 30,
2016. No revenues were recorded during the comparable prior year period.
Expenses and Net Loss
Our operating expenses decreased $463,520, from $1,504,528 for the nine months ended
June 30, 2015 to $1,041,008 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is
mainly attributable a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of $648,323
and offset by an increases in mine and exploration costs of $103,906 and legal and
accounting expenses of $85,126. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
are mainly attributable to decreases in costs associated with warrant and option costs of
$503,226, stock compensation of $67,550, depreciation of $42,347 charged to this category
in the prior reporting period, while in the current period mine associated depreciation is
charged to mine and exploration costs, travel and food of $20,316 and stockholder
meeting costs of $10,509. These cost decreases were offset by the increase in legal costs
incurred of $88,364. The increased legal costs were incurred for services related to our
new 2015 Incentive Equity Plan, legal work related to new contract agreements, two
convertible financing facilities and the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights
Agreement entered into on March 16, 2016 with River North and the related SEC filings.

Table of Contents
Our net loss for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $1,272,698 from a net
loss of $1,774,639 incurred for the comparable nine month period ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease in net loss of $501,941 for the current period is mainly attributable to the
decreases in net operating expenses and a decrease in other expenses of $38,711. The
decrease in other expenses is mainly comprised of an increase of a non-cash loss on
extinguishment of debt of $80,396, a decrease in interest expense of $46,709, and a non-
cash gain on derivative instruments of $72,467.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $62,425 and a working capital deficit of
$1,537,432. Based upon our budgeted burn rate, we currently have operating capital for
approximately one and a half months. The Company has historically relied on equity or
debt financings to finance its ongoing operations and currently has a minimum source of
revenue to cover our operational costs. Currently the Company has access to funds
under the Purchase Agreement with River North. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Purchase Agreement, we have the right to “put,” or sell, up to $5,000,000 worth of
shares of our common stock to River North. Unless terminated earlier, River North’s
purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date on which River
North shall have purchased shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for an aggregate
purchase price of $5,000,000 or March 16, 2018. We have registered 25,000,000 shares for
resale by River North under a registration statement on Form S-1 that was declared
effective by the SEC on April 20, 2016. As of the filing of this report, we have sold 5,987,983
shares of common stock to River North under the Purchaser Agreement for aggregate
proceeds of $236,123, and have the right, subject to applicable conditions, to sell to River
North additional shares of our common stock for up to an additional proceeds of up to
$4,763,877.
Current conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. To continue as a going concern, we are dependent on achieving cash flow and
generating future profits from entering the production stage of operations, the ability to
receive funds timely under the Purchase Agreement with River North or obtaining short-
term operational strategic financing alternatives or equity infusion. We do not have
adequate liquidity to fund its current operations, meet its obligations and continue as a
going concern.
Currently we anticipate funding our future operations from a potential revolving credit line
associated with our new agreements with Logistica, our recent financing activities
described below, and sales of mineralized materials and precious metals under our
agreements with Logistica. However, unless and until we commence sales and shipments
under the aforementioned contracts, and/or enter similar agreements for the purchase of
mineralized material, and produce sufficient cash flow from future revenues, we will
continue to rely on Purchase Agreement with River North and/or other debt or equity
financing to fund our current operations.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, we utilized net cash flow of $400,568. Net
cash funds received during the nine month period ended June 30, 2016, were net
proceeds of $321,800 from three convertible notes, finance contract increases for
insurance premiums aggregating $32,773 and $45,995 from the sale of common stock. Our
current financing arrangements are summarized below under the caption “Recent
Financing Activities.”
Recent Financing Activities
Agreements with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC
Under an agreement with Logistica U.S. Terminals, LLC (“Logistica”) dated February 28,
2014, Logistica agreed to remit a $400,000 payment on the Company’s behalf that
represented the remaining balance of the Company’s purchase price for a heavy ore
trailing separation line to be used for processing of mineralized material at the El Capitan
Property mine site. The Company previously remitted $100,000 toward the purchase of
such equipment. In consideration for Logistica remitting such payment, the Company
agreed to deliver a $400,000 promissory note to Logistica and issued 2,500,000 shares of
common stock to a designee of Logistica under the Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.
The promissory note accrues interest at 4.5%, with principal and accrued interest
payments to be made out of the Company’s proceeds from sale of iron extracted from
mineralized material as part of the Company’s exploration activities. The relative fair value
of the common stock was determined to be $222,222 and was recorded as a discount to
the promissory note that was amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the
note through August 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015,
amortization expense of $158,559 was recognized. The outstanding balance under this
note payable was $400,000 and the unamortized discount on the note payable was $0 as
of June 30, 2016. Accrued interest on the note at June 30, 2016 was $42,066.

Table of Contents
On January 5, 2016, we entered into our current agreement with Logistica U.S. Terminals,
LLC (“Logistica”). Under the agreement we will provide to Logistica concentrated ore to
their specifications at the mine site. Logistica will transport, process, and refine the
precious metals concentrates to sell to precious metals buyers. The terms of the new
agreement provide for the recovery of hard costs related to the concentrates by both
parties prior to the distribution of profits. The agreement also provides for the future
issuance of 10,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock and the elimination of a
$100,000 accrued liability to Logistica for prior services rendered. When certain terms and
conditions are met, the Agreement calls for Logistica to arrange for a letter of credit for
working capital for the mining, processing and sale activities under the Agreement. The
issuance date of the shares is anticipated to occur in late August 2016. The new
agreement supersedes the previous agreements with Logistica.
October 17, 2014 Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement
On October 17, 2014, we entered into a private Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with
an accredited investor pursuant to which we borrowed $500,000 against delivery of a
promissory note (the “2014 Note”) in such amount and issued warrants to purchase
882,352 shares of our common stock pursuant to the Note and Warrant Purchase
Agreement. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 8% per annum, was initially due
on July 17, 2015 and is secured by a first priority security interest in all right, title and
interest of the Company in and to the net proceeds received by the Company from its sale
of tailings separated from iron recovered by the Company at the El Capitan Property. On
August 24, 2015, the 2014 Note was mutually extended from July 17, 2015 to January 17,
2016. In consideration of the extension, the Company amended the common stock
purchase warrant to purchase 4,714,286 shares (subject to adjustment) of our common
stock at an exercise price of $0.07 per share. The warrant dated October 17, 2014 was
cancelled. On January 19, 2016, the amended 2014 Note was extended from January 17,
2016 to September 19, 2016. In consideration of the extension, we issued to the investor a
fully vested three year common stock purchase warrant to purchase 471,429 shares
(subject to adjustment) of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.051
per share, the closing price on the date of the agreed extension agreement. The fair value
of the warrants was determined to be $16,775 using Black-Scholes option price model and
was expensed during the three months ended March 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the
outstanding balance under the amended 2014 Note is $500,000 and accrued interest was
$8,109.
February 4, 2015 Unsecured Promissory Notes
On February 4, 2015, we issued unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $63,000. Outstanding amounts under these notes accrue interest at 18% per
year, with all principal and accrued interest being due and payable on February 4, 2016. As
additional consideration for the loan, we issued 200,000 shares of our restricted common
stock for each note for a total of 400,000 shares. The relative fair value of the common
stock was determined to be $21,211 and was recorded as discounts to the promissory
notes was amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes. On February 4, 2016,
one of the promissory notes was amended to extend the maturity date from February 4,
2016 to February 4, 2017 and reduced the interest rate to 10% per year. The Company also
agreed to add the accrued interest on the note at February 4, 2016 of $5,940 to the
principle of the note. In consideration of the amendment, the Company agreed to issue an
aggregate 150,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company to the lenders and
the Board of Directors approved the issuance on April 22, 2016. One of the lenders is
affiliated with the Company and provided $30,000 of the original $63,000 loaned funds. See
Note 2. Our obligations under both notes were personally guaranteed by the Company’s
director and Chief Executive Officer.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, aggregate amortization expense of $10,844
was recognized, the aggregate outstanding balance under these notes was $68,940,
accrued interest was $9,360 and the unamortized discounts on the notes payable was

April 16, 2015 Installment Loan
On April 16, 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third party financing source

restricted shares of our common stock. The note and accrued interest retired aggregated
$207,500 and the fair value of the stock was $215,423. The Company recorded a loss on
the debt conversion of $7,923. At June 30, 2016, unpaid accrued interest remained of
$2,466.
Financing of Insurance Premiums
On July 14, 2015, we entered into an agreement to finance a portion of its insurance
premiums in the amount of $15,116 at an interest rate of 8.76% with equal payments of
$1,573, including interest, due monthly beginning July 14, 2015 and continuing through
April 14, 2016. In August 2015, an increase in premium of $1,876 occurred due an increase
in coverage and the remaining payments increased to $1,815. As of June 30, 2016, the
outstanding balance under this note payable was $0.
On November 19, 2015, we entered into an agreement to finance director and officer
insurance premiums in the amount of $26,031 at an interest rate of 7.05% with equal
payments of $2,688, including interest, due monthly beginning December 21, 2015 and
continuing through September 21, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance
under this note payable was $7,970.
On December 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement to finance additional insurance
premiums in the amount of $6,742 at an interest rate of 8.752% with equal payments of
$2,283, including interest, due monthly beginning February14, 2016 and continuing
through April 14, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under this note
payable was $0.
August 31, 2015 Working Capital Loan
On August 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third party financing source
pursuant to which the lender committed to loan the Company $100,000 for working capital.
As an incentive for the financing, we issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock.
The investor decided not to accept the shares because of income tax implications and
they were returned to our transfer agent and returned to the treasury. The agreement had
an annual interest rate of 2% and was due November 15, 2015. The agreement provided for
payment of one-half (1/2) of the gross revenues that the Company may receive from its
mining activities towards the principal and accrued interest. The note, including accrued
interest, was satisfied in its entirety in December 2015 in exchange for 3,500,000 restricted
shares of the Company’s common stock. The principal and accrued interest retired
aggregated $100,482 and the fair value of the stock was $187,250. The Company recorded
a loss on the debt conversion of $86,768.

December 2, 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement
On December 2, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for two $114,400
convertible notes with an accredited investor for an aggregate principal amount of
$228,800 with an annual interest rate of 9%. Each note contains an original issue discount
(“OID”) of $10,400 and related legal and due diligence costs of $12,000. The net proceeds
from the first note received by the Company was $92,000. The second note was cancelled.
The maturity date on the first note is December 2, 2017. An amendment to the note on
January 12, 2016, allows us to prepay in full the unpaid principal and interest on the note,
upon notice, any time prior to June 3, 2016. Any prepayment is at 140% face amount
outstanding and accrued interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for within
three business days of the Company sending the redemption demand. The note may not
be prepaid after the June 2, 2016. The note is convertible into shares of the Company’s
common stock at any time beginning on May 30, 2016. The conversion price is equal to
55% of the lowest trading price of our common stock as reported on the QTCQB for the 10
prior trading days (and may include the day of the Notice of Conversion under certain
circumstances). We agreed to reserve an initial 5,033,000 shares of common stock for
conversions under the note. We also agreed to adjust the share reserve to ensure that it
equals at least four times the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the note from time to time. The Company currently has shares on reserve
for the convertible note. We recognized the fair value of the embedded conversion feature
as a derivative liability on June 9, 2016 of $136,276.
The note contained an embedded conversion option and was separated from the Note
and accounted for as a derivative instrument at fair value and discount to the Note and is
expensed over the life of the Note under the effective interest method. The initial carrying
value of the of the embedded conversion option exceeded the net proceeds received and
created a derivative loss of $$132,068 in the period ending December 31, 2015. The
Company recorded a loan discount of $114,400 and the discount included OID interest of
$10,400 and related loan costs of $12,000. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, the
discount amortization was $54,351. On June 9, 2016, we issued 2,878,127 shares of
common stock to the investor in satisfaction of $50,000 principal and $2,256 in accrued
interest on the convertible note payable. As of June 30, 2016, the balance outstanding on
the Note was $64,400, accrued interest was $3,453 and the loan discount was $60,049. As
of the filing of this report, the investor had converted the balance of the principal and
accrued interest of $3,742, and we issued 3,462,228 shares of common stock to the
investor.
January 26, 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement
On January 26, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the “SPA”) for an $180,000 convertible note with an accredited investor, with
an annual interest rate of 7%. The note contains an OID of $18,000 and related legal costs
of $6,000. The net proceeds received by the Company were $156,000. The maturity date of
the note is January 26, 2017. Interest is due on or before the maturity date. We may redeem
the note by prepaying the unpaid principal and interest on the note, upon notice, any time
prior to 180 days after the Effective Date. If redemption is (i) prior to the 30th day the note is
in effect (including the 30th day), the redemption will be 105% of the unpaid principal
amount and accrued interest; (ii) if the redemption is on the 31st day up to and including
the 60th day the note is in effect, the redemption price will be 115% of the unpaid principle
amount of the note along with any accrued interest; (iii) if the redemption is on the 61st day
up to and including the 120th day the note is in effect, the redemption price will be 135% of
the unpaid principle amount of the note along with any accrued interest; if the redemption
is on the 121st day up to and including the 180th day the note is in effect, the redemption
price will be 150% of the unpaid principle amount of the note along with any accrued
interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for within three business days of the
Company sending the redemption demand. The note may not be prepaid and redeemed
after the 180th day. The note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at
any time beginning on the date which is 181 days following the Effective Date. The
conversion price is equal to 55% of the lowest trading price of our common stock as
reported on the QTCQB for the 10 prior trading days and may include the day of the Notice
of Conversion under certain circumstances. The Company agreed to reserve an initial
10,800,000 shares of common stock for conversions under the note (the “Share
Reserve”). We also agreed to adjust the Share Reserve to ensure that it always equals at
least three times the total number of shares of common stock that is actually issuable if
the entire note were to be converted. The note has an embedded conversion option which
qualifies for derivative accounting and bifurcation under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and
Hedging. Pursuant to ASC 815, the Company will recognize the fair value of the embedded
conversion feature as a derivative liability when the Note becomes convertible on July 25,
2016.
The OID interest of $18,000 and related loan costs of $6,000 was recorded as a discount to
the note and is being amortized over the life of the loan as interest expense. For the nine
months ended June 30, 2016, the discount amortization was $9,876, the loan discount
balance was $14,124, the note balance was $180,000 and accrued interest was $5,351.
Upon the note becoming convertible in the period subsequent to the quarter ended June
30, 2016, the investor converted the principal balance of $180,000 and accrued interest of
$6,662 into 9,506,619 shares of restricted common stock.

March 16, 2016 Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement
On March 16, 2016, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with River North, pursuant to
which we may from time to time, in our discretion, sell shares of its common stock to River
North for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $5,000,000. Unless terminated earlier, River
North’s purchase commitment will automatically terminate on the earlier of the date on
which River North shall have purchased Company shares pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 or March 16, 2018. We have no
obligation to sell any shares under the Purchase Agreement.
As provided in the Purchase Agreement, the Company may require River North to
purchase shares of common stock from time to time by delivering a put notice to River
North specifying the total purchase price for the shares to be purchased (the “Investment
Amount”); provided there must be a minimum of 10 trading days between deliveries of
each put notice. The minimum trading days between delivery of put notices may be
adjusted downward at the discretion of River North from time to time. Currently the time
between the put notices is five (5) days. This arrangement is also sometimes referred to
herein as the “Equity Line.” We may determine the Investment Amount, provided that such
amount may not be more than the average daily trading volume in dollar amount for the
Company’s common stock during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the
Company delivers the applicable put notice. Additionally, such amount may not be lower
than $5,000 or higher than $150,000 without prior approval of River North. The number of
shares issuable in connection with each put notice will be computed by dividing the
applicable Investment Amount by the purchase price for such common stock. River North
will have no obligation to purchase shares under the Purchase Agreement to the extent
that such purchase would cause River North to own more than 9.99% of the Company’s
common stock.
For each share of the our common stock purchased under the Purchase Agreement, River
North will pay a purchase price equal to 85% of the Market Price, which is defined as the
average of the two lowest closing bid prices on the OTCQB Marketplace, as reported by
Bloomberg Finance L.P., during the five consecutive Trading Days including and
immediately prior to the date on which the applicable put notice is delivered to River North
(the “Pricing Period”). If we are not deposit/withdrawal at custodian (“DWAC”) eligible,
River North will pay a purchase price equal to 80% of the Market Price, and if the Company
is under Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) “chill” status, River North will pay a purchase
price equal to 75% of the Market Price. On the first trading day after the Pricing Period,
River North will purchase the applicable number of shares subject to customary closing
conditions, including without limitation a requirement that a registration statement remain
effective registering the resale by River North of the shares to be issued pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement described
below.
The Purchase Agreement contains covenants, representations and warranties of the
Company and River North that are typical for transactions of this type. In addition, the
Company and River North have granted each other customary indemnification rights in
connection with the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by
the Company at any time. The Purchase Agreement is not transferable and any benefits
attached thereto may not be assigned.
Also on March 16, 2016, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into
a Registration Rights Agreement with River North requiring the Company to prepare and
file, within 45 days of the effective date of the Registration Rights Agreement, a registration
statement registering the resale by River North of the shares to be issued under the
Purchase Agreement for the shares, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective, and to keep such registration statement
effective until (I) three months after the last closing of a sale of shares under the Purchase
Agreement, (ii) the date when River North may sell all the shares under Rule 144 without
volume limitations, or (iii) the date River North no longer owns any of the shares.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, on April 11,
2016, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-210686) with the
SEC registering the resale of up to 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock
that may be issued and sold to River North pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Such
Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2016, resulting in
extinguishment of $10,000 of the principal balance of the Commitment Note and accrued
interest thereon.
As partial consideration for the above-mentioned agreements, on March 16, 2016, we
issued to River North a “commitment” convertible promissory note (the “Commitment
Note”) in the principal amount of $35,000. The Commitment Note accrues interest at a rate
of 10% per annum and matures on March 16, 2017. Upon the registration statement
contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement being declared effective, $10,000 of
the principle balance of the Commitment Note and accrued interest thereon was
extinguished and deemed to have been repaid. At June 30, 2016 the note balance was
$25,000 and accrued interest was $726.

Table of Contents
After 180 days following the date of the Commitment Note, or earlier upon the occurrence
of an event of default that remains uncured, the Commitment Note may be converted into
shares of the Company’s common stock at the election of River North at a conversion
price per share equal 60% of the Current Market Price, which is defined as the lowest
closing bid price for the common stock as reported by Bloomberg, LP for the 10 trading
days ending on the trading day immediately before the conversion.
On March 16, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with River North
pursuant to which the Company issued a convertible promissory note (the “Bridge Note”)
to River North, in the original principal amount of $90,000, in consideration of the payment
by River North of a purchase price equal to $73,800, with $9,000 retained by River North as
original issue discount and $7,200 for related legal and due diligence costs. The Company
issued the Bridge Note on March 16, 2016. The Bridge Note accrues interest at a rate of
10% per annum and matures on March 16, 2017. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016,
the discount amortization was $4,337, and at June 30, 2016 the loan discount balance was
$11,863, the note balance was $90,000 and accrued interest was $2,614.
The Bridge Note provides for conversion rights and events of default on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the Commitment Note; provided however that an event of
default under the Bridge Note will also be triggered if the Company fails to use at least 15%
of the proceeds from each sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement to prepay a
portion of the Bridge Note after it becomes convertible.
Likelihood of Accessing the Full Amount of the Equity Line
Notwithstanding that the Equity Line is in an amount of $5,000,000, we anticipate that the
actual likelihood that we will be able access the full $5,000,000 may be low due to several
factors, including that our ability to access the Equity Line is impacted by our average
daily trading volume, which may limit the maximum dollar amount of each put we deliver to
River North, and our stock price. If the price of our stock remains at $0.075 per share
(which represents the average of the high and low reported sales prices of our common
stock on August 8, 2016), the sale by the selling stockholder of all 25,000,000 of the shares
registered would mean we had sold $1,448,139 of shares to the selling stockholder. Our
use of the Equity Line will continue to be limited and restricted if our share trading volume
or market price of our stock continue at their current levels or decrease further in the
future from the volume and stock prices reported over the past year.
In addition, we may have to increase the number of our authorized shares in order to issue
the shares to River North if we reach our current amount of authorized shares of common
stock. Increasing the number of our authorized shares will require board and stockholder
approval. Further, our ability to issue shares in excess of the 25,000,000 shares covered
by the registration statement will be subject to our filing a subsequent registration
statement with the SEC and the SEC declaring it effective.
Factors Affecting Future Financing Activities
Our only committed source of future financing is under the Purchase Agreement with
River North. To the extent that we are required to raise additional capital, we do not know
whether it will be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us when needed, if at all. To
the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders
may experience dilution. In addition, we may grant future investors rights superior to those
of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we could incur
significant interest expense and become subject to covenants in the related transaction
documentation that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business. If
adequate additional capital is not available when required, we may be forced to reduce or
eliminate our exploration activities and our marketing efforts for the sale of the El Capitan
Property, or suspend our operations entirely.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2016, we utilized net cash flow of $400,568. Net
cash funds received during the nine month period ended June 30, 2016, were net
proceeds of $321,800 from three convertible notes, finance contract increases for
insurance premiums aggregating $32,773 and $45,995 from the sale of common stock.
Factors Affecting Future Mineral Exploration Results
We have generated no material revenues to date, other than nominal revenues from test
deliveries of iron ore, interest income and miscellaneous revenue from the sale of two
dore’ bars, since inception. As a result, we have only a limited history upon which to
evaluate our future potential performance. Our potential must be considered by evaluation
of all risks and difficulties encountered by exploration companies which have not yet
established business operations and anticipated results and situations of entering active
exploration activities.

Table of Contents
The price of gold and silver has experienced increases and decreases in value over the
past five years.  A historical chart of their respective prices is contained in Item 1, the
“Business” portion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2015, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January
11, 2016.  Beginning in April 2013, the price of gold and silver has experienced a
downward swing. A significant permanent drop in the price of gold, silver or other
precious metals may have a material adverse effect on the future results of potential
exploration activities and the opportunity to market the sale of the El Capitan Property and
the potential future revenue derived from the sale of concentrates. The El Capitan Property
is an open pit mine with lower production costs and a material increase in costs
associated with the recovery of precious metals may also cause a material adverse effect
on the financial success of the Company and our ability to market the sale of the El
Capitan Property.
Time delays in obtaining the necessary approvals from the various governmental
agencies, both federal and state, and weather conditions have caused delays in the
deployment of our strategic business plan in 2016, all of which are not under our control,
in achieving our strategic business plan and current plan of operation.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet
arrangements set forth in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.
Contractual Obligations
As of June 30, 2016, we had no contractual obligations (including long-term debt
obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations
and other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP) that are
expected to have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require
us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Note 1, “Business, Basis of
Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2015 , filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January
11, 2016, describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by
management on a regular basis.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting
pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial
statements.

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)

were not effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by it in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms.  In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be

accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during the quarter
