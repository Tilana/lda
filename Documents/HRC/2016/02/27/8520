<p><b>  Mission to Papua New Guinea</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
Manfred Nowak, on his mission to Papua New Guinea, from 14 to 25 May 2010. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and representatives 
of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons deprived of their 
liberty, often supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special Rapporteur found 
isolated cases of torture in the classical sense of deliberately inflicting severe pain or 
suffering as a means of extracting a confession or information. He also found, however, a 
considerable number of cases where persons were subjected to different degrees of beatings 
by the police during arrest and as a form of punishment, which may also amount to torture. 
Impunity for torture and ill-treatment is fuelled by the lack of effective complaint 
mechanisms, independent investigations, monitoring and other similar safeguards. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur found a general atmosphere of violence and neglect in 
places of detention. In police stations, detainees were locked up for long periods in 
overcrowded and filthy cells, without proper ventilation or natural light for periods of up to 
one year. The conditions in correctional institutions were better, but generally 
overcrowded. There was also an overall lack of medical attention, even for those who were

<p>severely beaten by the authorities, and the poor sanitary conditions facilitated the spread of 
contagious diseases. 
</p>
<p> With regard to juveniles, the Police Juvenile Policy and Protocol, an excellent tool 
in dealing with juveniles in conflict with the law, is for the most part not being applied and 
juveniles were held with adults in all police stations visited by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p> Women in Papua New Guinea have a very low social status, which places them at 
very high risk of abuse in the domestic and public spheres. Gender-based violence is 
prevalent throughout the country, with widespread domestic violence and no effective State 
mechanism to address it. In detention, women are extremely vulnerable to sexual abuse 
from police officers or other detainees. 
</p>
<p> Owing to insufficient human and financial resources, a high level of corruption and 
a lack of professionalism, the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary is unable to provide 
security and prevent and investigate crime throughout the country, particularly in rural 
areas. As a result, private security companies have taken over much of the ordinary police 
work. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
issue an unambiguous declaration by the highest authorities that it will not tolerate torture 
or similar ill-treatment by public officials. He also urges the Government to ratify the 
Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto. Other recommended steps 
include amending domestic legislation to include the crime of torture with adequate 
penalties; ensuring prompt and thorough ex officio investigations for all allegations and 
suspicions of ill-treatment or excessive use of force; reducing the time limits for police 
custody to 48 hours; establishing accessible and effective complaint mechanisms; and 
ensuring a comprehensive and structural reform of the Royal Papua New Guinea 
Constabulary. He also recommends the establishment of a country presence of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, Manfred Nowak, undertook a visit to Papua New Guinea, from 14 to 25 
May 2010, at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in the 
country, including conditions of detention, and to initiate a process of cooperation with the 
Government aimed at eradicating torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the Government for its 
invitation to visit the country, which in itself is a sign of the Government&#8217;s willingness to 
open up to independent and objective scrutiny as a means to assess practices of torture and 
ill-treatment and strengthening assistance by the United Nations in the field of criminal 
justice. He also appreciates the full cooperation shown by the authorities during the course 
of the visit, and would like to thank the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary and the 
correctional services for issuing authorization letters providing him with access to all 
detention facilities. During the visit, he was able to carry out unannounced visits to places 
of detention and to conduct confidential interviews with detainees. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with State officials, including the Minister for 
Justice and Attorney General, Ano Pala; the Minister for Internal Security, Sani Rambi; the 
Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Michael M. Maue;  the former 
Minister for the Interior and Justice, Bire Kimisopa; the Chief Administrator of the 
Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Patrick Koles; the Acting Commissioner of 
Correctional Services, Henry Wavik; the Deputy and Acting Commissioner of the Royal 
Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Tom Kolunga; and the Chief Ombudsman, Chronox 
Manek. 
</p>
<p>5. Besides the Government, the Special Rapporteur met with a broad range of civil 
society organizations, lawyers, members of different tribal communities and former 
victims. In addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of 
international organizations, including the United Nations country team, the United Nations 
Development Programme, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross and the diplomatic community. 
</p>
<p>6. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited prisons, police stations and other 
detention facilities (see appendix). 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation for the excellent 
support provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, David McLachlan-Karr, and 
the entire United Nations team for their excellent assistance prior to and during the visit; the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); Dr. Duarte 
Nuno Vieira, forensic doctor; and Tiphanie Crittin and Roland Schmidt of the Ludwig 
Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>8. While still in the country, the Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings 
with the Government, which responded with constructive comments. On 27 October 2010, 
a preliminary version of the present report was sent to the Government for its comments.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Papua New Guinea is party to several of the core United Nations human rights 
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .  
</p>
<p>10. Papua New Guinea is not yet party to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment or the Optional Protocol thereto. It 
is also not party to the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance or the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In addition, 
Papua New Guinea has not ratified or acceded to any of the optional protocols to the above-
mentioned core treaties, or made declarations recognizing the competence of the respective 
committees to receive and consider individual complaints. It has not acceded to or ratified 
the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.1 
</p>
<p>11. Papua New Guinea is party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It is not, however, 
party to the Additional Protocols to the Conventions of 1977 or to the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional and legislative provisions criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Constitution of Papua New Guinea provides for the protection of &#8220;fundamental 
rights&#8221; and &#8220;qualified rights&#8221;. The first set of rights comprises the right to life (sect. 35),  
protection of the law (sect. 37) and the prohibition of &#8220;torture, or treatment or punishment 
that is cruel or otherwise inhuman, or inconsistent with respect for the inherent dignity of 
the human person&#8221; (sect. 36 (1)). The second set of rights includes those that may be 
restricted for, inter alia, the purpose of giving effect to the public interest and to &#8220;the extent 
reasonably justifiable in a democratic society&#8221;. These rights include the liberty of the 
person (sect. 42) and freedom from forced labour (sect. 43). 
</p>
<p>13. The prominent position of the prohibition of torture in the Constitution is not 
reflected in ordinary law, which contains no explicit definition of the crime of torture. 
Indeed,  the term &#8220;torture&#8221; appears only once in the Criminal Code Act as an aggravating 
circumstance in the case of sexual assault (sect. 349 (A)). Instead, the code outlaws several 
offences, including some, but not all, of the elements of the crime of torture as understood 
in the Convention against Torture, such as various forms of assault (division 5), including 
attempts or threats to apply force (sect. 243), excessive use of force (sect. 281), acts 
intended to cause grievous bodily harm and assaults causing bodily harm (sect. 315). The 
Criminal Code Act also outlaws threats to do any injury or cause any detriment to another 
person with the intent to compelling that person to do an act that he or she is lawfully 
entitled to abstain from doing (sect. 359). 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Papua New Guinea is considered de facto abolitionist, despite its abstention from the adoption of 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 63/168 on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty . The death 
penalty for wilful murder was reintroduced in 1991, after having been abolished in 1970. The last 
known execution took place in 1954. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Safeguards against torture and ill-treatment during arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>14. Any person arrested by the police must be taken without delay to a police station,2 
where the officer in charge has to register the person in a permanent register of arrests 
(unless detention is not deemed necessary), inform the detainee of the reasons for the arrest, 
details of the charges and the rights to immediately communicate with a member of their 
family or personal friends in private, and to give instructions to a lawyer of their choice, 
including the public solicitor if entitled to legal aid.3 Refusal or failure to keep records 
relating to a person in confinement is a misdemeanour, punishable by up to three years of 
imprisonment.4  
</p>
<p>15. According to the Constitution, any person arrested or detained on the basis of 
reasonable suspicion of having committed or being about to commit an offence is should be 
brought before a court or a judicial officer without delay, and should not be held further 
except by order of a court or a judicial officer (sect. 42 (3)). Any wilful delay in taking an 
arrested person to the judicial authorities constitutes a misdemeanour.5  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the protection of the physical and psychological integrity of persons 
held in prisons, the Correctional Service Act of 1995 regulates the treatment and conditions 
of detention, including the use of firearms in detention (sect. 111), the use of physical 
restraints against detainees (sects. 55, 57 and 112), and the duty of law enforcement 
officials to ensure the full protection of the health of persons in their custody, including 
aspects of accommodation (sect. 122), hygiene (sects. 122 and 125)6, food and water (sect. 
123),7 exercise (sect. 126)8 and medical services (sects. 88, 89, 141 and 142).9  
</p>
<p>17. Regarding medical examinations as a safeguard against ill-treatment, the 
Correctional Service Act stipulates that a medical officer should examine a detainee &#8220;as 
soon as possible&#8221;, &#8220;wherever practicable&#8221; after a detainee has been admitted, or before the 
detainee is charged or removed from a corrective institution (sect. 88).  According to the 
Correctional Service Regulation, examinations by the medical officer should be carried out 
with a view to detect illnesses that would require segregation from the overall prison, 
hamper rehabilitation or influence the detainee&#8217;s capacity to work (sect. 112).  As such, 
medical examinations are not foreseen to be carried out in order to detect traces of abuse or 
ill-treatment, undermining any safeguarding effect. Similarly, the Arrest Act only provides 
for medical examinations of suspects held in police custody if requested by a commissioned 
officer or the officer in charge, and if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a medical 
examination would provide evidence relating to the offence of which the detainee is a 
suspect (sect. 22). Examinations require the written consent of the detainee or a court order, 
and may only be carried out through the use of force which is &#8220;reasonable in the 
circumstances&#8221; (sect. 22 (6)). As with medical examinations in correctional facilities, there 
is no provision in the legislation that foresees medical examinations as a safeguard against 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>18. The Correctional Service Act stipulates that female and male detainees should be 
held so far as possible in separate correctional institutions. In cases where such separation is 
not possible, female and male detainees are to be held in entirely separate parts of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>facility. Young detainees are also be kept separate from adults (sect. 107(2)(a) and (c)).10 
Children for whom no alternative arrangement suitable to the needs of the child can be 
made may stay with their mothers in prison until the age of three.11 
</p>
<p>19. The Evidence Act excludes any confession as evidence in criminal proceedings if 
the confession was induced by threat or a promise by persons in authority (sect. 28). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Complaints and investigations of acts of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>20. Commanding officers in correctional institutions are responsible for making 
themselves available at reasonable times to receive and record requests and complaints 
from detainees, and to take the action they deem necessary.12 Detainees may also raise 
complaints with visiting magistrates, who must register any complaint in the Visiting 
Magistrate&#8217;s Register, available at each institution.13Despite the existence of visiting 
magistrates, however, there is no provision in the law that provides for an independent, 
external and efficient complaint mechanism. 
</p>
<p>21. Members or officers of the Ombudsman Commission  are also entitled to visit 
detainees in correctional institutions at any time. If practical, a commanding officer of the 
correctional institution should be informed of the intended visit.14 However, the 
Correctional Service Act does not state whether meetings with detainees are private and 
confidential, nor does it have provisions regulating visits to police lock-ups and pretrial 
detention facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>22. Police officers carrying out investigations in violation of the Arrest Act may be 
liable in damages to the person aggrieved by that breach (civil remedy) (sect. 26). However, 
officers found guilty under this proceeding are fully indemnified by the State if they acted 
bona fide, not maliciously or with wilful disregard of their professional duties and 
responsibilities, and not in a grossly negligent manner (sect. 29).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Juvenile Courts Act of 1991 establishes a separate justice system for juvenile 
offenders, namely, those from 7 and 18 years of age (sect. 2). Under the Act, juvenile courts 
have jurisdiction to hear all indictable offences other than homicide, rape or an offence 
punishable by death or life imprisonment (sect. 15).  
</p>
<p>24. To fully implement the Act, which came into force in 2003, the Royal Papua New 
Guinea Constabulary and UNICEF drafted the Police Juvenile Justice Policy and Diversity 
Protocol in February 2006. Its aim was to realign police practices and procedures with the 
Juvenile Courts Act and to ensure that the interests of the juvenile are the primary 
consideration. As a result, arrest and detention in cells are to be used only in extreme or 
special circumstances. In addition, strict confidentiality of their identity and records must 
be maintained. 
</p>
<p>25. The Police Juvenile Justice Policy and Diversity Protocol furthermore prohibits the 
use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (rule 1) and 
establishes that juveniles deprived of their liberty should be treated with humanity and 
</p>
<p>  
 10 See also Juvenile Courts Act, sect. 48(2).

 12 Correctional Service Regulation, sect. 122.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>respect for their inherent dignity (rule 3). Rules 4 and 7 provide for certain safeguards for 
juveniles in detention, including the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate 
assistance, the right to challenge the legality of detention before a court, the right to be 
informed of charges, the right to have matters determined without delay by a competent, 
independent and impartial authority or judicial body, and the presumption of innocence, 
among others.  
</p>
<p>26. If arrested, physical force is not to be used except when the danger or risk of harm or 
escape is unacceptably high. Finally, remand is only to be used as a measure of last resort, 
for the shortest possible period of time, and only for the most serious of crimes. Although 
according to the Police Juvenile Justice Policy and Diversity Protocol juveniles placed on 
remand are to be held in either the Badili or the Hohola remand centres, the Badili centre 
has since been closed down. A juvenile may only be held at the Boroko police station if the 
danger or risk of harm is unacceptably high or if the Superintendent of the Remand Centre 
refuses to accept the juvenile.  
</p>
<p>27. The Act also establishes the function of juvenile court officers, who must be notified 
of any arrest, the reasons for it and the place of detention, and must be allowed access to the 
juvenile. The officer may be present during any interrogation, advise juveniles of their legal 
rights and attend any hearing (sect. 13). 
</p>
<p>28. As a further safeguard, magistrates are given a checklist to ensure that the arrest and 
detention of all juveniles complies with the Act and the Protocol. 
</p>
<p>29. Under the Protocol, emphasis is placed on restorative justice and diversion. The aim 
is to divert juvenile offenders of trivial, minor and less serious offences from the formal 
justice sector. Alternatives to detention, such as mediation and community work, are 
encouraged instead. 
</p>
<p>30. With regard to corporal punishment, it is lawful for a parent, schoolmaster or master 
to use such force &#8220;as is reasonable under the circumstances by way of correction&#8221;.15 This is 
in contravention to international human rights law and jurisprudence, which has concluded 
that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Women 
</b></p>
<p>31. There is no existing legislation that criminalizes domestic violence in Papua New 
Guinea. As such, cases of domestic violence fall under the provisions of common and 
aggravated assault found in the Criminal Code. For its part, the Royal Papua New Guinea 
Constabulary has the Standing Order on Domestic Violence, issued in 1987, instructing 
police to treat cases of domestic violence with the same seriousness as any other assault. As 
a preventive measure, women may petition district courts to issue a protection order or 
require another person to enter a &#8220;good behaviour bond&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>32. In 2002, the Criminal Code Act was amended through the Sexual Offences and 
Crimes against Children Act to make spousal rape and sexual harassment criminal acts. 
However, in the village court system, chiefs may negotiate compensation or traditional 
apologies as a form of resolution for offences committed against women, including rape 
and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Criminal Code Act, sect. 278. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Village courts 
</b></p>
<p>33. In accordance with the Village Court Act, 1986, village courts are established to 
resolve disputes consistent with customary law, which takes precedence over all other 
legislation with the exception of the Constitution. Village courts aim to &#8220;ensure peace and 
harmony&#8221; through mediation and obtain an &#8220;amicable settlement of disputes&#8221;.16 Village 
courts are present throughout most of the country, unlike the institutions of the formal 
justice system. In this regard, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, in its concluding observations following consideration of the State&#8217;s initial, second 
and third reports, urged Papua New Guinea to ensure that the village courts, in their 
decisions, apply the principle of equality and non-discrimination.17  
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence and police response 
</b></p>
<p>34. Papua New Guinea has one of the most heterogeneous populations in the world, 
with very different cultures and beliefs and more than 800 languages spoken in the country. 
This diversity compounds the fundamental challenges faced by law enforcement officials 
when addressing the high level of violence in the country. Furthermore, the spread of 
firearms has exacerbated violent crime and tribal fighting. During the visit, the Special 
Rapporteur himself witnessed the rapid escalation of minor occurrences into violent 
incidents. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, the Special Rapporteur 
was concerned that the police are not always in a position to enforce the rule of law, owing 
to insufficient human and financial resources, widespread corruption and low standards of 
professionalism, difficulties in access to remote rural areas and a lack of political will. As a 
result, private security companies are called upon to carry out some of the main duties of 
the police; there are currently more private security officers (4,800) than police officers 
(1,200 in active duty) in the country. This trend is worrying, because it reflects police 
weakness and a failure of the State to provide security and freedom from fear.  
</p>
<p>36. Another concern is the fact that the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary lacks the 
capacity to prevent and investigate crimes relating to domestic violence, tribal fighting and 
accusations of sorcery. On the latter, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women has expressed serious concern about reports of torture and killings of 
women and girls accused of sorcery, and urged the State to take immediate and effective 
measures to investigate these acts.18 
</p>
<p>37. At the Buka police station, the Special Rapporteur witnessed first-hand a high 
degree of violence by the authorities. During his visit to the police station, an intelligence 
officer verbally assaulted the Special Rapporteur and his team, and attempted to physically 
attack the forensic doctor. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern over this 
incident, and both the Regional Commander and the Police Station Commander apologized 
for the officer&#8217;s misconduct. The Acting Police Commissioner also reassured the Special 
Rapporteur that appropriate action would be taken against the intelligence officer.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>38. In 2004, in response to increasing violence and use of firearms in the country, the 
Minister for Internal Security established a committee to review the Royal Papua New 
Guinea Constabulary. In its report, the committee found that there were serious discipline 
and morale problems within the Constabulary, leading to a loss of confidence and trust, and 
that additional resources were only part of the solution. The committee made a number of 
recommendations, including that (a) independent accountability and review processes be 
established and an office of inspector-general of the Constabulary be created; (b) a review 
of all matters under investigation be conducted by the Ombudsman Commission, which 
should then report to the Minister on recommended action; (c) outstanding increments and 
leave entitlements be paid immediately to all officers, as well as their basic entitlements, as 
a clear signal that the Government recognized the difficulties and seriousness of their jobs; 
(d) all police stations be equipped with basic resources; and (e) all mobile squads and rapid-
response units be returned to core police functions. Unfortunately, these recommendations 
have not yet been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Acts of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>39. On the basis of discussions with public officials, lawyers and representatives of civil 
society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons deprived of their liberty, often 
supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special Rapporteur found isolated cases of 
torture in the classical sense of deliberately inflicting severe pain or suffering as a means of 
extracting a confession or information. He did, however, find a considerable number of 
cases where persons were subjected to different degrees of beatings as a form of 
punishment, which may also amount to torture. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur found evidence of systematic beatings of detainees upon 
arrest or within the first hours of detention, including during interrogation. The beatings 
were frequently inflicted by the police as a form of punishment, reflecting a complete 
disrespect for the presumption of innocence and the dignity of persons suspected of crimes. 
Beatings were practiced with various tools, including automobile fan belts, bush knives, 
gun butts, iron rods and wooden sticks. Detainees were also punched and kicked, mainly as 
a form of punishment or intimidation by the police and as a way to establish authority. 
Although the Special Rapporteur did not come across more brutal and sophisticated 
methods of torture, police beatings often reached the same degree as torture, a fact that was 
largely corroborated by medical evidence. During the visit to the Kundiawa police station, 
for example, the beatings were confirmed by one of the Criminal Investigation Department 
officers. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned about the practice of police to 
deliberately disable persons suspected of serious crimes. This was confirmed by the 
testimonies of former victims of police abuse at the Rehabilitation Centre for Persons with 
Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>42. In correctional institutions, the Special Rapporteur was alarmed to see a standard 
practice of inflicting torture upon recapture on those who had attempted to or succeeded in 
escaping. These detainees are subjected to brutal beatings with bush knives and gun butts, 
shot in the leg and feet at close range, and their tendons are cut with bush knives and axes, 
with the deliberate intent to disable them. After they are tortured, the victims are usually 
kept in punishment cells for months, without medical attention, and in some cases 
eventually die. This practice seems to be confirmed by the need to issue a formal minute 
dated 21 May 2010, whereby the Chief Superintendent of the Baisu correctional institution 
specifically instructed all officers to &#8220;refrain from assaulting an escapee remand detainee&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur also received many complaints of beatings of juveniles. 
Particular concern was expressed by the Special Rapporteur concerning the high number of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>juveniles at the Baisu correctional institution who had been subjected to beatings and other 
forms of ill-treatment, and whose allegations were supported by medical evidence. 
</p>
<p>44. Collective punishment is also common in correctional institutions, whereby 
complete sections are sanctioned for the actions of a few detainees. At the Bomana 
correctional institution, the guards carried out raids after attempted escapes or strikes. They 
would force all detainees to strip, beat them and take their belongings. After one escape, all 
detainees were down for two months in the maximum security (general) section.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also found evidence of the excessive use of force by the 
police outside of detention, which amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This 
is practiced in dealing with crime and also, for example, in evicting residents from 
settlements. During a visit to the Five-Mile Ridge settlement in Port Moresby, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of an eviction that took place in June 2009, whereby the people 
living there were threatened and/or beaten by the police, their valuables were taken away, 
their shops were looted and their houses were either bulldozed or burned down. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>46. Impunity for torture and ill-treatment in Papua New Guinea is fuelled by the lack of 
effective complaint mechanisms, independent investigations, monitoring and other similar 
safeguards.  
</p>
<p>47. In a very frank discussion at one of the police stations visited, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed by a Criminal Investigation Department officer of some of the 
difficulties faced in terms of investigations. In this regard, he stated that detainees were 
often released on bail even if they faced other charges, making it almost impossible to 
investigate. As a result, when the suspects were once again found, they were shot and 
killed, which was &#8220;much easier&#8221; than going through the judicial process. The Special 
Rapporteur is extremely concerned at this admission of what would amount to a practice of 
extrajudicial execution. 
</p>
<p>48. The high level of impunity for police violence may be illustrated by the following 
example. The Special Rapporteur came across one investigating officer who had been 
entrusted to investigate the death in custody of Dokta Balu at the Kundiawa police station. 
On 10 August 2009, Mr. Balu, standing outside the station, was ordered by Senior 
Constable Jeffry Pyasoto not to move. When Mr. Balu ran away, he was caught by 
Constable Pyasoto, beaten on his face and body and taken to the police station, where Mr. 
Balu was beaten and kicked in the face, head and body until he lost consciousness. He was 
dragged to a cell, where he died that night. The post mortem confirmed that Mr. Balu had 
died as a result of excessive force. The occurrence book indicated that Mr. Balu had been 
arrested for drunkenness and assault, although no additional information was provided. A 
second entry confirmed his death inside the police cell. On 12 November 2009, Constable 
Pyasoto was questioned, arrested and charged with wilful murder. He was, however, 
released on bail immediately after the Rural Commander Inspector suggested that the 
interview should be suspended until the Provincial Police Commander returned to the 
province. Since the Provincial Police Commander never gave further instructions, 
Constable Pyasoto was re-arrested only on 17 March 2010. On 22 March 2010, he was once 
again granted bail.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, although the investigation had been 
obstructed, one clear investigative conclusion was that Constable Pyasoto should be 
indicted for wilful murder. The Special Rapporteur was also made aware that there were 
three additional cases of deaths in custody where the investigations had been terminated, 
though they should be reviewed and potentially resumed. The Special Rapporteur </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>encourages all relevant authorities to investigate all cases of deaths in custody, as well as 
those concerning torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur found that conditions of detention in police lock-ups and 
correctional institutions varied greatly, although there was a general atmosphere of violence 
and neglect in many places of detention. Since there are no effective oversight mechanisms 
and bribery is prevalent in the criminal justice system, many detainees were held in 
detention or remand for prolonged periods, mainly those who lacked financial means. 
Additionally, those deprived of their liberty had no knowledge of or trust in any complaint 
mechanism that may be available.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Police stations 
</b></p>
<p>51. In Papua New Guinea, detainees were held in remand at police lock-ups often for 
several months, and sometimes for more than a year. This is in clear contravention of 
international human rights standards concerning detention. Police lock-ups are built for 
short periods of detention of a maximum of 48 hours, during which time the detainee&#8217;s case 
should be brought before a judge, who should either release or transfer the detainee to a 
remand centre under a different authority. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that many 
of the detainees had been held in police lock-ups for a prolonged period in appalling 
conditions, amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment.  
</p>
<p>52. In this regard, in none of the police stations visited by the Special Rapporteur did the 
conditions comply with international minimum standards for the humane treatment of 
detainees. Detainees were locked up in overcrowded and filthy cells, without proper 
ventilation or natural light. In all police lock-ups (with the exception of some detainees at 
the Bihute police station), detainees were forced to sleep on a concrete floor, sometimes on 
only a piece of cardboard. The cells were often infested with mice, cockroaches and other 
insects. At the Arawa police station, which was small, dirty and run-down, officers stated 
there was usually no electricity available, but because the electoral ballots were being kept 
there, the electoral commission had provided them with light bulbs. Access to food was 
greatly limited; the food provided by families, in the few instances where they were 
allowed to visit, was usually not allowed. 
</p>
<p>53. Access to water for drinking, washing or toilet use was also severely limited. In 
addition, the toilets had to be flushed from outside, creating an unnecessary dependence of 
the detainees on police officers. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned that, in 
the Highlands region, the authorities alleged that detainees did not have continuous access 
to water owing to a shortage in the region. Given the natural availability of water in the 
region, this explanation suggested that access to water was deliberately restricted. A further 
concern in the police lock-ups in the Highlands region was the lack of blankets and warm 
clothes for detainees despite the low night-time temperatures. 
</p>
<p>54. With regard to sanitation, the Special Rapporteur found that the poor detention 
conditions were conducive to the spread of cholera and other diseases. In the Mount Hagen 
police station, for example, detainees were forced to urinate and defecate in plastic bags, 
which were then picked up by female detainees and collected in the courtyard. Furthermore, 
the courtyard was littered with used condoms, and the Special Rapporteur found two large 
boxes of unused condoms available in the Police Station Commander&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>55. With regard to health, there was generally no access to medical attention, leading to 
avoidable amputations and even deaths in custody. In the Goroka police station, a man with 
a serious foot injury had been held for his own protection for over a month. He had been </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>taken out of his cell because of the odour from his injury; because of the lack of even the 
most basic medical care, his foot would probably have to be amputated.  
</p>
<p>56. The overall impression of the Special Rapporteur regarding police lock-ups was one 
of negligence. Although the Boroka police station had clean cells and detainees received 
sufficient water and food, conditions in the Goroka and the Mount Hagen police stations 
were particularly appalling, reflecting total disregard for human dignity. For this, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Mount Hagen police stations be closed 
immediately.  
</p>
<p>57. In some of the police lock-ups visited, including the Kundiawa and the Mount 
Hagen police stations, the Special Rapporteur was shocked to see that the authorities did 
not have the keys to all of the cells, posing a very serious safety concern. In the Boroka 
police station, on the other hand, the Special Rapporteur was able to enter the lock-up and 
speak to some of the detainees, including women, without any keys. This clearly confirmed 
the allegation that women were often not separated from men in police custody and in 
danger of sexual and other abuses.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Correctional institutions 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was pleased at the strict separation of men from women in 
correctional institutions. Juveniles were, in principle, kept separate as well. Those held in 
remand and convicted prisoners were held in separate sections, but could mingle during the 
day. At the Bomana correctional institution, persons convicted to death were kept together 
with other detainees. 
</p>
<p>59. The conditions in correctional institutions were generally poor. Most institutions 
were overcrowded, particularly high-risk and remand sections, as were punishment and 
detention cells. At the Bomana and the Baisu correctional institutions, most detainees kept 
in detention cells were escapees who had been severely beaten, shot or had their tendons 
cut upon recapture. They were deliberately denied access to medical attention and kept in a 
cell for up to three months. At the Baisu correctional institution, on 13 April 2010, 84 
detainees escaped. Two of the detainees were later recaptured and had died as a result of the 
severe beatings to which they were subjected. One died immediately after being shot, while 
the second died a few days later in the detention cell, after he was denied access to medical 
attention. The two deaths were confirmed by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>60. The lack of medical attention also affected many other detainees, and the poor 
sanitary conditions facilitated the spread of contagious diseases. In most correctional 
institutions, very few sections had running water or mosquito nets. There were also not 
enough beds or mattresses, and food was insufficient and of very low nutritional value. 
</p>
<p>61. In principle, correctional institutions in Papua New Guinea provided prisoners with 
opportunities for work. At the Baisu correctional institution, however, detainees had no 
opportunities for work, education or other forms of recreation, and were locked in their 
cells for up to 18 hours a day. In the Bomana, Barawagi and Mukrumanda correctional 
institutions (the last of which only held four detainees), detainees were allowed to be 
outside their cells for longer hours than in Baisu, although not many possibilities for work 
or recreation were available. The best practice example was the Bihute correctional 
institution, where the opportunities available for detainees allowed for a real possibility of 
rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>62. In the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, the police lock-ups in Buka, Arawa and 
Buin were used to hold convicted prisoners, because the only prison had been destroyed 
during the armed conflict. On 18 August 2009, Justice David Cannings issued a court order 
requiring the State of Papua New Guinea, through the Secretary of Finance and Treasury, to 
make funds available urgently to establish a correctional institution in Bougainville. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>funding was supposed to have been made available by 18 September 2009; however, 
despite the fact that both the national Constitution and the Constitution of Bougainville 
establish certain rights for detainees, including to be treated with humanity and respect for 
the inherent dignity of the human person, no progress has been made in constructing a 
facility. This was confirmed by the Chief Administrator of Bougainville. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities and diseases 
</b></p>
<p>63. The detention facilities visited by the Special Rapporteur offered little or no medical 
care. Persons held in police custody had no access to medical attention, regardless of 
whether they were there for their own protection or in detention. At the Bomana 
correctional institution, the Special Rapporteur found several detainees receiving treatment 
in the hospital; however, they were locked up without the presence of a doctor, nurse or 
guard. In addition, several detainees stated that the treatment and medication available was 
insufficient and eight detainees had died in 2009 from different illnesses. At the Baisu 
correctional institution, the medical facilities had been closed down because no health 
worker was available, and detainees had no access to the local hospital. 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to psychiatric attention, Laloki Psychiatric Hospital, which is very old 
and run-down, is the only facility in the country for persons with mental disabilities. A new 
development plan had been adopted but no funds were available for the new project. The 
Special Rapporteur was unable to speak to the detainees in the closed wing for security 
reasons (as claimed by the medical personnel). The hospital does not have adequate staff, 
and the Special Rapporteur was informed during his visit that there was no permanent 
resident psychiatrist, and that only two psychiatrists visited the hospital one day per week.  
</p>
<p>65. Psychiatric support in detention facilities did not comply with international 
minimum standards. Psychiatric evaluations were not performed on a routine basis or in an 
independent and professional manner; as a result, many detainees with both physical and 
mental disabilities in correctional institutions and police lock-ups have no access to 
adequate medical treatment and rehabilitation. At the Mount Hagen and the Buka police 
stations, the Special Rapporteur found detainees with mental disabilities locked in police 
cells. In Buka, one detainee had been held for 18 months, without ever having had access to 
a psychiatrist or a lawyer. At the Baisu correctional institution, at least five mentally ill 
detainees were held together with the general population. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur also found that Papua New Guinea lacks a proper forensic 
system capable of assuring timely and adequate examinations of victims of torture and ill-
treatment. Prompt and complete forensic autopsies in compliance with international 
standards were also lacking. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Juveniles 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Police Juvenile Justice Policy and Diversity Protocol is an excellent tool to deal 
with juveniles in conflict with the law; unfortunately, it is for the most part not applied. 
Although it declares that police cells should only be used in extreme circumstances, the 
Special Rapporteur interviewed juveniles in all police stations visited, and did not come 
across any where juveniles were separated from adults. Additionally, the juvenile reception 
centre in Boroko was not in use owing to alleged attempted escapes. The Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that, even though UNICEF had provided a substantive amount 
of funding to build the reception centre, it had not been informed of its closure. During his 
visit to the Goroka police station, no juveniles were being held at the juvenile reception 
centre. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The conditions in correctional institutions were better for juveniles than for adults. 
In all the facilities visited that had a juvenile section, beds and blankets were provided. In 
the case of adult detainees, however, the quantity and quality of the food was inadequate. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur found some boys being held with adults, even when there 
was a separate section for juveniles. Particularly worrying was that, at the Bomana 
correctional institution, many of the juveniles had been remanded, in clear contravention of 
the Protocol. The Special Rapporteur commends the work carried out by the Brothers of the 
Sacred Heart, who run the Hohola remand centre for juveniles. The juveniles were held in a 
well-equipped facility in a friendly and stimulating environment, and provided with 
opportunities for education and work. The Government gives economic assistance to the 
Brothers of the Sacred Heart to run Hohola, but it is insufficient. Inadequate funding was 
indeed part of the reason why the other centre for remanded juveniles, the Badili Remand 
Centre, had to be closed by the institution that ran it. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>69. Women in Papua New Guinea have very low social status, partly due to the fact that 
most communities are patriarchal, placing them at a very high risk of abuse in the domestic 
and public spheres. Gender-based violence is prevalent throughout the country, and 
domestic violence is widespread. These acts are, for the most part, underreported owing to 
shame or fear of further violence or rejection by the communities. Little support is afforded 
by the State, as there is no effective mechanism to address violence against women. In this 
regard, many victims of domestic violence are not even recognized as victims by society, 
and violence against women appears to be socially legitimized and accompanied by a 
culture of silence and impunity.19 Of concern was the fact that many female detainees 
interviewed by the Special Rapporteur had been incarcerated for crimes linked to domestic 
violence and polygamy.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to find that women were extremely 
vulnerable upon arrest and in police custody. Although women were kept in separate cells, 
they were not always protected against police officers or other detainees. At the Boroko 
police station, for example, the Special Rapporteur was able to enter the cell without the 
presence of any police officer, because there was no lock. A similar situation was found at 
the Mount Hagen police station, where the Special Rapporteur also found a large quantity 
of unused condoms in the Commander&#8217;s office. In general, the Special Rapporteur received 
many allegations of sexual abuse and of threats of sexual abuse in exchange for release 
from custody. Some officers appeared to arrest women for minor offences with the 
intention of abusing them sexually. Additional allegations were received of male detainees 
entering cells where women were held and engaging in acts of sexual violence. As 
punishment, some women were threatened or placed in cells with male detainees for a 
night, where they were subjected to collective rape. Women were also forced to perform 
domestic work for officers in both police stations and correctional institutions, including 
doing their laundry and making string bags (<i>bilums</i>) for the officers to sell. In the Mount 
Hagen police station, the women also had to collect the male detainees&#8217; plastic bags and 
bottles filled with urine and excrement and wash their clothes. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>71. In the correctional institutions visited by the Special Rapporteur, the women&#8217;s 
sections of the facilities were better maintained. With the exception of the Baisu 
correctional institution, female detainees were only guarded by female officers. In the 
Bomana correctional institution, the section for women with children was overcrowded, and 
detainees were forced to sleep on the floor. In addition, the food given to the mothers was 
inappropriate for breastfeeding mothers and for children, although they were allowed to eat 
some vegetables that they grew themselves. Access to medical attention was limited and 
there was concern among the detainees about cases of tuberculosis. The Special Rapporteur 
also received many complaints from female detainees that they were not allowed to wear 
brassieres, which caused many of them severe pain. 
</p>
<p>72. In the Bihute correctional institution, women were provided with several educational 
and recreational opportunities. Counselling was also available for detainees, and officers 
were actively involved in rehabilitation processes. Medical attention was available and, in 
general, the facility offered a suitable environment for children living with their mothers in 
detention. The women&#8217;s section in Bihute should serve as an example to other prisons 
throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the Government of 
Papua New Guinea for the cooperation of the authorities during his mission, which he 
interprets as a sign of the Government&#8217;s willingness to open up to independent and 
objective scrutiny. He also appreciates the challenges faced by the Government in 
addressing the widespread violence in the country, a particularly challenging task 
owing to the very different cultures and beliefs and more than 800 languages spoken 
in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that the Royal Papua New 
Guinea Constabulary is not always in a position to enforce the rule of law, owing to 
insufficient human and financial resources, widespread corruption and lack of 
professionalism, the difficulties in reaching remote rural areas and the lack of political 
will. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and 
representatives of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons 
deprived of their liberty, often supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special 
Rapporteur found isolated cases of torture in the classical sense of deliberately 
inflicting severe pain or suffering as a means of extracting a confession or 
information. He also found a considerable number of cases where persons were 
subjected to different degrees of beatings by the police during the arrest and as a form 
of punishment, which may also amount to torture. He found evidence of systematic 
beatings of detainees upon arrest or within the first hours of detention, including 
during interrogation. Impunity for these cases is fuelled by the absence of effective 
complaint mechanisms, independent investigations, monitoring and other similar 
safeguards. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur found a general atmosphere of violence in places of 
detention, as well as neglect in all police lock-ups and some correctional institutions. 
The conditions of detention in police stations did not comply with international 
minimum standards for the humane treatment of detainees. Detainees were locked up 
in overcrowded and filthy cells, without proper ventilation or natural light for periods </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b>of up to a year. They were forced to sleep on the floor, the cells were often infested 
with mice, cockroaches and other insects, and access to food and water for drinking, 
washing or for toilet use was severely limited. Detention for such long periods in these 
conditions amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The conditions in correctional institutions were generally better, but the 
facilities were still overcrowded, particularly remand and maximum security sections, 
as were punishment cells. There was a strict separation between men and women, and 
in principle juveniles were also kept in separate sections. However, there was an 
overall lack of medical attention, even for those who had been severely beaten by the 
authorities, and the poor sanitary conditions facilitated the spread of contagious 
diseases. There were few correctional institutions with running water, mosquito nets, 
beds and mattresses. Food was also insufficient and of very low nutritional value. In 
principle, there were work and educational opportunities for detainees.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Despite the existence of the Police Juvenile Policy and Diversity Protocol, an 
excellent tool for dealing with juveniles in conflict with the law, it is for the most part 
not applied. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur did not come across any police 
station where juveniles were held separately from adults, although in correctional 
institutions juveniles were kept separate, in better conditions than male adults. The 
Special Rapporteur was particularly pleased with the privately run Hohola remand 
centre for juveniles, a well-equipped facility where juveniles were provided with a 
friendly and stimulating environment, including opportunities for education and 
work. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Women in Papua New Guinea have a very low social status, placing them at a 
very high risk of abuse both in the domestic and in the public sphere. Gender-based 
violence is prevalent throughout the country; domestic violence is widespread and 
there is no effective State mechanism to address it. In detention, women are extremely 
vulnerable to sexual abuse from police officers or other detainees. Women&#8217;s sections 
in correctional institutions were better maintained and, in general, female prisoners 
had opportunities to work, study or obtain counselling. However, women were also 
forced to perform domestic work for officers both in police stations and correctional 
institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur addresses 
the following recommendations to the Government of Papua New Guinea, aimed at 
preventing torture and ill-treatment and improving conditions of detention. He was 
assured that every effort would be taken to implement his recommendations, and 
stands ready to offer his full cooperation and assistance in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Have the highest authorities, in particular those responsible for law 
enforcement activities, declare unambiguously that they will not tolerate torture or 
similar ill-treatment by public officials and that those in command at the time abuses 
are perpetrated will be held personally responsible for them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto, providing for 
regular preventive visits to all places of detention by an independent domestic 
monitoring body. A declaration should be made with respect to article 22 of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention, recognizing the competence of the Committee against Torture to receive 
and consider communications from individuals who claim to be victims of a violation 
of the provisions of the Convention; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ratify the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, providing for the right to lodge individual complaints to the 
Human Rights Committee; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Amend domestic legislation to include the crime of torture with adequate 
penalties. The definition of this crime should be in full accordance with article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure prompt and thorough ex officio investigations for all allegations 
and suspicions of ill-treatment or excessive use of force by an authority that is 
independent from the investigation and prosecution. Any officer known to be abusive 
should be removed from custodial duties. Heads of police stations and detention 
facilities should be made aware of their supervisory responsibility. In particular, the 
allegations documented in the appendix to the present report should be thoroughly 
investigated and the perpetrators of torture and ill-treatment brought to justice. The 
forensic examinations conducted during the mission should be used as evidence in 
criminal trials against the perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure a comprehensive and structural reform of the Royal Papua New 
Guinea Constabulary in accordance with the September 2004 recommendations of the 
Administrative Review Committee to the Minister for Internal Security. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Safeguards and prevention 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Reduce, as a matter of urgent priority, the period of police custody to a 
time limit in line with international standards (maximum 48 hours). After this period, 
detainees should be released or transferred to a separate remand facility under a 
different authority; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establish accessible and effective complaint mechanisms in all places of 
detention. Complaints by detainees should be followed up by independent and 
thorough investigations, and complainants must be protected from reprisals. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Condition of detention 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that persons deprived of their liberty are confined in facilities 
where conditions comply with international minimum sanitary and hygiene standards 
and that detainees are provided with basic necessities, such as adequate floor space, 
bedding, food, water and health care. Prisoners should be provided with opportunities

<p><b>  Places of detention visited and interviews conducted 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur conducted unannounced visits to detention facilities and was able 
to hold private interviews with detainees in all facilities he visited. 20 If detainees did not 
wish that their interviews are recorded, the information provided is only reflected in the 
general findings of the report. Some detainees only agreed to an anonymous publication of 
their interviews. The individual interviews do not contain established facts but allegations 
by detainees deemed to be credible and consistent by the Special Rapporteur. It is indicated 
if these allegations were corroborated by forensic examinations, witness testimonies or 
other evidence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bomana Correctional Facility, Port Moresby  
Visited on 15 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by CIP Agnes Kinjil, who had not been informed of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s presence in the country. Bomana prison comprised a general 
section which included remandees as well as convicted prisoners, a separate section for 
juveniles and another section for female detainees. Detainees deemed to be high risk were 
held in a &#8220;separate confinement&#8221; section known as MSI (Maximum Security Institution). 
There were less than 30 female detainees, and less than 30 juvenile detainees.  
</p>
<p><b>  General section 
</b></p>
<p>There were 404 detainees in the general section. They were confined to their dormitories 
from 4:30 p.m. to 7 a.m., when roll-call took place and breakfast was distributed. At 
approximately 4:30 p.m., the dormitories were locked again. During the day, detainees 
could move freely between the dormitories. Remandees and convicts were not separated. 
There are only three guards for the entire general section, and it seemed that there was some 
understanding by the detainees of the difficult situation regarding manpower. Visits took 
place on Saturdays (remandees) and Sundays (convicted) and lasted approximately 30

<p>minutes. Meals were provided three times a day, biscuits and tea in the morning and rice 
and canned fish or meat for lunch and dinner. The insufficient quantity and the poor quality 
of the food, as well as the fact that they always received the same meal was one of the 
major complaints from detainees. Numerous detainees reported collective punishment for 
attempted escapes or violations of the internal rules by a few detainees. The dormitories 
were quite clean, and most detainees had mosquito nets, although they did not have 
mattresses. The main concerns were the spread of diseases such as cholera, and the lack of 
medical care. Some detainees had been allegedly beaten heavily by the Police in Port 
Moresby, often by the CID, in the bush after being arrested and before they were taken to 
the police station. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Group interview in cell 2  
</i></p>
<p>Detainees complained of compound raids as a form of collective punishment if there was an 
escape or a strike. The detainees were stripped naked and beaten with any tools available to 
the guards, including bush knives, forks and sticks. The last time had occurred two weeks 
before the visit of the Special Rapporteur. Homebrewed alcohol had been found and all the 
detainees were punished, their belongings were taken and more than 20 guards and off-duty 
officers came and beat them.  
</p>
<p>On 1 May 2010 there had been a police raid, during which detainees were stripped, beaten 
and their belongings taken. After the raid, detainees were not allowed to raise complaints. 
In September 2009 the detainees had made a petition to the Commissioner of Correctional 
Services to visit them as there had been three deaths from illness, and the detainees wanted 
the Commissioner to investigate and improve the conditions. However they were punished 
with a raid. Tear gas was fired into the cells, the detainees were stripped, had to walk out of 
cells and were mocked and beaten by male and female guards. Their belongings were taken 
and burnt. On 14 August 2009 there had been another raid. In 2009, eight detainees died of 
disease and in 2010, one had died from internal bleeding and one from tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p>No medical examination was performed on arrival at the prison. Some detainees had bullet 
wounds and had not received any treatment. On 10 May 2010, one of the detainees, <b>P.G.</b>, 
had died from tuberculosis after seven years in detention. He had been healthy when he 
arrived and had lived in the same cell with others. He had only been given the first dose of 
medication but not the second one.  
</p>
<p><b>David Gonz</b>, aged 36. He has been a remandee for one year but had already spent four 
years in detention on separate charges. At the time of his arrest, police came to his house 
and burnt it down. He surrendered for his own safety since he thought he would have been 
shot otherwise. At Boroko Police Station he was assaulted during the interrogation for more 
than four hours. He stayed there for a few weeks and was subsequently taken to Court and 
to Bomana. He complains that there are collective punishments, for instance when there is 
an escape. The remaining ones are then systematically stripped naked outside, asked to lie 
down on the floor, and beaten. On 27 September 2009, 61 inmates escaped from all 
compounds, allegedly because some detainees had died of tuberculosis in the cells due to an 
outbreak that was not taken care of by the management, and that created panic. At this 
occasion, they were stripped naked and beaten by security officers, then locked up for two 
months. He also mentioned that two weeks earlier an inmate had died of tuberculosis 
because he was not transported to hospital in time to be treated. He also noticed that the 
cells are overcrowded and that some inmates have to sleep on the floor. There is also inter-
prisoner violence, and he states that the place is not safe due to fights. Due to the lack of 
manpower, vehicles and resources, medical issues are not properly addressed. He 
recommends the facility to hire a full-time doctor.  </p>

<p><b>Jeffrey Wosi</b>, aged 33, was arrested on 3 March 2009 by the mobile squad. They 
blindfolded him and took him to the Saraga settlement with four cars. He was badly hit with 
iron pipes by the officers, who wanted him to confess to a crime. He had very large scars on 
his knee and on his back. On the knee he was cut with a knife and then thrown on the floor. 
He was then taken to Boroko police station, and later driven to the hospital. There, the 
police told the nurses that he was a &#8216;raskol&#8217; and that there was no need to treat him. He was 
then taken back to Boroko police station for a month and then to Bomana. He had not seen 
a doctor since he left the hospital. Despite the fact that he reported this to his lawyer, no 
action was taken. 
</p>
<p><b>Roger Bai</b>, aged 31, was arrested by the Special Crime Squad at his place on 28 February 
at 2 a.m. because he was suspected of a crime. He was kicked and threatened with guns, 
before being blindfolded and handcuffed. They put him into a car, punched him, and took 
him to Dogura, in the remote outskirts of Port Moresby, a place where the police are 
allegedly known to take people in order to beat them. There, he was beaten on the shoulders 
with a metallic stick and fell off the car. He was then asked to run away. He refused, scared 
that the police would shoot him while fleeing. He was then beaten all over his body for 
hours while lying on the ground. He was threatened to be killed and shot in the leg. His 
right leg was beaten so severely that it broke. When the officers asked him to go back 
inside the car he could not move and had to be lifted. The officers then took him to Boroko 
Police Station, and he was formally charged by the police the same day. However, he was 
put in the lock-up without any medical check-up and denied the right to go to the hospital 
because there was no car available to take him. He spent a month in the cell without any 
treatment, and underwent surgery after X-rays showed that his leg was broken. His leg was 
still in the plaster cast at the time of the interview, and his eyesight in his left eye was bad 
because he had been beaten on the face as well. His story was corroborated by medical 
evidence. Although he complained to his lawyer, he still had not been taken to Court after 
almost three months. 
</p>
<p><b>Tua Yangat Biori Silopon</b>, aged 27, was arrested on 13 May 2009 at the Saraga area and 
taken to Six Mile Police Station. Then he was taken by CID officers to Boroko Police 
Station, with a mask on his face. In the CID office, he was interrogated and beaten with a 
metallic hammer and an ax, and threatened to be burnt with boiling water. The officers 
were Aaron Silas, Edi Nieara, and Mansion Tutuni. A lady came in the office and he was 
told that it was an identity parade. She did not recognize him and left. Officer Silas told him 
he would release him for 1000 Kinas, but he had no money and declined the offer. He was 
then locked for three months without any development, and then asked for 1000 Kinas 
again. Some time later he was taken to Eight Mile area of Port Moresby. During the ride he 
was beaten so badly that he cried and wanted to die. Once there, he was asked to run away 
in the bush but refused, knowing that he would be shot in the back. He went back to Boroko 
Police Station where he was interrogated for four days. At Bomana Correctional Institution, 
he was subjected to the collective punishment inflicted on all detainees after the escape of 
some detainees in January 2010. The Office of the Public Solicitor is helping him, and his 
next Court hearing was scheduled to happen some days later. 
</p>
<p><b>J. V.</b> had been at Bomana since 2001. Upon arrest, he was taken to Boroko Police Station, 
where he was beaten with a rifle butt on the back of the head. He was threatened with death 
if he did not confess. During the one-hour interrogation, he was also beaten by three CID 
officers. He complained that although he had surrendered and had admitted he was guilty, 
he had still been beaten. He was held at Boroko Police Station for four days and was only 
able to inform his family after two days. At Bomana, he was forced to take his clothes off at 
the main gate (&#8220;naked beach&#8221;) and was mocked by the officers during the body search. He 
indicated that during the raids, all detainees would be forced to go outside in a straight line, 
without clothes, where they were beaten. He added that he would like to run away because 
of the ill-treatment he was subjected to as a result of four different escape attempts. Each </p>

<p>time he was recaptured, he was beaten all over his body and locked up in a detention cell 
without any medical treatment. During his last recapture in 2007, he had been taken to the 
maximum security section where he was beaten on the back and arms. Three months later, 
he was sent back to the general section after he complained to the welfare manager about 
the ill-treatment. He was afraid of reprisals for speaking to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>Rinagi Veira,</b> aged 32, was arrested in May 2008 at gunpoint at his home and was 
transferred to Boroko Police Station, where he was held three days without charge, before 
being released on bail. He was convicted in March 2009, and received his sentence in 
November 2009. Since then he has been detained at Bomona. Mr. Veira reported about a 
recent incident in which some detainees had been caught secretly brewing an alcoholic 
drink. As a reaction, all detainees had to gather in their respective dormitories, while 
officers from other sections were alarmed and ordered to section B. Subsequently, all 
detainees were instructed to undress, leave the dormitory one by one, and pass by the 
waiting officers who started to hit each detainee, including with timber sticks and the flat 
side of large bush knives. Once all detainees had left the dormitory and were beaten, the 
officers went into the facilities and searched their personal belongings. In several cases, 
detainees&#8217; items had been seized and were used for by the officers for private purposes. 
</p>
<p><b>Jessy Souh</b>, aged 32, was travelling with eleven other persons in July 2008 on the Magi 
Highway when their cars were stopped by the police. Without being informed of what they 
were accused of, Mr. Sough and his colleagues were arrested and their hands were tied 
behind their backs with wires. Subsequently, they were ordered to lie on the ground and 
police officers walked over their bodies and kicked their backs. The group was then moved 
into a police bus, and the detainees were piled on top of each other in the space between the 
seats. During the three-and-a-half hours transfer to Boroko Police Station, Mr. Souh and his 
colleagues had to remain in this position, which was painful and caused numbness in some 
of the detainee&#8217;s arms and legs. On 24 July 2008, Mr. Souh was transferred to the 
maximum security facility in Bomana where he was held until 17 August 2009, when he 
was eventually transferred to the general compound. 
</p>
<p><b>Junior Paul Allen</b>, aged 26, from Central Province escaped with several other detainees 
from Bomana Correctional Institution in September 2009 and was re-apprehended a month 
later. He was confined to the Maximum Security Institution (MSI) for six months, from 
where he was transferred only five days prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur. After 
his re-arrest, Mr. Allen was transferred to Bomana Correctional Institution, where upon 
arrival at Gate 24 he was stripped naked and beaten by four officers with timber sticks. He 
was further threatened, and told that any future attempt to escape would be his death. 
During his time at the MSI, Mr. Allen developed numbness in his feet which made him 
need crutches to walk. He was not seen by any doctor, and crutches were provided by 
friends. With regard to the general conditions of detention, Mr. Allen emphasized the lack 
of proper medical attention, which was not only due to a lack of resources, but also a 
prevalent negligence from the authorities&#8217; side and their lack of motivation to enquire into 
the medical situation of the detainees.  
</p>
<p><b>Goisi Rex, </b>aged 19, from West Sepik. Upon arrival of the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Rex was 
carried on a stretcher from the medical unit to the general compound, where he was later 
put on the ground next to the dormitory. He had been held in the punishment cell for the 
last two months. He reported that his legs had become increasingly numb, making him 
unable to stand or walk on his own. Mr. Rex explained that his medical state was due to the 
poor insufficient quality and quantity of food as well as the lack of sunlight and physical 
exercise in the punishment cell. Detainees who are confined to the punishment cell are not 
allowed to leave the section throughout their period of punishment.  </p>

</i></p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged between 19 and 20, has been recaptured in February 2010 after he 
escaped. The police came into his home, woke him up and shot him in the leg in front of the 
police car. He spent four days in the detention cell without any medical attention, until he 
was given hot water by the cook to clean the wound. His crutches had been provided by the 
other detainees. He added that he was turned away each time he requested medical 
assistance. A medical examination was performed by the forensic doctor who observed 
traumatic lesions totally compatible with the allegations and that clearly needed for medical 
treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>N.D.A</b>., aged 29, has been shot by the police on 26 May 2009 after he surrendered, 
following a car chase. He was asked to lie down on the floor and the police shot him three 
times with a machine gun. He was then put inside the police car, where an officer smashed 
a brick on his leg. Afterward, the police drove around for a few hours and later parked the 
car behind a police station when he became unconscious. He was taken to the hospital 
where he woke up, and he remained there for eight months until he escaped. He surrendered 
to Geragu Police Station on 4 March 2010, before asking the police commissioner to 
guarantee his safety in detention. Upon arrival at Bomana Correctional Institution, he was 
strip-searched at the main gate and beaten with long wooden sticks. He missed two court 
appointments because there was no vehicle to transport him. He complained about being 
beaten with an iron rod for taking a long shower on the day of the visit. He was not allowed 
to meet any visitors because he was suspected of helping a detainee escape. The forensic 
medical examination showed some small  traumatic lesions compatible with the allegations, 
although not specific, being acceptable, from the scientific point of view, that the majority 
of them could had already disappear due to the period of time passed since the alleged 
beating.

</i></p>
<p>Six male detainees from the general compound were held here, due mainly to tuberculosis, 
back pain and urinary tract problems. The medical staff was under the authority of the jail 
commander and not a medical authority. The detainees with serious cases were taken to the 
hospital. The detainees held there were: <b>Michael Mikaro</b> (tuberculosis, 5 months in 
hospital, no x-ray), <b>Mr. Natanio</b> (back pain, 1 year in hospital), <b>Adow</b> <b>Jerry</b> (tuberculosis, 
6 months in hospital, 1 x-ray), <b>Thomas Naky</b> (tuberculosis, 4 months in hospital) and <b>Mr.

<p>The Special Rapporteur visited the MSI in the evening of 15 May for a brief inspection. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by Damien Ibeibei, acting Officer in Charge. Kevin 
Avae was the Supervisor of the MSI, but he was not present during the first visit. 
</p>
<p>The wing accommodates 24 male adult detainees who all participated in a prison break. 
They were allowed out of their cells only for 30 to 60 minutes a day. Apart from housing 
detainees who were classified as &#8220;high risk&#8221; the facility was also used as a punishment 
institution for detainees who had violated the prison rules, for a maximum of 3 months. 
Several detainees have serious shot wounds. The block was divided into four sections (A, 
B, C, D), according to the level of danger of the detainees. The MSI was clean, looked 
fairly modern, with stronger security.  
</p>
<p>Due to administrative problems, the Special Rapporteur did not conduct individual 
interviews during his first visit on 15 May. </p>

<p><b>  Boroko Police Station, Port Moresby  
Visited on 16 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>This was the biggest police lock-up of Papua New Guinea. There were 58 inmates 
including seven women and four juveniles at the time of the visit. Upon the arrival of the 
Special Rapporteur, there was no guard, and the door of the lock-up was open. Inside, the 
door of the women&#8217;s cell was also open, and anybody could enter and leave without any 
control. At a certain point the officer in charge for the night-shift arrived (not in uniform) 
and allowed the Special Rapporteur to enter the men cells. The male block was locked, but 
detainees were all in the corridor. There are roughly five or six cells on each side of the 
corridor and the cells are fairly large and clean, although the detainees had to sleep on the 
concrete floor and only some had cartons to sleep on. Each cell had a toilet in a corner but 
no privacy. The toilet is broken in one cell. On the right side of the corridor, there was a 
shower but the sewage system did not function properly and the water was stuck. The 
wounded detainees were held in unhygienic conditions and without access to proper 
medical treatment and they all had to drink water from the toilet. One detainee had cholera 
and was sent somewhere else. Detainees received very little food, with two biscuit and tea 
in the morning, nothing for lunch, and tinned fish and white rice for dinner, although 
sometimes they did not receive anything. Visitors could talk to the detainees through the 
gate.  
</p>
<p>More than four juveniles were held with the general population: a 13-years-old (held for 1 
month), a16-years-old (held for 2 months), a 14-years-old (held for 4 months), a 17-years-
old and a 15 years-old (had arrived the day before). The lock-up reserved for the juveniles, 
and which had been built in cooperation with UNICEF some months prior was out of use 
for alleged security reasons. 
</p>
<p>The register was poorly kept, and a CID officer who arrived during the visit agreed that 
some detainees were never registered unless their relatives insisted. He stated that courts 
had recently started rejecting forced confessions, forcing officers to investigate properly. 
He had come that morning to talk to the three detainees he had arrested but could not find 
them because they had been released on bail without his consent. He explained that bribery 
in the courts was a common practice, and that detainees could be released by paying the 
officers. The &#8220;snake bail&#8221;, also common, happened when a detainee&#8217;s bail was granted but 
at the time of the release, another detainee walked out. These practices set the morale of the 
arresting officers very low and create enormous frustration. The CID officer further 
explained that since some detainees were bailed or just released, despite the fact they faced 
other charges, out of frustration CID officers would rather kill them when they found them 
in the streets.  
</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there should have been 6 to 7 officers present at the time of the visit, 
instead of the two who arrived much later. These officers wore civilian clothes and since 
some detainees were also out in the main entrance of the lock-up, it was impossible to 
distinguish them. During the debriefing with Mathew Pyakali, officer in charge, and 
Sergeant Gilbert Abore, they noted a lack of resources as the main explanation for the poor 
conditions the detainees were held in.

<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged approximately 30, was arrested on 15 December 2009 by Joseph 
Paul, First Constable, in East Boroko. She was threatened with arms, insulted, and forced </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>26 
</b></p>
<p>into a vehicle, but she did not know he was a police officer since he was wearing civilian 
clothes. He had no arrest warrant. She was punched in the mouth and told &#8220;you know what 
happened&#8221;. She worked for a company selling arms and laptops and was driven to the 
office. She was threatened with rape unless she would give information on &#8220;them&#8221;. She was 
so scared that she gave them her ex-boyfriend&#8217;s name. She was driven to his house and the 
police officers jumped out of their cars and rushed into his place. They pointed guns at him, 
and bashed him with gun butts and boots without asking any questions. They dragged him 
into her car, still punching him and hurting her too. They took them both to an interrogation 
room and stripped him naked. They mocked him by asking her about the size of his penis. 
She repeated she was innocent and wanted to leave. An officer took her in another room 
and asked her for sexual favour in exchange of her release. She refused, and as he was 
trying to undress her another officer came in and he had to stop. After her warrant was 
ready she was taken in Bomana, where she complained that the female guards were very 
restrictive and mean. Since she had to go to Court again, she was taken to the female cell of 
Boroko Police Station, where she had not been beaten and could see her family often. She 
thought the custody officers were nice, but there were no female guards. She thought they 
respect her &#8220;like a sister or a mother&#8221;, and during the day women can walk outside their cell 
and talk to the male detainees. During the night the door was closed for safety reasons. She 
did not like the food, but the officers and her family brought her different items. She only 
regretted that she did not get her medication for epilepsy and repeated that rapes happened a 
lot in exchange of release on the day of the arrest. 
</p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>female detainee</b>, aged 29, had been held between Bomana Prison and Boroko Police 
Station since 2009. She had left her husband due to domestic violence, and after she filed a 
complaint with the police, she was locked inside the house for two weeks. She tried to leave 
her husband once again, but was arrested. She had been arrested at home by ten officers 
from the Hohola Police Station, who beat her with sticks and with a hammer on the back of 
the head, and dragged her out of her home. Five officers continued to beat and punch her on 
the way to the police station. The police then burned her parents&#8217; home. At Hohola Police 
Station, some neighbours who were present threw things at her. Other police officers, 
including her husband&#8217;s colleagues, threatened to open the cell to rape her. She was then 
transferred to Bomana. She was taken back to Boroko Police Station for a court hearing, 
and she was forced to spend one night in the men&#8217;s cell where she was gang-raped. She was 
also taken to the interrogation room, where her husband&#8217;s colleagues threatened to kill her 
with a bush knife.

</i></p>
<p><b>Henry Sibona, </b>aged 21, arrested in the streets a week earlier, together with four other men, 
by the mobile squad. Two people died after being shot, and he had been shot in the left arm. 
This was corroborated by the forensic medical expert examination.. He had clear cutting 
traumatic wounds produced with a cutting instrument (probably a knife) in the leg and back 
and very clear  bullet wound in his arm that was still bleeding. The kind of traumatic 
injuries observed were clearly intentional and to ill-treatment. The shot wound needed 
medical treatment that had not been provided.  He had not seen a lawyer and nor had he 
been taken to the hospital. When the Special Rapporteur checked the registers, he noticed 
that he was not registered.

<p><b>K. B.</b>, aged 16, had been sleeping in cell 2 with nine other adult men for the last nine days. 
He had been arrested by the CID on suspicion of murder. He was beaten with iron rods on 
the back and in the face. After his warrant was ready he was sent to Bomana Correctional 
Institution, where he was beaten upon arrival at Gate 24, where he said all detainees are 
stripped naked and beaten. He was later also beaten in his cell by different officers, because 
some detainees were fighting. He was taken back to Boroko Police Station to attend a new 
hearing in Court, and he had no lawyer. </p>

place at 23 hours after calling him to warn him they were arresting him. He was not beaten 
at the time of arrest but in the CID interrogation room he was threatened to be beaten. He 
was charged by the police only five days later, and taken to Bomana Correctional 
Institution. He was back for his second hearing in Court, and he had no lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged 35, was arrested for alcohol consumption. He had received no visits 
and had no lawyer. Other detainees explained that he had a mental problem, which was 
corroborated by medical evidence. In fact, although there was no time for a complete and 
correct psychiatric evaluation, the mental alterations were absolutely evident, according to 
the medical forensic expert, and the detainee needed a psychiatric observation and 
treatment. He was, however, held together with the other inmates. 
</p>
<p><b>E. K.</b> aged 16. He had been detained at Boroko Police Station since 30 April 2010. He had 
been beaten with iron sticks on the legs and arms, and punched in the face upon arrest. He

Station for a day, but he was not questioned there nor submitted to any ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>M. A.</b>, aged 14, was arrested four months before in June Valley, near Port Moresby for 
smoking and selling marijuana. Many policemen apprehended him and hit him with their 
guns on his head and body. He still had a scar on his head. He was taken to Hohola Police 
Station and shortly thereafter to Boroka Police Station, where he had been detained for the 
last four months without being taken before a court. A female human rights lawyer had

directly to Boroka Police Station. Ten days later, on 9 April, he was taken before a court 
and charged with possession of marijuana. He had been sent to Bomana Prison where he 
was held together with 12 other prisoners in the Juvenile Section. He was offered release on 
bail but he did not have money to pay. At Bomana Prison he was beaten by a guard as a 
punishment for possession of marijuana, but at the Boroka Police Station he had not been 
beaten. Two days before the visit, he had been taken back to Boroka perhaps because he 
had to go to court tomorrow. He indicated that he had been abused by adults while in the 
cell, but did not wish to provide further details.  
</p>
<p><b>Ateno Koropo</b>, aged 25, was arrested in 2008, beaten and thrown into a police car. He was 
taken to Waigani Police Station from where he escaped. After his re-arrest he served six 
months at Bomana Prison and was released. He was re-arrested in April 2010 and spent one 
week at 6 Miles Police Station. Then he was taken to Boroka Police Station, appeared in 
court and was charged for the same crime. His next court hearing was scheduled for 4 June. 
During his detention in three different police stations, he had never been beaten. He could 
be visited at any time. His family could bring food, but direct communication was difficult 
since they could only communicate by shouting.  
</p>
<p><b>Wilson Waraningi</b>, aged 33, was arrested on 21 March 2010 at the Morota settlement in 
Port Moresby. The arrest was conducted by the SSD unit with four police vehicles and 30 
fully-armed police officers under the command of a CID officer. Some police officers were 
drunk. Although he surrendered, he was severely beaten with baseball bats on his legs and 
back. He could no longer walk and still has pain. The forensic expert was of the opinion </p>

</b></p>
<p>that his vertebras might be broken at the lumbar level. He was taken to Boroko Police 
Station and was sent to Bomana Prison on 31 March. The week before the visit, he was 
taken back to Boroko Police Station to prepare his court appearance. During his 
interrogation by the CID, he was threatened with torture outside the police station, in order 
to confess, but no physical force was used against him. Although he felt severe pain, he had 
not received any medical attention. Besides his medical needs, he asked the Special 
Rapporteur to help him obtain his university and school certificates, which had been 
confiscated by the police during the raid at his home in Waigani.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged 24. Two weeks before the visit he had been taken from the road by 
9 or 10 soldiers in green uniform around Nine Mile. He was not causing any trouble but 
they bashed him and put him in a bus. They beat him with their hands, sticks and barbed 
wire. He was then taken to a reception room at the Goldy Barracks outside of Port 
Moresby. They threatened to kill him, and for the next two hours, the same soldiers tortured 
him with hammer on his kneecaps. He was then taken to Boroko Police Station. He was 
beaten by the police during the transfer with their hands and gun butts. He asked for 
medical care but it was not provided. He was still bleeding on his hands and face and had 
cuts under both eyes. He did not know why he was detained.  
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee, </b>aged 28. Five days before the visit he was in North Waigani, drunk, and 
had a fight with some boys, who punched him and dragged him along the highway. One of 
the boys reported the incident to the Waigani police and obtained a doctor&#8217;s report. While 
he was sleeping at home in Morata, around 3 a.m., a vehicle arrived with the boys who had 
filed the complaint and they beat his wife and sister, punched him and took him to the 
Waigani police station where he was kept for two days. He did not receive any medical 
attention from the police. He was taken to Boroko Police Station and charged with assault. 
He had been to court two days before. The judge saw his injuries and set bail at 150 kina. 
He was waiting for the bail to be paid so that he could be released. 
</p>
<p><b>P. G</b>., aged 19.<b> </b>On 20 April 2010 he was taken from his house by police officers in blue 
uniform. He was beaten in the face and taken to Berina Police Station where he was locked 
up for days and once again beaten. The police used a stick to beat him on the head and 
punched him on the face He was later transferred to Boroko Police Station. 
</p>
<p><b>James Airi</b>, aged 23, from Port Moresby. At the time of the visit, Mr. Airi was lying on the 
floor, hardly capable to move his body, and only able to speak with great difficulty. His 
body displayed numerous injuries and abrasions on his feet, chest, and head. His face was 
swollen. Mr. Airi&#8217;s family had brought food for him; however, he was not able to eat it due 
to pain. Mr. Airi had been arrested two nights before for possession of marijuana. Initially, 
Mr. Airi had tried to run away, but was caught by the police and surrendered. Despite 
putting up no resistance, five to six officers kicked and punched him with an iron rod and 
wooden sticks at the market. Subsequently, Mr. Airi was taken by foot to a police post 
where he was held for about one hour and charged with drugs possession. Afterwards, he 
was transferred to Boroko Police Station where no further beatings where inflicted on him. 
The forensic doctor concluded that the injuries corroborate Mr. Airi&#8217;s account of the abuse 
by the police. As confirmed during the debriefing with the authorities of Boroko Police 
Station, the officers were aware of Mr. Airi&#8217;s condition, but had not provided any medical 
care. It was only after the meeting with the Special Rapporteur that the ambulance from 
Port Moresby&#8217;s General Hospital took Mr. Airi for treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>L. A.</b>, aged 20, from Southern Highlands, was arrested on 19 April 2010 at Gordon&#8217;s 
market in Port Moresby. After his attempt to run away failed, the police beat him. He was 
held for two days at a police post close to the market before being taken to Boroko Police 
Station. He was handcuffed during the transfer. Since the arrest he suffers from knee pain. 
On 14 May, he complained to one officer about the insufficient quantity and poor quality of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5

</p>
<p>the food, for which he was beaten with a rubber truncheon on his head which caused a 
bleeding wound.  
</p>
<p><b>Andrew Kopa</b>, aged 32, from Central Province. In mid-February 2010, Mr. Kopa sneaked 
into the premises of a mine, with the hope to find some gold. His intrusion was discovered 
by the police who shot him in the knee while fleeing. However, Mr. Kopa managed to 
escape. A few days later, he was arrested by the police on the basis of a tip-off from an 
informant. Since his arrest approximately three months before, he had not seen any lawyer, 
been to court, nor received any medical treatment for the bullet which was still inside his 
foot. Mr. Kopa reported that an attempted escape of two detainees on 21 April resulted in 
physical abuse of all detainees held at the station. A large group of police officers from 
another police station had gone from cell to cell and beat the detainees with whips, timber 
sticks, fan belts and baseball bats, and kicked them with their boots. He informed the 
Special Rapporteur of beatings at the front section of the station. Furthermore, detainees 
were exposed to regular verbal abuse by the guards. Family members who want to visit 
detainees are harassed by the officers and regularly sent away.  
</p>
<p><b>J. K., aged 17, </b>was arrested in relation to a murder case on 1 April, at Barioba Badagau 
secondary school in Port Moresby, where he was a 10th grade student. The arresting 
officers handcuffed him behind his back and put him in a police van, where they started to 
whip him with a copper wire and a fan belt, beat him with a gun butt on his head, and 
kicked him with their boots. He was further threatened to be killed and was insulted for his 
Goilala origin. The abuse lasted throughout the transfer from the school to Boroko Police 
Station. His upper body displayed clear traces from the whippings, above his eyebrow he 
had an about five cm long cut. All the traumatic evidences were absolutely compatible with 
the allegations and could not have an accidental origin  according to medical forensic 
expert, being clearly due to beatings. J.K. complained about pain in his right jaw, making it 
impossible for him to chew any meal on that side. J.K. had not yet been before a court. He 
repeatedly informed the authorities in Boroko that he was a juvenile. Since his arrest, his 
family had not been able to visit him due to the lack of financial means to travel to Port 
Moresby.

<p><b>Marava Genaboyo</b>, aged around 58, was hit by a truck on 3 June 1988. A police officer 
who saw the scene called an ambulance. She was brought to Port Moresby General 
Hospital. Doctors made X-rays but instead of having her leg rest, they put it on traction, and 
this way pulled her ligaments out. When they realised that they stopped it, but harm had 
been done. She had to be operated, and a doctor from Brisbane who was visiting promised 
to send for her operations the necessary pieces. When the doctors received the material 
some time later, they mistakenly used it on someone else. They then refused to order new 
pieces and she stayed in hospital until 1989. She was in and out until 2005, but was not re-
operated and although she complained to the doctor who had made the medical mistake that 
he had spoiled her leg, he did not react. The office of the Public Solicitor fought for her and 
obtained reparation for an amount of 73&#8217;000 kinas from the Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust 
(MVIT). This sum was given in once and she quickly ran out of it. Now she is in a 
wheelchair, unable to move, and rests most of the day in her bed. She has no State support 
and the doctor who harmed her is still practicing. </p>

<p><b>Matthew Sarufa</b>, aged 36. On 25 December 2000, the police had surrounded his house, 
and when he surrendered, he was told to lie face up on the ground. The police then emptied 
a full magazine from a semi-automatic rifle on his left leg. He was also shot on the right 
leg. He was a &#8220;most wanted man&#8221; for various crimes. After he was shot, he was taken to the 
hospital, where his leg was amputated. His family was prevented from visiting him in the 
hospital during the three months he remained there. Due to his disability, he was never 
charged. In 2005, he filed a complaint against the state and the two officers he could 
identify. The trial was set for 19 April 2010, but it was postponed by the judge.

<p><b>David Yaro</b>, aged 28, robbed on 3 October 2002 a bank in Boroko. Outside the bank he 
was surrounded by police; he surrendered and was shot by the police. He threw his gun 
down and they told him to lie on the ground, he know he was going to be shot so he 
remained standing and put his arms in the air and the police shot him from 2 meters away. 
After 30 minutes he was taken to hospital.  He received poor medical care, the doctor 
removed muscle from his thigh to fix the lower leg but it made his condition worse, the leg 
became numb and it had to be amputated from the knee down. In 2008 he went to register a 
complaint against the police for excessive use of force as he had surrendered and they shot 
him. On Friday he went to court and has until 16 July to prepare his case file. In 1997 he 
was involved in a robbery on a restaurant. (Apparently the police commissioner&#8217;s son was 
also involved in the robbery).There was a car chase by the police. Four were killed. He was 
shot in the back and had an exit wound in the stomach. He saw the police surrounding the 
getaway car and threw the money to the on looking crowd as they came in he was able to 
make an escape. The driver of the car also escaped, however two years later he was caught 
in Popendetta doing another robbery; allegedly that time the police amputated his arms and 
legs and threw him overboard.

<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendant Kiddy Keko. He complained about 
the lack of officers (3 for 400 detainees). He stated that the detainees were not rebellious 
but that they sometimes suffered ill treatment, due to the harsh conditions for both the 
detainees and the officers. When a detainee complains about an officer, he does it to the 
police. However, he acknowledged that it is not very effective.

</b></p>
<p><i>  Maximum Security Wing 
</i></p>
<p>24 male detainees, all escapees, are held here under high surveillance. The building is new 
and seems much more secure than the other buildings in the complex. The Supervisor, 
Damian Ayebaibai, received the Special Rapporteur and was very cooperative. The 
Maximum Security Wing is divided into 4 sections: D is a punishment block where nobody 
is presently kept. C is the section for detainees who escaped and were caught again; 
presently there are two detainees there. B is for escapees who behave well and A is the 
section where prisoners who will soon be transferred to the ordinary (open) regime are held. 
Each detainee was kept in a single cell, but they can see and speak to each other. The four 
sections are separated by locked doors. Section A is the closest to the door and has some 
daylight. 
</p>
<p>During a collective interview, one of the detainees, <b>William</b> <b>Kapris,</b> gave the Special 
Rapporteur a written statement with complaints about the prison conditions on behalf of all

<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>William Kapris Nanua</b>, aged 31, is the most famous and best guarded prisoner in Papua 
New Guinea. He first escaped from prison on 6 November 2005. On 14 February 2007, he 
robbed, together with three people, the Metal Refinery Operation (MRO). In October 2007, 
he was arrested in Port Moresby by many police officers and taken to Boroko Police 
Station, where he stayed for one night. Then he was sent to Bomana. In February 2008, he 
escaped from the Three-Mile Hospital. He was allegedly used by various politicians, who 
received money from the bank robbery. On 17 July 2008 he was once again arrested on a 
highway and surrendered to the police. Nevertheless, they forced him to lie down on the 
highway, and <i>Sergeant Terry Apolos</i> shot him from a close distance with a 9mm gun in 
both his legs. He spent five days in a cell in Boroko Police Station, was taken before the 
court on 24 July and then sent to Bomana Prison, where he was kept without any medical 
treatment. On 12 January 2010, a woman came into the Maximum Security Section 
pretending to be a human rights lawyer and freed him, together with 12 others. They 
escaped with a vehicle that was waiting outside and he spent three weeks in the bush before 
he was re-arrested. 
</p>
<p>He described the conditions at the prison as follows: they spend almost 24 hours per day in 
their single cells without daylight. At around 9 a.m. they are allowed to go outside for five 
minutes to fetch water, go to the toilet, take a shower and fetch their breakfast, which they 
eat in their cell. He was originally kept alone and completely isolated from the others in the 
D section, but now he is together with Oliver Benny Gabi in the C section. For breakfast 
they get tea and biscuits, rice and pasta for lunch at 11 a.m. and rice and tinned fish for 
dinner at 2 p.m. When the sun is shining, the roof heats up and the cells get very hot. There 
are many mosquitoes, flies and cockroaches. During the night they do not have enough 
water. When it rained, the roof leaked. They cannot receive any visits from families, 
doctors or lawyers. The guards do not talk to them and they have no right to speak to him.  
</p>
<p><b>John Sikowel</b>, aged 36, was arrested on 11 February 2010 in a residential area of Port 
Moresby by some 20 to 30 police officers from the mobile squad and special task forces in 
uniform. He surrendered to Officer <i>Philip Bakob,</i> whom he knew, but he still shot him with 
an automatic rifle. Mr. Sikowel was taken to the Six-Mile Hospital where he spent one 
month. He was then taken to Boroko Police Station, where he stayed for four days before 
he was sent to Bomana, from where he later escaped. He was later re-arrested, taken to 
Boroko Police Station and sent to Bomana Correctional Institution on 24 March 2010. At 
Gate 24, he was brutalized, beaten and forced to walk although he is disabled. He had to 
crawl into his cell. Since he is an escapee, he must stay at the Maximum Security Section 
for one year. He received some medication, but no proper medical treatment. He is locked 
in his cell most of the time and detainees have no books or magazines, cannot write letters 
or receive any visits, including from pastors.  
</p>
<p><b>James Bari Bomai</b>, aged between 60 and 70, escaped on 12 January 2010 and was re-
arrested on 11 February 2010 at Six-Mile district. He was forced to lie down with his face 
on the ground. He was shot from behind by Correctional Officer <i>Martin</i> <i>Kundu</i>. They 
brought him back to Bomana Correctional Institution, where he was detained without any 
medical treatment. His toe was strongly infected and the forensic expert recommended that 
he should be quickly taken to a hospital. He wishes to complain to the Ombudsman 
Commission and to get a lawyer in order to sue the Government for damages. 
</p>
<p><b>Robert Amato</b>, aged 29, was detained on 3 February 2004 during the day, in his village, by 
five officers of the mobile squad. He immediately surrendered and was taken to Six-Mile 
Police Station. There, he was beaten until he admitted the crime of which the officers 
accused him. After one night in the police station he was taken to Bomana Correctional 
Institution where he has been held since. He had seen detainees die of diseases. He was 
often beaten, usually with belts, mostly after fights broke out among detainees. </p>

</b></p>
<p>He explained that the bad food, coupled with the lack of hygiene led 54 detainees, including 
him, to escape in 2009. However, he was recaptured five months later and brought to the 
maximum security wing. He was beaten upon arrival by five officers with barb wires, 
wooden sticks, and rubber hoses, some of them filled with iron. This was two months 
before the visit and he had not been beaten since, although he said he was often mocked by 
the custody officers. He also complained that he was not allowed to work, except for the 
few times he could cut the grass.  
</p>
<p><b>Peter John Placeman</b>, aged 32, was arrested in 1993 at home, by the CID. They took him 
to Boroko Police Station, where he was beaten for more than an hour by several officers in 
order to confess a crime. Two days later, he was taken to court and then to Bomana 
Correctional Facility. He was sentenced to 18 years, and complained that unlike other 
detainees, he did not have the right to parole. He escaped in 2007 and was recaptured one 
month later by the &#8220;dog unit&#8221;. He was then beaten with knives. When he was taken back to 
Bomana, he was taken to the general compound and beaten with copper plates on the head, 
and with aluminium sticks on the feet. They then placed him in the maximum security 
wing. He was also part of the major escape in February 2010, where 18 detainees left the 
compound. He said he suffered a lot, and felt like he was an animal. He was often beaten 
with rubber hoses and wooden sticks, when detainees misbehaved. He also complained that 
as a punishment, they cannot have visits, and that they were locked up most of the day, with 
their plates filled with bugs because they could not even wash them. 
</p>
<p><b>Henry Henz Patrick</b>, aged 28. On 12 January 2010, he drove the car that picked up the 12 
escapees, led by William Kapris. They hid in the bush and spent the night together. He left 
them the following day, went down the river, caught a bus and went to his village. He did 
not dare to report the issue to the police since he knew he would be tortured. He hid for two 
weeks, before his brother-in-law denounced him. The &#8220;dog unit&#8221; of the police came in the 
early morning and surrounded the house. He surrendered quickly, and was put into a car. At 
a junction, they stopped and asked him to tell everything, &#8220;because your life is in our 
hands&#8221;. They then tried to shoot at his foot but he avoided the bullets. They took him to 
Butana, an allegedly famous place where police abuse criminals and shoot them. He was 
blindfolded and taken back to the &#8220;Dog Unit Compound&#8221; and was placed in the only cell 
where there were no dogs. The next day he was taken to Bomana Correctional Institution 
and was interrogated from 9am to 4pm by the CID. An officer told him they would shoot 
him anyway. He was taken back to Boroko Police Station before his hearing at the Court, 
where he had no lawyer, and then back to Bomana&#8217;s general compound. A day later he was 
moved to the Maximum security compound. He had no lawyer, and felt like he was being 
treated like a criminal and not like a remandee.  
</p>
<p><b>Oliver Benny Gapi</b>, aged 33, was beaten by the mobile squad when he was arrested on 18 
July 2008. He had just robbed a bank and was on the highway with 14 other people in three 
cars. The police chased them and beat them on the highway. They punched them, 
handcuffed them and took them to Boroko Police Station, where they had to lie down in the 
car park. The officers then beat them with any object they could grab. They spent four days 
in an overcrowded cell before being formally charged on 22 July. He went to court but has 
not been sentenced, thus has been a remandee for two years. On 12 January 2010 he 
escaped with Kapris and the 10 other detainees. They went to a forest, where there was no 
food and no water. He fell asleep, alone, and was discovered by someone who called the 
police. He was taken to the hospital where he remained for some days, before being taken 
back to Boroko Police Station. On 26 January he went to Court, where he was sentenced to 
six months for the escape, and subsequently placed in the maximum security compound. 
</p>
<p><b>Floyd Kohai</b>, aged 34, had been arrested on 11 February 2010 for harbouring an escapee. 
He was taken to Dogura, where he was given an empty gun and told to run, so that it could 
appear like the police was chasing him. The police fired shots at his legs but he was not </p>

butt. Afterward, he was taken to Six-Mile Police Station, where he was threatened in an 
effort to obtain information, and was not allowed to receive visitors until he was charged. 
The next day, he was taken to Boroko Police Station, where he remained until 8 March, 
when he was transferred to Bomana. He indicated that the detainees held in the section 
were &#8220;forgotten people&#8221;. He was not allowed any visitors or correspondence. He added that 
detainees were forced to crawl from the gate when they first arrived, and they were usually 
beaten by the officers. However, he noted there was hardly any inter-prisoner violence 
because the punishment was increased confinement. 
</p>
<p><b>O.Y.</b>, aged 35, had been arrested on 21 January 2010, after the police surrounded his home 
and forced him to get into the police vehicle. He was charged at Boroko Police Station with 
aiding escapees and was transferred to Bomana. He had been threatened with violence upon 
arrest, but was not beaten. He indicated that he suffered from scabies.  
</p>
<p><b>F.S.</b>, aged 17, had been detained there since January 2010. He had been previously detained 
but escaped in 2005. Upon recapture, he was beaten with a gun butt on the face and shot in 
the hand, leg and thigh with a rifle, by Corporal Martin Kundu, while he lay face up on the 
ground. He was then taken to Bomana, where he was stripped, beaten with an iron rod and 
a rubber hose, and forced to crawl from the main gate to the cell. He had always been kept 
with adults because he was serving a 20-year sentence.  
</p>
<p><b>Duma Korua</b>, aged 33. During a joint operation by the police and the correctional services 
on 23 February 2010, he was detained, told to lie face down inside his home and was shot 
on the right shin by Corporal Martin Kundu, because he was an escapee.  He was then taken 
to Six-Mile Police Station and later to the hospital, where he spent two hours and was only 
given antibiotics. Upon arrival at Bomana, he was kicked and beaten with a wooden stick 
for approximately ten minutes at the main gate. His family had sent him food and money, 
but the correctional officers never gave it to him. He had sent a complaint to the

<p><b>Michael I.C.</b>, aged 22, had been arrested on 23 January 2010. He was placed inside a 
Correctional Services bus and was beaten on the head with a rifle. He was an escapee. At 
the main gate, he was told to remove his clothes and was beaten with a fan belt all over his 
body, resulting in a broken arm.

<p><b>Kingsley Kimoi</b>, aged 48. On 12 January 2010, he was picked up from his home in 
Waigani by police and taken to Boroko Police Station. Four police officers (MOSIC) in 
blue uniform beat him on his knees and chest with a police baton and punched him in the 
face. They punched him on the jaw trying to force him to say something he did not know. 
Before he was charged, they gave assurances that if he provided the information the police 
needed they would release him. He repeated that he did not have any information. He was 
kept in Boroko for eight days and taken out for a one hour interrogation each day to the 
CID Robbery Squad office; each time he was asked questions and punched in the face. He 
was charged after seven days. On 20 January 2010 he was taken to Waigani Court. On 21 
January 2010 he was sent to Bomana main compound and kept there for 17 days. On 7 
February 2010 a commander ordered that he be taken to maximum security. The maximum 
time in maximum security should be 3 months. He went to court on 24 February 2010, and 
Fred Tamon was the presiding magistrate. He asked for a lawyer to defend him and Mr. 
Kimoi explained that he did not have a lawyer as he has been locked up in maximum 
security. The court ordered the Correctional Services to provide him with a lawyer; but they 
have not. The court was adjourned until 11 June 2010. Detainees provided complaints but 
with no results. Detainees cannot express themselves as they fear reprisals including an 
extension of their term of imprisonment.  </p>

<p><b>Peter Kumul</b>, aged 43, was arrested on 11 June 2000<b> </b>by four police officers at home and 
taken to Kundiawa police station, accused of killing a man in Port Moresby. He was 
punched and hit with the butt of the gun on the head, his side and knees. He was held for 26 
days in Kundiawa police cell. His family did not know where he was. There was only water 
and another detainee shared some of his food with him. They were 11 men in one cell. CID 
officers from Port Moresby came and took him to Port Moresby, where he was detained in 
Boroko Police Station for 28 days. During interrogation by CID officers he was threatened 
with a gun. He went to Court in August 2000, where a remand warrant was issued and he 
was transferred to Bomana. He stayed with the general population for three months. On 12 
October 2000 the presiding judge found him guilty and sentenced him to life. His appeal is 
still pending. In 2005 his son died and he was not allowed to attend the funeral. Later in 
2005, another of his sons died and he was not allowed to attend this funeral either. On 19 
June 2008 he went to the general hospital for his regular medical exam and whilst there he 
learned that his wife had died and the family had left the body at the hospital so he could 
see her when he came for his appointment. He decided to escape so he could attend his 
wife&#8217;s funeral. 19 months later on 11 February 2010 he was captured. He was at Eight-Mile 
settlement and 4 officers caught him, put a pistol to his head and fired, but there was no 
bullet. The second time they fired into his right ankle but there was no bullet. However, he 
fell, was kicked and told to walk to the car or else he would be shot. They pushed him and 
he fell down once again. They shot in the air; he was slapped and used rubber to tie his 
hands behind his back. He was taken to Boroko Police Station and interrogated by MOISC 
police. They threatened to shoot him in different parts of the body. The same day he was 
taken to Bomana and was locked in the main compound. On 18 February 2010 he was 
taken to the maximum security facility and he was told he would stay there for 3 months 
which would have finished on 11 June 2010.

<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 22, was arrested on 8 January 2006 by approximately 5 CID 
officers. He was put in the car, where the officers put a mask on his face, beat him up and 
broke the ribs on his right side using a wheel spanner. He was taken to Baruni dump, where 
he was beaten. The officers took his mask off and shot him behind the right knee. He was 
then taken to Boroko. He was not given any medical treatment. While in detention at 
Bomana, his father died, but permission to go to his fathers&#8217; funeral was denied. Out of 
frustration and due to the frequent raids and collective punishments that did not follow any 
processes, he decided to escape. In Sept 2009 there were two deaths in the cells due to the 
lack of medical care. Detainees wrote a petition to the OC/CS Commissioner calling for an 
investigation into the deaths but it was torn up by the guards and the officers. After that 
there was a raid. The police came and threw teargas into the cells and belted the detainees 
inside the cells. His right shoulder bone was broken and he was taken to hospital for an x-
ray. He had escaped on 20 September 2009 and was recaptured on 8 February 2010. He 
was beaten in the cell with bush knives by four police officers. He spent one night in the 
police cell and was then taken to Bomana. At the main gate he was stripped and beaten; the 
ribs on his right side were broken with a 4 by 4 piece of timber. He spent one week in the 
main compound&#8217;s punishment block. He was charged with escape and sent to maximum 
security for three months and one day. Medical treatment had not been provided.

<p><b>Kito Aso</b>, aged 28, was arrested on 18 July 2008 while travelling with friends on the 
Highlands Highway. The police stopped their car, arrested and handcuffed them and then 
started to beat them. They then placed them one on top of the other between the seats of a 
police van. During the ensuing transfer to Boroko Police Station, Mr. Kito and his friends 
were constantly punched and kicked. The beating continued after arriving at Boroko, where 
he was thrown into the cell and has injured his knee, which was still in pain, almost two 
years later.  On the next day, 19 July, Mr. Aso was informed that he was arrested in relation 
to a robbery in Madang, which was allegedly masterminded by another detainee. Mr. Aso 
and approximately 20 other detainees were later taken out of the detention block, to the car </p>

<p>park in front of the police station. The detainees were blindfolded and beaten with iron 
rods, gun butts, fan belts, and fists, all taking place in front of the public who could observe 
the ill-treatment. At this moment William Kapris was shot in the foot. Mr. Aso was 
interrogated and coerced to confess, which he eventually did but out of fear for his life. On 
24 July Mr. Aso&#8217;s warrant was issued and he was transferred to the Maximum Security 
Section at Bomana Prison. According to Mr. Aso, it is due to the high security confinement 
that he was not allowed to receive any visits by his family members. On 12 January 2010, 
Mr. Aso escaped from prison. He was recaptured on 22 February 2010. During the 
apprehension, after having surrendered and being ordered to lay with his chest on the 
ground, he was shot in his foot. He was further beaten with a bush knife, punched, and 
kicked. The next day he was charged for escaping at Six-Mile Police Station, where the 
treatment was awful and he was denied a medical treatment for his wound. On 24 February, 
Mr. Aso was transferred to the court and returned to the Maximum Security Institution. 
Upon return, he was strip-searched at Gate 24 and punched by the officer on duty, who was 
wearing a large ring, which caused particularly severe pain. Immediately after admittance 
to the prison, he was again strip-searched when accessing the MSI, and was beaten by 
wardens with iron rods and wooden sticks. Mr. Aso reported that the food portions had 
been reduced as a means of punishment since the prison break. Mr. Aso had never received 
any legal aid. 
</p>
<p><b>John Carro</b>, aged 27, was arrested at his home in late 2003 on the basis of allegations 
related to a killing. He was subsequently transferred to Boroko Police Station where he was 
interrogated by members of the CID for seven hours. During the interrogation he was 
stripped naked, beaten with a fan belt, iron rod, and timber, among others by Sergeant 
Mantu Ulagis, then the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the homicide department. Mr. Carro was 
ordered to sign a confession which had been already prepared by the officers, which he 
refused to do. After three days at Boroko Police Station, Mr. Carro had his first court 
hearing. The judge issuing the warrant did not inquire into the then clearly visible injuries 
of Mr. Carro, which he sustained during the interrogation. Mr. Carro himself refrained from 
raising his ill-treatment due to fear of retaliations by the police officers. Subsequently, Mr. 
Carro was transferred to Bomana where he was held in the general section. In September 
2009 he participated in a mass prison break. He was recaptured on 8 February 2010. His 
arms were tied with a rope behind his back, and he was thrown onto a police truck in which 
he was transferred to Boroko Police Station. There was little violence during his transfer or 
short stay at Boroko.  Upon arrival at the main gate at Bomona, he was stripped naked and 
beaten by the officers on duty. His head was also shaved. From the main entry he was 
transferred to the MSI where he was again stripped and beaten for about five minutes. Since 
then, Mr. Carro had not experienced any further physical abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>Awana Gini</b>, aged 25, was arrested on 2 March 2010 at the market of Kwikila where he 
was stripped naked in front of the public and tied with a rope behind his back. On 6 March 
he was transferred to MSI where he was again stripped naked and beaten with timber on his 
head and back for about five minutes.

<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Female Division 
</i></p>
<p>29 female detainees were held in the female section, including; 10 convicted and 19 
remandees. There were two blocks and one was reserved to mothers (5) and their children 
(6). Each dormitory was represented by a one-woman cell committee. The dormitories were 
very clean and although for the most part they had the same diet as the mail detainees, they 
were allowed to add some of the vegetables they grow.  </p>

<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Group interview 
</i></p>
<p>The detainees complained that they were not allowed to wear a brassiere, which caused 
pain. They also stated that they would like to wear civilian clothes when they go to hospital, 
in order not to be shamed and insulted by other patients. They were scared about the current 
cases of tuberculosis in their compound, and complained that access to medical treatment 
took too long. Two babies had tuberculosis at the time of the visit. The detainees also 
complained about the lack of mattresses for the wooden beds, which caused many of them 
back problems. The female section was almost exclusively guarded by female wardens 
although the relationship between them and the detainees was described as hostile and 
characterized by commanding language. The relationship among detainees was described as 
collegial and inter-prisoner violence was not an issue. Upon the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur two twin babies were present at the section. The mother had been taken to a 
local hospital nearby the prison for their delivery. After three days, she and her babies were 
returned to the prison.  
</p>
<p>Female convicted detainees have to work on the farm located in the Bomana Prison 
complex. Remandees can work in the workshop (e.g. sewing) which is described as being 
easier than the work undertaken by the convicts. Their products are sold outside the prison, 
however, no revenues are transferred to the detainees. Working hours are weekdays 
between 8:00 and 11:00 hrs. Furthermore, detainees have to do work for members of the 
prison staff, including washing their clothes and preparing food for them. 
</p>
<p>Female detainees felt discriminated against in comparison to male detainees. Male 
detainees are able to earn their own income by working at the prison (while female 
detainees do not receive any remuneration). Furthermore, male detainees are allowed to 
wear civilian clothes and can receive their partners for conjugal visits.  
</p>
<p>At the time of the visit, detainees were not able to receive any food from visiting family 
members or friends. The temporary prohibition was explained by the authorities as a 
precautionary measure in light of a then spreading cholera epidemic at Port Moresby. In 
general however, detainees were able to receive food from visitors as long as it was 
consumed immediately at the visitors&#8217; section and under the supervision of a warden, in 
order to prevent the smuggling of prohibited items into the prison. The decision whether a 
detainee could receive food by visitors was with the warden in charge and taken on a case 
by case basis &#8211; a practice which opens the possibility for arbitrariness and abuse of power, 
including corruption. During the day, the detainees could move freely within the perimeters 
of their section. On Fridays, religious fellowship and sports are practiced.

<p><b>Helen Mark Kuipa</b>, aged 26, was arrested on 6 March at 9 p.m. in the Talai Settlement in 
Badili, for allegedly staging the escape of 12 prisoners from Bomana Correctional 
Institution. While in the police car, she was asked to remove her clothes, put her fingers in 
her vagina and put one of her legs on top of the seat. However, when the driver came back, 
the officers asked her to quickly get dressed. At Boroko Police Station, she was taken to the 
CID-MOCIT office, where she was questioned about money and beaten on the face. The 
CID officer instructed two officers to lock her up in the women&#8217;s cell, but instead, she was 
asked to go to the fingerprint room. There they asked her whether she had had sex with the 
CID officers. She said no. They threatened her that she would spend the night with 60 
males in their cell, and was ordered to get naked. One of the officers was in civilian clothes 
and was drunk. The other one left the room and came back 40 minutes later. While he was 
out, the drunken officer locked the door and threatened her again with spending the night in 
the male cells and getting gang-raped. She had no option and was powerless. He then 
forced her to have intercourse with him and did not wear a condom. After that he sat back 
as if nothing had happened. She cried continuously until two female detainees found her in </p>

<p>the fingerprint room and took her to the shower. When she walked out of the shower, she 
saw a CID officer and reported the rape. The same day she was brought to the hospital for a 
medical check. She said that the SOS Sexual Offence Officer in Boroko Police Station 
humiliated her when she examined her. She had to be naked again and was questioned in a 
disrespectful manner. She said that many women were too afraid of the officer to even talk 
to her. She was scared of being HIV positive. 
</p>
<p><b>R. A</b>., aged 25, has been at Bomana Correctional Institution since 2006 and was convicted 
in December 2008 for murder. She surrendered at Six-Mile Police Station, where the CID 
officer asked her to sleep with him. Family from the deceased came to the police station 
and one relative cut her on the head. The officers did not take her to the hospital, but, as she 
was bleeding heavily, they finally had to rush her there. However, the doctors refused to 
treat her because she was a murderer and preferred to &#8220;let her die&#8221;. As a result, she was 
taken back to a cell. She is HIV positive, a condition no detainee knows except her best 
friend. She feels much discriminated by the guards, who refuse to share the car with her 
when she needs to go to the hospital, and purposely delay her access to medical care. She 
recommends a full-time doctor be hired for the Correctional Institution. Also, they ask 
detainees to call them &#8220;boss&#8221; and verbally mistreat them. She thinks she should not work so 
much in the sun, in the garden, as she is weak and feels very often dizzy. Recently doctors 
detected a growth in her uterus that hurts her a lot, especially during the night. She states 
that when she cannot sleep because of the pain, no detainee sleeps. They gather around her 
to show her solidarity and love. 
</p>
<p><b>Lyn Moses</b>, aged 24, reported that she had been a victim of attempted rape in 2006, which 
she fended off by stabbing the attacker in the back. A year later, in 2007, she accompanied 
a female friend who had also been a victim of rape to Boroko Police Station. There, Ms. 
Moses was arrested and accused of having killed her attacker. The arrest and accusations 
came as a surprise to her since she was not aware of any pending arrest warrant, had not 
been hiding intentionally from the authorities, nor was she aware of the death of the 
attacker. The same day, she was interrogated from 9am to 4pm at Boroko Police Station. 
The officers demanded that she sign a statement in which she would confess to the killing. 
She was held for two months at the police station without being charged and no legal aid 
was available. Ms. Moses described the atmosphere at Boroko Police Station as frightening; 
officers were regularly drunk during the nights and threatened her. In August 2007, she was 
transferred to the female section of Bomana Prison. She was sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment and hopes to be released on parole in 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>British detainee</b> with one child explained that she had to deliver the baby in the prison 
with only other prisoners helping her. She alleged that she was beaten during her arrest. The 
cell was too hot, in particular for the babies, and overcrowded. They also have to sleep on 
the floor. They receive three times a day food but it is not appropriate for breastfeeding 
mothers nor for babies. Children may stay with their mothers up to the age of 3. They can 
receive family visits on Saturdays for 30 minutes. Between 6 am and between 4 and 5.30 
pm the door is open and they can go outside and do some work (e.g. sewing). The biggest 
problem is access to proper medical treatment: two children had tuberculosis in prison, a 
third one might also have it and two got bronchitis but they received no medicine. There 
were only female guards at the female prison, some of whom are very nice.

</i></p>
<p><b>Anthony Mera</b>, aged 20, was arrested on 8 April 2010 after he presented himself &#8211; 
together with his family &#8211; at the Six-Mile Police Station in Port Moresby. He stayed there 
for approximately six hours, during which he did not experience any ill-treatment by the 
police, which Mr. Mera explained was due to the presence of his parents. He was 
subsequently transferred to Boroko Police Station where he was charged and held in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>38 
</b></p>
<p>main cell block, together with adults. On 15 April, Mr. Mera was scheduled to be seen by a 
judge and transferred to the court house in Waigani. Despite spending several hours at the 
court&#8217;s holding cell, his case was not heard since the necessary documents had not yet been 
processed. From the court house Mr. Mera was transferred to the Juvenile Section of 
Bomana Prison where he has been held since. Mr. Mera did not have any form of legal aid.  
</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Bomana prison, officers at the main gate took Mr. Mera&#8217;s necklace. Mr. 
Mera reported that Thursday mornings a member of YWCA visited the juvenile section and 
provided language and literature classes, which Mr. Mera described as helpful since many 
juvenile detainees were illiterate. Various sports are practiced every Friday on a meadow 
outside the juvenile section. During weekends, detainees could watch TV for approximately 
three hours. Despite these activities, detainees spent most of their time without any 
meaningful activity. A library offers a small collection of books; however, since most 
detainees are illiterate it is of little use to them. Some detainees received wool from their 
families, with which they produce <i>bilums</i> (traditional bags). Juvenile detainees are locked 
up in their dormitory from 4pm to 8am. During the day they could move freely within the 
juvenile section and also talk to the convicted juvenile detainees. Meals were served three 
times per day. Visits are allowed on Saturdays (for remandees) and Sundays (for convicted 
detainees) and last for no longer than 30 minutes. The toilet was clogged and juveniles who 
violate any of the rules were sent to the MSI for solitary confinement as a punishment.

<p><b>Gerega Bomai</b>, aged 18, was arrested on 1 January 2009 in the morning in Port Moresby. 
While being taken out of his home by eight police officers (including three officers of the 
Special Force Southern Command), he was beaten with a fan belt and kicked, as a way to 
&#8220;rough him up for the transfer&#8221;. He was subsequently transferred to Boroko Police Station. 
During the transport the ill-treatment continued. At Boroko Police Station he was held in 
the main cell block, where he reported not to have experienced any physical abuse. Mr. 
Bomai arrived at the Juvenile Section of Bomana Prison on 17 January 2009. His case is 
currently pending before a national court and he has been represented by a lawyer.  
</p>
<p><b>B.F.</b>, aged 16, was arrested on 28 December 2009 at a bus stop in Koki, a suburb of Port 
Moresby. From there he was taken to his house in Two-Mile in order to identify friends 
who were alleged to have been involved in a crime. Upon arrival with the police, his friends 
fled. He was subsequently taken to Boroko Police Station where he was held in the main 
cell block, together with adult detainees. He reported that he had not experienced any 
violence during his stay there. The next day, on 29 December, he was taken before the 
Juvenile Court in Boroko where he was charged and reportedly sentenced immediately on 
the basis of a witness testimony. Regarding the detention at the Juvenile Section at 
Bomana, he did not raise any allegations of ill-treatment. However, he voiced complaints 
about the poor quality of food and the lack of soap and other toiletries.  
</p>
<p><b>J.S.</b>, aged 19, had been held at Bomana for one-and-a-half years. He had been arrested 
together with ten other people, and seven of them were still in detention. He had been taken 
to Gordon&#8217;s Police Station and later transferred to Boroko, where he was held for two 
months with adults, without seeing a magistrate. At Boroko, he was threatened by CID 
officers during the interrogation, but no violence was used. He complained about frequent 
beatings with wooden sticks if the officers were angry. 
</p>
<p><b>Aru John</b>, aged 18, had been held at Bomana for one year. Previously, he had been held at 
Boroko for one month and transferred to Bomana. He indicated that the officers used 
wooden sticks to beat them if there was a fight. He wished he could go to school. 
</p>
<p><b>Jorris Alfonse</b>, aged 20, had been arrested on 29 March 2010. He was held at Doa 
Plantation, Three-Mile, Six-Mile, Waigani and Boroko Police Stations. He had missed a

<p><b>  Autonomous Region of Bougainville 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Arawa Police Station 
Visited 17 and 18 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Sergeant Moses who stated that every two months 
a visiting magistrate inspected the cell block. Five detainees and 3 persons were held in for 
their own protection due to allegations of sorcery. One cell was used to store sealed ballot 
boxes. In another section, juveniles were held together with adults. In general, the detention 
facilities are small, run down, dirty, overcrowded and unfurnished (people slept on the 
concrete floor, sometimes with a carton), but the atmosphere was fairly relaxed. 
</p>
<p>During the debriefing with the staff on duty after the visit on 17 May, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that there were only 32 police officers for the entire Central 
District of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. The police station in Arawa was not 
equipped with a telephone, requiring victims to come to the police station in person in order 
to report a crime or seek help. Out of four police cars, only two were operational; the lack 
of funds for petrol also posed an obstacle for patrols or investigations in the villages. This 
situation leaves no doubt that an overwhelming percentage of crimes is unreported. 
</p>
<p>The police force in Central Bougainville was supported by roughly 70 community/village 
police officers who do not have the power to investigate any crimes. In relation to so-called 
&#8220;sorcery cases&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the police of Arawa had not been 
investigating such cases in the villages with the justification that &#8220;there are too many cases 
in the communities&#8221; and not enough resources. </p>
<p>On 18 May, the Special Rapporteur was received by Ms. Florence Nobu, OIC, Office of the 
Prosecutor, whom he found very professional. He raised the problem of the juveniles with 
her. She said that there is a facility for juveniles in Arawa under construction. Senior 
Sergeant Herman Birengka, Chairperson of the district working group on juvenile justice 
arrived later on. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>John Demorie</b>, was in a cell for his own protection, accused of &#8220;poison&#8221; or sorcery. A man 
had died of diabetes and he had been accused of killing him. On 8 March 2010, three 
village court magistrates heard the case; they had the medical report, there was no evidence 
against him and he was found not guilty. However the relatives of the deceased still chased 
him with a gun, bows and arrows and bush knives and he knew he would be killed if the 
accusers caught him. He went to the police station in Arawa and asked for protection. He 
has been well looked after and he stays in the cell as he was afraid to go out. He received 
visits from his family as well as food and water. He informed the police about his case, but 
no action has been taken to investigate and arrest the people who are chasing him.  
</p>
<p><b>Daniel</b>, aged 37, was in a cell for his own protection, accused of &#8220;poison&#8221; or sorcery. There 
was no case at the village court and he did not know why he was accused. They caught him 
at his house and shot him from the back. He went to Buka hospital for medical treatment </p>

waiting for his mother&#8217;s clan to take him to their village as he would be safe there. He was 
treated well by the police, but needed more medical supplies as his have run out and he did 
not have money to buy more.  
</p>
<p><b>Samson Nonta</b>, aged 50. On 19 March 2010 he was arrested at Arawa market and taken to 
the police station. On 24 March 2010 he saw a judge and was sentenced on the same day to 
12 months&#8217; imprisonment. He did not have a lawyer. The police used force during the arrest 
and at the police station. He confessed after being beaten, punched in the mouth and kicked 
in the back. He had an injury on his lip.  He was locked in a cell for two months and after 
that the police allowed him to walk around the station and to the market place due to his 
good behaviour. When he first arrived he had been beaten by the officers, but thanks to his 
good behaviour they were now friends. He indicated that the food was only enough 
sometimes and it varied between rice, greens and fish.   
</p>
<p><b>A. D.</b>, aged 15, had been held at the police station for three months. He had been arrested at 
home and interrogated by the same officers who arrested him. He indicated that no violence 
was used during the interrogation, but that he had been verbally abused. He added that the 
Superintendent beat and kicked him as a punishment. He had not yet been before a 
magistrate, but did have a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>H. M., aged 26, </b>from Madang, was arrested three months before the visit for the possession 
of marijuana. During his arrest, which took place on the main road of Arawa and was 
conducted by four officers, he was beaten for a short period, including punches with the fist 
in his face. He reported to have sustained a bleeding nose, bruises in his face, and 
complained about pain in his eye. At medical examination performed by the forensic doctor 
no traumatic lesions were observed (but they could have disappear due to the period of time 
passed since the alleged aggression). Only a small injury was observed in his eye, that, 
although not specific, could be the result of the fist punches. After his arrest, he was 
transferred to Arawa Police Station, where he was exposed to further beatings at the 
reception area and in the cell. Since his arrival he has not experienced any further form of 
physical abuse.  
</p>
<p>Three weeks after his arrest he was presented before a judge who sentenced him to eight 
months&#8217; imprisonment for drug possession. The sentence had to be served at Arawa Police 
Station as only those with longer sentences are transferred to Buka. Throughout the entire 
process he had not had any contact with a lawyer or other forms of legal aid.

<p><b>  Buka Police Station, Autonomous Region of Bougainville  
Visited on 18 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p>Since the only prison in Bougainville was destroyed during the armed conflict, Buka Police 
Station also serves as a prison. There are 93 detainees in two overcrowded cells and 
convicts and remandees are not separated. Drinking water is provided via a tank which 
collects rainwater; however its volume is too small. The showers and toilets are not 
separated and there is a lack of water. Detainees have no proper bedding. They reported that 
violent incidents among them are not uncommon, and mainly erupt due to disputes over the 
distribution of food or when punishing one detainee for so-called &#8220;misbehaviour&#8221;. The 
officers at the station are said to be aware of the fighting but have never intervened in any 
incident. The last case of inter-prisoner violence was said to have occurred in March 2010. 
Visits by family members or friends are in principle possible and normally last between 10 
and 15 minutes. Detainees complained about the lack of separate rooms for the visits, 
which would allow for some privacy; instead detainees and visitors had to communicate 
through the bars of the cell block door, while police officers as well as other detainees </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>could listen to their conversations. Some detainees also raised the issue that the 
conversation out of the cell, through the bars, is a disturbing experience for their children 
who come to visit their fathers or elder brothers. The Special Rapporteur also received 
allegations that presents brought by visitors for detainees were confiscated by the officers 
and used for private purposes. Detainees expressed their regret about the discontinuation of 
a rehabilitation and reintegration programme which had been run by the Law and Justice 
Section and a foreign NGO, aimed at preparing detainees for their return to their 
communities and to face the stigma with which they are normally confronted. The 
programme included three classes per week and offered an opportunity to undertake a 
meaningful and useful activity during detention. 
</p>
<p>During his visit to the police station, an intelligence officer, Constable Thadeus Yangavi, 
verbally assaulted the Special Rapporteur and his team, and attempted to physically attack 
the forensic doctor. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern over this incident, 
and both the Regional Commander and the Police Station Commander apologised for the 
officer&#8217;s misconduct. The Acting Police Commissioner also gave the Special Rapporteur 
his assurances that appropriate action would be taken against the intelligence officer. 
</p>
<p>During the debriefing, Inspector Mr. Tsien, Commander for the Northern Part of the 
Autonomous Region of Bougainville complained about the situation of the detainees. 
According to him, there were approximately 93 detainees in a cell which had a capacity for 
</p><p>27. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Cell 1 
</i></p>
<p><b>Philemon Jack Ninits</b>, aged 25, was arrested at the market by five officers on 3 March 
2010. He was presented with an arrest warrant. He was beaten with copper wires and 
slapped; his face was later swollen. The year before, he had escaped from the hospital after 
two months in remand. As a result all the remaining detainees were punished for a day 
without food. When he was taken back to detention, they all beat him. He also added that it 
was a general practice to beat the new-comers. The officers did not know about it, they 
never come inside the cells. He indicated that he had trouble sleeping and was generally 
bothered by the smell of the toilets and the rubbish. 
</p>
<p><b>R. K</b>., aged 33, surrendered after committing a crime on 10 March 2010. He was a 
remandee and complained about the favouritism local detainees enjoyed compared to those 
coming from other islands. He also complained about the lack of diversity of the food and 
the terrible smell coming from the bathrooms, which were next to his cell.    
</p>
<p><b>Steven Komarin</b>, aged 23, was arrested on 23 February 2010 and sentenced to four years. 
He surrendered with his father and was never beaten. He complained that it was not a 
proper place where to spend a sentence, since there was no recreation or work, and the only 
thing they could do was sleep. He also mentioned that the quality of his sleep was poor 
since the detainees kept making noise and walking around. He stated that police officers 
never came inside the lock-up, and thus did not check whether some detainees were ill-
treated by the others. 
</p>
<p><b>J. M.</b>, aged 16, was a student in secondary school and had been arrested three weeks earlier 
because he was drunk in a bar. He had never been beaten or threatened. He had no lawyer 
and had not been to court yet. He indicated that he was hungry when he went to bed, and 
that sometimes they received no food during the entire day. He suffered from malaria and 
was not allowed to go to hospital. He thought that the beatings happened in the first office, 
and that the &#8220;boss&#8221; scared everyone, including the officers. He also indicated that the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>42 
</b></p>
<p>officers often mocked the detainees and made fun of him because of his age. He 
complained that no officers were present during the night. 
</p>
<p><b>Martin Sahoto</b>, aged 21, was arrested by three officers on 12 March 2010 for marijuana 
consumption. He had never been beaten and taken directly to the cell. He complained he 
had trouble walking due to a disability and because the floor was slippery. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee,</b> aged 20, was arrested at the beginning of April, in the street. People from 
his village beat him with bricks and iron pipes because he had stolen something, and later 
took him to the police station, where he was kicked and beaten. The police beat him to try 
to force him to confess and he was also beaten once in the CID office. He was not allowed 
to see a doctor and had not been to court yet. He did not want to go back to his community. 
</p>
<p><b>Richie Samuel</b>, aged 20, was accused by some villagers of having beaten someone, so they 
beat him with sticks, iron bars and their fists on his head, face and back. They then put him 
in a car and took him to the police station. He was taken to court on 14 April, and was still 
on remand. He noted that there were fights among the detainees over food because they 
were all hungry, and the police did not intervene during the fights.  
</p>
<p><b>N.N., </b>aged<b> </b>35, was arrested in 2005 at his home in Buka and transferred to the police 
station. He was charged soon after. He was released on bail one month after his arrest and 
the court proceedings lasted for approximately two years. He was sentenced to ten years&#8217; 
imprisonment in October 2007. N.N. reported two incidents in which he was physically ill-
treated. For a long time, N.N. had been participating in a rehabilitation programme outside 
the police station, and for which he was allowed to leave the cell on his own. While on his 
way back from one such meeting, he encountered a group of young adults who were 
drinking beer in a public space. N.N. stopped and engaged in a conversation with them, 
speaking about the negative consequences and potential dangers of alcohol consumption. 
His discussion with the group was observed by a police officer who was passing by and 
who thought that N.N. was drinking and therefore abusing his permission to participate in 
the rehabilitation group. The officer then proceeded to arrest N.N. and the youths, and he 
was given no possibility to explain himself. As soon as he arrived to the car park of the 
police station, officers started to beat him. He was taken back to his cell, where he was 
severely beaten and kicked by about seven to eight officers. After the ill-treatment, N.N. 
had a swollen face and difficulties to eat due to an injured jaw bone. Some scars on his face 
which are said to originate from the beating were still visible at the time of the interview. 
Approximately one or two months before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, N.N. had been 
sick, however, no medical attention was provided and the officers ignored his complaints. 
At one point he succeeded in approaching the Officer in Charge (OIC) for detainees&#8217; affairs 
and voiced his concern. The OIC granted N.N. permission to go to the pharmacy and to buy 
the medication he would require. Upon his return, the OIC for detainees&#8217; affairs was not 
present and none of the present officers was able to open the cell door, since the key was 
with the OIC for detainees&#8217; affairs. N.N. sat down at the car park right in front of the police 
station and to wait. At this point, the Commander of the Police Station, Mr. Alex Gunan, 
arrived with two young men who had been just arrested for being drunk. N.N. observed 
how Mr. Gunan forced the two detainees to do push-ups and wash their faces with mud. 
Mr. Gunan was surprised to see N.N. outside his cell and realized that his treatment of the 
two young men had been observed. Subsequently, Mr. Gunan took N.N. back to his cell 
and gave him a strong blow on his left cheek. When asked why he had been beaten, Mr. 
Gunan reportedly replied &#8220;I can beat you up whenever I want to&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>Joel Anold, </b>aged 20, was arrested on 29 March 2010 after having been involved in a fight 
in the course of which one person was killed. He sustained a severe injury on his left hand. 
During the arrest, Mr. Anold was beaten, punched, and kicked by six police officers. On the 
same day, he was transferred to Buka Police Station where he was formally arrested. Due to 
the abuse during his arrest, blood was running from his nose and forehead and he sustained </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>a wound on his shoulder. No medical treatment was provided by the police what resulted in 
an aggravation of his injury at his hand and eventually in its paralysis. This paralysis was 
observed and confirmed during a the forensic medical examination, but only medical 
complementary examinations to be performed in an hospital environment could give an 
idea of its eventually irreversibility. Mr. Anold was represented by a lawyer and hoped to 
be released on bail soon. He complained about the lack of water and food and reported 
occasional violence among detainees due to the lack of water. He further complained about 
the strong smell of urine in the cell block due to the clogged toilets. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 21, was arrested on 22 October 2008 by six officers who took him 
to the police station. He was sentenced in January 2010 to six years&#8217; imprisonment. He 
indicated that he observed a lot of beatings, taking place mainly behind the counter at the 
reception area. He explained that the beatings always happened during questioning and did 
not lead to the desired results. The beatings were done with 4 x 4 or 4 x 2 timber sticks, fan 
belts and police sticks. The last beating dated back to the previous month. Since the 
beginning of the year, he had observed about eight beatings.  
</p>
<p><b>Solomon Valboula</b>, aged 21, was arrested on 14 November 2006 and transferred to Buka 
Police Station on the same day. During the arrest, he was kicked and punched although he 
did not resist. When interviewed, he was serving an 18-year sentence. He had not 
experienced any further physical abuse since his arrest. Mr. Valboula was concerned about 
his personal belongings which had been confiscated upon admission to the police station. 
He once requested to be given 200 Kina which he had with him at the time of arrest, but 
was sent away by the officers. 
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 2 
</i></p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 25, from Buka, was arrested on 11 January 2010 at the Buka 
market, where he had been sitting with a rifle. During the arrest he was beaten on his head 
and legs. He was then taken to the Buka Police Station, where he was forced to lie on the 
ground with his face down at the entrance gate. He was heavily beaten for about 30 
minutes, and he felt electric shocks being applied to his back. The forensic expert identified 
several injuries, including heavy beatings with a sharp stick. There were also three marks 
on his back which may be the result of electric shocks. He was subsequently put in solitary 
confinement for one month, denied any treatment at the hospital despite severe pain, and 
prevented from contacting the public solicitor, a judge or his family. It was only on 9 
February that he appeared before court. He did not tell the court that he had been tortured 
and he was sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment because of carrying a rifle illegally. He 
was to be released on 19 June. He complained that the food was not sufficient, as they only 
received two meals per day. Drinking water was ok, but there had been a recent water 
shortage and they did not have water for three days. He felt that he was treated unfairly 
because he was in detention, while others who committed much more serious offences 
remained free. 
</p>
<p><b>Michael Northcote</b>, an Australian national aged 46, was arrested on 18 March at sea. 
Several police officers in civilian clothes came on to his yacht, pointing their M-16 machine 
guns at him, and arrested him. He was arrested together with five other people for drug 
possession, but the others had been released. The New Zealand police working in Papua 
New Guinea had reportedly obtained his arrest warrant, despite the fact that they were not 
supposed to perform police duties. He had been held at Buka Police Station for three days, 
and although he had been sentenced on one charge, he had two other trials pending. He was 
allowed to leave the cell, walk around town, and buy things that he needed, including a fan 
for the cell.  
</p>
<p><b>Agustin Binoko</b>, aged 23, had been arrested on 7 January 2007, after he surrendered to the 
police. He was still on remand since his case was still pending in court in June 2010. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>44 
</b></p>
<p>said that his family had never been allowed to visit him. He added that his case had already 
been dealt with within the village court and that he had paid compensation to the victim. 
</p>
<p><b>Ephrain Ricky</b>, aged 34, was taken from home in 2009 by five CID police officers. He was 
wearing shorts and a t-shirt and was not allowed to take anything else. He was taken to 
Buka Police Station and charged and read his rights when he arrived. After three weeks in 
detention, he was granted bail and on 27 February 2010, he was sentenced and taken back 
to the cell. He needed an x-ray, and was supposed to have gone a few days before, but the 
guards were busy with the elections and had not taken him. 
</p>
<p><b>Benjamin Gatana</b>, aged 18. On 2 March 2010 he was arrested at school by two police 
officers for drug possession. The officers beat him, put him in the car and took him to Buka 
Police Station. He had no lawyer and had been sentenced to one-year imprisonment on 4 
March 2010. The standard practice by the detainees was to fight with the new arrivals to 
show them who was in charge, and then make friends with them and give them a place to 
sleep. He added that convicted prisoners and remandees should be separated.  
</p>
<p><b>Justin Seratan</b>, a remandee, has been in the cell for nearly three years and did not speak at 
all. When he arrived at Buka Police Station he had been beaten by the police with sticks 
and cut with a bush knife on his arms. One of the detainees witnessed how he was treated. 
He was accused of murder but had no lawyer. The Public Solicitor said he would be 
transferred to the Laloki Psychiatric Hospital, but the police said there was no money for 
the transfer.  
</p>
<p><b>Peter Samo, </b>a remandee, had been in the cell one year and five months, and has mental 
health problems. He paced up and down the cell all day and night. The detainees were 
scared that he would do something to hurt himself or others, as he often fought with other 
detainees. No doctor or lawyer had visited him. A medical forensic assessment was 
performed and, although there was no time for a complete and correct psychiatric 
evaluation, the mental alterations were absolutely evident, according to the medical forensic 
expert, and the detainee needed a psychiatric observation and treatment.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Goroka Police Station, Goroka  
Visited on 19 and 20 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The station was visited by the Special Rapporteur three times. During the first visit, he was 
received by the Station Commander, Mr. David Serne, who described the lack of manpower 
and staff housing as the main challenges. During the second visit, the Special Rapporteur 
was received by Sergeant Andrew Naikabam and Inspector Tom Sevese, OIC for Safety. 
During the third visit, he was received by the Provincial Police Commander (PPC), Mr. 
Agustine Wampe. 
</p>
<p>There were 39 detainees, and among them one woman in a separate cell. The men were 
kept in three dark and overcrowded cells with 6, 12 and 15 detainees in each one. Six sick 
detainees were kept in a more open &#8220;cage&#8221;. Of the 15 detainees held in one cell, all except 
one complained about having been beaten by the police during arrest and upon arrival at the 
police station. Although the forensic expert did not find much medical evidence, their 
stories seemed credible. They were also afraid of reprisals. They added that they were kept 
in the overcrowded, dark cell from 4 p.m. until 9 a.m. During the day, they could go out of 
their cell and mix with the other detainees in the &#8220;cage&#8221;. The detainees were provided only 
one meal per day, consisting of a bowl of rice with tinned fish. In contrast to other places of 
detention, the detainees did not receive any tea or a second meal, and drinking water was 
only provided twice a week in a container, albeit in insufficient quantities. However, they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>did not receive any water to wash themselves. Despite the insufficient provision with food 
and water, which the authorities explained was due to a lack of resources, family members 
or friends who brought food during their visits were rejected on alleged security grounds. 
As a consequence, the detainees were underfed and thirsty, aggravating the already strained 
situation in the overcrowded cells, and fuelling violent disputes over food and water. The 
toilet on the floor was not separated from the cell and has been clogged for a very long 
time, forcing detainees to use cans and plastic bottles to relieve themselves. The smell of 
feces in the cells was dazing. Detainees had been held for as long as five months under 
these conditions. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur received information that one detainee had died in the cage in 2007 
due to a lack of medical attention. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur saw two men 
who had been denied access to medical care and were now suffering from serious 
consequences (see case of Dabake Yokunda below). One man who spent already two 
months in police custody had a severe infection in his foot, which would most likely have 
to be amputated. Another detainee suffered from a broken shoulder left unattended. When 
confronted with these alarming medical conditions, the authorities claimed that any transfer 
to the hospital and ensuing treatment would have to be paid by the police station, and that 
the station was not equipped with such resources. As a follow up to this claim, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the General Hospital of Goroka and met with its Chief Executive 
Officer, Dr. Joseph Apa, who refuted the claims and indicated that the hospital would pick 
up the sick and injured detainees and treat them for free.  
</p>
<p>During the third visit, the PPC knew nothing about the request of the Special Rapporteur to 
immediately transfer the two detainees to the hospital. During the de-briefing, the Police 
Station Commander (PSC) also arrived. The PPC assured the Special Rapporteur that the 
two detainees would be taken to the hospital before 6 p.m. He also committed himself to 
look into issues regarding food and water. The Special Rapporteur also suggested that the 
women be moved to the juvenile reception centre, consisting of clean, spacious and modern 
premises that were empty, and to move some of the male detainees in the most 
overcrowded cell to the female section.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases

<p><i>  Medical wing 
</i></p>
<p><b>Eiffaja Mese</b>, aged 20, had been arrested by a mobile squad seven days earlier, as he was 
walking back from school, holding a bush knife in his hands. The officers took the knife 
and slapped him with it, since it was an offence to carry arms in a zone under &#8216;tribal fight&#8217;. 
He stated that the officers kicked the detainees with their boots. It just occurred before the 
Special Rapporteur arrived, during roll call, and he had not been present because he was in 
the bathroom. When he came back, an officer hit him in the stomach, forcing him to fall. 
He felt weak, had a strong fever and had diarrhoea in the past few days, and thus thought 
that he might be suffering from cholera. However, he was refused a medical check-up. 
</p>
<p><b>Toni Musanake</b>, aged 32, was at home with his family on 8 March 2010, at night, when 
nine men from his community came and accused him of stealing. They beat and kicked him 
for 30 minutes. His family was helpless, and the men then took him to the police station. He 
was formally charged and placed in a cell for two weeks before he was taken to court. He 
witnessed detainees being beaten by the officers, often as a collective punishment when 
someone escapes. He had received no medical treatment for wounds on his nose, chest, 
knee and back. His shoulder had been broken during the arrest and had not treated. Mr. 
Musanake indicated that the worst element about being in custody was the poor quality of 
the food and water, but the officers would tell them that &#8220;they are offenders, thus they do 
not deserve good food&#8221;. He had a court hearing the following day, and his family wanted to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>46 
</b></p>
<p>bail him, but the community had threatened them, so he would have to stay at the police 
station. 
</p>
<p><i>  Female division 
</i></p>
<p><b>A</b> <b>female detainee</b>, aged 30, had been taken to the police station the day before by her 
brother, who punched her on the face. She did not know when she would go to court, did 
not have a lawyer, and was not allowed any visitors. She was alone in the cell, and had not 
received any water since her arrival. 
</p>
<p><i>  Male division 
</i></p>
<p><b>Moses Maima</b>, aged 40, and <b>Iso Grimai</b>, aged 30, had arrived that afternoon for drinking 
on the street. Mr. Grimai had been taken to the police station by his family, while Mr. 
Maima was arrested by the police, who punched him on the face and broke his eyeglasses. 
They had not had any water since their arrival. 
</p>
<p><b>Gohix Panai</b>, aged 35, had been taken to the police station on 21 April 2010 for assaulting 
a woman with a knife. The woman was in the police car when they arrested him, and her 
brothers wounded him on the back of the head with a bush knife, while the police watched. 
He went to court two weeks after his arrival, and was sent to the clinic because he suffered 
from malaria. His wife visited him every two days, but he was not allowed to see her and he 
only received the food she provided sometimes. He added that he had not been beaten, 
although it was regular practice to be beaten upon arrival at the police station. 
</p>
<p><b>Dabake Yokunda</b> had been at the station for protection for over two months, because he 
was accused of being a sorcerer. He had a wound on his right big toe, caused by the 
villagers, and had not received any medical attention. He was in the outside cell because of 
the putrid smell of his foot. According to the police officers, he was held there because he 
was accused of murder. The condition of his toe was critical and the forensic expert said it 
would likely have to be amputated. 
</p>
<p><b>N. N.</b> was arrested earlier on the day of the visit of the Special Rapporteur at the main 
market.  He was taken to a nearby police station where he was beaten by three police 
officers with a gun barrel. Subsequently he was transferred to Goroka Police Station, where 
he was beaten at the counter with a gun butt and punched in the face and on his head.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goroka &#8216;Bihute&#8217; Correctional Institution  
Visited on 20 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Frances Gahuye, Commanding 
Officer of the Prison, who provided him with an introductory briefing on the facility. On 
the day of the visit, the prison accommodated 270 male detainees, out of which 
approximately 50 per cent had been convicted. Furthermore, 17 female women were 
detained. Remandees and convicted detainees were not separated. The facility&#8217;s staff 
comprises 46 wardens and four officers. According to the information provided by the 
Superintendent, three juvenile remandees were held in the prison. Once convicted, juvenile 
detainees were transferred to Lae. The conditions seemed much better than in other 
detention facilities. Convicted inmates had access to different activities such as carpentry, 
gardening, and school. On Fridays, they played soccer and rugby, and were allowed to 
watch television. They received food three times a day, to which they could add vegetables 
from the garden. The low security inmates were allowed leave for the weekend. Each cell 
block at the male section had punishment cells, where detainees could, according to Mr. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>Gahuye, be held for up to three months, either by themselves or with other detainees. Four 
inmates had died in the last five months due to diarrhoea. At the debriefing with Major 
Nason Abba, he complained that the buildings dated back to colonial times. He also 
recognized that there were some beatings sometimes at the gate and informed the Special 
Rapporteur that the doctor at the prison was leaving and there was no replacement for him 
yet. 
</p>
<p><i>  Female Section 
</i></p>
<p>There were 17 women and one baby. The detainees were given classes on literacy, HIV, 
etc., and they were allowed to play basketball, volleyball and soccer on Fridays from 8.30 
to 11 a.m. Some of the classes were held together with male detainees, but otherwise the 
women were strictly separated from the men. From 4 p.m. to 6 a.m., female detainees were 
locked in the house without any officer being present. The house consists of two large 
dormitories, which were clean and well-kept, and each detainee had a wooden bed and 
blankets. There were toilets, showers and a kitchen, where the detainees made doughnuts 
which they could sell to the surrounding community in order to generate income. There was 
also a &#8220;fellowship programme&#8221; run by a Christian NGO aimed at generating money for 
purposes such as buying medicine. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>J.T.</b>, aged 35. On 2 May 2007 she reported to the police station in Goroka and stayed in a 
cell for five weeks. She was told there was no paper to do the report and was only charged 
three weeks after she arrived. She was taken to court two weeks after that. She complained 
that the toilet was blocked. She also complained that although the women were separated 
from the men, police officers would go into the female cell at night, often while the women 
were sleeping, harass them and ask for sex. Women who were accused of soft crimes such 
as shoplifting were offered sex in exchange for their release. For more serious cases, the 
police also asked but the women knew that they would not be released and refused. She 
added that detainees were generally verbally abused and called &#8220;criminals&#8221;. The officers 
also demand food from the detainees, which they were forced to share. A young woman 
had recently escaped and as a result, all the detainees were locked up for one week and not 
allowed to get some sun. When she was recaptured, the guards beat her using iron rods, 
wire and fists, kicked her, forced her to jump back over the fence and into the compound 
and then allowed the other detainees to beat her. The officers also forced them to make 
bilums for them.  
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 32, was arrested on 4 July 2008. She went to her uncle&#8217;s house, 
since he works for the CID, to surrender for a crime. She confessed everything at the 
Goroka Police Station, and was put in a cell for two weeks without being able to shower 
and with almost no water. She was very cold during the night and had no blankets. After 
two weeks she was starving. She was taken before a judge who ordered that she be detained 
at Bihute. She noted that the officers did not always follow the rules, and forced her to do 
gardening and other types of work. She was afraid of them since they screamed a lot. She 
had seen the director of the prison only for the second time in two years during the visit of 
the Special Rapporteur. She noted that the food was repetitive but that they could 
sometimes add fruit. The fact that the toilets could not be flushed bothered her. She had 
been sick with typhoid some time before and had been given medication for two weeks. 
She stated that it took a long time to prepare a car to taken them to the hospital, but that it 
was due to a lack of means and not because of bad will. She noted that they were forced to 
wear their uniforms in the hospital, and were therefore mocked.  
</p>
<p><b>A mother and her daughter</b>, aged 59 and 17, were arrested together with the father and 
two brothers for an offence the older brother had committed. On 7 February 2009, police </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>48 
</b></p>
<p>had gone to her home and took them to the Asaro police station. They stayed there for a 
month and were treated well. They were still on remand. Once they would be released, they 
would have to find a new place to live, as their house had been burnt down by the 
community, who treats them as outcasts. They are scared because many detainees suffered 
from typhoid. They complained about having to perform work for the warders, such as 
making bilums, but they did not dare to complain. They also made doughnuts which they 
could sell to make some money. They had never been beaten. Their lawyer only met with 
one of the brothers because the rest of the family was innocent. 
</p>
<p>A <b>female detainee</b>, aged 31, had been held there since 2006. She had been originally 
detained at the Lae Police Station, transferred to Buimo Prison for three months, and later 
transferred to Bihute. She was serving a 12-year sentence for murdering her husband after 
he took a second wife. She complained about the lack of water, which often produced many 
cases of typhoid, but added that they always received medication when needed. Her family 
visited her once every three months for 30 minutes. She noted that she had been beaten a 
few times in 2006, but that the attitude of the officers had changed in the past year. Now, 
when the detainees made mistakes, the officers talked to them and did not use any physical 
violence. However, she complained that they were forced to make bilums and wash the 
officers&#8217; clothes. According to her, Bihute was the best place to obtain an education. She 
could leave the prison for one weekend each month. 
</p>
<p><b>Kepa Katoro</b>, aged 40, from Goroka, was arrested around April 2005 and transferred to 
Bihute in May 2005. According to Ms. Katoro she &#8220;had caused troubles&#8221; for which her 
husband started to beat her, including with a bush knife. Due to the injuries sustained she 
was taken by the police to the hospital and from there to Goroko Police Station. During her 
stay at the police station, which lasted four weeks, she did not experience any abuse; 
however conditions of detention were characterized by a lack of water, only one meal per 
day, and clogged toilets. In terms of medical care, Ms. Katoro reported that detainees had 
been receiving a quick response from the prison&#8217;s doctor when they requested his 
intervention. Since recently, however, the treatment was no longer free. Regarding ill-
treatment, Ms. Katoro reported that she had never experienced any ill-treatment; however, 
she observed several new arrivals being beaten at the entry gate to the female section by 
prison guards. Ms. Katoro further reported occasional fights among detainees at her section, 
triggered by the rivalries over water, food and toiletry articles. Asked what would be the 
most pressing need to change, Ms. Katoro noted the lack of a roof over the fireplace where 
food was prepared. 
</p>
<p><b>Jennifer Tony</b>, aged 29, was arrested in 2006 and transferred the same year to the Goroka 
prison. She was sentenced to eight years&#8217; imprisonment three years after her arrest. 
According to her, her husband used to be a criminal who was involved in robberies and 
killings. One day in 2006, Ms. Tony was apprehended in the street by men to whom her 
husband owed a considerable amount of money. She was punched and beaten for 
approximately one hour. Her face was swollen and her eyebrow bled. Subsequently, she 
was arrested by the police who took her to Goroka police station, where no water and 
bedding was provided and the toilet was &#8220;smelly&#8221;. At the prison, Ms. Tony did not 
experience any physical abuse, but was subjected to verbal abuse.   
</p>
<p><i>  Male Section 
</i></p>
<p>Detainees were separated into high, medium and low risk blocks. Low risk prisoners 
enjoyed many privileges, including beds, two new water tanks and could leave the prison 
on the weekends. Other detainees had to sleep on the floor, often without blankets. The 
dormitories in the maximum security block, which housed 73 detainees was overcrowded. 
Quite a number of detainees had been taken to the hospital recently, although some were 
denied access. The major complaint was the inconsistent water supply. Water usually ran </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>for only 15 minutes in the morning, when prisoners had to fill bottles for the day, including 
for cooking and washing themselves. The poor quality of the food was another source of 
concern, and some detainees explained that the lack of nutritious value led to physical 
problems, including problems with eyesight due to a lack of vitamins. Food was provided 
three times per day, but only detainees in the minimum security block were allowed to 
produce vegetables. Detainees were not allowed to keep any food provided by their 
families. Detainees in the general population were only allowed to play rugby once a week. 
Beatings usually took place upon arrival with wires and stones. Detainees were also kept in 
the isolation (punishment) cells for three months or longer. During that period they were 
only allowed out of the cells three times per week 15 minutes each time. At the time of the 
visit, approximately ten detainees arrived from different police stations. Four had injuries 
from recent beatings. Whenever the detainees argued amongst each other, they would be 
beaten by the officers with fan belts, wires, sticks and stones. Collective punishment was 
also used whenever one of the detainees escaped. When sick, detainees were normally 
taken to the hospital, although there had been 8 deaths between 2006 and 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Anton Ronny</b>, aged 18, was arrested on 11 April 2010, after a shop was burgled. Because 
he was a suspect, he was arrested by six officers from a mobile squad. They beat him with 
machine guns on the chest and head, and broke one of his ribs. They also threw bush knives 
at him. He had large scars on his back. He was taken to the Goroka Police Station, where he 
desperately asked for medical treatment and X-rays. He was refused and he stayed in that 
condition in his cell for two weeks. The officers told him that because he was a thief he 
would not be treated and would die in the cell. He added that the officers were never nice. 
He could not shower and felt dirty when he went to court. His family was in Port Moresby 
and he would like to be transferred to Bomana in order to be closer to them. However he 
thought the treatment here was not too bad, that he was not beaten, and that a man would 
say a prayer for all the detainees each night. He complained that there was nothing to do 
and wished he could have a television. 
</p>
<p><b>Jadape Mara</b>, aged 40, was in a detention cell. He had spent three years in jail in Mendi, 
and seven in Bihute. He had killed a man in his cell in January 2007, and had to spend 21 
months in solitary confinement. He had also been beaten with stones and wires and his 
fingers had been dislocated. He had once helped 36 convicts escape and was punished 
severely when they caught him. He had also committed another offence five weeks ago for 
which he was placed in the detention cell. 
</p>
<p><b>Kevin Tom</b>, aged 23, was arrested by the mobile squad in 2005. They stabbed him and hurt 
him before taking him to Goroka Police Station. He was refused medical care for a week 
and his finger, first swollen, became black and had to be amputated. He was released after 
he was taken to court. He had been arrested a second time on 4 October 2009 and was once 
again brutally beaten. However, he had not been beaten at Bihute. He noted the sanitation 
was bad and sick people were not isolated, so he was afraid of getting sick. He noted that 
the doctor was not properly trained. 
</p>
<p><b>A male</b> <b>detainee</b>, aged 21, had been arrested in the outskirts of Goroka, where he was 
pushed, kicked and beaten. He had also been beaten on the face upon arrival at the police 
station. He had been convicted for possession of marihuana, and was serving a three-month 
sentence. 
</p>
<p><b>Frankie Michael</b>, aged 18, had been arrested on 14 May and beaten by 20 police officers 
with a fan belt and a gun butt on the face, head and back. He was then taken to the Azaro 
Police Station, where he was kicked and pushed by an officer. During the interrogation, he 
was beaten but refused to confess. He had been to court the day before, and sentenced to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>50 
</b></p>
<p>nine months imprisonment for drug possession. He was put in a cell with two sick 
detainees.  
</p>
<p><b>A male</b> <b>detainee</b>, aged 33, had been arrested on 18 May and beaten with a gun butt on the 
head and face. At the police station, he was punched while being questioned by several 
officers from the Kerowagi mobile squad. He had been sentenced to one-year imprisonment 
for possession of marijuana. 
</p>
<p><b>Rex Yanonepa</b>, aged 45, had been in Bihute for four years, serving a life sentence for 
murder. In 1999, he had been stabbed in the shoulder by a CID officer at Rabaul Police 
Station, in an effort to obtain a confession. He was also beaten on the head with a gun butt 
and later taken to see a doctor. He informed the judge about the ill-treatment, but no action 
was taken. He complained about the use of verbal violence by the officers and the 
conditions of detention. He added that the conditions in Rabaul were so bad that the 
detainees had taken the matter to court.  
</p>
<p><b>A male</b> <b>detainee</b>, aged 27, had been detained there for two years, completing a three-year 
sentence. He had been beaten, stabbed and shot on the foot from a short distance, despite 
the fact that he surrendered upon arrest. At Goroka Police Station, he was told to close his 
eyes and say his final prayers, and was then shot by an officer. He was also beaten on the 
face and head with a gun butt. He was later taken to the hospital, where he stayed for one 
month without receiving any medical treatment, following police instructions. He escaped 
from the hospital and was re-arrested three weeks later. He never received any medical 
attention. He spent six months in a detention cell, in isolation, without access to air or light. 
In the cell, he was repeatedly beaten with a wire, timber sticks and stones. He also 
complained about other detainees beating him and taking his food while the officers 
watched. He complained about an injury on his foot which was ignored because he was an 
escapee.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kundiawa Police Station  
Visited on 20 and 21 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Senior Constable Koneyal Yaldnia during the first 
visit, who was not aware of the mission and terms of reference of the Special Rapporteur, 
and who refused to provide access to the detention facilities without having received a 
respective authorization from his superiors. The Acting Provincial Police Commissioner, 
Chief Inspector Albert Korin, later arrived at the station and opened the cells. The lock-up 
was in a building behind the police station, where 33 males and four women were held. The 
male detainees were held in three different cells with 8, 11, and 14 detainees in each. Mr. 
Korin stated that the water supply was a serious problem. In light of corroded and leaking 
water tanks, water had to be fetched from the local river, which raised health concerns. 
There were also no functioning showers or toilets available. The Special Rapporteur saw a 
circular in the station requesting all police officers to release detainees after 24 hours unless 
they were charged.  
</p>
<p>One of the officers indicated that the CID required digital cameras and computers to 
perform adequate investigations and collect evidence. He said it was particularly important 
for CID to have a locked safe for keeping files, after all of his files relating to a police case 
he was investigating had been burnt in 2002. Logistic support is also lacking, and autopsy 
teams are needed, with the necessary facilities to keep corpses and to collect fresh evidence. 
A task force officer on duty in front of the police station stated that he regularly kicked 
detainees upon arrest, and that officers purposefully denied certain items to detainees in 
order to teach them a lesson. He states that &#8220;it is normal; they committed a crime, so they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>deserve it. Here we treat them badly so that they can learn and become good citizens&#8221;. In 
the inspection of the CID office, the Special Rapporteur found two homemade guns. A CID 
officer admitted that CID officers beat the detainees, but only with their fists and not with 
their guns. During the debriefing, Mr. Korin committed himself to take two detainees to the 
hospital following a request by the Special Rapporteur. He also committed himself to deal 
with cases of police misconduct in a professional manner. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Female section 
</i></p>
<p>Four women were kept in the female section. One of them had been there for two weeks 
and the others for some days. During a group interview, they complained about the fact that 
they could not shower, that they were often cold, and that they only received one portion of 
food per day. However, visitors were allowed to bring them food. They also complained 
about the lack of privacy, for example when using the toilet. They indicated they got along 
well with the warders since they knew them from before their detention. One of the women 
had been beaten the day before by one of the officers. 
</p>
<p><b>Ambai Keten</b>, aged 28, has been in the cell for three days. She had been arrested by a 
police officer as she had stepped on him at the market. When he took her to the station, she 
asked for her rights and was subsequently punched in the eye, on the ears and cheeks. She 
was taken to the cell with her face completely swollen. She was charged for speaking 
against the community police and destroying the marketplace.  
</p>
<p><b>Cathy James</b>, aged 25, was arrested at her house three days before the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. The police searched her apartment and took her away after they found 
homebrew. She was holding a baby and they put him away while they beat her with sticks 
and belts. She had many scars and stated that the baby was also beaten. Considering the 
terrible effects it has on people and the society, consumption of homebrew was a serious 
offence. For this reason, it was not possible to be bailed. However, as the police officers 
listened to her story, they understood that she had not brewed it, but was only in the home 
where it was stored. She would therefore be bailed in the following days. 
</p>
<p><i>  Male division 
</i></p>
<p><b>Cell with 11 detainees</b>: four of the 11 detainees had been there for more than one week and 
some had been there for months. Nine of them had been beaten by the police, three of 
which were beaten by CID officers in a separate building. They indicated that the food was 
not enough, as they only received one meal a day at around 3 p.m. They also noted that the 
light was always on. Visits were sometimes allowed. Finally, they added that there was a 
lot of corruption, with police officers taking their money and mobile phones and selling 
them to others. 
</p>
<p><b>Bonney Kaupa</b>, aged 37, was arrested on 19 January 2010 and taken to the CID office. 
First Constable Peter Kadiosa Lou beat him severely with a homemade gun and broke one 
of his fingers and his arm. He was denied medical treatment. The forensic examination 
corroborates the evidence.  
</p>
<p><b>Michael Dekenne</b>, aged 27, was a primary school teacher. He had been arrested the day 
before for drinking in the street. He had been beaten by the police and taken to the police 
station, where he was offered release on bail for 400 Kina, but he could not pay this 
amount. 
</p>
<p><b>Amos Kaupa</b>, aged 20, was arrested on 10 February 2010 and taken to the CID Office, 
where he was beaten with a metal pipe while sitting on a chair. He sustained injuries on his </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>52 
</b></p>
<p>head and right shoulder. He had already been held for more than three months in the cell 
and would have his next court hearing on 30 June.  
</p>
<p><b>Kamin Kagl</b>, aged 34, had been arrested the day before the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
outside the Police Station and beaten with a bamboo stick. He had an open wound on his 
foot. 
</p>
<p><b>Joshua Kaupa</b>, aged 19, had been detained at the station for nine days. He was serving a 
sentence in prison, but had been taken to the police station for an investigation concerning 
another case. He had been arrested after some villagers gave money to the police to arrest 
him. Upon arrest, he was beaten by six officers who then proceeded to burn his house 
down. His hands were then tied with a rope and he was dragged for a long distance. He was 
taken to the Saure Police Station, where he was charged. He indicated that he had not been 
beaten at Kundiawa. He did not have a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>L.M.</b>, aged 14, has been detained for three weeks. He had been picked up by the police in 
the street, and they allegedly put marijuana in his bag when he arrived at the station. He 
was beaten with a rubber hose and a gun butt in order to obtain a confession. He spent the 
first night in the corridor, and his family was only informed of his arrest two days later. He 
had been taken to the general court, not the Juvenile Court. If he did not pay bail, he would 
have to remain in detention for eight months.  
</p>
<p><b>S.J.</b>, aged 17, has been arrested on 10 May. He had been beaten and kicked upon arrest and 
at the police station. He had not yet seen a judge or a doctor. 
</p>
<p><b>Yaldrua Kalaga</b>, aged 55, was a former Governor. He had allegedly burnt his mother&#8217;s 
house with her inside, with the help of his brothers and kids, because she was a sorcerer. He 
complained that no police officer had properly investigated the case, and that he had not 
committed the offence. Six members of his family are in jail. He complained about the 
judicial system in general and alleged that the situation in the Police Station was bad, with 
corruption, bribes, arbitrariness, refusal of bail by CID officers, etc. He had been at the 
police station since 9 February 2010, after a request from the police to go to the station to 
help with the investigation. His daughter had delivered a baby at the police station the week 
before, and had since been taken to a female police officer&#8217;s home to continue her 
detention. He indicated that he had not been ill-treated but his house had been destroyed. 
</p>
<p><b>Jerry Gomna </b>(in detention for three months),<b> Philimon Wap </b>(in detention for four 
months),<b> Darua Kutne </b>(in detention for three weeks),<b> Kela Thomas </b>(in detention for one

detention for one day)<b> </b>as well as<b> Robert Geo </b>(see below), <b>T. S.</b> (see below) and another 
detainee. All detainees were held in the cell throughout the day. There was almost no 
natural light coming through the small and filthy windows and neon lights enlightened the 
room 24 hours a day. During the frequent power shortages, the cell was in complete 
darkness. The detainees had no bedding and had to sleep on the concrete floor. The toilet in 
the room was only separated with a small wall and the lack of water to flush it produced a 
strong smell. In terms of food, they reported that they only received one meal per day. 
Water was provided in a large bucket, which was nonetheless insufficient to satisfy their 
needs for drinking, washing and flushing. Out of the 14 detainees, nine stated that they had 
been beaten during arrest. All reported being physically abused during at least one occasion 
at the police station. About half of the detainees had not seen a lawyer and the majority of 
them had not been charged, despite having been in the cells for longer than 24 hours. 
</p>
<p><b>Robert Geo</b>, aged 25, had been arrested in Madang the night before the visit after police 
forces raided his house while he was sleeping. During the arrest, he was punched and 
kicked severely. His arms were subsequently tied with a rope behind his back, he was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>dragged into a police van and forced to lie down between two seats. During the long drive 
from Madang to Chuave, Simbu Province, he was continuously kicked, punched, and 
beaten with the butt of a gun, mainly on his face and upper body, by at least five officers. 
When he arrived at Simbu Police Station, he was beaten at the reception desk. When 
interviewed, Mr. Geo&#8217;s face was badly swollen, with a cut in his lip of about two cm in 
length, traces of butt of rifle on his back, and many other traces of ill-treatment. His clothes 
were covered with large blood stains. 
</p>
<p><b>T. S.</b>, aged 17, had been arrested at gunpoint the night before, in relation to allegations of 
illegal alcohol consumption. He was taken to Chuave police station, where he was beaten 
by four officers for approximately one hour with a gun butt and a fan belt; he was also 
kicked and punched. He was subsequently transferred to the police station in Kundiawa. 
When interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, one of his eyes was swollen, one of his 
cheeks was covered with dried blood, and there were traces of a gun butt on his back. 
According to Mr. S. and Geo, both had been transferred by the same officers from Chuave 
to Kundiava Police Station. One of the officers involved in the abuse was identified as Mr. 
Paul Kalis from the CID at Chuave Police Station. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meeting with civil society in Kundiawa 
20 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur meet with more than 30 civil society representatives, victims of 
police violence, police officers dealing with cases of sorcery and victims of sorcery related 
violence.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur interviewed the parents, sister and brother of Balu Kukam, who 
was so heavily beaten after his arrest on 10 August 2009 by police officer Jeffrey Pyasoto 
that he died in custody at Kundiawa Police Station the same night. We later investigated the 
case. 
</p>
<p><b>Emmanuel Minga</b>, aged 20, was at home in March 2010, when he saw a crowd chasing a 
boy who had stolen the pastor&#8217;s wallet. Since his family always tried to stop criminal 
activities, he went out with a friend, stopped the boy, took the wallet and gave it back to the 
pastor. Then they escorted the pastor back to the bus stop, the crowd still following them. 
However, a police car passed and thought they had done something wrong since the crowd 
was so agitated following them. They came out of their car, and he saw that they had beers 
and guns in the car. They started beating both of them with the gun butts and the other boy 
was bleeding. They were asked to crawl in the mud. The mobile squad then left. Later, he 
went to the police station to complain about it, talked to the PPC and requested apologies 
for being mistaken by the two officers. So far nothing was done. 
</p>
<p><b>Peter Bomai Jonathan,</b> aged 33, was in many different police stations and prisons since 
1995. He was freed this year in March as his case was dismissed. Over the years, he was at 
Bomana Correctional Facility, Goroka Correctional Facility, Barawagi Correctional Facility 
and Goroka, Boroko and Kundiawa police stations. He states that upon arrest he was never 
treated humanely. At Boroko and Kundiawa police stations he was forced to confess. He 
actually thinks that Boroko is the worst place he visited. Barawagi was the best. But all in 
all he complains about the food that made him so weak physically over the years. He also 
states that criminals go back to criminality after their time in jail, as there is no program to 
rehabilitate them. He has no job, no idea of what to do next, and thinks criminal activities 
are as appealing as before. He has no trust in police. </p>

<p><b>  Barawagi Correctional Facility, Shimbu 
Visited on 21 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Michael Auirap, Acting Commanding Officer, 
who assumed the position two weeks prior. There were 202 detainees, including 17 
females. According to Mr. Auirap, there were no juveniles. The prison was divided into two 
sections with two cellblocks each. Detainees on remand and high-risk convicted prisoners 
shared one section, while medium and low-risk prisoners shared the other. In addition, there 
were four detention (punishment) cells measuring 2x2 meters. The last death in prison had 
occurred in 2008. There were 48 staff members, including three female warders and four 
female corporals, who worked in four shifts. However, they needed at least ten more staff 
members. Between 8.30 and 11 a.m. and 1.30 to 2.30 p.m., the convicted prisoners worked. 
High-risk detainees were always separated from the others. The remandees are also 
separated, but not during the day. The Acting Commanding Officer stated that the main 
concern was the water supply. They pumped water from the river, but did not disinfect it, 
and they also collected rain water. The staff suffered the same water shortage. Detainees 
were allowed to leave the cell on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays for one hour in order 
to empty the toilet buckets and wash themselves; however, the time was insufficient.  
</p>
<p>Two days before the visit of the Special Rapporteur there had been a violent incident, 
where 22 detainees escaped or tried to escape. This resulted in collective punishment and 
the beatings took place at the guard&#8217;s house. During an incident on 11 December 2009 and 
as a form of punishment, no food was served to the detainees and the guards shot teargas 
into the locked dormitory. According to some officials a few detainees were about to be 
released on parole and when others requested to be released, they tried to escape. The 
Special Rapporteur also heard about instances of inter-prisoner violence, mainly due to the 
water shortage.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Cell 4 &#8211; Remandees Section 
</i></p>
<p>The remandees have a large garden, a non-functioning television, natural light, and the 
dormitory was in a good condition and did not smell bad. However, the detainees did not 
have mattresses. The remandee who has been there the longest had been there for 11 years, 
and he suffered from a mental illness. Another detainee has been there for four years and 
five months. Around 22 detainees out of 45 had been beaten by the officers, mainly with 
bush knives, stones, belts, boots and iron bars. One detainee had just been beaten and 
presented fresh and large marks. The main reasons for the beatings were to chase them back 
to their cells or if someone escaped. Collective punishment was also used. On 11 December 
2009, they were locked-in with teargas. Visitors could bring cooked food, but it had to be 
eaten immediately. They received three meals a day but complained about the lack of 
medication. Their main recommendations were to improve the food and to have a system 
for them to go to court more often, as currently they remain on remand for very long 
periods. 
</p>
<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 24, was arrested at home by seven community police officers. He 
spent a week at Kundiawa Police Station and was then taken to Barawagi, where he was 
beaten by an officer with a fan belt on his back, cheeks and ears. When he fell on the 
ground, the officer kicked him while three officers watched. The reason for the beatings 
seemed to be &#8220;revenge&#8221;. He was taken to a medical staff who gave him some aspirins. He 
would go to court soon but had no lawyer. </p>

<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 22, was arrested in December 2006 and spent three months at 
Kundiawa Police Station. He was strongly beaten by CID officers to force a confession. 
They threatened him with a gun and hit him with a bicycle chain throughout his body. He 
was also threatened with further beatings on two other occasions. He went to court, but still 
no decision had been taken, three years after his arrest. The office of the public solicitor 
was helping him. In May 2009, he had been beaten with iron bars and fan belts after 
making fun of one of the officers. He still had large scars, which were confirmed by 
forensic evidence. 
</p>
<p><b>J. G.</b>, aged 17, had been in prison for nine months, serving a five-year sentence. He had 
escaped in September 2009 and was re-captured one week later by the Correctional 
Services. Upon recapture, he was kicked and beaten with a gun butt and bush knives on the 
head, back, legs and hands. He was taken to the hospital, where he remained for one week 
without receiving any medical attention. He was later placed in a detention cell for three 
months. 
</p>
<p><b>Brown Kawagle</b>, aged 28. He had been in detention for three years and had tried to escape 
twice. Upon recapture the second time, he was blindfolded and beaten on the legs, back and 
head for approximately one hour by two officers. They also fired shots in the air, but did 
not shoot at him. He was placed in a detention cell for three months and four days, where 
he was often beaten during the night. He never received medical attention and would like to 
be transferred to a different prison. He will complete his sentence in 2016. 
</p>
<p><b>John Siba Gulmay</b>, was arrested on 10 November 2003. His mother died and he asked the 
warders to allow him weekend leave to attend the funeral but was denied. He escaped on 22 
February 2005. He got married and had a child, but was recaptured on 22 February 2009 
and put in the high-risk section.

<p><b>  General interview  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Maximum Security Wing 
</i></p>
<p>68 detainees were held in overcrowded conditions. They were locked up between 3 p.m. 
and 9 a.m. Ten detainees said they had been beaten by the officers. When someone escaped, 
all the detainees were subjected to collective punishments. They had to stand in line and 
were beaten with fan belts, iron rods and sticks. One of the officers, Sergeant Harry, had 
allegedly decided to extend the sentence of John Roba, an escapee, by three years. He was 
supposed to serve 11 years and now had to serve 14.  
</p>
<p><i>  Detention cells 
</i></p>
<p><b>Marant Waigi</b>, aged 30, <b>Maike Were,</b> and <b>John Blacky</b>, aged 43, have been detained in 
the cell for three months, 10 weeks, and five weeks, respectively for attempting to escape. 
They reported beatings after their recapture, which took place in the office of the prison 
authority, and on the way from the office to the gate. The beatings were mainly inflicted 
with fan belts and fists, and involved about 15 officers. Mr. Waigi had a broken arm after 
being beaten with a stick by one of the guards. He had not received any treatment. They 
added that detainees were always held in the detention cells for the maximum time allowed. 
During this time, they were not allowed to receive visitors. They had no toilet and have to 
defecate in a bucket. They also had to eat in the cell. </p>
<p><b>Michael Buldagi</b>. He indicated that one of the warders, Peter Sine, had punched him in the 
face, took him to the guard house and kicked him with his boots before taking him to the 
punishment cell. He had a bucket for his waste and a container for water.  </p>

<p><b>  Baisu Correctional Facility, Mount Hagen 
Visited on 22 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Donald Apeti, Assistant Duty Officer and Major 
Jackson Kera. The commanding officer, Superintendent Simon Sobaim, was not present. 
The Senior Administrative Inspector John D. Eluh was in charge at the time of the visit. Mr. 
Eluh was responsible for welfare operations and rehabilitation. The prison had 378 
detainees, including 46 women and 38 juveniles. There were more remandees than 
convicted detainees. 
</p>
<p>At the debriefing, John Eluh barely knew anything about the facility, and was not aware 
that two inmates had recently died in their cells. There were 94 staff members, and Mr. 
Eluh indicated that they needed 200 to 300 more. He described the security situation as 
very poor and stated there are frequent breakouts. He added that male detainees were not 
always taken to the hospital due to the high risk of escapes.  
</p>
<p>On 13 April 2010, 84 detainees had escaped in a major breakout. 23 had been recaptured 
and 61 were still at-large. The Special Rapporteur interviewed all escapees who were 
caught during or shortly after the escape. All of them were severely beaten up and put in the 
punishment cells. He documented their injuries (gun shots from close distance, partly also 
from long distance in order to prevent the escape; beatings with bush knives or grass knives 
and cuts of their legs or tendons with the intent of disabling them). None of them had been 
taken to the hospital or received any medical treatment. According to the information 
provided by the detainees and confirmed by the officers, one escapee, <b>L.O.,</b> had died in the 
detention cell at around 10 pm on 13 April. He had been shot and beaten. <b>M.U.</b> died on 29 
April as a result of heavy beatings. Some detainees also alleged the death of a third detainee 
in the punishment cell in early May, but the officers denied this. No investigations were 
initiated in either of these cases.  
</p>
<p>The situation in the prison was terrible. There were no sports, no recreational and 
rehabilitation facilities, the detainees were locked in their cellblocks for most of the day, the 
food was of a poor quality and insufficient quantity, detainees had very little water, the 
medical facilities were closed down because there was no health worker available, and the 
detainees had no access to the hospital in Mount Hagen. 
</p>
<p><i>  Male section 
</i></p>
<p>The male section was divided into four cellblocks (high, medium and low risk prisoners and 
a section for remandees).  22 detainees were in the detention cells. The detainees did not 
have enough food, with seven detainees having to share one tin of fish. The cooking 
utensils were old and the pans made the rice burn. They were locked up for 19 hours per 
day in overcrowded cells, and they had no books or a library. They also receive no 
education. Many detainees had to serve 20-year sentences and would like to learn a trade 
such as carpentry, mechanics, or information technology as a form of rehabilitation and to 
have the skills needed to reintegrate into society, but nothing was provided. They had no 
blankets and not enough plates. There was also a lack of hygiene, and detainees had died of 
illnesses such as diarrhoea and scabies. The toilet did not flush and the detainees had to use 
water collected from outside the cell. Sick prisoners also lived in the same area as the other 
detainees and diseases could easily spread throughout the prison population. At least five 
detainees with mental illnesses were held with the other detainees and should be separated. </p>

<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Remandee section 
</i></p>
<p>All the personal belongings of the escapees had been burnt after the escape and they had to 
buy everything again. There were two juveniles in the cell, aged 15 and 16. They had been 
here for two weeks and one year, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>Larson Tetepa, </b>aged 28, was arrested in September 2008 by the community for an issue 
regarding inheritance. He had been beaten on the face at Mount Hagen Police Station. In 
April, he decided to escape because of the terrible conditions he was living in pending his 
trial. He cut the fence and escaped with 83 others. Later, the alarm rang and the officers 
went looking for them. He was caught and taken back. Once under their control, the 
officers cut his leg with an axe and beat him with sticks. They also broke his left arm with a 
stick and hit him behind the ears with an axe. He was also beaten on the foot with an axe. 
He was put back in the cell without any medication and was only taken to the hospital three 
days later, where he spent two weeks. The medical forensic examinations confirmed the 
presence of traumatic lesions absolutely compatible with the allegations and clearly 
diagnostic of ill-treatment. He had to borrow clothes from other detainees since all of his 
possessions had been burnt.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nelson Jack</b>, aged 20, was arrested on 20 January 2010 at the market in Mount Hagen, by 
seven officers, for stealing a blackberry and phone cards. They hit him three times on the 
knee with a stick and also broke his jaw. He indicated that he could no longer run fast or 
move properly. At the police station, he was beaten with a fan belt on the back and left arm 
and was taken to hospital only nine days after. He did not have a plate, cup, shoes or 
anything else because all of his belongings had been burnt.  
</p>
<p><b>Mewa Gui</b>, aged 38, has been arrested in July 2004 at home by CID. They beat him on the 
eyebrows with gun butts. He spent a month at Mount Hagen Police Station, where he was 
also beaten. In 2005, he escaped for 8 months. He had received his sentenced the day before 
the visit and had been sentenced to 20 years. He had been beaten three times in six years. 
He complained that the current superintendent was worse than the ones before him. 
</p>
<p><b>Joel Dominik</b>, aged 30, was arrested about one month before the visit. Mr. Dominik had 
been shot in the foot by a police officer, in course of an incident at Wabag, in which he 
reported not to have been involved. The following day, Mr. Dominik went to the police 
station in order to complain about the shooting. However, upon arrival at the station, he was 
arrested and kicked by the police officers on duty. He was held for three days, and later 
transferred to Baisu Correctional Facility. During the transfer, he was taken to the nearest 
general hospital where his injury was treated. Mr. Dominik complained about the old and 
dirty plates from which they had to eat their meals, and the overall lack of information on 
the rights of detainees. 
</p>
<p><b>Petrus Aba</b>, aged 50, from Simbu. In July 2009, Mr. Aba had participated in the setting up 
of roadblocks and robbing travellers. While walking on the street one day, the owner of a 
vehicle he had robbed earlier identified him and informed the police. The officers stopped 
Mr. Aba at gunpoint and he surrendered. Subsequently, the owner of the vehicle started to 
hit Mr. Aba with a bush knife, resulting in the loss of several fingers and other severe 
injuries. The police officers present did not intervene. Eventually, Mr. Aba lost 
consciousness and woke up in the hospital, where he received treatment for his injuries. Mr. 
Aba was not aware of having been officially interrogated by the police. He reported not to 
have experienced any further ill-treatment since his arrest.  
</p>
<p><b>Michael Lakari</b>, aged 20. On 29 October, the police and an informant tried to arrest him in 
Mount Hagen. Mr. Lakari resisted and tried to run away, but was apprehended. After 
having surrendered and having been ordered to sit on the ground, the informant started to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>58 
</b></p>
<p>punch and stab Mr. Lakari, resulting in a severe injury on his left hand and broken teeth. 
The police officers reportedly observed the ill-treatment, but did not intervene until a very 
late stage. Eventually, Mr. Lakari was put into the police car and transferred to the police 
station. His request to receive medical treatment was denied both during the 14 weeks he 
stayed at the police station in Mount Hagen, and at Baisu Correctional Facility. He 
indicated that mobile phone vouchers worth 200 kina and 35 kina in cash had been taken 
from him upon arrest, and were not given back. Mr. Lakari reported that only a few days 
prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur, a guard had thrown a stone at his head. At the 
moment of the interview, Mr. Lakari had a suppurating stab wound on his hand, which was 
strongly deformed and almost completely paralyzed.  
</p>
<p><i>  Convict section 
</i></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Eddie Murphy&#8221;</b>, aged 18, from Tari. On 25 February 2010 he was picked up from the 
Hagen bus stop by a female prosecutorial officer and four police officers in civilian clothes. 
They beat him and kicked him in the back as they interrogated him in front at the bus stop, 
and then took him to the police station, where the beatings continued at the cell gate. The 
police was accompanied by the complainant, and he also joined in the kicking and 
punching. He remained in the police cell for two weeks, on remand in prison for a month, 
and five months in prison since his conviction.  
</p>
<p><b>So Mel</b>, aged 40, from Mt. Hagen, had had a stomach ulcer for five years. The week before 
the visit, he was taken to the hospital for blood tests. He was supposed to go back to get the 
results but the warden had not let him. Medicines had to be provided by their relatives.  
</p>
<p><b>J.N</b>., aged 18. Between one and two weeks before the visit, a police officer kicked him in 
the back upon arrest at a bus stop. He was still in pain. After that, the police locked him in a 
cell for 12 days, after which he went to court and was taken to Baisu. He had never been to 
court before, and was sentenced to eight months without any time to explain his story. He 
had no lawyer. If a prisoner was convicted to over one year, they were placed in the high-
security section. The prison officers brought in drugs, pliers to help them escape and mobile 
phones. Then they beat inmates for being in possession of them.  
</p>
<p><i>  Female Section 
</i></p>
<p>On the day of the visit, 46 women were detained in the female section (27 convicts and 19 
remandees). There were also six babies, who could stay with their mothers until the age of 
three. Women who gave birth could stay at the hospital for one day before being taken back 
to the prison. They could not do gardening. The remandees had to do the same work as the 
convicted detainees, but those with medical problems could stay in the compound. The 
women had to work for the female and male officers, including making bilums and 
cleaning, but were not paid. They had no power to refuse, and they are verbally abused and 
threatened if they did. After the 13 April escape in the male prison, the women were also 
punished; they were not allowed visits or spiritual fellowship, even though no women had 
taken part in the escape. They could do sports on Fridays. They had bible study 
programmes. Women with serious medical problems were taken to Mt. Hagen Hospital. A 
woman had recently given birth in jail at 3.00 a.m. with the assistance of other detainees. 
They received soap and toilet paper once a week, although there was not enough water. All 
the officers are female.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>A female detainee had been a victim of domestic violence. On 16 May 2010, her husband 
hit her as she was cooking. She took a stick and hit him back to try to release herself. He 
went to the police and asked them to arrest her. The police told her to get in the car but her 
uncle intervened and indicated she had acted in self-defense. The next day, her husband and </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>59</b> 
</p>
<p>a police officer arrived at her home. The husband pulled her, kicked her, bit her right arm 
and put her in the police vehicle. They took her to Mount Hagen Police Station and her 
husband left. The police officer kicked her in the back, slapped her and pushed her into a 
toilet and then into the cell. He told her to take off her clothes so he could look at her and 
that he would come back at midnight. He came back and said he would set her bail at 100k. 
In the middle of the night, he unlocked the cell door and raped her. The next morning, she 
was taken to court. The following morning, she told her uncle what had happened and he 
wanted to take her out to hospital but she was afraid. Later in the day she was transferred to 
prison. The court found her guilty and sentenced her to one month imprisonment and a fine 
of 500k. She has not seen a doctor and was in pain.  
</p>
<p>A female detainee, aged 34, was arrested at home in Mount Hagen on 10 September 2009 
because she could not repay debts. She spent six months at Mount Hagen Police Station. 
She was not beaten but she witnessed other detainees being slapped. She complained about 
the lack of water and the privileges men had, including for example being able to leave for 
three days to attend a funeral, while the women were only allowed to leave for one day. 
</p>
<p>J.N. had to go to the hospital for an operation, but was not taken because there was no 
vehicle available. There were classification meetings every three months, but the female 
guards did not take up the female detainees&#8217; cases. Male detainees were allowed weekend 
leave and other privileges, while the women&#8217;s leave had stopped. She had recently made an 
application for leave but the guard threw it away. She added that the staff expected bribes in 
order to grant them weekend leave. She complained about the lack of privacy, including 
during their medical examinations. Male guards would open the women&#8217;s section of the 
prison in the mornings.  
</p>
<p>Josephine Tomo, aged 25, had been arrested six years prior. She reported that no violence 
had been used against her. She did not recall being interrogated by the police, but only 
being taken directly to court and charged with murder. Ms. Tomo spent one month and 
three weeks at Lae Police Station, and was sentenced by the court to twelve years&#8217; 
imprisonment. In March 2009 she requested to be transferred to Baisu Correctional Facility 
in order to be closer to her young child who had been with her sister&#8217;s family in Lae, but 
was illegally taken by her husband to Mount Hagen. However, on the day of the interview, 
Ms. Tomo was not aware of the whereabouts of her child, which caused her deep sorrow. 
Ms. Tomo&#8217;s request for weekend leave to look for her child had not been granted. Ms. 
Tomo considered Baisu Prison to be better than the one in Lae, mainly due to the good 
relationship among female detainees and the possibility to be visited by family members. 
At the same time, she regretted that personal problems were not taken up by the wardens, 
and complained about the lack of food, which she reportedly had raised already earlier with 
the local church and representatives of the Ombudsman&#8217;s office. Ms. Tomo further reported 
that no schooling or vocational training was provided to female detainees. Wardens 
sometimes urge detainees to produce bilums, which were later sold at the market, with no 
revenue given to the detainees. 
</p>
<p><i>  Detention cells 
</i></p>
<p><b>Pikua Smith</b>, aged 25. The correctional officers and their sons had cut the tendon on his 
leg with a bush knife when he tried to escape. They also beat him all over his body with the 
back of an axe, stones and fists. He had been taken to the clinic for a day, and later placed 
in a detention cell. He suffered from malaria, diarrhoea and vomiting, and had a very high 
fever. He was receiving no medication for malaria. 
</p>
<p><b>Robert Moses</b>, aged 21, had been allowed to live with the livestock on the prison grounds. 
One night, he was approached by officers from the mobile squad who punched and kicked 
him on the back of the head. He shouted for help and one of the correctional officers came </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>60 
</b></p>
<p>to help him, but afterwards locked him up in one of the cells. He was taken to the police 
station to file a complaint and later to the hospital. 
</p>
<p><b>A male</b> <b>detainee</b>, aged 21, had been arrested on 18 March and was not charged until 28 
March. He had been beaten and punched at Wabag Police Station by an officer. He had 
escaped from Wabag Prison, but surrendered two weeks later. He had been sentenced to six 
months hard labour on one case, and had a second case pending. 
</p>
<p><b>Joshua Kandanyo</b>, aged 24, had tried to escape in 2009, and was shot at by correctional 
officers after he surrendered. He had been lying on his back while officers beat him with a 
bush knife all over his body. He was afterwards locked in a detention cell for two months. 
He was taken to the hospital after four weeks. He had been transferred to the maximum 
security section in March 2010 because he was serving a life sentence related to tribal 
fighting. He indicated that he had been in a duel, and had compensated the family of the 
man he killed through the village court. However, the other villagers convinced the police 
to arrest him and provided evidence to the police for his conviction. His allegations were 
not supported by forensic evidence. 
</p>
<p><b>James Yamkema</b>, aged 35. He had been cut on the left leg by correctional officers after he 
tried to escape. 
</p>
<p><i>  Juvenile section 
</i></p>
<p>The section for juveniles was separate from those for adults, and accommodated 38 male 
juvenile detainees (33 convicts and five remandees) on the day of the visit. Two adult 
detainees (aged 22 and 35) were held in the same section, since their safety could not be 
ensured in the section for adults due to an inter-prisoner conflict. The youngest boy was 13 
and some were 14. Four juveniles had been there for more than a year. They had all been 
beaten by the police during arrest or custody. Only four juveniles reported not having been 
beaten at Baisu, and six had been beaten the week before the visit. The beatings normally 
took place in front of all the detainees, and the victim was forced to remove his shirt and 
beaten with a fan belt. The beatings were often done if the juvenile did not respond quickly 
to the warder&#8217;s orders or if they used too much firewood to cook. Officer Waramendi was 
notorious for the beatings. The juvenile&#8217;s section does not comprise any punishment cell; 
however, one juvenile reported having been detained in the adult detention cell for three 
months for an attempted escape. Juvenile detainees did not receive any schooling or 
vocational training, nor are they allowed to undertake any recreational activities or sports. 
Footballs and similar items were described by the authorities as being too expensive. 
Juveniles reported that balls provided by visiting parents were taken under the pretext of 
security considerations. In the absence of possibilities for any meaningful activities, 
juveniles described their detention as a complete waste of time. They only received two 
meals per day. 
</p>
<p><b>I.B.</b>, aged 14, had been held there for two weeks. He had been beaten by officer 
Waramendi, for allegedly wasting firewood. He was beaten in front of the other juveniles 
for approximately five minutes on the arm, thigh, back, shoulder and buttocks with a fan 
belt. He had not received any medical attention. 
</p>
<p><b>J.W.</b>, aged 13, had been detained for six months and was serving a three-year sentence. He 
had been beaten one week before the visit of the Special Rapporteur for talking to an older 
detainee when he went to fetch water. Officer Waramendi beat him on the back and upper 
arms with a wooden stick. All the detainees saw the beating. He did not complain because 
all of the officers beat them. He had been bailed, but arrived late to a court hearing because 
he was at school and was therefore re-arrested. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Sergeant Cosmos Pingina, Deputy Commander, 
and Taka Ramo, Senior Administration Clerk. Wabag Prison had been closed down in 2007 
following a large prison breakout, where 28 detainees escaped and none were recaptured. 
The facility was reopened in March 2010 with improved fences and had a maximum 
capacity of 50. A new facility was being built nearby. The staff comprised 14 officers, 
including three women.  
</p>
<p>On the day of the visit, only four individuals were in detention, which was described by the 
authorities as the typical occupancy rate. Wabag Prison only held detainees who had less 
than six months left to serve and were considered low-risk detainees. Detainees who had 
longer sentences to serve, were on remand, or were not low-risk were held at Mount Hagen. 
The overall conditions of detention at Wabag Prison were muchbetter than those in other 
facilities, mainly due to its small size and low occupancy rate. The dormitory was spacious 
and included wooden plank beds for every detainee. They were allowed to leave the 
dormitory between 7.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. The sanitary facilities were dirty but functional, 
and water was provided in sufficient quantity, either from tanks collecting rain water or 
from a nearby creek. During the dry season, the detainees were taken to the creek for 
showering. The food rations were supplemented with vegetables from the prison&#8217;s garden. 
The guards were not armed. None of the prisoners alleged to have been beaten at Wabag 
Prison.

<p><b>Kuriya Mope</b>, aged around 30, was sentenced to four months and had spent three at Baisu.

Visited on 23 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Mr. Tom Aul, Supervisor. Three male and one 
female detainee were in detention, with the female detainee spending the daytime in a little 
shed outside of the detention block due to the ongoing renovation work in the female cell. 
The male detainees reported that they received one meal per day and had to ask the wardens 
for drinking water, which they normally provided. However, there was no water available 
for washing. The three male detainees reported that they were not allowed to leave the cell 
at any time and had to defecate in a small, blocked hole on the floor in the cell. There was 
no bedding and detainees had to sleep on the concrete floor, despite the low temperatures at 
night. With the renovations, the toilet would have to be flushed from outside, as was the 
case in other police stations in the Highlands, creating an unnecessary dependence by the 
detainees on the police officers. None of the detainees who had been in detention between </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>62 
</b></p>
<p>five and seven days had been taken to court. Two of the detainees reported having been 
beaten during arrest.   
</p>
<p>The register was not bad, but incomplete, since the prosecutor either forgot to complete it or 
the officers would release some detainees without registering them. At the time of the visit, 
there were three detainees in the lock-ups who were not in the register. 
</p>
<p>During the debriefing with the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Aul complained about a lack of 
attention from Port Moresby regarding the challenges and limited resources of the police in 
Wabag. According to Mr. Aul, there were 150 police officers under the command of the 
provincial headquarters in Wabag, responsible for a population of almost 200,000. The 
police force only had 20 cars at their disposal, and had received their last in-service training 
more than ten years ago. He explained that they did not have enough uniforms for 
everyone. He also complained about the old and scarce furniture, lack of computers or even 
a typewriter, despite the fact that the police station served 200,000 people. In February 
2010, Judge Graham Ellis had inspected the police lock-up, had personally cleaned it and 
ordered the police officers responsible to maintain the cells properly. In reaction to this, the 
authorities of Enga Province had secured funds from the private sector for a thorough 
renovation of the police cells. The renovation work was being financed by Barrick Gold 
Corporation, co-owners of the Porgera Gold Mine.

<p><b>A male detainee</b>, aged 25, had been arrested three days before the visit. He was passing by 
a shop where an attempted burglary just had occurred and the guards from the shop 
apprehended him. They beat him and handed him over to the police, who beat him upon 
arrival at Wabag Police Station. The beating took place at the counter in the entrance. He 
was forced to lean on the wall and was punched to try to obtain a confession. There had 
been no further beatings. 
</p>
<p><b>Alice Kuan</b> has been held there for two days, for her own protection. She spent all day in a 
shed and slept in the building that was being refurbished. She was regularly beaten by her 
husband, and left him after he cut her with a bush knife. She went to live with her parents, 
but her husband also beat her father, so he went into hiding and she went to the police 
station. They had filed a criminal case against him and had a court hearing the following 
week. She indicated that her husband had substance abuse problems. She was treated well 
by the police and kept in the shed for her own protection.

<p><b>  Mount Hagen Police Station, Mount Hagen 
Visited on 23 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by John Maguna, Commander and Sergeant Canute 
Gutok, duty officer. There were 32 detainees and the lock-up comprised eleven cells, 
although not all of them were in use. The cells were located around an inner courtyard. The 
authorities were not able to open the cell to allow for private interviews, as there was only 
one set of keys held by the head of the police station, who was out of town. The inability to 
open the cell doors not only made the fact-finding by the Special Rapporteur very difficult, 
but it also raised serious concerns regarding safety of the detainees in case of emergencies, 
such as a fire. One cell was open because it had not been locked before the head of the 
station left for the weekend. 
</p>
<p>The detainees were extremely agitated, screaming, complaining and insulting the guards. 
They were not allowed to leave the cells at all. The cells were very dirty and did not have </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>any furniture. Very little daylight entered the cells. There were no functioning toilets in the 
cells and the detainees have to defecate in plastic bags or urinate in plastic bottles in front 
of the others, which were then pushed out of the cells into the court yard. The bags and 
bottles were piled up in the courtyard, after the female detainees were forced to collect 
them from the different cells. The detainees were fed rice once a day. The Special 
Rapporteur found used condoms everywhere in the courtyard, and two boxes in the 
Commander&#8217;s office. The Special Rapporteur was informed that police officers arrested 
women and kept them for the night, exchanging sex for their release. A male police officer 
was inside the female cell at the time of the visit. 
</p>
<p>During the debriefing, the Station Commander and the person in charge of the cells 
confirmed that the female detainees cleaned the lock-up, including collecting the urine and 
excrements and washing the male detainees&#8217; clothes. The male detainees confirmed that the 
women brought them their food. The station commander in principle acknowledged the bad 
conditions of detention; however, he justified the situation by a lack of resources provided 
by the Government. The lack of food was also explained by a lack of funds. Nevertheless, 
family members were not allowed to provide food for detainees. The station commander 
further reported that the detention block flooded with water and excrements when it rained 
due to the broken sewage system.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur considers Mount hagen Police Station the worst of all detention 
facilities he had visited in Papua New Guinea. He had also received numerous allegations 
of beatings at Mount Hagen Police Station during his interviews with prisoners at Baisu 
Correctional Facility. He urged the Government to immediately close down this inhuman 
police lock-up and to take disciplinary measures against the responsible police officers.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Cell 1  
</i></p>
<p><b>P.D.</b>, aged 17 or 18, student, had been arrested on 25 April and taken to court on 27 April. 
His next hearing would be on 27 May. <b>Max Taki</b>, 22 years, had been arrested on 11 April 
and taken to court on 27 April. His next hearing would also be on 25 May. <b>Hammon 
Wassok</b>, 21 years, had already been detained for six months. All 3 detainees explained that 
they are locked in the cell 24 hours a day, without blankets, although it was very cold at 
night. The cell was infested with mosquitoes, rats and cockroaches. The artificial light was 
on all night. They could not receive family visits, and their families were chased away 
when they brought food.  
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 2 
</i></p>
<p>The detainees had some cartons in the cell and an old bed without a mattress. They 
explained that the roof was leaking, and when it rained, the broken sewage would rise, 
filling the cell with dirty water. <b>Timothy Phieder</b>, aged 29, had been arrested on 11 
January 2010 and was taken to court three times, in March, April and May. On 25 May he 
would be taken to court again. The door to the cell had been open during the previous four 
days, and he was cleaning the lock-up together with the women. <b>Mark Luk</b>, 32 years, had 
surrendered on 21 May. <b>Phil Undaba</b>, aged 37, confirmed that the cell would be filled with 
waste when it rained. None of the three detainees had been beaten in the police station.  
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 6 
</i></p>
<p>There was one detainee held alone in the cell and he appeared to be suffering under a severe 
mental condition. Other detainees reported that the detainee had been in the cell for at least 
three months and received medication every morning. </p>

<p><i>  Cell 7 
</i></p>
<p>There were seven detainees held in Cell 7, including <b>Eron Andrias</b>, aged28, (in the cell for 
two weeks); <b>Mathew</b> <b>Kumin</b>, aged 28 (in the cell for two weeks); <b>Martin Tukre</b>, aged 20 
(in the cell for two weeks); <b>Samuel</b> <b>Kops</b>, aged 30 (in the cell for one day). One detainee 
had been in the cell for six weeks. All of the detainees had been charged, however, none of 
them had a lawyer or legal aid and they had not been seen by a judge. In general, the 
detainees indicated that the police officers were ignorant regarding their requests for 
medical attention. They indicated that their personal belongings had been confiscated upon 
arrival, and they were afraid that they had been taken away for the officers&#8217; personal use. In 
terms of ill-treatment, the detainees reported regular rapes of female detainees by the police 
officers. Furthermore, they reported an incident four weeks prior in which a detainee had 
been beaten by an officer with an axe. Duty officer Gutok was identified as one of the 
harshest officers. 
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 9 
</i></p>
<p><b>Michael, Bob, Kit, Friel, Tom Tango, Bila and S.</b> They complained about the conditions 
in the station, but did not report any physical ill-treatment. They noted that the police raped 
women they brought in for the night and then released them. They complained about the 
light being on all night in the cell. The juveniles shared cells with adult detainees. The last 
time they had been allowed out of the cell was two days prior, for 20 minutes. One detainee 
said that the police sometimes brought young boys to the station for minor offences, and 
used them to clean the corridors.  
</p>
<p><b>H. A.</b>, aged 16, had been held there for three weeks. After his arrest, he spent two days at 
the police station and was then transferred to Bomana Prison, where he had been beaten on 
the legs, arms and back with a piece of timber, for approximately seven minutes. He stayed 
at Bomana for one week and was transferred to Hohola Juvenile Remand Centre. He 
indicated that the Brothers who took care of them were kind and that there was no physical 
abuse or fights between the detainees. 
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 10 
</i></p>
<p>There were five detainees, including one juvenile, <b>J. R. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A detainee</b>, aged 25, had a broken nose and probably broken ribs for the past six days. He 
had been beaten in the streets by the police. The forensic expert examined his broken nose 
through the bars, but was unable to examine his ribs. 
</p>
<p><i>  Cell 11 
</i></p>
<p>The detainees indicated that bribery was common and the fastest way to get out of the 
police station. They added that the guards had sex with the female prisoners.  
</p>
<p><i>  Female section 
</i></p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 38, was accused of stealing. The complainant had taken her to the 
police station at 6 p.m. the day before. She had been questioned and taken to cell 1. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 40, had been arrested three weeks before after her husband&#8217;s 
family took her to the police station. She had to wash the male detainees&#8217; clothes, fetch 
water for them and sweep the bags and bottles with excrement and urine to the dustbin. She 
also helped the male detainees by getting cigarettes, betel nut and other items. She was 
worried about what would happen to the female detainees when they were transferred. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 23, slept in the cell for one night and had been released the next 
morning. She went back to the village and her relatives said they wanted 2,000 Kina to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>repay an offence. She only collected 300 Kina and her husband told the police to re-arrest 
her. She had been taken back to the police station but had not been charged. She asked for 
permission for her family to visit her and bring bedding but it was refused by police. 
</p>
<p><b>A female detainee</b>, aged 19, left her husband and went to her village after arguing with 
him. At Mt. Hagen bus stop, her husband found her and dragged her to the police station. 
The police indicated that because her husband had not paid the bride price she was free to 
go, but the husband insisted that she was still his wife. She asked the police to allow her to 
call her brothers and they refused. She was told to call her father, but she threw the mobile 
phone on the floor and broke it. The owner of the phone asked her to pay for it, and since 
she did not have any money, she was put in the cell for the night. Her family brought her a 
new phone but the police insisted on holding her in the cell and asked that she pay them 
staying in the cell. Her family had promised to come back with the money to have her 
released. 
</p>
<p><b>  Laloki Hospital, Port Moresby 
Visited 24 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was received by Dr. Yamele Getzo, head of the hospital. The 
hospital was the only one for persons with psychiatric problems in the country, and had a 
capacity for 100 patients. The facility also provided general health care services to the 
population living nearby. The facility had an open and a closed wing. Due to the stretched 
capacity of the open wing, some of the patients had been transferred to the closed wing. 
Persons who had committed a crime but were unfit to stand trial were not separated from 
other patients. It was the nursing staff&#8217;s responsibility to ensure the patients&#8217; safety. There 
were no security guards working at the hospital. 
</p>
<p>Built after World War II, the facility was rundown. There was a severe shortage of adequate 
housing for the patients and the staff. Plans for renovation were available and were 
presented to the Special Rapporteur, however, funds for its implementation were lacking. In 
terms of medication, the supplies were outdated. Treatment of mental conditions was 
largely limited to counseling. Most of the patients were young men who suffered from drug 
abuse, but no drug substitutes were provided. There were approximately 80 male patients in 
the clinic, 38 of whom were in the closed station. All the women were in ward No. 6 of the 
General Hospital. There were presently no juveniles there. The staff numbered 
approximately 50, including 20 nurses and health workers. The medical records of the 
patients were very well-kept. The dormitories were in a good state. The closed area was 
star-shaped, with a circular area where the patients were kept during the day, with the 
various dormitories around it. It had daylight and fresh air, and they could look into the 
garden through the bars.  
</p>
<p>According to Dr. Getzo, there were only six psychiatrists in the entire country. Of those, 
only two worked in health care. The two psychiatrists worked at the hospital on a part-time 
basis and came in once per week. Only one of them dealt with forensic psychiatry. De 
facto, the overwhelming majority of the medical work was carried out by the 20 members 
of the nursing staff. The nurses had the responsibility to select those patients who should be 
seen by the psychiatrists, and they eventually decided which patients could be released. On 
average, patients spent four months at the hospital. However, there were several patients 
who had been accommodated in the closed wing for several years. One person had been 
held there for 20 years. </p>

<p><b>  Hohola Juvenile Centre, Port Moresby 
Visited 24 May 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>Brothers Patrick Bokorun and Lazarus Bung of the Sacred Heart Brotherhood received the 
Special Rapporteur. There were five staff members and eight male juveniles in the juvenile 
remand centre. The facility was the only one of its kind in the entire country and could hold 
up to 16 juveniles.  
</p>
<p>The Sacred Heart Brothers also run the SHB Socay Training Institute on the other side of 
the street, an elementary and vocational training centre for street children, ex-criminals and 
detainees. The basic philosophy of the Institute is to &#8220;rebuild broken lives&#8221; and the place 
gives a very good impression. 
</p>
<p>The Brothers assessed that there was a lot of police violence and that they often had to treat 
the new arrivals following heavy beatings by the police. Some of the juveniles arrived at 
the center with cigarette burns and marks from beatings with fan belts, cables, telephone 
wires and cooper wires. If needed, the boys would be taken to the hospital for treatment.  
</p>
<p>Once a juvenile is arrested by the police, the court has to be informed and decides where to 
hold the suspect. Depending on the crime and taking into account the possibility that the 
suspect might abscond, the judge could place a juvenile at the center. If convicted, the boys 
were transferred to a prison for juveniles near Lae. They could stay at the center as long as 
their case was pending, with the longest being 18 months. They juveniles and the officers 
ate their three meals together. It was a friendly place with a nice and well-kept garden. In 
the house, there was one dormitory, with beds, which was not locked. It led to a kitchen 
where they could prepare their own food. They could also go to the garden at any time. 
They received counseling by the center&#8217;s staff, vocational training as well as outside 
schooling. Sports and cultural activities were provided during the weekends. They also had 
books, artwork and handcrafts made by them. Nobody complained about beatings on the 
Hohola Juvenile Centre. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>A male juvenile</b>, aged 17, was arrested in March 2010 at his home. Two police officers 
started beating him on his face with gun butts, in front of two other persons. He spent the 
night in a cell and was beaten for no apparent reason. He was then taken to Bomana 
Correctional Institution for a week. He considered himself very lucky to be at the center, 
since Bomana was very dangerous. They were all friends at Hohola, there were no beatings 
and they had nice Sundays. They cooked, cleaned, did sports and gardening. He wanted to 
become a lawyer. He would not like anything to change there since &#8216;it is all good&#8217;, except 
maybe for the food. 
</p>
<p><b>J.Y.</b>, aged 17, was arrested on 6 February 2010 at a sports centre, by three police officers 
who did not use force as he immediately surrendered and admitted. He was first taken to 
Gerehu Police Station and shortly thereafter to Boroko Police Station, where he was locked 
up for one week and three days in a cell with 30 adults. He was not beaten but he saw 
others being beaten by the police and coming in with swollen faces and other injuries. They 
received three meals per day and enough water. The possibility to take a shower depended 
on the good will of the police officer in charge. He complained about the overcrowding of 
the cells at Boroko and the fact that the judiciary was very slow in handling their cases. 
When the magistrate postponed his hearing, he was sent to Hohola Remand Centre, where 
the conditions were much better. They can receive family visits at any time, the doors were 
open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and they could spend most of their time outside. They also did 
some gardening and attended classes in the adjacent school. Food and water was in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>principle enough, although there was a shortage of food sometimes. In February, a boy had 
escaped but there was no collective punishment. He complains that there were no sport 
facilities and that they would like to get a gym. 
</p>
<p><b>A.I</b>., aged 16. The police took him to Bomana on 4 March. The police came to the village 
chief&#8217;s house and took him with four other suspects from his village. At Bomana, he was 
forced to stand with his arms against the gate, and he was beaten, but only once. On 10 
March, he was sent to Hohola. He had no complaints about Hohola. He could garden, 
including planting food such as bananas. They ate well and his parents visited him before 
his court date. He had a lawyer but he had not been to court.  
</p>
<p><b>J. A., </b>aged 18, from Central Province, was arrested in February 2010 in relation to a killing 
in his village. He was held at Berena Police Station twice before being transferred to the 
courthouse in Port Moresby, where he was charged with murder. He reported that he did 
not understand the documents presented to him during the hearing. His parents had not been 
allowed to be present during the proceedings. After being charged, he was transferred to 
Bomana Prison and held in the adult section, despite being a juvenile at the times. Upon 
arrival, he was strip-searched and beaten several times with a timber stick by the guards. 
After one week at Bomana, he was transferred to the Center. In terms of activities, he 
reported that he mainly made bilums and that currently no sports or schooling activities 
were offered. His parents visited him when he had to go to court. In general, he was very 
happy to be at the Center because the conditions were far better than in Bomana.
