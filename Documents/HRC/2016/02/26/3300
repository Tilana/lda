<p>  Composition of the delegation .........................................................................................................  22 </p>


<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of the Republic of Moldova was held at the 
16th meeting on 12 October. The delegation of the Republic of Moldova was headed by the 
Deputy Minister of Justice, Vladimir Grosu. At its 18th meeting, held on 14 October 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Republic of Moldova: Hungary, 
Kyrgyzstan and Mauritius. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of the Republic of Moldova: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">9. The delegation indicated that human rights activists and international organizations 
working in the human rights field in the region had been operating in a hostile environment 
and under permanent surveillance and pressure from the Transnistrian security services. 
With an interest in the development of civil society in the region, the delegation urged the 
international partners to contribute to the achievement of civil society development in 
Transnistrian region despite of existing difficulties.  
</footnote>/12/MDA/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">8. The delegation mentioned a number of specific human rights issues that the region 
faced: the status of Latin-script schools remained undefined and those schools encountered 
difficulties in their day-to-day operation, and the obstacles created for free movement of 
people and goods between the region and the rest of the country in spite of the requirements 
of international agreements and other decisions regulating the situation in the conflict zone. 
The delegation stated that the current leadership of the region did not provide positive 
response or solutions to the issues raised by the Government. 
</footnote>/12/MDA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">7. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in cooperation with line ministries, had launched 
internal consultations on the issue of lifting territorial reservations under the international 
treaties on human rights. At the same time, the fact that the Transnistrian region had been 
outside the control of the constitutional authorities of the Republic of Moldova made it 
extremely difficult to ensure proper respect of fundamental human rights and freedoms in 
the region. The Government offered, to the extent of its possibilities, assistance to persons 
whose rights were violated.  
</footnote>/12/MDA/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Republic of Moldova through the 
troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation expressed the Government&#8223;s commitment to the universal periodic 
review process. It stated that the process of the preparation of the national report, which 
included the national human rights institutions and stakeholders, gave the country an 
opportunity to assess the human rights situation and would allow creating synergies 
between human rights policies and the lives of people. 
</p>
<p>6. The Republic of Moldova had extended a standing invitation to all mandate holders 
for special procedures. It had been continuously improving the normative and institutional 
framework for the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with the 
international standards, national priorities and aspirations of the European integration. 
Furthermore, the international legal instruments were directly applicable in the national 
legal system. The Government had undertaken measures to ensure respect of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed to its citizens and in particular, it supported 
the existence of a strong, free and independent civil society, including the media. 
</p>
<p>7. Since the formation of the Government two years ago, new initiatives to implement  
the country&#8223;s international human rights obligations had been undertaken. In particular, the 
</p>
<p>European Union (EU)-Moldova dialogue on human rights had been launched and the 
Moldovan experts together with the regional organizations had been discussing the 
priorities for cooperation in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and </p>


<p>democracy. The delegation explained that the perspective of the European integration had 
created a positive environment for the modernization and transformation, with significant 
achievements in the field of human rights. The criminal code and laws on peaceful 
assembly, access to legal assistance, domestic violence, human trafficking, juvenile justice 
and social assistance had each been improved. 
</p>
<p>8. However, a number of challenges and events, including post-election events in April 
2009, tested the national capacities in human rights and supported new proactive 
approaches, especially in improving the implementation of legal norms in this area.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that as human rights were recognized a priority issue, a 
number of policies and programmes were adopted to enhance the human rights protection. 
The National Human Rights Action Plans of the Republic of Moldova for the period of 
2011-2014 which represented the continuity of the previous national action plan included a 
mid-term evaluation of the document to be in line with UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>10. The draft law on preventing and combating discrimination was developed in order to 
strengthen existing rules and create mechanisms for the implementation of the principles of 
non-discrimination and equality. The draft law included, inter alia, an indicative list of 
criteria of discrimination and established a council for preventing and combating 
discrimination.  However, as the consultations over the draft law revealed certain 
sensitivities within the society, the draft was withdrawn from the Parliament for further 
consideration. Following this, the Government embarked on a path of broad consultations 
aimed inter alia at ensuring that the law would be endorsed not only by the Government, 
but also by the entire society. Recently, the draft anti-discrimination law was submitted to 
the public authorities and civil society for coordination and comments before adopting this 
legislative act. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation reported that in March 2011 the Ministry of Justice registered the 
Islamic League of the Republic of Moldova as a religious organization, enabling the 
organization to enjoy the full range of benefits deriving from its legal personality. At the 
same time, extensive consultations with the participation of the civil society and religious 
organizations were launched in order to start the amendment procedure of the existing law 
on the religious organizations. The country visit of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief in September, made a positive contribution to this end. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation reported on the Strategy for Justice Sector Reform for 2011-2016 
which created the institutional framework necessary to coordinate reform in this area and to 
build an accessible, efficient, independent, transparent and professional justice sector. The 
importance of the justice sector reform was also reflected in the new Development Strategy 
&#8220;Moldova 2020&#8221;. The delegation also noted the recently adopted Action Plan to support the 
Roma population for 2011-2015, which contained measures affecting  key areas of social 
life. 
</p>
<p>13. A working group on amending the Ombudsman Law was established to bring the 
existing regulations in compliance with Paris Principles. The Centre for Human Rights of 
Moldova was accredited in 2009 with B status according to the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation noted the recent reform of the prison system which had the following 
major objectives: improving the legal criminal-executive framework, improving conditions 
of detention in accordance with international standards, increasing transparency in 
detention institutions and preventing torture and cases of ill-treatment, and building 
capacity of prison staff.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation informed that the Republic of Moldova would start the ratification 
process of the Protocol 12 to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  </p>
<p>after the adoption of the legal framework on anti-discrimination. With regard to the </p>


<p>(lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issue, the delegation noted that 
homosexuality was no longer criminalized in the domestic legislation. However, the LGBT 
issue remained a sensitive topic with important cultural and religious implications and thus, 
a gradual approach, one that would strike a fair balance between the rights of all citizens 
and the particularities of the society would be adopted. 
</p>
<p>16. Human rights in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova represent a 
priority for the Government. Specialized ministries and institutions continued to follow up 
on the developments in the human rights field in the Eastern districts and provided with 
assistance to the population within their competences and possibilities. The current 
situation in the region created serious obstacles and difficulties in the enforcement of 
human rights throughout the country. The delegation noted that addressing human rights 
issues in this region did not rest exclusively with the Government and it should be part of 
discussions with the international partners involved in the settlement process. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the interactive dialogue, 37 delegations made statements. A number of 
countries welcomed the open and constructive participation of the Republic of Moldova in 
the universal periodic review. Several delegations thanked the Government for preparing a 
comprehensive national report for the UPR and expressed satisfaction at the involvement of 
civil society in the preparation of the national report. Recommendations made during the 
dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>18. Algeria noted that the institutional framework for the promotion and protection of 
human rights had been constantly improved. It welcomed the inclusion of Muslim religion 
into the national register of religious beliefs and inquired about the follow-up to the 
recommendation made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief 
regarding the formulation of a law against discrimination and investment in civic education. 
Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>19. Thailand commended the Republic of Moldova for its commitment to protecting 
human rights, especially in the areas of anti-discrimination, rights of minorities and human 
rights education through &#8220;Civic Education&#8221;. It also welcomed the dialogue with special-
procedures mandate holders. Relating to the issue of combating human trafficking, 
Thailand would be interested in exchanging views on assistance and protection to victims 
of trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Brazil noted with interest the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s cooperation with international 
human rights mechanisms. It commended the enactment of a law to prevent and combat 
domestic violence and the draft framework for the rehabilitation of victims. It referred to 
the programmes for social integration and political participation of ethnic minorities. Brazil 
was concerned at reports of discrimination, including anti-Semitism, and noted decreasing 
school enrolment rates. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. France noted that the Republic of Moldova did not have a law to combat and prevent 
discrimination. It referred to reports that ill-treatment during custody and pretrial detention 
had not disappeared and that there were no credible investigations on torture perpetrated by 
the police and penitentiary staff. France wished to know about planned improvements to 
juvenile justice. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Austria commended the Republic of Moldova for its cooperation with the special 
procedures and treaty bodies. Austria wanted to know about the efforts to overcome the 
obstacles for the prosecution of trafficking cases and what measures had been taken to 
tackle discrimination. Finally, it asked how the Government was addressing the alleged </p>


<p>cases of torture perpetrated in police custody and by members of the armed forces. Austria 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>23. The Russian Federation stated that poverty, unemployment and the absence of social 
protection for vulnerable groups of the population were a reality in the Republic of 
Moldova. Of special concern were the restrictions on the rights of ethnic minorities to use 
their mother tongue. The authorities were attempting to limit the use of the Russian 
language in all spheres of life. Over the last two years, a number of schools teaching 
Russian were closed and Russian studies were removed from higher education. The Russian 
Federation made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Nepal commended the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s improvements to the human rights 
normative and institutional framework, including through the National Action Plan on 
Human Rights 2011-2013. Nepal noted the Government&#8223;s initiatives in ensuing gender 
equality, preventing and combating violence against women and guaranteeing the rights of 
the child, electoral rights and the rights of persons with disabilities. The Republic of 
Moldova had made remarkable progress towards institutionalizing democracy. Nepal made 
three recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Canada noted remaining challenges in combating human trafficking and 
discrimination, particularly against the Roma. Canada encouraged the Republic of Moldova 
to continue pursuing reforms relating to the protection of religious minorities, gender 
equality, liberty and security of the person and administration of justice, including impunity 
and the rule of law. Canada was concerned at the numerous allegations of ill-treatment of 
arrested and detained persons by security forces in Transnistria and the excessive control 
exercised by the Transnistrian authorities over the media and civil society. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Bulgaria commended the Government for the elaboration of the second National 
Human Rights Action Plan 2011-2014 and looked forward to its implementation. It noted 
with satisfaction the stated policy on non-discrimination, as well as the respect enjoyed by 
minorities. Bulgaria requested to be further informed about progress in the area of 
education and the measures to safeguard the right to choose the language of education. It 
asked about the reform of National Public Broadcasting Company. Bulgaria made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>27. Estonia commended the Republic of Moldova for the increased efforts to protect 
children&#8223;s rights by establishing the Ombudsman for Children, implementing the National 
Plan of Action on Protecting Children without Parental Care, reforming the juvenile justice 
system by introducing alternatives to detention and providing access to basic education to 
all children by 2015. Moldova was commended for being increasingly attentive to the 
issues of gender equality and non-discrimination and for recent efforts to improve freedom 
of expression. Estonia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>28. China commended the efforts of the Republic of Moldova in addressing human 
trafficking, in the progress made on gender equality, and in protection of the rights of 
women and children as well as of minorities.  China noted with appreciation that Moldova 
had made the implementation of its strategy of social integration for persons with disability 
2011-2013 a national priority. China encouraged the Republic of Moldova to further the 
measures to protect the equal rights of Roma and other minorities.    
</p>
<p>29. Qatar stated that the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s Constitution gave priority to human 
rights and that human rights were at the heart of public policy. Despite the fact that the 
Republic of Moldova was going through a period of transition, as well as serious economic 
problems, there was progress in the sphere of human rights, which demonstrated Moldova 
commitment to improving the human rights situation. Qatar welcomed Moldova&#8223;s efforts in </p>


<p>the area of human trafficking and the invitation it extended to the Special Rapporteur on 
human trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Poland expressed appreciation for the efforts made by the Republic of Moldova in  
strengthening the human rights protection system. Poland welcomed Moldova&#8223;s recent 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Poland took account of 
positive developments, noted problems and stressed the need for further advancement in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Norway referred to reports that journalists still faced a difficult situation and that 
freedom of expression was still not fully in place and self-censorship was common. Norway 
noted that trafficking in human beings was reported to be higher in the Republic of 
Moldova than other places in Europe. Norway referred to the reported documentation of 
violence and even torture of prisoners in Moldovan jails, to the reportedly high level of 
domestic violence against women and to women earning only three-quarters of men&#8223;s 
wages for the same work. Norway made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Australia commended the Republic of Moldova for the efforts to increase public 
awareness of domestic violence and the instructions given to public and law enforcement 
officials on addressing this problem, but expressed concern that the legal remedies for 
domestic violence were limited to fines and brief detentions. It welcomed the improvement 
in prison conditions the reduction of time of pretrial detentions and stated that prisons and 
pretrial facilities fell short of international standards. Australia urged the Republic of 
Moldova to encourage respect for people of all sexual orientations. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Greece noted the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s cooperation with treaty body and special 
procedures. Greece welcomed the efforts by the Government to promote gender equality 
and asked about any further measures intended to combat higher levels of unemployment of 
women and lower paid jobs filled by women. Greece welcomed the establishment of the 
Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child and asked how Moldova intended to address its 
lack of adequate funding in the current financial crisis. Greece made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>34. Italy stated that it would continue to support the ongoing process of reform in the 
Republic of Moldova and the strengthening of its relations with the European Union. Italy 
noted that domestic violence against women was a serious problem. The lack of proper 
facilities hampered access to education for children with disabilities, leading to their limited 
participation in social life. Italy welcomed Moldova&#8223;s ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its strategy for social inclusion for 2010-2013. Italy 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>35. Germany expressed concern about the allegations of torture and ill-treatment in 
police custody. During post-election demonstrations in April 2009, law enforcement 
officers reacted with excessive force with acts of violence and ill-treatment of about 300 
arrested persons and three unresolved deaths, which resulted in only a handful of 
prosecutions.  While commending the Republic of Moldova for its judicial reforms, 
Germany stated that there remained widespread corruption among judges, prosecutors and 
police officers. Media organizations that denounced this corruption were intimidated and 
silenced by disproportionately high fines. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Turkey welcomed the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s zero-tolerance regarding torture and 
encouraged the more effective implementation and strengthening of related legislation. 
Turkey noted the link between the two countries through the Gagaouz community. Turkey 
stressed that the problem of Transnistria region should not erode the existing autonomous 
status of Gagauzia. Turkey encouraged the Republic of Moldova to pay special attention to 
the development of the Autonomous Territorial Unit of &#8220;Gagauz-Yeri&#8221; as well as its 
language and heritage. Turkey made a recommendation.  </p>


<p>37. Romania noted the Government&#8223;s successful organization of elections in 2010 and 
2011.  Romania referred to the comprehensive legal and institutional framework for the 
protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, including ensuring 
teaching of and in minorities&#8223; languages. However, knowledge of the State language was 
</p>
<p>problematic among certain sectors of society. Romania encouraged the Republic of 
Moldova to enhance the capacity of the Centre for Human Rights. Romania made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. Argentina welcomed the amendments that were introduced in the legislation with 
regard to the combating of domestic violence. It also welcomed the Government&#8223;s 
establishment of an ombudsman dedicated to the defence of the rights of children. 
Argentina made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland strongly supported the 
Republic of Moldova&#8223;s efforts to create a viable mechanism for reinforcing the principles of 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination, universality and equality of human rights. It welcomed the positive 
assessment of recent elections and acknowledged the ongoing liberalization of the media, 
while noting the challenges related to freedom of expression. It recognized the positive step 
being taken to eliminate torture.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Hungary noted with satisfaction the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s standing invitation to 
special procedures, its ratification of almost all core international human rights treaties and 
institutions with a human rights protection mandate. Hungary remained concerned about 
the representation of women in public life and employment and welcomed the enactment of 
the law on preventing and combating domestic violence. Hungary noted that conditions in 
many prisons and detention facilities were far from ideal. Hungary made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Sweden noted that following a debate in Parliament, the anti-discrimination bill was 
withdrawn. The contentious issue related to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people. The adoption of the bill was crucial to the visa liberalization process, as 
well as to protect groups and individuals who were discriminated against. The level of 
domestic violence was high. No one was brought to justice for the events of April 2009 
were individuals were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by the police. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Uruguay noted the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s amendment to the Criminal Code 
establishing domestic violence as a criminal offence and that there was insufficient 
enforcement of these new provisions. Uruguay was concerned that the principle of non-
discrimination was not always fully respected for children from disadvantaged families, 
children with disabilities, children with HIV/AIDS and children from ethnic groups, 
especially Roma children who were victims of discrimination and had limited access to 
education, health and an adequate standard of living. Uruguay made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Slovenia welcomed the efforts to protect children through the establishment of the 
Ombudsman for the rights of the child, but was concerned by reports of corporal 
punishment. It noted with appreciation the measures taken to ensure respect for the identity 
of persons from national minorities.  Slovenia enquired about the steps taken to improve the 
implementation of the Action Plan for Roma for 2007-2010 and about the implementation 
of this plan for 2011 to 2015.  Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>45. Latvia stated that promotion and protection of human rights and freedoms was a 
priority for the Republic of Moldova, as confirmed in the Government&#8223;s policies and the 
</p>
<p>framework programme of the National Human Rights Action Plan. It acknowledged that 
many challenges remained, but that measures for further improvements were already 
envisaged. Latvia welcomed the decision of the Republic of Moldova to extend a standing 
invitation to all special procedures. It noted the Government&#8223;s commitment to combat 
human trafficking. Latvia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>46. Mexico acknowledged the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s progress in ratifying and acceding 
to international and regional human rights instruments. Mexico congratulated the Republic 
of Moldova for its adoption of the National Action Plan on Human Rights and hoped that 
its implementation would contribute to the full enjoyment of human rights in the country. 
Mexico was pleased that the Republic of Moldova had extended a standing invitation to 
special procedures. Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. Slovakia stated that the Republic of Moldova has made remarkable progress in 
advancing its human rights record and took positive note of the appointment of four 
ombudspersons. It indicated that the second National Human Rights Action Plan for 2011-
2014 as well as the national plans on migration and asylum, prevention and combating 
trafficking in human beings and domestic violence, and the national programme on gender 
equality were steps in the right direction.  Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. The United States of America commended the Republic of Moldova&#8223;s participation 
in the &#8220;Democracy Partnership Challenge&#8221;, its cooperation with non-governmental 
organizations to combat human trafficking and its decision to register a Muslim religious 
group. It was concerned about the rule of law and the need to ensure justice for individuals 
abused by security forces and reported trafficking-related judicial corruption. It expressed 
concern about discrimination against and police harassment of LGBT persons. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>49. The Democratic Republic of Congo welcomed the establishment of the Ombudsman 
on the rights of the child as well as the inter-ministerial committee on gender equality.  It 
also stated that the political integration of ethnic minorities was of importance for national 
cohesion. In this regard, the situation of Roma deserved further attention. It was concerned 
about human rights violations, particularly in the Transnistra region. It made a 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p>50. Azerbaijan stated that the national priorities and initiatives mentioned in the national 
report would pave the way to overcoming challenges in the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It noted with interest, the appointment of the ombudsman for children. 
Azerbaijan asked about the measures taken by the Government for the implementation of 
strategies for human rights education.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Ukraine commended the National Human Rights Action Plan and the establishment 
of the Centre for Human Rights of the Republic of Moldova. Ukraine encouraged the 
Republic of Moldova to take further measures to realize women&#8223;s equality in all areas, 
</p>
<p>addressing the root causes of domestic violence, especially related to children. Ukraine 
hoped that technical assistance from the United Nations and non-governmental 
organizations would help the Republic of Moldova to achieve concrete results in the afore-
mentioned areas.  Ukraine made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>52. Morocco commended the progress made by the Republic of Moldova in legislation 
and institution development and noted existing challenges for different Ombudsmen in 
fulfilling their mandate. Morocco expressed its appreciation that Moldova had recognized 
Islam as one of the official religions of the country. Morocco shared the view that 
secessionism constituted an obstacle for the promotion and protection of human rights, </p>


<p>therefore it was important to respect national unity and territorial integrity of States.  
Morocco made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Israel welcomed the second National Human Rights Action Plan for 2011-2014. 
Despite the serious economic and social challenges, Moldova has sought to ensure that 
national legislation granted its citizens access to their fundamental rights and freedoms. 
Israel commended the Republic of Moldova for its recent ratification of the United 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Israel made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>54. Mauritius welcomed the progress made by the Republic of Moldova in the area of 
human rights, and that, despite its sometimes complex and painful history, the acceptance 
of diversity and openness has been a constant factor.  Mauritius suggested that as Moldova 
was a small country with few natural resources investing in human capital was in the 
country&#8223;s interest. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the questions on the issue of effectiveness and transparency of judiciary, 
the delegation stated that while being fully aware of the challenges in this area, the 
Government had initiated the relevant measures to address those challenges by, inter alia, 
the adoption of the strategy of reform of the judiciary. The plan of action had been in the 
process of the development based on the Strategy which would assist to adopt and improve 
relevant laws in line with the European and international standards. 
</p>
<p>56. In respect to questions on the human rights violations during the events of April 
2009, the delegation informed that about half of the complaints submitted to the Prosecutor 
office by the victims had been under the investigation and 27 cases were already referred to 
the judiciary. The court judgements were issued in respect to two cases. As to the eight  
judgements rendered by the European Court of Human Rights regarding human rights 
violations of the April events, the Government had provided with compensations to the 
victims. 
</p>
<p>57. In the context of implementation of the prison reform, the Government was in the 
process of identifying solutions for building adequate detention facilities. In particular, a 
new prison would be built to replace prison No. 13 in Chisinau as a main priority. In this 
respect, the Government appealed to the Council of Europe Development Bank to secure 
the relevant funding.  A number of other initiatives had been also launched to improve 
conditions in prisons, including renovation of sanitary facilities and medical units as well as 
the section of juvenile detainees in the prison No. 13. 
</p>
<p>58. In respect to the questions on human trafficking, the delegation reported that the 
number of identified victims had reportedly decreased greatly compared to 2007.  Moldova 
was no longer a major source country for human trafficking. Nevertheless, the Government 
continued to intensify its counter-trafficking programmes. The National Referral System 
with a nationwide coverage included multi-disciplinary professional education for law 
enforcement officials, social and medical personnel. It was based on the &quot;active prevention&quot; 
approach and become a best practice in the region.  
</p>
<p>59. The Government had launched a programme to provide life-skills training to 
children in institutions who were considered to be more vulnerable to human trafficking.  A 
new monitoring mechanism over the activities of law enforcement agencies and judiciary 
was in the process of formation to improve the prosecution and punishment of trafficking. 
The delegation informed about the invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur on human 
trafficking to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>60. The Ministry of Education launched a programme, &#8220;Friendly schools for all&#8221;, in 
2010, with a view to creating an environment favourable for the development of mutual 
respect and tolerance and free from violence and all forms of discriminations on the 
grounds of sex, ethnicity or health status.  In 2011, the Government also approved the </p>


<p>programme on inclusive education with the objective of creating conditions for the 
inclusion of children who had not been in public school system as well as those studying in 
regular schools but in need of special education.  
</p>
<p>61. As shaping the existing traditions was required along with the development of legal 
framework to address the issue of child labour, the Government approved the National Plan 
for Combating the Child Labour and Exploitation to inter alia raise public awareness on the 
issue of child labour. The Government had also adopted the National Strategy to reform the 
residential care system and increased the State funding for this purpose. The number of 
children in the institutions had decreased by 40 per cent.  At the same time, a large number 
of children remained without parental care as a result of migration of the population abroad 
in a search for jobs. To this end, the Government had started a nationwide study to assess 
and address the needs of such children. 
</p>
<p>62. To address a question on the status and use of the Russian language, the delegation 
stated that the legal framework, and specifically the law regarding the functioning of 
spoken languages on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, required the creation of the 
necessary conditions to guarantee access to education in Russian, Gagauz, Ukrainian, 
Bulgarian and other languages. Students were entitled with the right to choose the language 
of instruction at any level of education. Furthermore, the Russian language was legally 
recognized as a language of interethnic communication. There was a mandatory subject on 
Russian language and literature in the schools with education in the Romanian language. 
Domestic legislation and official communications were available in the Russian language. 
Every citizen had a right to request and to receive information from the public authorities in 
the State language or Russian. 
</p>
<p>63. Regarding to the issue of schools with education in Russian, the delegation reported 
that there were 280 Russian-language schools functioning nationwide. The information 
about the closure of 60 Russian schools in the past two years was incorrect.  In the past 
years, only 14 of the 70 educational institutions which were reorganized or simply merged 
with others, were Russian-language schools. The delegation suggested that the decrease in 
the number of such schools should be explained keeping in mind the general demographic 
trend of the population and restructuring of the education system.  
</p>
<p>64. The delegation reported on a number of steps undertaken by the Government to 
ensure gender equality in line with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, including training conducted for the gender focal points of all 
State agencies, the inclusion of special chapters on gender equality in the State Programme 
and Action Plan, and gender mainstreaming in the draft development strategy &#8222;Moldova 
</p>
<p>2020&#8223;. It also mentioned that a recommendation on temporary special measures was 
</p>
<p>initiated before the Parliament to introduce a 30 per cent quota in the election of the 
members of the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>65. Regarding the issue of domestic violence, the Government had co-sponsored several 
shelters for victims countrywide. The National Bureau of Statistics adopted a special 
module to its periodic surveys to track in official data incidence, frequency and profile of 
domestic violence. Additionally, Moldova, in 2010 recognized domestic violence as a 
criminal offence. The relevant legal provisions provided a definition and a mechanism for 
the enforcement including the mechanism for the protection orders. In less than two years,  
about 200 protection orders were enforced in respect to cases of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>66. As the human rights situation in the Transnistrian region had been a source of 
serious concern, the Government had been monitoring the violations of human rights in the 
region. In this respect, the Government had regularly raised the cases of human rights 
violations before the relevant international actors and also sought for the cooperation with </p>


<p>the representatives of the civil society and mass media in order to improve the human rights 
situation in the region.
