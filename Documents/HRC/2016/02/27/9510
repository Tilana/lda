<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General has submitted to the Commission on Human Rights an annual 
report on technical cooperation in the field of human rights, reflecting the discussions at the 
meetings of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field 
of Human Rights.  The Commission, in its last resolution on the subject, resolution 2004/81, 
requested the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary administrative assistance to 
the Board of Trustees, to arrange meetings of the Board and to ensure that its conclusions are 
reflected in the annual report to the Commission on technical cooperation in the field of human 
rights.  The Secretary-General was requested to submit a further analytical report to the 
Commission at its sixty-second session on the progress and concrete achievements made, as well 
as obstacles encountered in the implementation of the programme of advisory services and 
technical cooperation in the field of human rights and on the operation and administration of 
the Voluntary Fund.  Such an analytical report has been submitted (E/CN.4/2006/104).  
Subsequently, the Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested<b> </b>the Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of their activities, 
in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies.  The present report is submitted in this context as an 
update of document E/CN.4/2006/104, focusing on the work of the Board of Trustees of the 
Voluntary Fund. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE VOLUNTARY FUND 
</b></p>
<p>2. Members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Secretary-General to advise the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on streamlining and rationalizing 
the working methods and procedures of the Office&#8217;s technical cooperation programme.  The 
Board has moved away from reviewing individual projects to advising the Office on policy 
orientation, global vision and strategy at a broader programme level.  The evolution of the role 
played by the Board has been appreciated by the Office, which benefits greatly from the 
experience and wisdom of the Board, particularly during the recent time of reform within the 
United Nations and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>3. The Board holds its meetings twice a year.  The twenty-fifth session took place at the 
Palais des Nations in Geneva from 7 to 10 November 2006.  During this session, the Board of 
Trustees held a joint seminar on 9 and 10 November with members of treaty bodies, 
representatives of United Nations agencies and programmes and OHCHR heads of field 
presences on the recommendations of United Nations treaty bodies (see section VII below).  
The Board also participated in some of the OHCHR regional consultations with heads of field 
presence. 
</p>
<p>4. At the end of each session, the Board meets with Member States in order to brief them 
on its work and exchange views on issues of common interest and relevance to the technical 
cooperation programme.  At the end of the twenty-fifth session in November 2006, owing to the 
holding of the joint seminar on recommendations of United Nations treaty bodies, the Board was 
not able to maintain its tradition of meeting Member States.  It hopes that the present report will 
help keep Member States informed of the Board&#8217;s work. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. At the twenty-fifth session, the Board welcomed two new members:  Monica Pinto 
(Argentina) and William A. Schabas (Canada).  Mary Chinery-Hesse (Ghana) was elected as 
the Chairperson of the Board.  The other members are Vitit Muntarbhorn (Thailand) and 
Viacheslav Bakhmin (Russian Federation).  The following reflects the discussions of the Board 
of Trustees at the twenty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b>III. UPDATE ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE OFFICE OF 
THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>6. The High Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan 2006-2007 (SMP) and the 
May 2005 Plan of Action have set the direction and priorities for the current biennium and 
beyond.  The Board of Trustees joined OHCHR field colleagues at the Africa regional 
consultations for a discussion on progress to date, problems encountered, and next steps in the 
implementation of SMP and the Plan of Action.  Colleagues from the field pointed to the 
challenge of measuring and analysing the impact of human rights work.  It was pointed out that 
work on indicators was work-in-progress at the Office and was particularly challenging for the 
first SMP, where baseline benchmarks would have to be established. 
</p>
<p>7. The OHCHR mid-year review had focused on the implementation of the major tasks 
under each of the five focus areas of SMP (country engagement, leadership, partnership, 
United Nations human rights bodies, and management and planning) as well as the recruitment 
process and financial situation.  While concrete progress has been made in each of these areas, 
challenges would have to be overcome to achieve the objective of SMP 2006-2007, that is, to 
help bridge gaps in implementation (knowledge, capacity, commitment and security) at the 
national level.  Major challenges ahead included ensuring a single approach by the Office to 
common priorities and enhancing thematic expertise in a sustainable and field-oriented way.  
The end-of-the-year review would provide another opportunity to look comprehensively at 
progress made and measures required to achieve the stated objective.  A report on the 
implementation of SMP during 2006 would then be published. 
</p>
<p>8. The Board joined the concluding meeting of the regional consultations of the European, 
North American and Central Asian region.  Rapporteurs of the meeting reported on the 
discussions held on the operation of regional offices, the review of country assessment 
development, and a broad outline of a strategy for 2008-2009.  The Board supported the vision 
of the Office that after the 2006-2007 expansion period, OHCHR would see the next biennium 
(2008-2009) focusing on consolidation and follow-through on key initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT, INCLUDING CRITERIA FOR VARIOUS 
FORMS OF FIELD PRESENCES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 
TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROGRAMME 
</b></p>
<p>9. Country engagement was one of the five focus areas of the Plan of Action.  The purpose 
of country engagement was to analyse the obstacles standing in the way of the implementation 
of human rights and work towards overcoming them.  The Board of Trustees discussed the 
concept of country engagement and progress made to date since the launch of the Plan of Action 
in May 2005. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. Country engagement entailed a process of country assessments and the development of 
strategies that aimed to harness knowledge and expertise from all parts of the Office.  This 
process offered a framework of a holistic and sustained engagement at the country level.  The 
Board discussed the nature of the country assessments and their possible relationship with the 
upcoming process of the universal periodic review.  The Board noted that part of the country 
assessment originating from the work of treaty bodies and special procedures would remain 
public information, while part of the assessment should be for internal purposes.  In that regard, 
the Board was pleased to learn that OHCHR had been working on compiling all country-related 
information and making it available on the Office&#8217;s website. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to the universal periodic review, the formalities were being discussed in 
intergovernmental settings in the context of the Human Rights Council.  The Board discussed the 
challenges as well as the opportunities of such a universal review system, which was seen as a 
major development in the United Nations human rights machinery.  The Board noted that the 
High Commissioner had set clear strategies, including through country engagement, in the Plan 
of Action in response to the challenge of filling implementation gaps.  The Board was informed 
that there had been discussions regarding the possible setting up of an ad hoc fund for universal 
periodic review follow-up. 
</p>
<p>12. OHCHR country engagement concerned all countries and employed a range of tools at its 
disposal on the basis of a strategic assessment.  The Board pointed out the importance of the 
early warning function of the country assessment tool in order to avoid engagement only in 
trouble spots.  The Board also noted the need to ensure that the Office had adequate capacity to 
play a meaningful role vis-&#224;-vis the Security Council. 
</p>
<p>13. Being present in different regions and countries, with staff having the requisite expertise, 
local knowledge and language, had been recognized as the preferred means of undertaking 
human rights work for the United Nations.  Current OHCHR field deployment took the form of 
regional offices, country offices, support for peace missions, and the assignment of human rights 
advisers to United Nations country teams.  When it came to the technical cooperation 
programme, experience had shown that OHCHR projects were most effective when the Office is 
present in the country, and with sufficient staff, and where the project formed part of a strategy 
of long-term engagement agreed upon by the Government and involving a full programme of 
OHCHR work.  The Board reiterated the vision that technical cooperation projects must form an 
integral part of an overall country engagement strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>V. THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE VOLUNTARY FUND AND 
ITS FUNCTIONING IN THE OVERALL FUNDING SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>14. As of 26 December 2006, the financial situation of the Voluntary Fund was as follows:  
total income of some US$ 13.7 million and some US$ 8 million in expenditure and commitment.  
The estimated fund balance was some US$ 5.7 million.  More detailed information on income 
and expenditure is to be found in the annex. 
</p>
<p>15. At its twenty-fifth session, the Board discussed the issue of &#8220;carry over&#8221; and the problem 
of  cash flow.  Early in the year, it was not always possible to have adequate funds to cover 
contracts and activities, owing to reasons relating to earmarking and unpaid pledges.  An </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>adequate amount of carry over was therefore necessary to allow a proper start-up of activities.  
The Board considered that if the reasons for this carry-over need were not made clear, there 
could be adverse effects on further contributions. 
</p>
<p>16. With the Plan of Action and SMP, OHCHR was taking a holistic approach, aiming at 
long-term engagement and the exercise of the full mandate of the High Commissioner.  The 
overall policy of the Office was therefore to encourage unearmarked contributions.  More and 
more contributions were being made in this way. 
</p>
<p>17. The Board recalled that it had taken a deliberate decision to switch from the 
consideration of individual projects to a strategic vision at the programme level.  However, the 
Board considered it important to have more detailed discussions at its future sessions on the 
functioning of the Voluntary Fund and the overall picture of the Office&#8217;s arrangements for 
voluntary contributions.  The Programme Support and Management Services had agreed to 
provide more detailed information on the allocations of the Voluntary Fund to facilitate further 
discussions by the Board. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. OHCHR STRATEGY ON POVERTY REDUCTION 
AND THE WORLD BANK 
</b></p>
<p>18. OHCHR is increasingly working on the issue of poverty with energy and leadership.  
That was one of the key challenges identified in the Plan of Action and strongly stressed in the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s address to the Human Rights Council.  The theme of Human Rights 
Day 2006 was &#8220;Fighting poverty, a matter of obligation, not charity&#8221;.  Progress had been made in 
changing the mindset and further tools would need to be developed to sustain the momentum. 
</p>
<p>19. The Board engaged with OHCHR colleagues in discussing the Office&#8217;s strategy on 
poverty reduction and engagement with the World Bank.  Board members were pleased to see 
the leadership role played by the High Commissioner and expressed their encouragement to her 
in this important undertaking.  It welcomed the Office&#8217;s initiative to define a clearer strategy 
and entry points for OHCHR in the field of poverty reduction.  The Board also welcomed 
engagement by OHCHR with the World Bank, recognizing that at times tensions might arise 
when the Office needed to be critical in its engagement. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board further noted the &#8220;inreach&#8221; on these issues within OHCHR headquarters as 
part of a &#8220;mindset change&#8221;.  It was comparatively easy for colleagues in the field to identify with 
social, economic and cultural rights issues and problems of poverty, as those were the issues 
facing their realities.  In-house training and development of tools would be necessary in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>21. Board members emphasized the indivisibility of civil and political rights and social, 
economic and cultural rights, in theory and practice.  There were no necessary trade-offs between 
them.  Beyond justiciability, this was very much a question of public policy, public action and 
public response.  Progress indicators were important to ensure that States did take steps to act 
and that duty-bearers were held accountable. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. The Board also enquired about engagement with IMF and was briefed on the related 
work on the follow-up to the Plan of Action in the area of building partnerships.  Currently, the 
Office was focusing on engagement with the World Bank. 
</p>
<p><b>VII. UPDATE ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN 
THE UNITED NATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Board had been following the United Nations reform initiatives with keen interest 
and advising the Office on the implications for the technical cooperation programme.  At its 
twenty-fifth session, it reviewed recent developments in the United Nations, including with 
regard to the Human Rights Council, the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence, the 
Peacebuilding Commission and the United Nations Democracy Fund. 
</p>
<p>24. The Board was particularly interested in the developments around the Human Rights 
Council, including the discussion on the universal periodic review mechanism and its normative 
basis and resource implications.  The Board pointed out the value of the achievements made over 
the last 60 years in the field of human rights.  The Human Rights Council should be seen as an 
integral part of the larger United Nations machinery that included the General Assembly, the 
Security Council, the Peacebuilding Commission and other bodies. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence, a stronger focus on 
mainstreaming human rights in development activities was advocated.  OHCHR was called upon 
to serve as a centre of excellence, providing normative support to countries, and the role of the 
resident coordinator would be strengthened.  The Board was pleased to learn that terms of 
reference for resident coordinators were currently being revised to include human rights and that 
an induction programme for resident coordinators was being prepared.  The Board stressed that 
the time had come to turn rhetoric into action.  The accountability of resident coordinators was of 
key importance.  Training, involvement in the selection process, and the development of tools 
were concrete steps to be taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII. SEMINAR ON RECOMMENDATIONS OF 
UNITED NATIONS TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Board of Trustees had in recent years held discussions with human rights treaty 
bodies, through the meetings of chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies and the 
inter-committee meetings of human rights treaty bodies, on the implementation of 
recommendations of treaty bodies at the national level.  United Nations specialized agencies, 
funds and programmes had sought guidance on how their input into the treaty body system could 
result in the formulation of more concrete and implementable recommendations.  They had also 
sought guidance on how they could assist at the operational level in the implementation of 
recommendations contained in concluding observations.  Treaty bodies had also called on the 
specialized agencies, funds and programmes to assist them in their monitoring role and to 
support implementation of their recommendations.  The seventeenth meeting of chairpersons of 
human rights treaty bodies held in June 2005 recommended the organization of a seminar for 
treaty body members, members of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Technical Cooperation, United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes and, if 
possible, representatives of United Nations field presences to discuss the format and substance of 
concluding observations and their implementation at the national level. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. Such a seminar took place during the twenty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees, on 9 
and 10 November.  The seminar represented the first opportunity for some of the key actors to 
gather together for a focused discussion.  In addition to all the members of the Board, treaty body 
members from the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the 
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, as well as representatives from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), UNAIDS, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, and OHCHR 
staff from the field participated actively in the discussion. 
</p>
<p>28. Colleagues from specialized agencies and programmes shared their various experiences 
in relation to the different aspects of treaty body work, in particular the formulation and 
implementation of treaty body recommendations.  Several OHCHR field case studies from 
different regions were presented.  It was clearly demonstrated that the quality of 
recommendations made by treaty bodies was directly linked to the input received from actors 
at the national level.  In addition to reports from Governments, contributions from national 
NGOs, OHCHR field presences where they existed, and United Nations agencies and 
programmes were essential to assist treaty bodies to make relevant and constructively critical 
commentaries.  Such contributions from the field could be made even more systematic. 
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, OHCHR had an important role in providing training, awareness-raising 
and other capacity-building activities for a range of concerned actors at the national level, 
including parliaments, which performed a key function regarding the implementation of 
recommendations of United Nations treaty bodies.  Some countries now had a large body of 
recommendations before them awaiting implementation.  OHCHR, working together with NGOs 
and United Nations country teams, should help process the recommendations in order to 
facilitate their implementation based on clearly identified priorities.  There was also a need to 
make United Nations human rights treaty body work better known to the general public in many 
countries.  Country visits by treaty body members, when they took place, were considered useful 
in raising the awareness of treaty body work at the national level as well as in enabling treaty 
bodies to raise the most relevant questions. 
</p>
<p>30. As United Nations expert bodies, human rights treaty bodies brought legitimacy and 
weight at the national level.  The output of treaty body work served as a valuable framework 
and as entry points for OHCHR engagement with countries.  It also served as a useful tool for 
United Nations agencies and programmes in furthering countries&#8217; development objectives.  
Concluding observations and recommendations of human rights treaty bodies should be 
systematically considered and integrated into analyses by United Nations agencies and 
programmes when establishing policy and programmatic strategies. 
</p>
<p>31. Participants at the seminar welcomed the opportunity for a focused discussion among 
relevant partners.  They considered that further follow-up meetings, involving government 
representatives, would be most useful. </p>
