<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, as well as other pertinent human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>resolutions 2002/26 of 22 April 2002, 2003/26 of 22 April 2003, 
</p>
<p>2004/20 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/20 of 14 April 2005 of the former Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that numerous declarations within the United Nations system promote 
</p>
<p>respect for cultural diversity, as well as for international cultural cooperation, in 
</p>
<p>particular the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Cooperation and 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted by its General Conference in 1966 and 
</p>
<p>2001 respectively, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the Tehran Declaration and Programme of Action on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and Cultural Diversity adopted at the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned 
</p>
<p>Movement on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, held in Tehran, Islamic Republic 
</p>
<p>of Iran, on 3 and 4 September 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the entry into force on 18 March 2007 of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, adopted by the 
</p>
<p>General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization on 20 October 2005, </p>

<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance of the promotion of the cultural rights of everyone 
</p>
<p>and of respect for cultural diversity, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that international cooperation in promoting and encouraging 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all should be based on an 
</p>
<p>understanding of the economic, social and cultural specificities of each country and on 
</p>
<p>the full realization and recognition of the universality of all human rights and the 
</p>
<p>principles of freedom, justice, equality and non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, 
</p>
<p>which are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interdependent; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the promotion of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone 
</p>
<p>and respect for different cultural identities (E/CN.4/2006/40); 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its appreciation</i> to States and intergovernmental and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations that responded to or participated in the consultations held 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2002/26 of 22 April 2002, 
</p>
<p>2003/26 of 22 April 2003, 2004/20 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/20 of 14 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the establishment of a thematic procedure in the field of 
</p>
<p>cultural rights should not develop a new monitoring mechanism, and that the 
</p>
<p>appointment of an independent expert in the field of cultural rights could assist the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the present resolution, taking into account the work already done in 
</p>
<p>this field by other bodies, organs and organizations of the United Nations system; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the process of review, rationalization and 
</p>
<p>improvement of mandates represents momentum towards the establishment of an 
</p>
<p>independent expert in the field of cultural rights,  and to this end requests the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consult States, 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on the content and scope of 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the independent expert in the field of cultural rights, the basis of which 
</p>
<p>would be the comprehensive implementation of the present resolution, and to report 
</p>
<p>on the results of those consultations to the Council in accordance with its annual 
</p>
<p>programme of work; </p>

<p> 6. <i>Underlines</i> that it is important to avoid overlapping with the activities 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other 
</p>
<p>bodies and organizations of the United Nations system when establishing the mandate 
</p>
<p>of the independent expert and to bear in mind the significance of encouraging synergy 
</p>
<p>between all actors dealing with cultural rights and the issue of cultural diversity; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the annual programme of work under the same agenda item. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>[Adopted without a vote]
