<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
resolution 19/19. In the report, the Special Rapporteur lists his key activities undertaken 
from 3 April 2012 to 9 January 2013 and focuses thematically on the principle of 
accountability for grave or systematic human rights violations while countering terrorism. 
The report highlights the failure to date of the international community to secure full 
accountability for the acts of certain sections of the United States' Central Intelligence 
Agency during the Presidency of George W. Bush (&#8220;the Bush-era CIA&#8221;) in implementing a 
programme of torture, rendition and secret detention of terrorist suspects, as well as the acts 
of public officials in other States who colluded in that programme. It also sets out a series 
of framework principles for securing the right to truth and the principle of accountability 
for gross or systematic human rights violations committed by public officials while 
countering terrorism, and makes recommendations to States.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 12 April 2012, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Subcommittee on Human 
Rights of the European Parliament in the context of a public hearing on secret rendition and 
detention practices: &#8220;How to protect human rights while countering terrorism?&#8221; He referred 
to the Special Procedures mandate holders&#8223; &#8220;Joint study on global practices in relation to 
secret detention in the context of countering terrorism&#8221;1 explaining the findings of the study and drawing attention to the failure of certain European Union States to respond to letters 
seeking further information on allegations of their involvement in those practices.2 
</p>
<p>3.  On 20 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur presented his report on the framework 
principles for securing the human rights of victims of terrorism (A/HRC/20/14) to the 
twentieth session of the Human Rights Council and held a press conference. On this 
occasion, he also participated as a panellist in a side event on the Human Rights 
Implications of the United States Targeted Killing Programme, co-organized by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the International 
Commission of Jurists and the International Federation for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>4. On 27 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated as a panellist in a debate on 
the &#8220;Future of the Targeted Sanctions one year after splitting the 1267 Regime&#8221;, hosted by 
the Permanent Mission of Germany in New York, with the Ombudsperson of the Al-Qaida 
Sanctions Committee, Kimberly Prost. 
</p>
<p>5. On 5 and 6 July 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the third regional 
expert symposium on fair trial and due process in the counter-terrorism context held in 
Brussels, Belgium, making an intervention related to the investigation and pretrial phase for 
persons suspected of terrorism offences, including administrative detention regimes and 
procedures for review.

</p>
<p> 2 See further paras. 44 and 53(a) below.  </p>


<p>6. On 9 and 10 July 2012, the Special Rapporteur addressed a high-level conference on 
the rights of victims of terrorism, organized by the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, in 
Madrid, Spain. 
</p>
<p>7.  On 19 October 2012, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote speech at the 
symposium &#8220;The Social Cost of National Security: Assessing the Impact of Global 
Counter-Terror Initiatives on Canadian Society&#8221; in Toronto, Canada. The conference was a 
partnership between the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Arab 
Institute and hosted by the International Human Rights Program at the University of 
Toronto. 
</p>
<p>8.  On 2 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur presented his report to the sixty-
seventh session of the General Assembly on the mandate of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson established by Security Council resolution 1904 (2009) (and amended by 
resolution 1989 (2011)) and its compatibility with international human rights norms,     in 
which he assessed in particular its impact on the due process deficits inherent in the 
Council&#8223;s Al-Qaida sanctions regime.  
</p>
<p>9.  On 7 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur took part in an experts&#8223; meeting of the 
Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) on the &#8220;Draft Madrid Memorandum on Good 
Practices for Assistance to Victims of Terrorism Immediately After the Attack and in 
Criminal Proceedings&#8221; in Vienna, Austria. 
</p>
<p>10. On 4 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in a side event to the 
presentation of his annual report to the General Assembly (A/67/396) co-organized by the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Permanent Mission 
of Germany in New York entitled &#8220;Targeted sanctions, human rights and due process &#8211; The 
future of the 1267/1989 Al-Qaida sanctions regime&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur also 
addressed a meeting with the 1267/1989 Al Qaida Sanctions Committee to explain his 
findings to all State representatives of the Security Council.  
</p>
<p>11.  On 12 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated via video message in a 
panel discussion on the role of victims of terrorism in countering violent extremism 
organized by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Abu Dhabi, United Arab 
Emirates. The meeting was organized in cooperation with the Center of Excellence on 
Countering Violent Extremism. The panel discussion took place as a side event prior to the 
coordination meeting and the Ministerial conference of the GCTF held on 13 and 14 
December 2012, respectively. 
</p>
<p>12. On 16 and 17 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Counter-
Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) Inter-Agency Coordination Meeting at 
Greentree, New York. The CTITF retreat is a continuation of regular gathering of 31 
CTITF entities to take stock of ongoing activities and strategize on future initiatives.  
</p>
<p>13. On 18 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated in the CTITF Quarterly 
Briefing to Member States in New York, United States. </p>


<p><b> III. Framework principles for securing the accountability of 
public officials for gross or systematic human rights 
violations committed in the course of States-sanctioned 
counter-terrorism initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>14.  The Special Rapporteur considers that the attacks that were perpetrated on the 
territory of the United States on 11 September 2001 can properly be characterized as crimes 
against humanity. Soon after those attacks, and in response to them, the Government of 
President George W. Bush embarked upon a systematic campaign of internationally 
wrongful acts involving the secret detention, rendition and torture of terrorist suspects.3  
</p>
<p>15. On 17 September 2001 President Bush authorized the CIA to operate a secret 
detention programme which involved the establishment of clandestine detention facilities 
know as &#8220;black sites&#8221; on the territory of other States, with the collaboration of public 
</p>
<p>officials in those States.4 At about the same time, he allegedly authorized the CIA to carry 
out &#8220;extraordinary renditions&#8221; (the secret transfers of prisoners outside any lawful process 
</p>
<p>of extradition or expulsion) enabling them to be interrogated whilst in the formal custody of 
the public officials of other States, including States with a record of using torture.5 At the 
beginning of August 2002 the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel purported to 
authorize a range of physical and mental abuse of terrorist suspects known as &#8220;enhanced 
interrogation techniques&#8221;.6 The Bush administration has since publicly acknowledged the 
use of &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; on &#8220;high value detainees&#8221; on the personal authority of the 
</p>
<p>President.7 
</p>
<p>16. In July 2006, the United Nations Committee Against Torture expressed concern at 
the apparent impunity enjoyed by the United States personnel involved in these practices 
and recommended that the involvement of public officials in acts of torture and other forms 
of inhuman and degrading treatment should be promptly and thoroughly investigated.8  
</p>
<p>17. Two days after his inauguration, on 22 January 2009, President Obama passed an 
executive order which prohibited the use of secret detention, banned the use of torture and 
other forms of serious abuse, and required all detainees to be treated in accordance with the

<p>techniques authorized by the Army Field Manual.9 Thereafter, on 16 April 2009 the 
President authorized the release of a number of legal memoranda from the United States 
Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), purporting to justify as lawful the 
CIA use of &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; and other forms of torture.10 At a White House conference to 
mark his first 100 days in office President Obama unequivocally confirmed the view of the 
international community that &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; amounts to torture.11  
</p>
<p>18. Despite this clear repudiation of the unlawful actions carried out by the Bush-era 
CIA, many of the facts remain classified, and no public official has so far been brought to 
justice in the United States. In August 2007, United States Attorney General Eric Holder 
announced that the Department of Justice would not prosecute any official who acted in 
good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel 
in connection with the interrogation of terrorist suspects.12 In the view of the Special 
Rapporteur this comes close to an assertion of the &#8220;superior orders&#8221; defence, despite its 
prohibition under customary law13 and relevant international treaties.14  
</p>
<p>19. Whilst a number of States have made strenuous efforts to keep their involvement in 
the CIA programme hidden from public scrutiny, a considerable amount of reliable 
information is now available. Through the dedicated and persistent work of a small number 
of Parliamentarians15 and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)16 the facts have

<p>gradually emerged over the past decade. This process of seeking the truth has gathered 
momentum in the past three years. Independent investigations have reliably established the 
complicity, to a greater or lesser degree, of the public officials of a large number of States 
in the CIA rendition programme.17 There is now credible evidence to show that CIA &#8220;black 
sites&#8221; were located on the territory of Lithuania, Morocco, Poland, Romania and Thailand18 
and that the officials of at least 49 other States allowed their airspace or airports to be used 
for rendition flights.19 
</p>
<p>20. Despite the emergence of these facts, only one State has so far brought any public 
official to justice. On 4 November 2009 the Milan Criminal Tribunal convicted 22 CIA 
agents <i>in absentia</i>, including the Milan station chief, for their role in the abduction of 
Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, a dual Egyptian-Italian national in Milan on 17 February 
2003, and his rendition to Cairo, where he was detained for 14 months and repeatedly 
tortured.20 The CIA officials were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between five, 
seven and nine years. Claims by the Italian Government to withhold relevant evidence were 
eventually rejected,21 and on 1 February 2013 convictions were returned in respect of the 
Italian agents involved in the abduction, including the former Director of the Italian 
Military Intelligence Service, SISMI, who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.22  
</p>
<p>21. The prosecutions brought in the case of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr are a 
straightforward application of the relevant principles of international law that are binding 
on every Member State of the United Nations. It is therefore a matter of obvious regret that 
this remains the only instance in which the perpetrators of these crimes have been brought 
to justice.

<p><b> B. The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Gross or systematic human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the counter-terrorism context, the expression &#8220;gross or systematic human rights 
violations&#8221;23 includes State-sanctioned torture in the course of (or for the purposes of) 
interrogation of terrorist suspects24; the authorized and systematic infliction of inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment on terrorist suspects 25; the transfer of suspects into the 
custody of another State where there is known to be a real risk of torture26; enforced 
disappearance of terrorist suspects,27 including their temporary detention at 
unacknowledged secret detention sites,28 and other acts of State that involve systematic 
human rights violations that are calculated to place human beings beyond the reach of the 
legal protection that international human rights law is designed to guarantee.29  
</p>
<p>  
 23  There has been consensus for more than two decades that torture, enforced disappearance and 
</p>
<p>prolonged arbitrary detention amount to gross human rights violations: see the conclusions of the 
Seminar on the Right to Restitution, Compensation and Rehabilitation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Maastricht, 11-15 March 1992. SIM Special 
No. 12, p.17.  
</p>
<p> 24  As to the status of the prohibition against torture as a peremptory norm of customary international 
law, see International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, <i>Prosecutor v. Furundzija</i> 
(Judgment) 10 December 1996, (&#8220;Furundzija&#8221;), paras. 153 to 156; European Court of Human Rights, 
<i>Al</i>-<i>Adsani v. United Kingdom</i>, Judgment 21 November 2001, para. 61; <i>Ex parte Pinochet (No. 3)</i> 
[2000] 1 AC 147 at 198; see also <i>UNCAT</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>, footnote 14, which provides a definition of torture 
as prohibited by the peremptory norm (Article 1), and requires States to take effective legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and punish acts of torture (Articles 2, 4, 7 and 
12).

A/RES/47/133, (&#8220;<i>United Nations Declaration on Enforced Disappearance</i>), Art. 1. See also <i>Inter-

Session of the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly, preamble; see also ECtHR, 
<i>Kurt v. Turkey</i>, Application No. 2426/94, Judgment 25 May 1998, (&#8220;<i>Kurt</i>&#8221;), para. 124, (characterizing 
enforced disappearance as &#8220;a most grave violation&#8221;); and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe, Resolution 1463 (2005), <i>Enforced Disappearances</i> (describing such action on the part of a 
State as &#8220;a very serious human rights violation on a par with torture and murder&#8221;).  
</p>
<p> 28  See <i>United Nations Joint Study on Secret Detention, op. cit</i>., footnote 1, para. 28; <i>United Nations 
Declaration on Enforced Disappearance, op. cit</i>., footnote 27, Article 2 which defines &#8220;enforced 
disappearance&#8221; as &#8220;the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by 
agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or 
acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by 
concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which places such a person outside

<p> 29  Observations on behalf of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to the ECtHR in <i>El-Masri, op. 
cit.</i>, footnote 26, Geneva, 11 March 2011, at para. 1. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge 
the work of Chile Eboe-Osuji, the Senior Legal Adviser to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
on the international recognition of the right to truth, upon which he has drawn for the purposes of the 
present report. </p>


<p><b> 2. The right to truth in international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>23. The principles of international law that govern accountability for such violations 
have two complementary dimensions. Put affirmatively, international law nowadays 
protects the legal right of the victim and of the public to know the truth.30 The right to truth 
entitles the victim, his or her relatives and the public at large to seek and obtain all relevant 
information concerning the commission of the alleged violation, including the identity of 
the perpetrator(s),31 the fate and whereabouts of the victim32 and, where appropriate, the 
process by which the alleged violation was officially authorized.33 It also includes the right 
of the victim to adequate reparation34 (of which the establishment of the truth is an 
indispensable part35). The payment of monetary compensation without full public exposure 
of the truth is not sufficient to discharge this obligation.36 
</p>
<p>24. The victim&#8223;s right to truth has been expressly recognized in a number of 
international instruments negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations. Article 24(2) 
of the United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances provides that each victim &#8220;has the right to know the truth regarding the 
circumstances of the disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the 
fate of the disappeared person&#8221;.37 The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on 
the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International 
Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted by 
the General Assembly on 16 December 2005, provide at paragraph 24 that victims should 
be entitled to &#8220;seek and obtain information&#8221; on the &#8220;causes and conditions pertaining to 
</p>
<p>gross violations of international human rights law&#8221; and to &#8220;learn the truth in regard to these

<p>violations&#8221;.38 The Human Rights Council has similarly recognized &#8220;the importance of 
respecting and ensuring the right to truth so as to contribute to ending impunity&#8221;.39 
Statements to the same effect have been made by many of the United Nations' independent 
human rights mechanisms including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
Committee Against Torture, and various Special Procedures mandate-holders.40 
</p>
<p>25. The Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights have developed 
jurisprudence on the right to truth which is cast as a right jointly vested in the victim, his or 
her next of kin, and the whole of civil society. In one of its earliest decisions on the subject, 
the Commission observed that &#8220;[e]very society has the inalienable right to know the truth 
</p>
<p>about past events, as well as the motives and circumstances in which aberrant crimes came 
to be committed, in order to prevent repetition of such acts in the future&#8221;.41 In <i>Myrna Mack 
Chang v. Guatemala</i> the Court held that42 &#8220;the next of kin of the victims and society as a 
whole must be informed of everything that has happened in connection with the said 
violations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>26. The right to truth has been recognized by the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8223; Rights as an aspect of the right to an effective remedy for a violation of the 
</p>
<p>African Convention. In its <i>Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal 
Assistance in Africa</i>, the Commission held that the right to an effective remedy includes 
&#8220;access to the factual information concerning the violations&#8221;. Most recently and, for present 
</p>
<p>purposes, most relevantly, the right to truth was expressly recognized by the European 
Court of Human Rights in connection with the former CIA programme of secret detention, 
&#8220;enhanced interrogation&#8221; and rendition, in the judgment of its Grand Chamber in <i>El-Masri 
</i></p>
<p><i>v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</i>43 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The principle of accountability in international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>27. On the other side of the equation, international law imposes corresponding 
obligations on States which can be conveniently gathered together under the rubric of the 
international law principle of accountability. This imposes specific duties on all three 
branches of government. The executive, the judiciary and parliamentary oversight bodies, 
as well as independent bodies entrusted with official responsibility for review of 
intelligence matters and/or the conduct of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies, each

<p>bear a share of the State&#8223;s responsibility to secure the realization of the right to truth and the 
principle of accountability.44 
</p>
<p>28. Where a plausible allegation is made that public officials have committed (or been 
complicit in the commission of) gross or systemic human rights violations, the executive 
authorities of the State(s) concerned are obliged under international law to carry out <i>proprio 
motu</i> an effective official investigation45 which is begun promptly,46 secures all relevant 
evidence,47 and is capable of leading to the identification and, where appropriate, the 
punishment of the perpetrator(s) and those on whose authority the violations were 
committed.48 Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish 
the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of the requisite legal standard.49 
As the European Court of Human Rights has pointed out, in the absence of such an 
investigation &#8220;it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights 
of those within their control with virtual impunity&#8221;.50 
</p>
<p>29. The investigating authorities are obliged to allow victims, or (if deceased) their 
relatives, effective access to the investigative process,51 respecting their right to be

</p>
<p>30. To meet the requirements of international law, such an investigative body must be 
genuinely independent of the officials implicated in the violations.56 This implies not only a 
lack of hierarchical or institutional connection but also a practical independence.57 Those 
potentially implicated should have no supervisory role, whether direct or indirect, over 
those conducting the investigation.58 In all cases, investigators must approach their task 
with genuine impartiality and must not harbour preconceptions about the matter they are 
investigating or the identity of those responsible for any fatalities. They should be 
demonstrably free of undue influence.59 The investigators must evaluate the evidence 
objectively and reach impartial conclusions.60 The authorities &#8220;must always make a serious 
attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions 
to close their investigation or to use as the basis of their decisions&#8221;.61 The obligation to 
carry out an effective investigation imposes a duty to seek mutual legal assistance from 
other states, including those allegedly implicated in the violations, through diplomatic or 
judicial inquiries, the results of which should also be disclosed.62

<p>31. In addition, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation 
and its results so as to secure public accountability in both theory and practice.63 This 
implies that the findings of the investigation must be made public,64 subject to redactions 
authorized by an independent tribunal or other quasi-judicial body where this is found 
strictly necessary on grounds of national security, having regard to the principles set out at 
paragraphs 38 to 43 below. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>El-Masri v. the former 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</i> 
</b></p>
<p>32. In its recent judgment in <i>El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,</i> 
the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights acknowledged the existence of 
right to truth (as such) for the first time in its jurisprudence, treating it as an aspect of the 
State&#8223;s adjectival obligation under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
to conduct an effective and independent official investigation into allegations of torture.65 
The case involved the arbitrary detention, rendition and torture of a German citizen who 
was arrested by officials as he tried to enter the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.66 
After 23 days of incommunicado detention, he was then transferred to Skopje airport where 
he was severely beaten, stripped naked and anally penetrated with an object. He was then 
flown to Afghanistan where he was detained in a secret CIA &#8220;black site&#8221; known as the &#8220;Salt 
Pit&#8221; for over four months, during which time he was severely and repeatedly beaten. On 28 
May 2004, he was flown to Albania, where he was left by the side of a road.67  
</p>
<p>33. In formally acknowledging the right to truth, the Court underlined &#8220;the great 
importance of the present case not only for the applicant and his family, but also for other 
victims of similar crimes and the general public who had the right to know what had 
happened&#8221;.68 It went on: 
</p>
<p>The issue of &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; attracted worldwide attention and triggered 
</p>
<p>inquiries by many international and intergovernmental organisations, including the 
United Nations human rights bodies, the Council of Europe and the European 
Parliament. The latter revealed that some of the States concerned were not interested 
in seeing the truth come out. 
</p>
<p>34. The Court observed that, where allegations were made that were as grave as those in 
the <i>El-Masri</i> case, an effective investigation &#8220;may generally be regarded as essential in 
maintaining public confidence in [the authorities&#8223;] adherence to the rule of law and in 
</p>
<p>preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts&#8221;. The investigation 
conducted by the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was found to 
have been insufficient to lead to &#8220;the identification and punishment of those responsible&#8221;, 
thereby violating the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's obligations under the 
Convention69. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. The principle against impunity in international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Human Rights Council has repeatedly recognized that the right to truth and the 
principle of accountability are inextricably bound up with the expressed commitment of the

<p>international community to end impunity for gross or systematic human violations. The 
guiding axiom of the United Nations Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human 
Rights through Action to Combat Impunity is the obligation on States &#8220;to ensure the 
</p>
<p>inalienable right to know the truth about violations&#8221;.70 If faithfully implemented, this cluster 
of rights and duties would by now have ensured accountability not only for those public 
officials who directly engaged in the secret detention, rendition and torture programme 
operated by the Bush-era CIA, but also for their superiors, and for any current or former 
high-ranking officials of State, who planned such strategies or who gave authorization for 
subordinate public officials to participate in them. The Special Rapporteur is gravely 
concerned that these norms have not been implemented in this context. 
</p>
<p>36. The international community&#8223;s expressed commitment to ending impunity is 
reflected in specific treaty obligations designed to cater for precisely this sort of systematic 
criminal conduct. The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment,71 and the more recent International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance72 each require the signatory State to (a) enact 
domestic criminal law offences prohibiting the commission of acts amounting to torture73 
and enforced disappearance74; (b) assume jurisdiction over such crimes when perpetrated by 
its own nationals abroad,75 or on territory that falls within its jurisdiction76, including any 
detention facility that is under the <i>de facto</i> control of its public officials (even if it is 
physically located on the territory of another State)77; (c) conduct effective investigations 
into allegations that such crimes have been committed78; and (c) where the evidence 
justifies it, to prosecute the offender or extradite him or her to another State to face 
prosecution.79  
</p>
<p>37. The experience of the past decade, however, shows that there are various means by

 81 A criminal investigation conducted by Assistant United States Attorney John Durham found that 92 
</p>

deliberately destroyed in November 2005 on the authority of Jose Rodriguez Jr., head of the CIA's

<p> </p>


<p>independent investigations into past practices82; (d) the assertion by the executive of 
unjustified claims for secrecy on grounds of national security or the maintenance of good 
foreign relations83; (e) the suppression84 or delayed publication85 of reports of independent 
investigations whose findings might expose past official wrongdoing to public scrutiny; (f) 
executive inertia motivated by a desire to &#8220;draw a line&#8221; under the past86; (g) more or less 
oblique invocation of the &#8220;superior orders&#8221; defence, despite its prohibition under customary 
law and relevant international treaties87; and (h) excessive judicial deference to the 
executive on matters related to national security88 or the maintenance of good foreign 
relations89, with the effect of excluding the right of access to court, or unjustifiably 
restricting the exposure of the facts, often on the basis of highly dubious legal reasoning.90 
Approaches such as these are antithetical to securing accountability and if they are allowed 
to go unchallenged, a blanket of official impunity would be allowed to descend, cloaking 
official crimes from public scrutiny on the pretext of defending state secrets.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. The invocation of national security and the State secrets doctrine 
</b></p>
<p>38. If the right to truth and the principle of accountability are to be secure in domestic 
law, the national judiciary must play its part. Judges of national courts and tribunals are 
equally bound by the State&#8223;s international law obligations, and are under a duty to ensure 
the unfettered right of access to court for the vindication of any cause of action arguably 
recognized under domestic law. Given the importance of the right to truth and the principle 
of accountability, the domestic judiciary is bound to subject executive claims of non-
justiciability on national security grounds to the most penetrating scrutiny.91 Similar 
scrutiny must be directed to executive claims to exemption from normal rules of disclosure 
in legal proceedings.92 As the Council of Europe Guidelines on Eradicating Impunity for 
Serious Human Rights violations point out, the need for public accountability follows from 
the fact that the eradication of impunity is not only a matter of justice for the victims, but

programme on the plainly erroneous basis that the applicant (the United Kingdom's all-party

<p>also operates &#8220;as a deterrent to prevent new violations, and to uphold the rule of law and 
public trust in the justice system&#8221;.93 
</p>
<p>39. Legitimate national security considerations do not include governmental interests 
and activities that constitute grave crimes under international human rights law, let alone 
policies that are precisely calculated to evade the operation of human rights law.94 The 
European Court of Human Rights in the <i>El-Masri </i>case noted that an unjustifiably broad 
interpretation of State secret privilege had been asserted by the United States Government 
in proceedings before United States courts in that case, and that the same approach had led 
the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to hide the truth.95 In the 
context of the secret detention, rendition and torture programme of the Bush-era CIA, the 
Court rightly concluded that the concept of State secrets &#8220;has often been invoked to 
</p>
<p>obstruct the search for the truth&#8221;.96 
</p>
<p>40. This phenomenon, which constitutes a serious abuse of public power, has a long 
pedigree in South America, where national security claims have frequently been advanced 
in an attempt to prevent judicial scrutiny of systematic human rights violations. Based on its 
extensive experience of dealing with such claims, the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights has developed a robust response, holding that &#8220;public bodies cannot shield 
</p>
<p>themselves behind the protective cloak of official secrets to avoid or obstruct the 
investigation of illegal acts ascribed to members of its own bodies&#8221;.97 The Court has held 
that in such cases claims to avoid disclosure on the grounds of national security &#8220;may be 
</p>
<p>considered an attempt to privilege the &#8222;clandestinity&#8223; of the Executive branch and to 
perpetuate impunity&#8221;.98 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur recalls the well-settled principle that allegations of State-
sanctioned systematic human rights violations in the counter-terrorism context must be 
subjected to penetrating scrutiny by independent judicial, quasi-judicial and/or 
parliamentary oversight mechanisms that have unfettered access to all classified 
information.99 Any claim to withhold publication of evidence on national security grounds

</i></p>
<p><i>cit.,</i> footnote 26, Geneva, 11 March 2011, at para. 38. A particularly egregious illustration of this is 
the practice of the Military Commissions in Guantanamo Bay to treat evidence confirming the torture 
of &#8220;high-value detainees&#8221; by the CIA as &#8220;classified information&#8221; on the spurious ground that the 
accused, having been subjected to waterboarding and other forms of torture, are thereby privy to 
information about classified CIA interrogation techniques which they cannot be permitted to reveal, 
in any proceeding open to the public, even to the extent of preventing their attorneys from providing 
the accused with Government classified materials about the ill-treatment to which they were 
subjected. See<i> e.g</i>. <i>United States v. Mohammad</i>, Appellate Exhibit 013AA, Amended Protective 
Order #1 (To Prevent Against Disclosure of National Security Information), &#182;&#182; 2g(4)-(5), dtd Feb. 9, 
2013, &#8220;observations and experiences of an accused with respect to&#8221; their treatment by the CIA 
</p>
<p>remains classified, such as details of their capture, information that would tend to reveal the foreign 
countries involved, the names and identifies of the persons involved, the enhanced interrogation 
techniques applied, and any descriptions of the confinement conditions This absurdist and amoral 
legal analysis carries the implication that the use of torture by public officials is <i>ipso facto </i>privileged 
from public disclosure.

<p>must be determined by a body that is independent of the executive, following an adversarial 
procedure with such adaptations as may be strictly necessary to ensure effective 
independent oversight without unjustifiably imperiling legitimate national security 
interests.100 Where such claims are advanced there should be a strong presumption in favour 
of disclosure,101 and any procedure adopted must, as a minimum, ensure that the essential 
gist of the classified information is disclosed to the victim or his family, and made public.102 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur commends as a model the approach adopted by the 
Canadian authorities (and by the investigating judge Justice Dennis O'Connor) in the <i>Maher 
Arar Inquiry</i>103 into the rendition and torture of a Canadian citizen pursuant to the Bush-era 
CIA's counter-terrorism programme. In that case, the judge was provided with all 
documentation, irrespective of the possible national security claims that arose; the Canadian 
Government highlighted the passages it considered to be classified; the judge determined 
the claim on the merits; and his determination was potentially amenable to judicial review. 
Making full use of these powers, Justice O'Connor concluded that the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police had provided &#8220;inaccurate and unfairly prejudicial&#8221; information to the FBI, 
which led to Mr. Arar's detention at JFK airport in New York, and his subsequent transfer 
to via Jordan to the Syrian Arab Republic, where he was imprisoned for 10 months and 
subjected to repeated acts of torture including beatings with cables, and being threatened 
with torture by electric shocks.104  
</p>
<p>43. In his final report, Justice O'Connor made a series of important recommendations 
about the need for an integrated intelligence oversight and accountability mechanism in 
Canada. He also concluded that the success of the inquiry in getting at the facts was a direct 
consequence of his powers to compel production of evidence and the attendance of 
witnesses, and to assess the competing interests of national security and public 
accountability for himself. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Situations of pressing concern 
</b></p>
<p>44. In February 2010, four special procedures mandate holders presented the United 
Nations joint study on secret detention while countering terrorism to the Human Rights 
Council.105 After the report was presented, and in order to follow up its findings and 
recommendations, the authors wrote to all States identified in the report seeking their 
response to the concerns it had highlighted. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that 
a significant number of States simply failed to respond. The Special Rapporteur calls on all

<p>States that have so far failed to provide substantive responses to the inquiries made by the 
joint mandate-holders to do so without further delay. 
</p>
<p>45. In March 2009, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence began a 
comprehensive investigation into the CIA's secret detention and interrogation programme, 
chaired by Senator Dianne Feinstein. The Special Rapporteur commends the United States 
for establishing an independent parliamentary which has reportedly had unrestricted access 
to classified information. On 1 December 2011, Senator Feinstein announced that the 
Committee was close to the completion of the comprehensive review, and the report was 
approved by the Committee the same month.106  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur calls on the United States to release the full Senate Select 
Committee report as soon as possible, subject only to the specific redaction of such 
particulars as are considered by the Select Committee itself to be strictly necessary to 
safeguard legitimate national security interests or the physical safety of persons identified 
in the report. 
</p>
<p>47. On 6 July 2010, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced an 
independent inquiry by members of the Privy Council (a body made up mainly of senior 
serving or retired politicians of distinction and senior judges), under the Chairmanship of 
Sir Peter Gibson, a retired judge with experience on national security issues. The Gibson 
Inquiry was set up in order to consider whether, and to what extent, the United Kingdom 
Government and its security and intelligence agencies were involved in, or aware of, the 
improper treatment or rendition of detainees held by other countries in counter terrorism 
operations outside the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>48. The terms of reference for the Gibson Inquiry were published on 6 July 2011 and a 
protocol was subsequently issued which governed its procedures. The inquiry lacked the 
power to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents. Nor did it 
have any power to request the production of evidence from other States, or their personnel. 
Moreover, under the protocol established for the inquiry, the final decision as to whether 
any document or finding could be released to the public was vested in the Cabinet Secretary 
(a senior civil servant). As a result, the detainees, their lawyers and the NGOs who were 
supporting them, withdrew their cooperation.107 Thereafter, the Special Rapporteur, acting 
together with the Special Rapporteur on torture, engaged the United Kingdom in 
correspondence about the powers, terms of reference and protocol for the Gibson Inquiry.108 
On 18 January 2012, the Justice Secretary announced there was no prospect of the Gibson 
Inquiry being able to start in the foreseeable future and the Government had therefore 
decided to terminate it. He indicated, however, that the inquiry would provide an interim 
report, which was delivered to the Prime Minister on 27 June 2012. Despite Government 
assurances of transparency, the interim report has not so far published and the Government 
has given no public explanation for the delay. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the United Kingdom to publish the interim report 
of the Gibson Inquiry without further delay, subject only to such redactions as are 
considered by the independent inquiry team itself to be strictly necessary to safeguard 
legitimate national security interests or the physical safety of persons identified in the

<p>report. He further invites the United Kingdom to make a public statement setting out a 
timetable for the start of the proposed judge-led inquiry, indicating what its powers and 
terms of reference will be. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the shortcomings in 
the terms of reference for, and the powers of, the Gibson Inquiry should be remedied in the 
resumed inquiry, and commends to the attention of the United Kingdom the principles laid 
down in the present report, and in the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture on best 
practice for commissions of inquiry into allegations of this nature.109 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations

</b></p>
<p><b>should be prosecuted without delay and, where found guilty, given sentences 
</b></p>
<p><b>commensurate with the gravity of the acts perpetrated.</b>110<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The Special Rapporteur <i>welcomes </i>the decision of the CTITF Working Group

</p>
<p>52. <b>The Special Rapporteur <i>calls upon </i>all Member States, and in particular those
