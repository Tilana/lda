Republic</b>**<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report analyses the progress made by the Central African Republic in 
implementing recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions following his visit to the country from 31 January to 7 February 
2008 (A/HRC/11/2/Add.<footnote name="3">. The follow-up report is an important component of one of the principal working 
methods of the Special Rapporteur &#8211; conducting country visits to investigate allegations of 
violations of the right to life. Country visits provide an opportunity to ascertain the facts on 
a first-hand basis, to analyse in detail the forms and causes of unlawful killings, and to 
engage in constructive dialogue with officials at all levels in the country concerned. 
Following the visit, the Special Rapporteur prepares a detailed report on his findings, 
including recommendations aimed at reducing unlawful killings and promoting 
accountability. Country visits can achieve their full potential only if Governments give real 
consideration to these recommendations. Accordingly, the Commission on Human Rights 
requested States to carefully examine recommendations and to report to the Special 
Rapporteur on actions taken on the recommendations (resolution 2004/37, para. 15). 
4. In 2006, in order to assess the extent to which States had implemented 
recommendations, the Special Rapporteur initiated follow-up reports on visits conducted. 
The first follow-up report (E/CN.<footnote name="4">4. The Special Rapporteur reported after his visit that impunity for killings in the 
Central African Republic was pervasive, regardless of the perpetrator (security forces, 
rebels or private persons) or the context (military operations, routine law enforcement or 
detention). He noted that few FACA/Presidential Guard members had actually been 
prosecuted for serious abuses against civilians, and that certain elements of the armed 
forces seemed to enjoy a de facto status protecting them from prosecution. </footnote>/2006/53/Add.<footnote name="2">0 April 2009. </footnote>) concerned the recommendations made 
by his predecessor, Asma Jahangir, on her visits to Brazil, Honduras, Jamaica and the 
Sudan. In 2008, a follow-up report (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3) was issued on the first two missions 
conducted by Special Rapporteur Philip Alston to Sri Lanka and Nigeria. In 2009, follow-
up reports were issued on Guatemala (A/HRC/11/2/Add.7), and the Philippines 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.8). 
5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to Sarah Knuckey and Christine Chiu from the 
Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at New York University School of Law, for 
their excellent assistance in the preparation of this report. </footnote>). Although killings and abuses committed by Government forces 
and rebel units have declined significantly since the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the 
people of the Central African Republic remain at the mercy of other armed groups, 
including bandits, self-defence groups, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army and the Chadian 
National Army. Protection of civilians is practically non-existent in all regions of the 
country outside of Bangui, and insecurity remains particularly grave in the northeast and 
northwest of the country. 
</p>
<p> Although the Government has made a commitment to security sector reform and has 
taken admirable steps towards achieving it, its lack of funding and institutional capacity has 
resulted in minimal improvement. Impunity for abuses committed on all sides remains the 
status quo, and no high-ranking officials have been prosecuted for the most serious crimes. 
The long-discussed national human rights commission has yet to be created. Despite ample 
planning, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process has yet to begin in

roads, continue to routinely engage in thefts and harassment of civilians. In combination

occasional abuses against civilians. In one particularly serious incident, credible reports 
indicate that the Presidential Guard and FACA killed 21 men in the north on 2 February 
2009. In another incident in February 2009, near Ndele, Government forces beat a number 
of civilians suspected of supporting one of the rebel groups. In March 2009, members of the 
Presidential Guard seriously injured a local police chief in Bangui, who later died of his 
injuries. In a positive step, the Permanent Military Tribunal tried those accused of 
involvement in the incident later that month.

and other serious abuses such as forced displacement and village burnings committed in the 
north by both the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and the Presidential Guard from 
mid-2005 to mid-2007. These abuses were usually carried out as retaliation for perceived 
civilian support for, or cooperation with, rebel forces. At the time of his visit, the conflict 
had waned and abuses of this nature were much more infrequent.

<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report analyses the progress made by the Central African Republic in 
implementing recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions following his visit to the country from 31 January&#8211;7 February 2008 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.3). 
2. In accordance with established practice, the follow-up report was prepared on the 
basis of all available information. The Special Rapporteur requested information from the 
Government and from civil society actors on any steps taken to implement the 
recommendations in his original report. Information on the non-implementation of 
recommendations was also sought. In addition, information was sought on the current state 
of the phenomenon of extrajudicial executions in the country, and particularly on whether 
and how the situation had improved, deteriorated or remained static since the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur. Unfortunately, the Government did not respond to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s numerous requests for information. The United Nations Integrated 
Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) did provide information, 
and the Special Rapporteur has taken the Office&#8217;s very helpful comments into account in 
the present report. Extensive consultations were also undertaken with domestic and 
international civil society groups.

<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur visited the Central African Republic from 31 January&#8211;7 
February 2008 and his final report was published on 27 May 2009.1 His report highlighted 
killings by bandits, rebel groups and Government forces &#8211; as well as killings of persons in 
detention and persons accused of witchcraft. All of these types of killings and abuse 
continue today. 
</p>
<p>7. In his original report, the Special Rapporteur indicated that the Central African 
Republic was at an unusually favourable juncture for change. Unfortunately, this potential 
for change has largely gone unrealized. Incursions by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) 
are on the increase. Bandits operate all over the country with impunity, committing 
arbitrary executions, kidnappings and other egregious human rights abuses. Although the 
main rebel groups in the north have ostensibly made peace with the Government, tensions 
remain high due to dissatisfaction with the stymied disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration process and unfulfilled promises from the inclusive political dialogue.2 
Intermittent rebel attacks and killings continue. In addition, violence is increasingly 
committed along ethnic lines in the northeast, with tensions arising amongst Kara, Goula 
and Rouanga ethnic militias. Across the country, &#8220;private justice&#8221; and killings of alleged 
witches continue. The Government offers virtually no protection for civilians outside of 
Bangui. 
</p>
<p>8. Presidential and parliamentary elections are due to be held in May 2010, and have 
the potential to occasion further instability. There have already been reports that political 
opponents have been subject to intimidation and restriction of movement by Government 
security forces. One presidential candidate claimed that his life had been threatened by two 
kidnapping attempts in January 2010.3 
</p>
<p>9. In his report, the Special Rapporteur focused his recommendations on reforming the 
criminal and military justice systems, the security sector and human rights monitoring. 
Action on the recommendations has been disappointing, and no major improvements have 
been made in any of these areas. However, the Government does appear genuinely 
committed to security sector reform and has taken preliminary steps in the right direction, 
including by supporting human rights and humanitarian law training for members of the 
security forces.

 During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with key Government officials, including the President, 
</p>
<p>the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, as well as 
judges, magistrates, prosecutors, gendarmes, police officers, members of the armed forces, civil 
society representatives, witnesses and victims.

 After a series of delays, the Inclusive Political Dialogue was held from 8 to 20 December 2008, 
</p>
<p>attended by almost 200 representatives from all the salient interest groups including the presidential 
majority, the democratic opposition, rebel group leaders, other political parties and civil society, 
including representatives of the United Nations. The dialogue resulted in agreements on important 
issues including the formation of a consensus Government, a truth and reconciliation commission and 
a disarmament process

<p><b> III. Conflict in the North 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>10. The most serious armed insurgencies plaguing the Central African Republic at the 
time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit in early 2008 have largely been quelled. As of this 
writing, all the rebel groups except the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP) 
had signed a peace agreement with the Government. An overarching peace agreement was 
signed in Libreville on 21 June 2008, providing for a complete ceasefire, a general amnesty 
and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants. The 
participants also agreed to engage in an inclusive political dialogue so that all groups could 
contribute to the formulation of a more comprehensive plan for peace and development in 
the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>11. Despite these very positive steps towards peace, intermittent killings by Government 
forces and rebels in the north continue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by the Central African Republic Armed Forces 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13466 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>that he was arrested in Chad in December 2009, was taken to the Central African Republic 
and tortured, and that he died in custody on 8 January 2010.4 The Defence Minister has 
denied the accusations of detention and torture. Various calls for an independent 
investigation have been made, but none has occurred. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings by rebel groups 
</b></p>
<p>17. The initial report of the Special Rapporteur focused on the Arm&#233;e Populaire pour la 
Restauration de la R&#233;publique et la D&#233;mocratie (APRD) as the most significant rebel group 
operating in the northwest. He documented a number of extrajudicial executions committed 
by APRD in relation to the then ongoing armed conflict. Since the Libreville peace accord, 
there have been fewer attacks on civilians. 
</p>
<p>18. However, isolated but serious incidents committed by APRD as well as other rebel 
groups continue to be reported. For instance, there were credible reports that in October 
2008, APRD executed some 16 civilians, in some instances after holding sham trials to 
condemn them. Some were executed following accusations of witchcraft, others for 
allegedly having aided the <i>zaraguinas</i> (armed bandits). In April 2009, the president of the 
National Federation of Cattle Breeders (FNEC) was killed by members of APRD in Paoua. 
In June 2009, rebel attacks on Birao resulted in an unknown number of casualties. In 
February 2010, APRD reportedly killed 18 Chadian breeders near Markounda.5 
</p>
<p>19. In the north-eastern Vakaga region, ethnically motivated conflict appears to be on 
the rise. The Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR), comprised in large part of 
Goula fighters and supported by the Goula community, is ostensibly working with FACA 
troops to re-establish stability in the region. But, legitimated and armed by the Government, 
the group extorts money and goods from civilians and commits abuses against members of 
other ethnic groups with impunity. UFDR forces have clashed with Kara militias and 
targeted Kara civilians. Kara militias have also launched attacks, especially in Birao, 
targeting UFDR and FACA, and also burning villages.  
</p>
<p>20. In addition, new rebel groups have splintered off from those who signed the 
Libreville agreement. The formation of new groups, including CPJP and the Mouvement 
National du Salut de la Patrie, has spurred additional violence, as these new groups vie for 
their share of political power. In early December 2009, skirmishes between CPJP and the 
Government for control of Ndele killed at least 15 people. 
</p>
<p>21. The slowness of the country&#8217;s disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 
process is in part responsible for continued tensions between, and abuses by, rebel groups. 
In August 2009, President Boziz&#233; launched a country-wide disarmament, demobilization 
and reintegration sensitization campaign, a welcome step forward. The process ostensibly 
began on 17 December 2009, with the deployment of military observers to regions around 
the country and the opening of applications for former combatants. However, as of January 
2010, military observers were refusing to be deployed in areas not monitored by the

</p>
<p>Mission de Consolidation de la Paix (MICOPAX)6, which constitutes the majority of the 
country. Rebel groups are still in possession of their arms, and many groups feel that 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration commitments have not been honoured. 
There is a real danger that if there is not substantive progress in disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration before the 2010 elections, violence by rebel groups may 
be exacerbated. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Security vacuum and banditry  
</b>22. Banditry has become the major source of insecurity for civilians in the Central 
African Republic. In his initial report, the Special Rapporteur described the bandits&#8217; general 
method of operation as ambushing vehicles, looting their contents and taking hostages for 
ransom. Many of the bandits are from neighbouring countries including Cameroon, Chad 
and Niger. They tend to operate in loosely organized groups and are well armed. 
</p>
<p>23. Since the visit of the Special Rapporteur, armed groups of bandits have proliferated 
throughout the northern part of the country, becoming both better organized and more 
violent. Bandits assault and kill villagers and others on the roads, loot property and burn 
villages. They are increasingly kidnapping people for ransom, demanding upwards of CFA 
100,000, and killing hostages whose families cannot pay. Because of their attacks, they are 
a significant cause of internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>24. Violations by the State have also been reported in addressing banditry. For example, 
the Special Rapporteur received credible information that members of the Office Central de 
R&#233;pression du Banditisme, a police unit set up to address banditry, unlawfully killed 15 
individuals in their custody. 
</p>
<p>25. In some areas of the north-west and the north centre, APRD has stepped in to 
provide protection from banditry for the local population. But both APRD and Abdoulaye 
Miskine&#8217;s Front D&#233;mocratique pour le Peuple Centrafricain, operating in the north centre, 
have set up roadblocks and often exact illegal taxes from civilians, ostensibly in return for 
ensuring security in the region. 
</p>
<p>26. To protect themselves from banditry and from rebel groups, and in the absence of 
any real State protection, villagers in the north are increasingly organizing themselves into 
ad hoc self-defence groups. Some of these groups have joined the continued skirmishes 
between the Government and the rebel troops, with dire consequences for civilians. In June 
2009, for example, over 1,000 civilians were displaced from Loura following fighting 
between self-defence groups and APRD. In March 2009 in B&#233;z&#233;r&#233;, seven were killed in 
APRD self-defence-group violence. In the Ouham-Pend&#233; prefecture, the self-defence 
groups&#8217; support for the FACA forces has provoked a series of reprisal attacks against 
villages.  
</p>
<p>27. International efforts have insufficiently addressed the security threats posed by 
banditry and rebel groups. The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and 
Chad (MINURCAT) replaced European Union-led peacekeeping force troops on 15 March 
2009, but interlocutors reported that it patrols infrequently and inadequately.

 MICOPAX is a mission comprised of 500 troops from the Economic Community of Central African 
</p>
<p>States. The MICOPAX mandate is to protect civilians, contribute to national reconciliation, facilitate 
political dialogue, and to promote a durable peace and security in the Central African Republic. </p>

<p><b> V. Killings by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
</b></p>
<p>28. After over 20 years of fighting in northern Uganda, the LRA has increasingly been 
carrying out violent raids and attacks on civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The LRA has a major presence in the 
Orientale Province in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and, following 
Government and United Nations offensives there, LRA fighters have increased their 
presence in the Haut Mbomou region in south-east Central African Republic.7 Some of the 
first reports of significant LRA activity in the Central African Republic were in February 
and March 2008, when the LRA abducted about 150 people in a raid on four villages in the 
south-east of the country. 
</p>
<p>29. Since May 2009, LRA fighters have intensified their attacks against civilians, 
including killings, kidnappings, rapes, attacks on villages and looting of property. In May 
2009, the LRA allegedly killed 10 civilians in an attack on the south-eastern village of 
Kourokou. On 24 July 2009, members of the LRA reportedly attacked a village near Obo, 
killing two traders on their way to a market and injuring six others.8 On 18 November 2009, 
dozens of people were reported killed when more than 40 LRA fighters attacked the village 
of Djemah.9 On 19 February 2010, the LRA launched a series of attacks in the east near the 
village of Rafa&#239;, killing, injuring and kidnapping civilians and ransacking houses along the 
way.10 On 27 February 2010, the LRA attacked Yalinga in Haute-Kotto, thereby confirming 
it has moved north through the Central African Republic during 2010. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government deployed additional FACA troops to the region, although military 
operations against the LRA have largely been led by the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Force 
since August 2009. But there are not enough troops in the region to adequately protect the 
local population from LRA abuses. The Government and the United Nations have failed to 
take adequate measures against the LRA, including adopting a much needed regional 
approach.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Chadian incursions 
</b>31. Since 2008, the Chadian National Army has launched cross-border raids in north-
western Central African Republic, killing civilians, burning villages and stealing cattle. 
Elements of APRD around Kaga Bandoro, reported to be loyal to a Chadian dissident 
leader, General Baba Ladd&#233;, have threatened to wage war against the Government of the 
Central African Republic as well as MICOPAX following General Ladd&#233;&#8217;s arrest and 
deportation from the Central African Republic in October 2009. 
</p>
<p>32. In March 2010, following fighting between Chadian herdsman and Central African 
Republic farmers near Batangafo in which two Chadians were killed, the Chadian group 
returned with reinforcements, and killed nearly 20 citizens of the Central African Republic.

<p>Local officials were reported as stating that although there was a military police brigade 
and army unit in the town, both of the Central African Republic, they took no action.11 
</p>
<p><b> VII. &#8220;Witchcraft&#8221; killings 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur reported after his 2008 visit that he had received credible 
reports of numerous cases of killings of persons accused of witchcraft by private persons, 
Government security forces or rebel groups. 
</p>
<p>34. According to interlocutors, accusations of witchcraft and associated violence have 
been on the rise since the visit of the Special Rapporteur. Accusations continue to be levied 
against the most vulnerable elements of society, including women, children, older persons 
and disabled persons. 
</p>
<p>35. The problem has become so grave that many of the prisoners incarcerated in Central 
African Republic prisons are women accused of witchcraft. Suspected witches are 
frequently the victims of mob violence. In many cases, they are killed with impunity in the 
presence of Government and rebel forces. In one town in a single month in January 2009, 
22 people were accused of witchcraft. The majority were brutally killed, whipped, stoned, 
or beaten to death by their fellow villagers. A few of the accused survived, but were 
disabled for life from their injuries. On 10 January 2010, an elderly male was accused of 
witchcraft, arrested by the police and, under the orders of a State prosecutor, was handed 
over to a neighbourhood chief and the village&#8217;s self-defence forces and then beaten to 
death. 
</p>
<p>36. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Criminal Code criminalized 
witchcraft and provided for penalties of capital punishment, a prison sentence or a fine. The 
Special Rapporteur recommended that &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; be decriminalized, because it reinforced 
social stigmatization, led people to view the killing of alleged witches as legitimate, and 
lent itself to the persecution of women and children. The revised Code of 6 January 2010 
has replaced the death penalty with life in prison, a welcome, though insufficient, change &#8211; 
the Code still contains provisions criminalizing witchcraft.12 The continued criminalization 
of witchcraft perpetuates and legitimizes the widespread targeting of alleged witches and 
provides a convenient carte blanche for the killing of disfavoured individuals in many 
settings. 
</p>
<p>37. Workshops and trainings to address witchcraft issues are being held throughout the 
country at all levels. For example, there was a symposium on &#8220;Witchcraft and Justice&#8221; on 1 
and 2 August 2008 sponsored by the University of Bangui, the European Union, the French 
Cooperation, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA). The Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also put on a workshop on witchcraft that 
brought together prosecutors and judges from across the country to discuss the challenges 
and potential solutions. Despite this positive engagement on the issue, other stakeholders 
criticized the lack of follow-up to training sessions, pointing out that they tend to be 
conducted as one-off events, reducing their efficacy.

</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Security sector reform 
</b>38. Security sector reform is probably the area in which the Government has made the 
most progress since the original report of the Special Rapporteur. The Government, and in 
particular the Minister of Defence, has adopted a high level of responsibility for the process 
of security sector reform. This attitude represents a marked improvement since the 2008 
visit of the Special Rapporteur, when most interlocutors were fundamentally pessimistic in 
assessing the will of the Government to implement the necessary reforms. Today, most 
interlocutors express a tentative optimism about the commitment of the Government to 
security sector reform. 
</p>
<p>39. A national round table on security sector reform, held in April 2008, resulted in an 
action plan with a clear timetable of steps to be taken by the Government and others, 
including reforms to the justice system, police, gendarmerie, FACA and the Presidential 
Guard. A number of these reforms have been undertaken since April 2008, though 
primarily those changes that did not require funding.  
</p>
<p>40. On 28 and 29 October 2009, a donor conference on security sector reform was held 
in order to raise funding for 27 projects that would be impossible without international 
assistance. However, the conference was poorly planned, donor attendance was extremely 
low, and no new pledges were made. Another conference will be held, likely after the 
elections, to resubmit the project proposals to the donor community. 
41. Training of FACA has been somewhat improved. In September 2009, the 
Government established an office for international humanitarian law within FACA that is 
tasked with training members of the army on the laws of war. In 2009, human rights law 
and international humanitarian law were integrated into military training modules, and over 
5,575 members of the armed forces have participated in training sessions. 
</p>
<p>42. Despite these positive changes, the security forces continue to be unable to provide 
adequate protection for civilians outside of Bangui. Soldiers are ill-equipped and irregularly 
paid (their salaries are often in arrears for months). They thus lack both the capacity and the 
motivation to ensure security for local populations. FACA units patrol only minimally, and 
rarely, move beyond town limits. Furthermore, inadequate training has resulted in FACA 
employing methodologies that actually endanger civilians, failing to provide warning of 
impending military operations and using force indiscriminately. 
</p>
<p>43. In the initial report of the Special Rapporteur, he noted that recruitment for FACA 
and especially the Presidential Guard was politicized, and that both institutions needed to 
be reformed so that they worked for the people as a whole, rather than any single regime. 
There has been no noticeable change made in the recruitment processes for either the 
Presidential Guard or FACA. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Impunity and the criminal and military justice systems 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Progress on prosecutions  
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13466 
</p>
<p>45. Some progress had been made towards dismantling the longstanding culture of 
impunity in the country. With 250 cases of human rights violations referred to the judiciary 
and 80 convictions, 2009 was the most prolific year for prosecutions yet.13 Moreover, the 
end of 2009 saw the launch of a programme to train paralegals and open legal clinics. The 
Government also adopted a law to establish a High Court of Justice, which will have the 
competence to try cases of serious misconduct, including those involving State civil 
servants, cabinet ministers, members of parliament and the Head of State. Importantly, the 
Government adopted a revised Criminal Code in September 2009, which included 
domestically implementing the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court offences 
of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Continued impunity 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Permanent Military Tribunal is charged with trying crimes and violations of 
military law committed by members of the security forces. It remains largely ineffective, 
and sometimes does not even convene because it lacks the necessary funds from the 
Government. When the Tribunal does hear cases, they deal almost exclusively with lower-
ranking officials who have committed less serious offences. For example, the session of the 
Tribunal held from 15 to 24 April 2009 tried 30 cases involving the theft of arms, 
abandonment of positions, violence and arbitrary detention, and 1 case concerning the 
alleged killing of a police chief by the Presidential Guard in March 2009.14 
</p>
<p>47. Senior members of the military and of the Government have, without exception, 
escaped judicial scrutiny. The Special Rapporteur had recommended that all members of 
security forces implicated in abuses be suspended from duty, investigated and prosecuted. 
He called on the Government to begin the effort to end impunity by investigating Eug&#232;ne 
Nga&#239;koss&#233;, who is alleged to have commanded troops who carried out particularly 
egregious instances of village burnings, targeting of civilians and unlawful killings. Far 
from facing charges, he has instead been promoted to the rank of captain and placed in 
charge of a Presidential Guard brigade. The Central African Republic State Prosecutor has 
not yet even initiated prosecutions into the allegations against Captain Nga&#239;koss&#233;. 
Information provided by experts in the Central African Republic indicate that the 
Government has been &#8220;complacent&#8221; in seeking prosecution of members of the security 
forces, especially regarding abuses by the Presidential Guard and FACA in the north of the 
country. Interlocutors noted that a key cause was the lack of prosecutorial and judicial 
independence from the executive. 
</p>
<p>48. The general population&#8217;s access to, and knowledge of, the justice system remains 
minimal. Average citizens often rely on local justice mechanisms rather than the formal 
court system for redress. 
</p>
<p>49. Corruption is rampant throughout the judiciary, which has little independence from 
the Government. Judges are subject to intimidation, with threats to both their physical and 
job security. In the north, the courts, like everything else, have suffered from the ongoing 
insecurity. Many of the magistrates themselves have fled or been displaced by the conflict. 
</p>
<p>50. The amnesty law promulgated by the Government on 13 October 2008 also raises 
questions about whether the perpetrators of serious abuses in the Central African Republic

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13466 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>will be brought to justice.15 As the Special Rapporteur stated in his 2009 report 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.3, para. 67), it is important that the amnesty law only be applied to acts 
committed in the context of armed conflict, and that it not be applied to private acts or those 
in a law enforcement context. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>51. The International Criminal Court proceedings represent an important step in 
bringing perpetrators of some of the most egregious abuses in the history of the Central 
African Republic to justice.16 The Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court is 
working towards establishing responsibility for the crimes committed in 2002 and 2003, but 
has also continued to monitor allegations of crimes committed since the end of 2005. 
Particular attention should be paid to abuses committed by Central African Republic 
security forces in 2005&#8211;2007.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Corruption and economic reform 
</b>52. In his initial report, the Special Rapporteur noted that one factor that strongly 
contributed to the failure to implement required reforms was the country&#8217;s chronic lack of 
resources. The lack was in part due to widespread corruption, which diverted resources and 
inhibited investment. 
</p>
<p>53. The Government made some progress over the reporting period in combating 
corruption. A number of Government institutions have been audited and senior civil 
servants and heads of public companies are now required to declare their assets.17 
Significant efforts and resources will be required for the Central African Republic to 
develop functioning institutions and good governance. Interlocutors report that, particularly 
at the level of local government, officials largely view their duties as collecting taxes in 
order to pay civil servants, rather than seeing their ultimate objective as providing for the 
populations that they represent. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 The law grants amnesty for &#8220;all offences committed by members of the defence and security forces 
</p>
<p>and the civil and military authorities as part of their operations to maintain order and defend national 
territory&#8221; since the overthrow of former President Patass&#233; on 15 March 2003. In effect, the law 
constitutes a blanket pardon for Government security and defence forces as well as for many rebel 
fighters and specifically named political figures including former President Ange-F&#233;lix Patass&#233;, 
APRD President Jean-Jacques Demafouth and Abdoulaye Miskine. However, the law contains some 
critical and important limitations. First, the law recognizes the exclusion from the amnesty of 
perpetrators of acts amounting to war crimes, crimes against humanity or other crimes over which the 
International Criminal Court has jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 On 22 May 2007, International Criminal Court Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo announced that the 
</p>
<p>Court would open investigations into crimes committed in the Central African Republic in 2002&#8211;
2003, and would continue to gather evidence of current crimes. In the case of <i>The Prosecutor v. Jean-
Pierre Bemba Gombo</i>, Mr. Bemba, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Mouvement de 
liberation du Congo, is alleged to be criminally responsible for war crimes and crimes against 
humanity committed on the territory of the Central African Republic from 25 October 2002 to 15 
March 2003. Mr. Bemba was transferred to the International Criminal Court in July 2008 and is 
currently in pretrial proceedings before the Trial Chamber. The trial is due to begin in July 2010.

<p>54. With respect to the mining industry, the Central African Republic joined the 
Extractive Industries Transparencies Initiative as an implementing country on 21 November 
2008. It has until 20 November 2010 to validate its membership by fulfilling the 
requirements set by the Initiative.18  
</p>
<p><b> XI. Civil society and human rights monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The role of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the 
Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>55. The report of the Special Rapporteur noted that while the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) had an important role to 
play, its human rights section was in need of improvement (A/HRC/11/2/Add.3, para. 82). 
At the time of his visit, he recommended that peacebuilding and human rights monitoring 
be separated, perhaps with the establishment of an Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) office in the country, and he called for more pro-active 
monitoring and reporting. When his report was submitted to the United Nations, he noted 
that the recommendation to establish an OHCHR office had been superseded by reported 
efforts to strengthen OHCHR within BONUCA.  
</p>
<p>56. As of 1 January 2010, BONUCA became an integrated mission, the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA), but the 
ramifications, if any, of this shift for human rights promotion have yet to be determined. 
The two peacebuilding and human rights monitoring functions still remain part of the 
combined mandate of BINUCA, OHCHR has not established an office in the country, and 
it is far from clear that OHCHR has been strengthened within BONUCA. However, in an 
important step forward, February 2010 marked the first ever visit to the country by a United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the 
human rights section of BINUCA is planning to open two additional field offices. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Government has agreed to set up a National Human Rights Commission, 
although no concrete steps appear to have yet been taken to establish it. As was the case 
during the visit of the Special Rapporteur, a single Government ministry is tasked with 
human rights monitoring, but lacks independence from other Government organs, as well as 
the resources to effectively track abuses even within Bangui, let alone outside the capital. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings of humanitarian workers 
</b></p>
<p>58. Security threats to humanitarian organizations risk depriving regions most in need of 
humanitarian aid. On 21 August 2009, an LRA attack on a lorry hired by an international 
non-governmental organization, Cooperazione Internazionale, left two staff members dead 
and two others wounded (S/2009/627, para. 22). Three International Committee of the Red 
Cross and Cooperazione Internazionale local aid workers were killed in May and

</p>
<p>The Government of the Central African Republic made an unequivocal commitment to join the 
Initiative on 30 August 2007 and the application for candidate status was submitted on 26 September 
2008. </p>

</b></p>
<p>September 2009.19 Two staff members of Triangle G&#233;n&#233;ration Humanitaire, an international 
non-governmental organization, were kidnapped in Birao on 21 November 2009 and not 
released until March 2010. These attacks caused international organizations to temporarily 
suspend operations in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. The role of the international community  
</b></p>
<p>59. Some interlocutors expressed doubt that the international community was 
sufficiently committed to the Central African Republic. While the country, objectively, 
receives far less attention than many of its neighbours, 2009 did see an increased number of 
international visits, including by representatives of the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, the World Bank, UNICEF, the Peacebuilding Commission and the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. Some interlocutors noted that while the Central 
African Republic still largely remains overshadowed, this slightly more heightened 
engagement has motivated improved Government compliance with human rights and other 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>60. Better information sharing and collaboration within the international community 
would increase overall leverage with the Government and strengthen development 
programming. 
</p>
<p>61. On a positive note, the United Nations announced on 4 February 2010 that it was 
allocating an additional US$ 20 million from its Peacebuilding Fund to the Central African 
Republic, on top of the US$ 10.8 million it had already disbursed. The additional funds will 
be used to construct much-needed police barracks and new prisons, to establish the long-
awaited national human rights commission, and to develop a human rights action plan.20   
</p>
<p><b> XIII. Conclusion 
</b>62.<b> The Government deserves credit for having enacted some reforms in partial 
fulfilment of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, and for having reduced 
the number of killings perpetrated by Government forces. In particular, the high level 
of Government responsibility for security sector reform is to be commended, though it 
will be important to see this commitment translated into concrete action. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> In relation to many of the other recommendations of the Special Rapporteur, 
the Government has failed to make sufficient substantive progress and, in some cases, 
has made no progress at all. Although killings by rebel groups and Government forces 
have greatly diminished, extrajudicial killings by both of these groups, as well as by 
bandits, self-defence groups, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army, and the Chadian National 
Army, continue to threaten the lives of civilians throughout the country. Impunity for 
all killings, regardless of the perpetrator, continues unchecked. The Government 
neither protects civilians from abuses, nor prosecutes those who commit them. In the 
absence of serious Government steps to institutionalize or implement the many 
necessary reforms that have been identified, and significant international support for 
reform efforts, the pattern of abuse and impunity will continue.

<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Acknowledge, investigate, and prosecute serious human rights abuses 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Impunity should not be allowed to prevail for recent abuses in the north: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Government should effectively investigate the allegations of human 
rights abuses that have been made regarding the conduct of its security forces and provide a 
detailed public response, acknowledging abuses and identifying errors; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (b) All members of the security forces implicated in abuses should be suspended 
from duty, investigated and prosecuted. The Government should begin the effort to end 
impunity by investigating Lt. Eug&#232;ne Nga&#239;koss&#233; and his unit. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The Government and the international community should continue to support the 
important work of the International Criminal Court in the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; If the Government fails to take the steps listed above, the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Court should expand the existing investigation to take 
account of relevant crimes alleged to have been committed. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Reforms should be implemented in the criminal and military justice systems to 
promote accountability over the long-term: 
</p>
<p> (a) The reforms proposed by the Government to, inter alia, improve court 
infrastructure, recruit more magistrates and clerks, and revise magistrate training should be 
welcomed and supported by the international community; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (b) The role of gendarmes in gathering information and reporting on abuses by 
the military units which they accompany should be clarified and strengthened. Gendarmes 
should receive training in human rights and humanitarian law directed at ensuring that they 
investigate, report on and arrest perpetrators of abuses; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (c) Prosecutors and investigative judges should recognize their obligation to take 
on cases in which the security forces are implicated in serious abuses of human rights and 
humanitarian law, and treat such cases as a priority; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (d) The Criminal Code should be amended so that genocide, crimes against 
humanity, war crimes, and other offences under the Rome Statute are criminalized in 
domestic legislation;

<p> (e) The Permanent Military Tribunal should be provided with sufficient 
resources to hold regular sessions; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (f) There should be transparency regarding the investigation, prosecution and 
punishment of members of the security forces. The security forces should maintain records 
and regularly issue reports on allegations of abuse by soldiers and on the numbers of 
soldiers disciplined and referred for prosecution. Similarly, the Permanent Military 
Tribunal and administrators of the ordinary judicial system should regularly report on the 
status of cases against security force members. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Reform the military to effectively protect and respect human rights 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The Government&#8217;s proposed reforms to increase the resources and capability of the 
security forces should continue to be supported by the international community and 
be pursued in a manner that develops their capacity to both respect and protect 
human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The general instructions given by the President to end killings and other abuses 
against the civilian population should be specifically reflected in internal 
regulations, orders, training and other practices so as to prevent abuses from 
recurring in the future. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Training in human rights and humanitarian law should be provided to all members 
of the security forces and regularly reinforced. The President and senior 
commanders should further support respect for these bodies of law by issuing clear 
instructions: 
</p>
<p> (a) Soldiers should be instructed that they must obey international human rights 
and humanitarian law and that they have the obligation to disobey manifestly illegal orders 
and will otherwise be prosecuted; 
</p>
<p><i>There has been significant progress on this recommendation, but it has not 
been fully implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (b) Commanders should be instructed that they are criminally responsible when 
they knew or had reason to know that their subordinates were going to commit crimes and 
did not take all reasonable and necessary measures to prevent and punish those crimes. 
</p>
<p><i>There has been significant progress on this recommendation, but it has not 
been fully implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The FACA should be reformed so that it is seen to be an apolitical institution 
working on behalf of the people rather than of any single individual or regime. 
Relevant reforms would include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Recruitment and promotion processes should be regularized and based on 
merit and the development of a force representative of the society as a whole; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (b) A regular chain-of-command should be established and enforced; </p>

<p> (c) No military operation should be carried out except pursuant to a written order

investigated, and those involved disciplined and prosecuted; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (d) The FACA and other security forces should consult closely with local 
populations in the north in need of protection to reduce fears that the military will engage in 
abuses and to guide operations responding to banditry and cross-border raids; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (e) The FACA should be transformed into a truly countrywide force with 
soldiers based in key centres throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; A process should be embarked upon to permanently abolish the institution of a 
Presidential Guard &#8212; whatever it might be formally named &#8212; that plays any role 
other than providing close protection for the President: 
</p>
<p> (a) Donors should link assistance for reforms that increase the effectiveness and 
reliability of the military to steps taken to reduce the size and role of the Presidential Guard; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p> (b) Civil society groups should promote a popular non-partisan understanding 
that new presidents must accept the existing security forces rather than supplementing them 
with presidential guards, militias or mercenaries, and that the security forces must support 
whoever is president. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Address deaths in custody and killings by law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The practice in Bangui of prosecutors carrying out regular inspections of detention 
centres is a positive development, and should be implemented throughout the 
country. Reports of killings and other serious human rights abuses in detention 
centres should be fully investigated. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The human rights training provided to police in Bangui should be extended to law 
enforcement officers throughout the country. Such training should in particular focus 
on the lawful use of force in law enforcement operations, and the proper treatment of 
detained suspects. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>  End the killing of &#8220;witches&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The Criminal Code should be reformed to abolish the criminalization of 
&#8220;witchcraft&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Educational efforts should be made to bring an end to arbitrary and unjustified 
punitive measures against those accused of witchcraft. The killing of &#8220;witches&#8221; 
should be prosecuted like any other murder. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13466 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; All violations of the human rights of those accused of witchcraft should be 
investigated and prosecuted. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Improve independent human rights monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The arrangements for international human rights monitoring and assistance at the 
time of the visit were deeply unsatisfactory. The Special Rapporteur recommended 
then that the Government and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights engage in discussions aimed at the establishment of an OHCHR office in the 
Central African Republic. While this recommendation has subsequently been 
superseded by efforts to strengthen the OHCHR presence within BONUCA, it 
remains to be seen whether this formula is in fact viable. A detailed review of the 
effectiveness of the current mechanism should be undertaken when this 
recommendation is reviewed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s follow-up report on the 
Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The Government should establish a national human rights commission that is 
independent and that fully complies with international standards, including the Paris 
Principles. Such a commission should be a priority for development assistance 
agencies. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Local civil society organizations need to be strengthened. They play an 
indispensable role but are severely under-resourced and lack necessary technical 
expertise and facilities. 
</p>
<p><i>Efforts have been undertaken to implement this recommendation, but they 
have been largely unsuccessful. 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Promote economic reform 
</b></p>
<p> The extractive industries are a potentially substantial source of revenue for the 
country. Among other measures to increase revenue so that necessary reforms can be 
implemented, the Government should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Take the necessary steps to join the Extractive Industries Transparencies Initiative. 
<i>This recommendation has been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; With World Bank support, conduct an audit of the mining sector. 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.
