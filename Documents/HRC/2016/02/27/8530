<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report, submitted pursuant to the Human Rights Council decision 2/113 
of 27 November 2006, describes ongoing human rights concerns in Afghanistan and 
outlines recommendations to address them, as well as actions the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is taking to support and strengthen 
institutional capacity in the country through the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p> Throughout 2010, efforts to promote and protect human rights and build rule of law 
in the country were seriously challenged. The armed conflict intensified throughout 
Afghanistan with a corresponding rise in civilian casualties. Targeted assassinations, 
executions, abductions and intimidation of thousands of civilians by anti-Government 
elements throughout the country undermined international and Government efforts to 
provide protection and security in conflict-affected areas. The proportion of civilian 
casualties inflicted by pro-Government forces continued to decline during the year, 
however air strikes and night searches continue to place civilians at risk. Civilians also 
suffered from injury, loss of livelihood, displacement, destruction of property and 
disruption of access to education, health care and other essential services. Despite some 
gains in the spheres of health, education and employment opportunities, women continue to 
confront discriminatory laws and policies, attitudes and practices that violate their basic 
human rights. Harmful traditional practices against women and girls are widespread, 
occurring in varying degrees in all communities, urban and rural, and among all ethnic 
</p>

 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>groups. Lack of political will to seriously address a long history of egregious human rights 
violations is a significant factor driving the culture of impunity that is deeply entrenched in 
Afghan power structures and systems of governance. Detention-related laws, policies and 
practices by national authorities and to a lesser degree international military forces remain 
causes for concern.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 of 
27 November 2006 and has been prepared in cooperation with the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Since my last report (A/HRC/13/62), the 
human rights situation in Afghanistan has become more challenging. Long-standing human 
rights problems associated with the ongoing armed conflict, dysfunctional governance, 
widespread and deeply entrenched impunity, weak rule of law, coupled with extreme 
marginalization of and violence against women, pose significant challenges to the 
enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>2. The human cost of the armed conflict escalated during 2010 as civilian casualties &#8211; 
including deaths and injuries of civilians &#8211; increased by 20 per cent in the first 11 months of 
2010 over the same period in 2009. Civilians experienced an erosion of Government 
presence and a further decrease in protection in more areas of the country. At the same 
time, anti-Government elements (AGEs) increasingly undertook unlawful means of warfare 
through increased use of improvised explosive devices, suicide attacks and assassinations 
that violated Afghans&#8217; basic right to life and international humanitarian law principles. 
Although improved safeguards appear to have contributed to a significant reduction in 
civilian casualties by pro-Government forces (PGFs), these efforts must be sustained and 
increased to ensure improved protection for civilians. 
</p>
<p>3. Other ongoing human rights problems in Afghanistan have not been effectively 
addressed. Widespread harmful traditional practices, including child marriage, offering 
girls for dispute resolution, forced isolation in the home, exchange marriage and &#8220;honour&#8221; 
killings, continue to cause suffering, humiliation and marginalization for millions of women 
and girls. Such practices are grounded in discriminatory views and beliefs about the role 
and position of women in Afghan society, although some religious leaders reinforce these 
harmful customs by invoking their interpretation of Islam.  
</p>
<p>4. Impunity remains a major impediment to the re-establishment of the rule of law and 
respect for human rights. The Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme and 
reconciliation process have sent mixed messages about the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
providing accountability for serious international crimes and violations of human rights. 
Many human rights activists have voiced their concerns that impunity is not being seriously 
addressed in the ongoing peace process. 
</p>
<p>5. The ongoing lack of capacity of both the criminal justice and penal management 
systems continues to result in widespread arbitrary detention. Detention-related laws, 
policies and practices used by the national authorities and sometimes international military 
forces frequently result in prolonged detention without proper due process and oversight 
from judicial authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>6. The human cost of the armed conflict escalated in 2010. Civilian casualties &#8211; 
including deaths and injuries of civilians - increased by 20<b> </b>per cent in the first 11 months of 
2010 (1 January to 30 November) over the same period in 2009. Three quarters of all 
civilian casualties were linked to AGEs, an increase of 25<b> </b>per cent compared to 2009. At 
the same time, civilian casualties attributed to PGFs decreased by 20 per cent compared to 
the first 11 months of 2009. 
</p>
<p>7. Analyses by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR)/UNAMA showed two critical developments that increased harm to civilians in </p>


<p>2010. The number of civilians assassinated and executed by AGEs rose dramatically and 
AGEs used a greater number of larger and more sophisticated improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs) in more parts of the country. The devastating human impact of these tactics 
underscored that nine years into the conflict, measures to effectively protect civilians and 
minimize the impact of the conflict on Afghans&#8217; basic human rights are more urgent than 
ever.  
</p>
<p>8. Between 1 January and 30 November 2010, OHCHR/UNAMA documented a 
preliminary figure of 6,717 conflict-related civilian casualties, including 2,584 deaths and 
4,133 injuries. Over this period, AGEs were linked to the deaths and injuries of 5,162 
civilians (or 77 per cent of the total number of civilian casualties for this period), an 
increase of 25 per cent from the same period in 2009. Suicide and IED attacks caused the 
most civilian casualties attributed to AGEs, including 1,075 deaths (55 per cent of civilian 
deaths attributed to AGEs) and 2,291 injuries (71 per cent of civilian injuries attributed to 
AGEs). In the same period, OHCHR/UNAMA recorded 774 civilian casualties (or 11 per 
cent of the total number of civilian deaths and injuries) linked to PGFs, down 20 per cent 
from the same period in 2009. Aerial attacks caused the largest number of civilian 
casualties attributed to PGFs, including 165 deaths (41 per cent of civilian deaths attributed 
to PGFs) and 121 injuries (32 per cent of civilian injuries attributed to PGFs).   
</p>
<p>9. As civilian casualties rose in 2010, women and children made up a greater 
proportion of those killed and injured than in 2009. Women and children continued to 
experience an extreme lack of protection in conflict-affected areas along with widespread 
violations of their basic human rights. Between 1 January and 30 November 2010, IEDs 
and suicide attacks by AGEs caused the most women and children casualties - 33 per cent 
and 44 per cent, respectively. During this period, women casualties increased by 9 per cent 
and child casualties leapt by 56 per cent from 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Anti-Government elements 
</b></p>
<p>10. The 2,584 total civilian deaths in the first 11 months of 2010 represented a 15 per 
cent increase over the number documented in the same period in 2009. In total, 1,955 (76 
per cent of total civilian deaths) were attributed to AGEs, up 28 per cent from the first 11 
months in 2009. IEDs remained the deadliest tactic used by AGEs in the first 11 months of 
2010 and caused 33 per cent of all civilian deaths. OHCHR/UNAMA recorded 232 
civilians killed by suicide attacks and a further 442 killed by assassinations and executions, 
representing 10 per cent and 17 per cent of total civilian deaths, respectively. Of the deaths 
attributed to AGEs, some 39 per cent of women and 45 per cent of children died from IED 
explosions and suicide attacks &#8211; a 15 per cent increase in female deaths and 72 per cent 
increase in child deaths by those means over the number documented from 2009. 
OHCHR/UNAMA also recorded 247 incidents of abductions.  
</p>
<p>11. Compared with the same period in 2009, the number of civilians assassinated and 
executed by AGEs surged by more than 106 per cent in 2010. More than half of the civilian 
assassinations and executions occurred in southern Afghanistan, where more than 211 such 
incidents were noted as the Taliban expanded and strengthened its campaign of intimidation 
against a wider and larger group of civilians who worked for, or were perceived by the 
Taliban to be supportive of the Government of Afghanistan and international military 
forces. This campaign included assassinations, executions, abductions, night letters and 
threats. In one week alone in August, in Kandahar province, AGEs allegedly assassinated a 
former prosecutor, a sitting judge, a shura member, an off-duty Afghan National Police 
officer, a woman working for an international non-governmental organization (NGO) and 
an engineer working for an international company. Civilians targeted included teachers, 
nurses, doctors, tribal elders, community leaders, provincial and district officials, other </p>


<p>civilians and civilians working for international military forces and international 
organizations. The intensified pattern of assassinations reinforced the widespread 
perception by civilians that the Taliban can strike anywhere at anytime with impunity and 
that the Government and international forces are failing to protect them. 
</p>
<p>12. In the first 11 months of 2010, OHCHR/UNAMA documented a number of 
executions carried out by the Taliban in Badghis, Ghazni, Kandahar, Kunduz, Uruzgan and 
Wardak provinces. These incidents included the public execution of a woman by shooting 
on 7 August in Badghis province for alleged adultery, the public execution by stoning of a 
man and woman on 15 August in Kunduz province for alleged adultery,1 and the sentencing 
of two women to death on 14 October in Ghazni province for allegedly killing their mother-
in-law. A relative of the mother-in-law reportedly executed one of the women and the 
execution of the second woman, who is pregnant, is reportedly being delayed until she 
gives birth. OHCHR/UNAMA also recorded a number of other reported serious human 
rights violations including the execution (by hanging) of a 7-year-old boy accused of spying 
for the Government on 10 June in Helmand province and the assassination of a 12-year-old 
boy on 29 June in Ghazni province. These incidents indicate that AGEs commit serious 
human rights violations with full impunity and underscore the severe protection and 
accountability gaps that exist in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p><b>  Election-related violence 
</b></p>
<p>13. During the parliamentary election campaigning period from June to September 
2010, AGEs conducted a systematic and targeted assassination campaign against candidates 
and campaign workers. Between June and August, four candidates and 24 campaign 
workers were killed. On 18 September, election day, OHCHR/UNAMA documented 136 
civilian casualties including 33 deaths and 103 injuries, making it the most violent day in 
Afghanistan since the 2009 Presidential and Provincial Council elections, when 31 civilian 
deaths and 79 injuries (110 civilian casualties) were recorded. The eastern region recorded 
the highest number of casualties in the 2010 election, with 38 civilians killed and injured, 
followed by 26 recorded in the south-eastern region. The southern region saw a high 
number of security incidents, but few civilian casualties. On election day, most provinces 
experienced rocket attacks, IEDs and armed clashes, depriving many of their freedom of 
movement and their right to vote. Security incidents led to the closure of at least 153 
polling centres. Intimidation tactics by AGEs contributed to reduce the participation of 
voters, especially women voters, in different parts of the country.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Pro-Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>14. PGF military operations resulted in deaths and injuries of civilians as a result of air 
strikes, mortar attacks, escalation of force and cross-fire incidents. Between 1 January and 
30 November 2010, PGFs were linked to 401 deaths or 15 per cent of total civilian deaths, 
down 27 per cent from 2009.  
</p>
<p>15. OHCHR/UNAMA found a 52 per cent decrease in civilian deaths caused by aerial 
attacks carried out by PGFs compared to the same period in 2009. Tactical directives and 
standard operating procedures implemented by the International Security Assistance Force 
(ISAF) in 2010, including an August 2010 tactical directive on &#8220;disciplined use of force&#8221;, 
appear to have contributed to a significant reduction in civilian casualties by PGFs. The use 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The UNAMA Human Rights Unit has also received reports that the female victim&#8217;s killing was an 
</p>
<p>&#8220;honour killing&#8221; following complaints by some members of her family to the Taliban about her 
relationship with the male victim. </p>


<p>of aerial attacks in civilian areas, however, continued to claim the largest percentage of 
civilian casualties attributed to PGFs, causing 165 civilian deaths (41 per cent of the 401 
civilian deaths attributed to PGFs) and 121 injuries (32 per cent of the civilian injuries 
attributed to PGFs) in the first 11 months of 2010. OHCHR/UNAMA documented 
increased use of aerial attacks between July and October 2010, resulting in more alleged 
civilian casualties, particularly in the southern, northern and eastern regions of the country.  
</p>
<p>16. Search and seizure operations, mainly night searches, resulted in 63 deaths (16 per 
cent of civilian deaths by PGFs) and numerous detentions. Although night searches do not 
cause a large number of civilian casualties, these operations continue to cause anger and 
frustration within Afghan society. Communities&#8217; concerns included lack of effective 
investigation and prosecution for abuses that occurred during raids, lack of information 
regarding the location of persons detained in night raids and the inability to receive 
compensation for loss of life, injury and destruction of property. Communities also reported 
a continuing lack of cultural awareness and sensitivity on the part of certain troops involved 
in raids. Invasion of people&#8217;s homes, especially at night, searching of women&#8217;s quarters by 
men and violating the honour of women negatively effects the reputation and future of the 
entire family. 
</p>
<p>17. Escalation-of-force incidents (PGF shooting at suspected AGE attackers) accounted 
for 11 per cent of civilian deaths by PGFs in the same period.  
</p>
<p>18. Tactical directives and standard operating procedures implemented in 2010 by 
international military forces regulating night searches and rules of engagement on 
escalation of force, together with the July 2009 and August 2010 tactical directives 
restricting air strikes, appear to have contributed to a significant reduction in civilian 
casualties by PGFs. OHCHR/UNAMA welcomes the efforts of international military forces 
to minimize civilian deaths and injuries and urges these be further improved and sustained. 
At the same time, OHCHR/UNAMA highlights concerns about the lack of full 
implementation of directives and procedures on the ground, and the continuing lack of 
transparency on investigations and accountability for civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Advocacy on protection of civilian issues 
</b></p>
<p>19. OHCHR/UNAMA met with embassies, donors and Afghan and international 
military forces to advocate for implementation of the recommendations published in 
<i>Afghanistan: Mid Year Report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict 2010</i>. 
OHCHR/UNAMA held individual meetings with high-level officials at the Canadian 
embassy, the French embassy, the Norwegian embassy, and the embassies of the United 
States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and made 
presentations to a large group of key donors. Advocacy activities also included briefings on 
the report&#8217;s findings and recommendations, given to the Deputies Committee of the 
National Security Council and the Security Operations Group that advises the Deputies 
Committee, and to the Senior Security Shura, a high-level weekly meeting chaired by the 
Afghan Minister of Defence and attended by ISAF commander General David Petraeus. 
OHCHR/UNAMA held meetings at Camp Bastion in Helmand province, and in other 
regional command headquarters, with ISAF, the United States Marines and other 
interlocutors to discuss the report&#8217;s recommendations and civilian protection issues. 
</p>
<p>20. On 11 August 2010, the Taliban released a statement on their website criticizing the 
OHCHR/UNAMA 2010 mid-year report on the protection of civilians. The statement 
alleged that the report &#8220;is based on political expedience, exaggeration and propaganda 
instead of surfacing the facts&#8221; and was followed by another statement on 15 August calling 
for the establishment of a joint committee of the Taliban, OHCHR/UNAMA and ISAF to 
conduct investigations into civilian casualties. On 23 December, the Taliban released a </p>


<p>similar statement criticizing the OHCHR/UNAMA civilian casualty numbers for the first 
11 months of 2010 that indicated AGEs were linked to 76 per cent of all civilian casualties, 
a figure referred to in the December 2010 report of the Secretary-General to the Security 
Council on the situation in Afghanistan and its implications for internal peace and security 
(A/65/612-S/2010/630, para. 56). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>21. Violence against women and girls, including sexual violence and harmful traditional 
practices such as <i>ba&#8217;ad </i>(use of girls in marriage to settle disputes), so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; 
killings, early and forced marriages and rape continue to be persistent and widespread in 
Afghanistan. The misplaced stigma of sexual violence falling on the victim rather than the 
perpetrator and the lack of access to effective justice or remedies for victims have ensured 
that sexual violence and harmful traditional practices remain largely unaddressed either by 
the law enforcement institutions of Afghanistan or by Afghan society. The 2009 
OHCHR/UNAMA report <i>Silence</i> <i>is Violence: End the Abuse of Women in Afghanistan</i>, and 
the December 2010 report <i>Harmful Traditional Practices and Implementation of the Law 
on Elimination of Violence against Women in Afghanistan</i> confirmed these findings and 
provided recommendations for action. The latter report noted that harmful traditional 
practices serve to harm, degrade and marginalize women and girls and are often reinforced 
by certain interpretations of religious precepts. These practices are inconsistent with 
national laws, in particular the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women which 
criminalizes many harmful traditional practices, as well as sharia law and international law.  
</p>
<p>22. Based on country-wide research and case analysis, the report on harmful traditional 
practices documents particular customary practices that violate the rights of women and 
girls throughout Afghanistan and makes recommendations that would strengthen 
implementation of the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women  as the 
Government&#8217;s main tool to end harmful practices. The report found that although there had 
been some improvement in the State&#8217;s response to harmful practices and crimes of violence 
against women, the police and the judiciary often fail to impartially enforce the law and are 
unwilling or unable to implement laws that protect women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>23. Law enforcement officials frequently take a selective approach to administering 
justice. They pursue cases where women are perceived to have transgressed social norms 
and fail to act when women report violence or in cases of child marriage, claiming these are 
&#8220;private matters&#8221;. This situation is demonstrated by the large number of women detained in 
prisons for &#8220;moral crimes&#8221;. When social and cultural circumstances do not allow women 
and girls to oppose harmful traditional practices, or to escape violence, they sometimes run 
away from home. &#8220;Running away&#8221; is not a crime under Afghan law. Yet law enforcement 
authorities often arrest, jail and prosecute girls for running away. The charge is usually 
&#8220;intention&#8221; to commit <i>zina </i>(sexual intercourse outside of marriage).  
</p>
<p>24. On a positive note, OHCHR/UNAMA documented some improvements in the 
Government&#8217;s response to harmful traditional practices. The Ministry of Justice, with 
support from the UNAMA Human Rights Unit and other partners, is drafting a law that 
would regulate traditional dispute resolution mechanisms which have been found to 
frequently violate women&#8217;s rights. State authorities sometimes supported girls who objected 
to their forced marriage. Furthermore, some religious leaders have spoken out in favour of 
women&#8217;s rights. At a conference on International Women&#8217;s Day 2010 in Jalalabad, ulema 
members unanimously vowed to raise awareness against harmful practices in their teaching 
at mosques. OHCHR/UNAMA also found examples of religious figures condemning 
exchange marriages and high bride price.  </p>


<p>25. OHCHR/UNAMA continued its support to the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and 
provincial Departments of Women&#8217;s Affairs to strengthen their capacity to implement the 
law on Elimination of Violence against Women including through the establishment of a 
High Commission for the Prevention of Violence against Women and provincial 
commissions in compliance with the law and a June 2010 Council of Ministers decision. 
The provincial commissions are mandated to coordinate efforts between provincial 
authorities and NGOs to eliminate violence against women, through awareness-raising 
campaigns and monitoring and follow-up on individual cases of violence against women. 
Once commissions were set up, OHCHR/UNAMA supported their monitoring of police, 
prosecutors&#8217; and courts&#8217; implementation of the Law and coordination efforts.  
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR/UNAMA also conducted awareness-raising activities and training for 
women&#8217;s groups, mullahs, judges, prosecutors, police and tribal elders, particularly in rural 
areas, on the practices the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women criminalizes and 
on the duties and obligations of law enforcement authorities. Training included 
presentations on the law and specific measures that can be taken by the law enforcement 
authorities to ensure its implementation.  
</p>
<p>27. Given critical events such as the National Consultative Peace Jirga, the Kabul 
International Conference on Afghanistan (Kabul Conference) and elections for the lower 
house of the Parliament of Afghanistan, women&#8217;s participation in political processes 
assumed a central place on the agenda of human rights defenders in 2010. 
OHCHR/UNAMA worked to ensure that in all political processes aimed at restoring peace 
and economic prosperity in the country, women were physically represented and that 
women&#8217;s rights remained firmly on the agenda of all discussions. OHCHR/UNAMA 
facilitated a more regular dialogue between women&#8217;s groups and the UNAMA senior 
political leadership. OHCHR/UNAMA supported advocacy initiatives in line with Security 
Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, to promote women&#8217;s 
participation in decision making and to ensure that the issue of women&#8217;s rights remains a 
priority. 
</p>
<p>28. The participation of more than 300 women (25 per cent of the total number of 
participants) at the National Consultative Peace Jirga, held from 2 to 4 June, was widely 
viewed as a positive development largely attributed to the successful lobbying and 
advocacy of Afghan women&#8217;s associations and NGOs. OHCHR/UNAMA supported civil 
society by raising the issue of female participation in all appropriate forums. Following the 
<i>jirga</i>, the Afghan Women&#8217;s Network, an umbrella organization of Afghan women&#8217;s groups, 
issued a statement calling for a minimum of 25 per cent female participation in all peace-
making forums and international oversight to ensure that any peace deal does not violate 
women&#8217;s rights under the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>29. In the communiqu&#233; issued following the Kabul Conference,2 the Government of 
Afghanistan and its international partners reiterated the centrality of women&#8217;s rights, 
including political, economic and social equality, to the future of the country. They 
committed to assist all national ministries and sub-national government bodies in 
implementing their respective responsibilities under the National Action Plan for the 
Women of Afghanistan, and to ensure that all training and civic education programmes 
contribute to practical advancements in its implementation. In addition, the Government of 
Afghanistan is to develop a strategy to implement the Law on Elimination of Violence 
against Women, including services for victims.

<p>30. OHCHR/UNAMA worked with Afghan partners to promote and guarantee women&#8217;s 
representation in the parliamentary elections of 18 September 2010. Assurances were 
obtained from the Government that the 68 parliamentary seats constitutionally reserved for 
women (25 per cent) were a minimum and not a ceiling on female representation. In 
addition, the Government assured that where a female candidate won a non-reserved seat 
but was unable to take up elected office, the seat in question would go to the next female 
candidate who obtained the highest number of votes. More women contested the 2010 
parliamentary election, as 16 per cent of all candidates were women, up 4 per cent from the 
2005 parliamentary election. OHCHR/UNAMA documented reports of community 
resistance to their candidacies in addition to threats, harassment and attacks in some areas 
of the country. In Badakhshan province, for example, OHCHR/UNAMA received reports 
of religious leaders preaching against the participation of female candidates, urging people 
not to support females contesting the election. As the election date drew closer, 
OHCHR/UNAMA noted an increase in the incidents of threats and intimidation against 
female candidates, including the detonation of an IED outside a female candidate&#8217;s 
campaign offices in Taloquan city in Takhar province. On 30 August, one female 
parliamentary candidate&#8217;s five male campaign workers were abducted and killed in Herat 
province.  
</p>
<p>31. On 18 September, election day, intimidation tactics by AGEs contributed to reduce 
the participation of voters, especially women voters, in different parts of the country. In the 
south, the Taliban enforced restrictions on movement with oral threats, ad hoc road blocks 
and IEDs which prevented Afghans from exercising their right to vote. In the eastern region 
and in Wardak and Logar provinces in the central region, threats from AGEs, including the 
distribution of night letters, reportedly had a significant impact on voter turnout. With the 
exception of Bamyan, Day Kundi and Badakhshan provinces, and some cities, female voter 
turnout was medium to low. The International Election Commission reported that of the 4.3 
million estimated ballots cast, about 1.6 million were thought to have been cast at female 
polling stations, representing 37 per cent of the total number of ballots cast. High security 
risks, the co-location of female and male polling centres, inadequate or absent female 
polling staff and related cultural constraints kept women away from the polls in the 
southern and south-eastern regions in particular. Notwithstanding these challenges, 69 
women were elected to the lower house of the Afghan Parliament. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impunity and transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>32. Impunity remains the rule in Afghanistan, serving as a major impediment to building 
rule of law and respect for human rights. While the Government committed to revising the 
Action Plan for Peace, Reconciliation and Justice at the Kabul Conference in July, it has 
sent mixed messages about its commitment to ensuring accountability for serious 
international crimes and violations of human rights. As the gazetting of the Law on Public 
Amnesty and National Stability became known at the end of 2009, the Afghan Independent 
Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and civil society repeated calls for the Law to be 
revoked.  
</p>
<p>33. Questions about governmental commitment to end impunity were also raised during 
the initial stages of the Government&#8217;s efforts to create a sustainable peace, reintegration and 
reconciliation process. Civil society activists and the AIHRC repeatedly stressed the need to 
ensure that the process respect victims&#8217; needs for justice as well as the imperative of 
consolidating gains made in the constitution and legal framework that protect human rights, 
particularly the rights of women. A Victim&#8217;s Jirga for Justice, held in May 2010, provided a 
forum for those points to be made directly to the Government in advance of the 
Government&#8217;s National Consultative Peace Jirga held in early June. Victims of serious </p>


<p>human rights violations and international crimes recounted stories of their suffering and 
made clear their need for justice and accountability to be addressed in the peace process in 
some form. While the National Consultative Peace Jirga explicitly recognized the need to 
protect and respect the rights of women and children in its final 16-article resolution and 
reconciliation road map, the document failed to stress the imperative of accountability and 
justice as part of that process.   
</p>
<p>34. While the Government&#8217;s agreement to update the Action Plan for Peace, 
Reconciliation and Justice can be seen as a continued commitment to justice and combating 
impunity, the launching of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme and 
establishment of the High Peace Council created concern about governmental priorities in 
this area. This programme and its supervisory implementing body stressed the need to end 
the conflict through a variety of incentives to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate anti-
Government elements. While there is a vetting process envisioned in the document for 
assessing the suitability of combatants to take part in reintegration efforts, there is also 
frequent mention of &#8220;political amnesty&#8221; and &#8220;grievance resolution&#8221; to be extended to 
participants in the process. This amnesty is not explicitly defined in the document, but it is 
designed to allow combatants to leave the field of battle without fear of arrest or 
prosecution in the immediate term. Mention is made in the Afghan Peace and Reintegration 
Program text that the process is not a &#8220;framework for pardoning all crimes and providing 
blanket amnesty&#8221; without further elaboration.3 As a result many human rights advocates 
voiced their concerns that impunity was not being seriously addressed in the process and 
that, if successful, the resulting peace would be unsustainable, non-reflective of victims&#8217; 
concerns, and unjust. 
</p>
<p>35. Peace and reintegration initiatives designed to facilitate the release of detained 
combatants and the resolution of grievances raised human rights concerns. Prisoner release 
efforts began as part of the Government&#8217;s commitments to develop a peace process after the 
June National Consultative Peace Jirga, and a special Prisoner Release Committee was 
established. OHCHR/UNAMA monitored the Committee&#8217;s work and noted the release of 
more than 500 detainees. Human rights concerns included the non-transparent legal process 
involved in reviewing the cases of detainees and the grounds on which individuals are 
released. A core concern was that due process was not fully observed and that some 
suspected perpetrators of serious crimes and human rights violations were released for 
political reasons and not on strict legal grounds. Utilizing opaque or arbitrary grounds for 
release seriously further undermined rule of law and efforts to address impunity. The 
inclusion of &#8220;grievance resolution&#8221; mechanisms within the process of the Afghan Peace and 
Reintegration Programme also raised concerns that many suspects of serious international 
crimes and human rights violations could be absolved of criminal responsibility for political 
reasons or expediency. Uncertainty remains over how grievance resolution will work in 
practice in communities across the country. Vetting procedures, investigatory processes or 
related dispute resolution mechanisms have not been defined, but it is clear that this process 
will operate outside the formal justice system.  
</p>
<p>36. The creation of the High Peace Council in September 2010 raised concerns within 
civil society that the justice agenda was unlikely to feature prominently in the peace and 
reintegration process. President Hamid Karzai appointed 70 members to the High Peace 
Council on 28 September, a group that included only 10 women and only one member of 
civil society. Many members of the Council have been denounced as having been involved 
in serious human rights violations. As a result, Afghan civil society groups, including the 
Transitional Justice Coordination Group, a group of 20 representatives of human rights 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Afghanistan, &#8220;Afghan Peace and Reintegration Program&#8221;, programme document (Kabul, 2010), p. 9. </p>


<p>organizations in the country, the Afghan Women&#8217;s Network and the Civil Society and 
Human Rights Network, representing 56 human rights NGOs, made repeated calls for the 
membership of the High Peace Council to be reviewed and revised to give greater 
representation to women, victims and civil society in general. These recommendations 
featured in public statements, press conferences and the conclusions of a conference on 
Peace, Reconciliation and Justice. UNAMA, the Civil Society and Human Rights Network, 
the International Centre for Transitional Justice and the Open Society Foundations office in 
Afghanistan sponsored this latter event on 10 November 2010 in Kabul, to highlight the 
need for civil society&#8217;s active participation in the Afghan Peace and Reintegration 
Programme and for issues of justice to be among the Government&#8217;s core priorities. This 
event resulted in recommendations to the Government and the international community, 
reiterating the need for justice and accountability to be reflected in the peace process, for a 
truth-seeking mechanism to be created that gives voice to the suffering of victims of serious 
international crimes, and for a mechanism to facilitate civil society&#8217;s active participation in 
the peace and reintegration process as it moves forward. 
</p>
<p>37. On 31 October 2010, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Afghanistan established the Salaam Support Group, a group of experts tasked with 
providing technical assistance to the High Peace Council in implementing all aspects of its 
mandate. At the same time, OHCHR/UNAMA facilitated the effective participation of civil 
society in the peace and reconciliation process, particularly at the provincial and district 
levels as much of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme process is to be 
implemented by committees at the local level.   
</p>
<p>38. Concerns persist regarding the ability of local authorities to secure and protect mass 
graves discovered over several years of conflict. OHCHR/UNAMA continued to work with 
the AIHRC and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) to raise the importance of this issue 
for future investigations into serious international crimes. PHR held training sessions with 
prosecutors, police, investigators and other key justice sector actors during the year and a 
conference in Kabul in October to stress the need to protect such sites, to secure them for 
the long term and to develop the capacity to perform forensic investigations. Such 
investigations are critical not only to the process of identifying perpetrators, but also for 
confirming the identities of victims and establishing the truth of what happened for their 
families. PHR has previously reported several instances in which mass grave sites have 
been maliciously tampered with and evidence of serious crimes intentionally destroyed. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Protection from arbitrary detention and respect for fair trial 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>39. Detention remains a critical human rights concern in Afghanistan. Approximately 
18,000 detainees are held in a range of facilities across the country. This number increased 
rapidly in recent years with demand for detention space far outstripping the capacity of the 
existing infrastructure and human resources of both the criminal justice and penal 
management systems. Widespread arbitrary detention has long been a consequence of this 
situation. Gross and common instances of arbitrary detention include individuals who 
remain in detention despite having served their sentences or having been found not guilty 
by lower courts. Detainees are not informed of their right to remain silent, and 
interrogations before cases reach the courts are systematically carried out without defence 
counsel.   
</p>
<p>40. Following a commitment made at the Kabul Conference in July, the Government has 
begun work on a number of steps which, if fully implemented, could have a positive impact 
on the detention situation, including revision of the Criminal Procedure Code, and </p>


<p>development and implementation of a database on prisoners - an important step forward to 
keep accurate records and prevent arbitrary detention, especially post-trial.  
</p>
<p>41. Many detainees lack meaningful access to defence counsel. There are not enough 
qualified lawyers or funded legal aid programmes to meet the demand of criminal cases. 
There is a need to identify realistic and innovative approaches to expanding legal aid and 
awareness for accused persons. Neither the legal aid department of the Ministry of Justice 
nor legal aid NGOs can meet the existing demand. 
</p>
<p>42. The current detention-related laws and policies used by national authorities and, to a 
lesser degree, international military forces, remain major causes for concern. Given the lack 
of a legal framework that complies with the obligations of Afghanistan under international 
human rights and humanitarian legal standards and national applicable law, the need for 
reform is urgent. In some cases, OHCHR/UNAMA has observed changes to existing policy 
or practice in the international military forces contingents with limited improvement in the 
overall situation of detention, particularly in cases of individuals held due to their suspected 
involvement in the conflict. Current ISAF counterinsurgency policies as set down in the 
2006 ISAF Standard Operating Procedure on Detention of Non-ISAF Personnel, prescribes 
a 96-hour time limit for detaining persons in the conduct of military operations, after which 
time ISAF forces are required to either release or transfer detainees to Afghan authorities. 
Despite this 96-hour rule applying to all international military forces that are part of ISAF, 
several ISAF contributing countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and 
Canada have introduced national caveats to the Standard Operating Procedure. These 
caveats prolong detention without proper due process and oversight from Afghan judicial 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>43. In addition, the de facto recipient of many of these detainees is the National 
Directorate of Security (NDS) which takes custody over individuals transferred either 
directly from ISAF or indirectly through the Afghan National Police or the Afghan National 
Army. Some ISAF countries have signed memorandums of understanding with the 
Government of Afghanistan regulating the transfer of detainees from their respective ISAF 
contingents and have obtained certain diplomatic assurances about the treatment of these 
detainees, including that no transferred detainee will be subject to the death penalty. It 
appears that the memorandums of understanding provide that the representatives of the 
relevant ISAF country, the AIHRC and the International Committee of the Red Cross have 
access to transferred detainees. 
</p>
<p>44. Limited information is available from the Afghan authorities on the conditions and 
treatment of detainees transferred by ISAF to the Afghan authorities, in particular to NDS. 
Reliance on this institution, in particular is of concern, as NDS continues to operate without 
an explicit, public legal framework stipulating its powers of investigation, arrest, and 
detention. The operational rules and procedures of NDS regulating detention facilities 
under its control are classified and are not available to the public, defence counsel or 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>45. In September, OHCHR/UNAMA began to implement a country-wide detention 
monitoring and advocacy project on the conditions of confinement and respect for judicial 
guarantees for detainees. This initiative examined fair trial guarantees to and humane 
treatment of general pretrial detainees and NDS detainees. 
</p>
<p>46. NDS continues to operate detention facilities where detainees are held for substantial 
periods of time without access to either relatives or defence counsel, sometimes resulting in 
these detentions becoming incommunicado. Many detainees reported forced confessions or 
having signed or thumb printed papers that they could not read or understand. The same 
documents were used later as evidence against them before courts. NDS also sometimes </p>


<p>refused to release detainees who had been found innocent by the courts claiming that those 
acquittals were based on intimidation of judges or corruption. 
</p>
<p>47. Of equal concern are individuals detained during counter-insurgency operations by 
United States forces in Afghanistan. UNAMA has been following reforms in United States 
military operational procedures since September 2009, including the implementation of 
revised detainee review procedures and broader detention reforms in Afghanistan. United 
States forces closed the Bagram Theater Internment Facility and transferred all detainees to 
a new facility inside Bagram known as the Detention Facility in Parwan. They introduced 
new policies that included the establishment of a Detainee Review Board (DRB) and 
revised procedures for reviewing detention at the new facility. New DRB procedures afford 
detainees a personal representative to assist them during the proceedings, improved 
notification procedures, and the ability to attend hearings and call witnesses that are 
&#8220;reasonably available&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. While the new United States military detention review procedures are a marked 
improvement on previous practices, many points of concern still remain regarding detainee 
access to fair trial guarantees. OHCHR/UNAMA observed how these new procedures are 
being implemented, including the monitoring of DRB hearings. This review body 
determines whether a detainee in United States custody meets the criteria for detention, 
including whether he or she shall be released without conditions or transferred to Afghan 
authorities for criminal prosecution or participation in a reconciliation program. Detainees 
have no right to defence counsel in these proceedings, but rather are represented by an 
assigned personal representative (usually a military officer), who assists them with 
preparing and presenting their case and with challenging evidence. While these individuals 
are supposed to act in the best interests of their assigned detainee, very few representatives 
are available - only nine personal representatives to process more than 1,000 cases per 
year &#8211; limiting the effectiveness of the representation. Also, there are extreme restrictions 
on the amount of information available to a detainee under review as the United States 
forces made a great deal of information classified and therefore not directly available to 
detainees. Such restrictions result in a process in which a detainee and his or her 
representatives have a very difficult time mounting a credible defence. Since January 2010, 
approximately 1,500 individuals have undergone DRB hearings with a full release 
occurring in only 8 per cent of cases, an indicator that effective assistance of counsel is at 
least questionable in the majority of these review cases. OHCHR/UNAMA has proposed to 
the military that efforts be made to guard against arbitrary detention and to allow detainees 
a more meaningful mechanism to challenge their detention.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Support to national institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National Priority Programme for Human Rights and Civic 
Responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>49. OHCHR/UNAMA actively supported the participation of representatives of civil 
society and the AIHRC at the Kabul Conference held on 20 July. At the Kabul Conference, 
the Government pledged to implement, with civil society and the AIHRC, the National 
Priority Programme for Human Rights and Civic Responsibilities under the Governance 
Cluster. The Programme highlights the importance of human rights, legal awareness and 
civic education programmes targeting communities across Afghanistan to foster a more 
informed public and civil society, and to increase Government accountability. The AIHRC 
is the lead in coordinating activities among line ministries and civil society groups. 
OHCHR/UNAMA has been playing a supporting role as a member of the Programme 
Working Group.  </p>


<p>50. As per commitments made at the Kabul Conference, the AIHRC worked with line 
ministries and civil society to develop both a six-month action plan and a three-year work 
plan for implementation of the National Priority Programme for Human Rights and Civic 
Responsibilities. The Programme includes, inter alia, revised implementation timelines for 
the Action Plan for Peace, Reconciliation and Justice as well as planned activities to 
strengthen the technical capacity of the Human Rights Support Unit of the Ministry of 
Justice. As of September, the AIHRC had finalized its suggested revisions and submitted 
them to the Government for review, budgeting and further action. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission  
</b></p>
<p>51. OHCHR/UNAMA continued to provide technical support to the AIHRC both at the 
national and regional levels. OHCHR/UNAMA worked closely with the Special 
Investigation Team of the AIHRC on protection of civilians, and shared information on 
major cases that caused civilian casualties. In the 2010 Parliamentary election process, 
OHCHR/UNAMA provided technical assistance to the AIHRC by supporting the 
Commission&#8217;s election-related activities and participating in awareness-raising programmes 
in particular on women&#8217;s participation in the electoral process. 
</p>
<p>52. As part of its efforts to secure long-term sustainability and viability, the AIHRC, 
together with OHCHR/UNAMA and key donors, continued to urge the Government to 
provide State funding for AIHRC operations. The Government endorsed the need to 
provide funding for the AIHRC and to create a long-term independent budgetary 
mechanism that guarantees the Commission&#8217;s full independence.  
</p>
<p>53. The AIHRC welcomed this decision as a first step by the Government towards 
fulfilling its commitment to provide the Commission with political and financial support. 
Progress to date in implementing the decision of 18 October 2010 has been slow and the 
Ministry of Finance has raised questions regarding whether the Law on Budget may need to 
be amended to create the independent budgetary unit for the AIHRC. OHCHR/UNAMA 
has been assisting the AIHRC to explore State funding modalities that would not 
compromise the Commission&#8217;s independence, actual or perceived. An independent State 
funding mechanism is a core principle of legitimacy for national human rights institutions 
under the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights (Paris Principles) endorsed by the General Assembly in 1993. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Ministry of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>54. On 29 September, the Human Rights Support Unit within the Ministry of Justice 
was officially inaugurated. The Unit is responsible for strengthening the Government&#8217;s 
capacity to fulfil its international human rights obligations in conformity with the 
Constitution. The further development of the Unit was one of the commitments made at the 
Kabul Conference.  
</p>
<p>55. As part of its support to the Human Rights Support Unit, OHCHR/UNAMA 
conducted training on the human rights-based approach for newly recruited staff of the Unit 
to enhance their understanding of human rights mainstreaming in development planning at 
line ministries. OHCHR/UNAMA also facilitated a seminar to support the action plan 
designed by the Unit, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other stakeholders to implement 
the Human Rights Council&#8217;s universal periodic review recommendations in the 
Government. The Unit incorporated this into its annual work plan and has been seeking to 
synchronize its activities with the National Priority Programme for Human Rights and 
Civic Responsibilities endorsed at the Kabul Conference.  </p>


<p>56. Responding to the Secretary-General&#8217;s April 2010 finding that the Afghan National 
Police and several AGE groups were among &#8220;parties that recruit or use children, kill or 
maim children and/or commit rape and other forms of sexual violence against children in 
situations of armed conflict&#8221; (A/64/742-S/2010/181, annex I), the Government on 30 
November finalized an action plan to address concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Longstanding human rights concerns including rising civilian casualties and 
decreased protection for civilians due to intensified armed conflict, deeply entrenched 
impunity, the lack of functioning and independent &#8220;rule of law&#8221; institutions, and 
widespread practices that harm, degrade and humiliate women and deny them their 
basic human rights continue to seriously undermine efforts to promote and protect 
human rights in Afghanistan. While Government authorities have taken steps to build 
peace and rule of law, institutions remain weak. Legal and policy frameworks require 
considerable review, and reform and existing laws and policies that promote and 
protect human rights require much greater and more effective implementation. 
Afghanistan&#8217;s international partners should redouble support in these critical areas 
and ensure the protection of civilians and the rights of detainees in military and 
security operations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Taliban and other anti-Government elements should withdraw all 
orders and statements calling for the killing of civilians and reduce civilian casualties 
by complying with international humanitarian law, rules and principles including 
those rules the Taliban publicly committed to in the Taliban Code of Conduct and 
other documents on preventing civilian casualties when planning suicide attacks and 
acts of perfidy; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) International military forces and Afghan National Security Forces 
should fully implement measures designed to reduce civilian casualties and further 
strengthen civilian protection. They should institute immediate, credible, impartial 
and transparent investigations into all incidents involving civilian casualties, including 
public and prompt reports on the progress and results of investigations, and take 
appropriate disciplinary or criminal action against any individuals found responsible 
for violations of military or domestic criminal law. International military forces 
should provide timely, adequate and transparent compensation for civilians/victims of 
all military operations that result in death or injury of civilians or damage to civilian 
property; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government of Afghanistan should reaffirm its commitment to 
justice and combating impunity for perpetrators of serious international crimes and 
human rights violations. The Public Amnesty and National Stability Law should be 
revoked as it clearly violates the Constitutional provisions and the Government&#8217;s 
international treaty obligations;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government of Afghanistan at the highest levels, including the 
President, should continue to publicly emphasize that promotion and protection of 
women&#8217;s rights are an integral part and main priority of peace, reintegration and 
reconciliation and a central pillar of the country&#8217;s political, economic, and security 
strategies. The Government should expedite implementation of the National Action </b></p>


<p><b>Plan for the Women of Afghanistan, in particular a national strategy to implement the 
Elimination of Violence against Women Act, and international donors should increase 
support for these initiatives. As an immediate step, the President could, by decree, 
release from detention any woman or girl arrested for &#8220;running away&#8221;, which is not a 
crime under Afghan law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Supreme Court and the Office of the Attorney General should issue 
directives instructing the courts and prosecution offices to apply the Elimination of 
Violence against Women Act. Police and prosecutors should register all complaints of 
harmful traditional practices criminalized by the Act, and the Attorney General&#8217;s 
office should promptly investigate and prosecute such cases. The Ministry of Justice, 
in cooperation with the national High Commission for the Prevention of Violence 
against Women, should provide all law enforcement officials with training and 
capacity-building on the Act; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Religious leaders, together with the Ministry of Hajj and Religious 
Affairs and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, should develop and deliver training and 
awareness-raising programmes for mullahs, imams and religious teachers about 
women&#8217;s rights and the Elimination of Violence against Women Act. Religious leaders 
should speak out about harmful practices that are inconsistent with Islamic teaching 
and principles and hold open discussions among sharia experts on Islam and women&#8217;s 
rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) While the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme represents an 
important step forward in ending the conflict, the Government and its international 
partners should take all steps necessary to ensure that political amnesties are not used 
to exonerate suspected perpetrators of serious international crimes and human rights 
violations. Combatant vetting, grievance resolution and prisoner release mechanisms 
should not be used to circumvent the criminal law and procedure, but to reaffirm the 
need to strengthen the rule of law and judicial institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) As a matter of the utmost urgency, the Government should take steps to 
ensure greater participation and representation of civil society, especially women&#8217;s 
groups, in the peace and reintegration process;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Government and its international partners should take immediate 
steps to address deficiencies in the protection of fair trial rights for detainees. In this 
respect, priority actions should include increasing and improving detainee access to 
legal aid throughout the country, ensuring full and unfettered access of the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission to all detention facilities, especially those run by the National 
Directorate of Security, investigating all detainee allegations of ill-treatment and 
torture, and releasing all prisoners who remain in detention despite having served 
their full sentence or having been found innocent in the courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) To address inadequacies in the existing criminal justice framework, the 
Government and Parliament should expedite approval of the draft Criminal 
Procedure Code, as agreed at the Kabul International Conference on Afghanistan. 
The Government should establish a clear, public legal framework for National 
Directorate of Security operations of arrest and detention that removes the 
Directorate&#8217;s authority to operate separate detention facilities, reinforces the need for 
proper oversight of detainees and respect for their rights, and provides effective 
remedies for violations of such rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) International military forces present in Afghanistan, including those of 
the United States and other countries that contribute to the International Security 
Assistance Force, should expand or establish mechanisms that monitor and safeguard </b></p>


<p><b>those detainees transferred to the National Directorate of Security or Afghanistan 
National Security Forces to ensure such detainees are not subjected to torture, 
inhumane treatment and violations of fair trial rights. For detainees who remain in 
the custody of international military forces, procedural reforms should be 
consolidated and advanced that are designed to ensure detainee access to basic due 
process. Mechanisms, such as the United States military&#8217;s Detention Review Board, 
should be more transparent and respect detainees&#8217; needs for effective legal support 
and assistance during the process of review. This includes increasing the number and 
quality of personal representatives available to individuals in United States custody.
