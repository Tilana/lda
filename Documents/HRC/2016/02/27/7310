<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association conducted an official visit to Oman from 8 to 13 September 2014. The purpose 
</p>
<p>of the visit was to assess the exercise, promotion and protection of the rights under his 
</p>
<p>mandate.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur views the invitation that was extended to him by Oman as 
</p>
<p>testimony of the State&#8217;s willingness to engage in a frank, constructive and open dialogue on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights. He therefore presents his findings and offers his 
</p>
<p>recommendations in a spirit of shared endeavour and commitment, supporting the efforts of 
</p>
<p>Oman towards the realization of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association. 
</p>
<p>3. He thanks the Government for its cooperation before and during the conduct of the 
</p>
<p>mission and commends Oman for being the first Arab country to agree on an official 
</p>
<p>country visit. He had constructive talks with members of the executive, legislative and 
</p>
<p>judicial branches. He met with the Attorney General, the Minister for Social Development, 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Assistant Inspector General of 
</p>
<p>the Royal Oman Police, the Secretary-General of the State Council, the Chairman of the 
</p>
<p>Consultative Council and the Chairman of the Public Administration of Judgement 
</p>
<p>Enforcement. In addition to holding meetings in Muscat, the Special Rapporteur travelled 
</p>
<p>to Salalah, in the south of the country, where he met with the Adviser at the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Minister of State and Governor of Dhofar. The Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity 
</p>
<p>to consult with representatives of the National Human Rights Commission and with human 
</p>
<p>rights activists, both men and women, including lawyers, bloggers and researchers. He is 
</p>
<p>most grateful to all his interlocutors. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did 
</p>
<p>not accommodate his request to meet with Talib al-Mamari, a member of the lower 
</p>
<p>chamber of the parliament, who was convicted of convening an illegal gathering and is 
</p>
<p>currently serving a prison sentence at Sumail Central Prison. He also regrets that, although 
</p>
<p>he would have liked to meet with representatives from the Ministry of the Interior, he was 
</p>
<p>not accorded this opportunity. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the 
</p>
<p>importance of guaranteeing freedom of inquiry to mandate holders so that they can have 
</p>
<p>free access to prisons and representatives of central and local authorities of all branches of 
</p>
<p>Government, as provided for in the terms of reference for country visits (E/CN.4/1998/45). 
</p>
<p>Free access enables the Special Rapporteur to objectively assess the state of the rights under 
</p>
<p>his mandate. 
</p>
<p>5. In carrying out his visit, the Special Rapporteur was guided by several international 
</p>
<p>legal standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular its articles 21 and 22; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights; the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
</p>
<p>Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Freedoms; and relevant Human Rights Council resolutions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Political, economic, social and legal context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Oman is a hereditary monarchy headed by the Sultan, who is Head of State and 
</p>
<p>Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.  
</p>
<p>7. Among his other duties, the Sultan presides over the Council of Ministers, which 
</p>
<p>implements State policy. The Sultan appoints and dismisses ministers and other officials of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>equivalent status and authorizes and approves laws, decrees and accession to international 
</p>
<p>treaties (see HRI/CORE/OMN/2013, paras. 18&#8211;20). 
</p>
<p>8. A series of political reforms have gradually increased the representation in 
</p>
<p>government of elected officials, albeit in an advisory capacity. The legislative branch 
</p>
<p>comprises the Council of State (Majlis al-Dawla), with 83 members, including 15 women, 
</p>
<p>selected by the Sultan, and the Consultative Council (Majlis al-Shura). The Consultative 
</p>
<p>Council works as an advisory body to the Sultan, with limited powers to propose 
</p>
<p>legislation; it is composed of 84 members, including 1 woman, elected by universal 
</p>
<p>suffrage (ibid., paras. 21&#8211;26). 
</p>
<p>9. The Sultan chairs the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, an organ with supervisory 
</p>
<p>powers over the judicial system. Furthermore, the Sultan directly appoints and dismisses 
</p>
<p>senior judges and presides over the Council of Ministers, which is tasked with overseeing 
</p>
<p>compliance with court judgements. Though nominally independent (ibid., para. 27), the 
</p>
<p>judiciary remains strongly influenced by the executive.  
</p>
<p>10. Since the 1970s, Oman has made remarkable progress in developing its economy, 
</p>
<p>building infrastructure, widening access to education and improving health and basic 
</p>
<p>services, such as water, housing and electricity. The country has tried to diversify its 
</p>
<p>petroleum-dependent economy, promoting sectors based on renewable natural resources 
</p>
<p>such as agriculture and fishing, encouraging tourism and producing light industrial goods. 
</p>
<p>Oman has expanded its diplomatic relations, resolved its border disputes and assured a high 
</p>
<p>degree of internal stability in a region often subject to turbulence, tensions and conflicts. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the significant achievements made by Oman and 
</p>
<p>commends the people and the Government for the considerable progress they have made.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur also notes that Oman is blessed with a diversity of 
</p>
<p>ethnicities, cultures and nationalities and has remained largely cohesive and stable.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur notes the efforts made by Oman to consolidate the legal 
</p>
<p>framework for the protection and promotion of human rights. The Basic Law of Oman sets 
</p>
<p>out civil and political liberties for all, including the rights of expression and association, the 
</p>
<p>rights to private property and personal privacy and the right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>The rights of peaceful assembly and non-discrimination are, however, guaranteed only to 
</p>
<p>Omani citizens,1 contrary to best practices. In addition, a number of laws and decrees limit 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p>13. Oman is a party to international treaties relevant to peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association rights, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, 
</p>
<p>Oman has acceded to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination and to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>From 1998 to 2001, it ratified four relevant conventions of the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization (ILO).2  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Basic law of the Sultanate of Oman, promulgated by Royal Decree No. 101/96., arts. 32 and 17, 
</p>
<p>respectively. 
</p>
<p> 2 Oman ratified Conventions No. 29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour in 1998; No. 182 
</p>
<p>(1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
</p>
<p>Child Labour in 2001; No. 138 (1973) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment in 
</p>
<p>2005; and No. 105 (1957) concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour in 2005.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Basic Law of Oman provides that international law has primacy over national 
</p>
<p>laws,3 but the country has made reservations to articles 9, 15, 16 and 29 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to articles 7, 9, 14, 
</p>
<p>21 and 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Special Rapporteur is pleased 
</p>
<p>that Oman has recently lifted four of its reservations to the latter treaty and limited the 
</p>
<p>scope of another reservation (see A/HRC/17/7, para. 12). Oman undertook to examine 
</p>
<p>recommendations to remove its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women (ibid., para. 90.16). 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur regrets that Oman has neither acceded to the core universal 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, nor ratified the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment or the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of their Families. The Special Rapporteur notes that, during its 
</p>
<p>review in the framework of the universal periodic review mechanism in January 2011, 
</p>
<p>Oman agreed to consider accession to the basic international instruments and postponed for 
</p>
<p>further consideration the recommendations to sign and accede to the Covenants and their 
</p>
<p>optional protocols (ibid., paras. 87 and 89.2). The Special Rapporteur was informed by 
</p>
<p>multiple government officials that the Government was currently considering ratifying 
</p>
<p>those instruments. He urges the Government to ratify the instruments at its earliest 
</p>
<p>opportunity. While he agrees that States should take seriously any commitments they make 
</p>
<p>and should therefore be prepared to implement the relevant obligations, that should not be 
</p>
<p>used as an excuse to indefinitely delay ratification. The Special Rapporteur is convinced 
</p>
<p>that the great strides that Oman has made in transforming and modernizing its society in the 
</p>
<p>past 40 years signal the abundant capacity of the State to successfully implement the core 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that Oman has accepted a 
</p>
<p>recommendation to examine the possibility of extending an open invitation to all special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders in line with its belief in an open and constructive engagement 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations human rights mechanisms (see A/HRC/17/2, para. 367) and that it 
</p>
<p>welcomes visits conducted by all special procedures in compliance with the established 
</p>
<p>procedures therefore (see A/HRC/17/7/Add.1, para. 90.27). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the exercise of the right to freedom  
of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>17. Article 32 of the Basic Law of Oman provides that &#8220;citizens have the right to 
</p>
<p>assemble within the limits of the Law&#8221;, but there are no laws that clearly and explicitly 
</p>
<p>establish the presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies or, generally speaking, 
</p>
<p>which promote the right to peaceful assembly. Rather, most laws impose limits.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Article (72) states that &#8220;The application of this Basic Statute shall not prejudice treaties and 
</p>
<p>agreements the Sultanate has entered into with other countries, international bodies and 
</p>
<p>organisations&#8221;. Article (80) states that &#8220;No authority in the State may issue regulations, statutes, 
</p>
<p>decisions or directives that contradict the provisions of laws and decrees in force, or international 
</p>
<p>treaties and agreements which constitute part of the Law of the Land&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>18. For example, articles 137 and 138 of the Penal Code criminalize seditious assembly, 
</p>
<p>which is defined as &#8220;a private gathering including at least 10 individuals with a view to 
</p>
<p>committing a riot or a breach of public order&#8221;. The punishment for not dispersing an 
</p>
<p>assembly following an order by the authorities is between 10 days and one year in prison 
</p>
<p>and a fine not exceeding 50 rials. Furthermore, the law places limits on assembly rights that 
</p>
<p>are vague and susceptible to misuse by the authorities. For example, &#8220;anyone who commits 
</p>
<p>an act &#8230; expressing hatred and contempt&#8221; faces between three months and three years in 
</p>
<p>prison and a fine of up to 500 rials. Article 130 bis of the Criminal Code provides for 
</p>
<p>punishment of &#8220;anyone who promotes religious or sectarian dissension, or stirs up feelings 
</p>
<p>of hatred among the country&#8217;s population&#8221; by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 
</p>
<p>10 years.4 Terms such as &#8220;hatred&#8221;, &#8220;contempt&#8221; and &#8220;dissension&#8221; are ambiguous and are not 
</p>
<p>defined in the law.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur finds that the country&#8217;s legal framework is not conducive to 
</p>
<p>the free and unhindered exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. He is 
</p>
<p>particularly concerned that: 
</p>
<p>(a) The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is not recognized for everyone. In 
</p>
<p>a country where a significant percentage of the population consists of migrant workers, 
</p>
<p>restricting their rights to peacefully gather to express their concerns amounts to denying 
</p>
<p>them an outlet to air their grievances. It places them at a higher risk of violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses that may go unreported, uninvestigated and unpunished. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that groups that are disenfranchised from mainstream political activities, such 
</p>
<p>as voting and holding office, have an even greater need for alternative means to participate 
</p>
<p>in the public sphere. Peaceful assemblies are an important tool for allowing the voices of 
</p>
<p>otherwise excluded groups to be heard (see A/HRC/26/29, para. 25);  
</p>
<p>(b) The legal framework lends itself to the criminalization of the exercise of 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and opens the 
</p>
<p>door to judicial harassment, persecution and intimidation of individuals peacefully 
</p>
<p>exercising that right. Under the Penal Code, the actions of libelling or expressing public 
</p>
<p>criticism of the Sultan,5 committing an affront to an official in service &#8220;publicly by 
</p>
<p>publication and by speech or gestures&#8221;6 and blaspheming or &#8220;pronounc[ing] a curse at his 
</p>
<p>Prophets&#8221;7 are all punishable by a maximum sentence of three years and/or a fine of up to 
</p>
<p>500 rials. Article 312 of the Code also makes the actions of disturbing &#8220;public tranquillity 
</p>
<p>by screaming or making noise, with no reason, or by using any noisy device &#8230; in public or 
</p>
<p>private places&#8221;8 and obstructing public roads9 punishable by prison sentences and/or fines;  
</p>
<p>(c) Some provisions in the laws are so broadly worded as to allow virtually 
</p>
<p>unlimited interpretations of what could be an offence. That places excessive discretion in 
</p>
<p>the hands of implementing authorities and creates uncertainty about what the law means for 
</p>
<p>those exercising their rights. Some of the prohibitions impair the very essence of the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of peaceful assembly, opinion and expression. For example, article 34 of the 
</p>
<p>Penal Code defines public crimes as: 
</p>
<p>The ones perpetrated by the following means: (1) Acts and gestures committed in a 
</p>
<p>public place, or a place open to the public or exposed to sight, or those seen, due to 
</p>
<p>the offender&#8217;s fault, by an individual not intervening in the act or gesture; (2) Speech 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Royal Decree No. 72/2001, Assault Against the State&#8217;s Internal Security. 
</p>
<p> 5 Royal Decree 7/74 establishing the Omani Penal Code, 16 February 1974, art. 126. 
</p>
<p> 6 Ibid., art. 173. 
</p>
<p> 7 Ibid., art. 209 (1). 
</p>
<p> 8 Ibid., art. 312 (4). 
</p>
<p> 9 Ibid., art. 312 (11). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>and screams either made directly by the offender or through devices, so as they are 
</p>
<p>heard by an individual not intervening in such speech or screams; (3) Various 
</p>
<p>writings, drawings, pictures, photographies, films, emblems, if shown in a public 
</p>
<p>place or a place open to the public&#8221;. Article 223 prohibits homosexuality and states 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;the suspects of homosexual or lesbian intercourse shall be prosecuted without a 
</p>
<p>prior complaint, if the act results in a public scandal.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Public scandal is defined in the same way as public crime, making it de facto illegal for 
</p>
<p>individuals to peacefully gather to claim the rights of sexual minorities; 
</p>
<p>(d) The laws allow the authorities wide powers to monitor people&#8217;s activities, 
</p>
<p>infringing the right to privacy and &#8220;chilling&#8221; social interaction and political activity. For 
</p>
<p>example, the Telecommunications Act makes it illegal to knowingly send a message, by 
</p>
<p>any form of communication, that violates public order and morals or is harmful to any 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s safety.10 The Law on Press and Publications authorizes the Government to censor, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, communication exchanges made using any sort of device, including the Internet 
</p>
<p>and smartphone applications, that might prejudice the safety and security of the State, 
</p>
<p>without the permission of the competent authorities, or that might defame the Sultan, 
</p>
<p>implicitly or explicitly, offend the ruling system or promote matters violating &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>principles of the true Islamic religion&#8221;.11 In interactions with civil society activists, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was repeatedly told of hacked e-mail and social media accounts and of 
</p>
<p>civil society activists who were repeatedly summonsed to meet with intelligence officers, 
</p>
<p>who had detailed knowledge of their movements and activities. Such surveillance, even if it 
</p>
<p>does not lead to formal criminal charges, has the effect of intimidating people and 
</p>
<p>spreading fear among those who wish to speak out and work for reforms in Oman. Most 
</p>
<p>activists that the Special Rapporteur met with believed that it was designed with that goal in 
</p>
<p>mind.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Practice 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s extensive discussions with civil society actors and 
</p>
<p>authorities revealed a predominant concern on the part of the State with maintaining peace, 
</p>
<p>order and stability, to the extent of excessive control. Those are legitimate concerns for any 
</p>
<p>State, but it is essential that the measures taken to ensure stability do not impair the essence 
</p>
<p>of any fundamental right. Restrictions must also meet the strict standards of necessity and 
</p>
<p>proportionality set out in international law. The Special Rapporteur has previously stressed 
</p>
<p>that there should be a presumption in favour of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, 
</p>
<p>meaning that assemblies should be deemed de facto lawful and as not constituting a threat 
</p>
<p>to public order (see A/HRC/23/39, paras. 49-50). He is therefore concerned at the reports 
</p>
<p>from Oman of restrictions on assemblies, excessive use of force by the police, threats, 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrests, abductions, detentions in secret locations and torture at the hands of 
</p>
<p>authorities.  
</p>
<p>21. During meetings with civil society activists, the Special Rapporteur heard harrowing 
</p>
<p>reports of activists who had been kidnapped off the streets, sometimes hooded and 
</p>
<p>handcuffed, and taken to secret detention locations, where they were interrogated for long 
</p>
<p>hours and often detained for days. Several sources who had been detained reported that they 
</p>
<p>were subjected to loud music at all hours and that authorities sometimes left the lights on

</p>
<p>24 hours a day.12 Beyond detention, activists are subjected to stigmatization in the largely 
</p>
<p>government-controlled press, which not only affects the activists themselves but also 
</p>
<p>members of their families, thus chilling their activities. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that arrests and prosecutions for certain 
</p>
<p>offences, particularly defamation of the Sultan, illegal gatherings and attempts to overthrow 
</p>
<p>the Government, are used not to punish actual criminal activity but to suppress activists 
</p>
<p>who call for reform and advocate for increased realization of human rights. His concern is 
</p>
<p>not allayed by the fact that some activists arrested are not subsequently prosecuted. Rather, 
</p>
<p>he believes that the practice of &#8220;arrest-interrogate-release&#8221; could be used as a tactic to 
</p>
<p>intimidate and control. That practice should be vigorously discouraged. Activists know that 
</p>
<p>charges stemming from an earlier arrest could be revived at opportune times and used as 
</p>
<p>leverage to discourage them from continuing their activities.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was informed that gatherings of more than nine people 
</p>
<p>required de facto approval from authorities, an administrative procedure that cannot be 
</p>
<p>contested before a court of law. The authorities are under no obligation to offer reasons for 
</p>
<p>their decision to disperse an assembly and can broadly interpret what is perceived to be a 
</p>
<p>threat to public order. Under international law, prior authorization is not required for the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly. At most, a prior notification regime may be 
</p>
<p>in place to enable the authorities to take measures to facilitate the assembly and to protect 
</p>
<p>public safety and the rights and freedoms of others (see A/HRC/20/27, para. 28). 
</p>
<p>Spontaneous gatherings should be recognized by law and exempted from prior notification 
</p>
<p>requirements (ibid., para. 29). 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur met with several activists who described how they and their 
</p>
<p>colleagues had been arrested or in several cases abducted, transported to secret detention 
</p>
<p>locations, denied access to their lawyers and not brought before court within the stipulated 
</p>
<p>period of 48 hours. Ismail al-Muqbali described how he was kept in solitary confinement 
</p>
<p>for three months. It was only after 60 days in detention that he was brought before a court. 
</p>
<p>25. The authorities also frequently prevail upon the owners of establishments open to 
</p>
<p>the public, such as coffee shops, hotels and Internet cafes, not to host meetings to discuss 
</p>
<p>issues that are deemed political or critical of the Government. The Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that awareness-raising meetings that are open to the public, such as book clubs 
</p>
<p>and even social gatherings, have all been targeted by the authorities for dispersal. 
</p>
<p>26. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council in April 2013, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur said that he was very concerned about the high number of arrests, of charges 
</p>
<p>and of sentencing against individuals who had taken part in or had monitored peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies during the reporting period, and that the replies transmitted by the Government 
</p>
<p>had not dispelled his concerns about the physical and psychological integrity of individuals 
</p>
<p>exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in the country (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/39/Add.2, para. 300). 
</p>
<p>27. His concerns were heightened by reports of non-governmental organizations and the 
</p>
<p>media referring to the unprecedented use of force and mass arrests of peaceful protestors 
</p>
<p>who gathered in Muscat and Sohar in January and February 2011 to demand, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>better working conditions, higher standards in education, the end of corruption and 
</p>
<p>economic and political reforms. Furthermore, reports indicate that a massive peaceful 
</p>
<p>protest was violently dispersed by the police in Sohar in April 2011, resulting in one death, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 The Committee against Torture has noted that sleep deprivation, when used for prolonged periods, 
</p>
<p>constitutes a breach of the Convention against Torture (see, for example, CCPR/C/USA/CO/3/Rev.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 13). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>dozens of injuries and 23 arrests. In May 2011, about 80 people were arrested in Muscat 
</p>
<p>while participating in a peaceful protest calling for the release of other protestors, 
</p>
<p>themselves recently arrested in Muscat, Salalah and Sohar. Among the detainees were 
</p>
<p>young lawyers, bloggers, writers and members of unregistered organizations, including 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>28. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the authorities acknowledged arresting 
</p>
<p>protestors and placing several in solitary confinement following the peaceful protests in 
</p>
<p>January and February 2011. They also admitted that one person had been killed on 27 
</p>
<p>February 2011 and another on 28 April 2011 following a protest and that investigations 
</p>
<p>were ongoing. They further confirmed that individuals involved in the protests had been 
</p>
<p>arrested at their homes in March 2011, but that they had been released without charges after 
</p>
<p>signing pledges not to commit acts of destruction of public property (see A/HRC/18/51, 
</p>
<p>case No. OMN 1/2011). The Government has also informed the special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council that the court of first instance released all the remaining accused on 
</p>
<p>18 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur joined an urgent appeal to Oman on 21 June 2012 
</p>
<p>concerning the reported arrests of three members of the Omani Group for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>including one woman, while on their way to Fohod oil field to monitor a strike on 31 May 
</p>
<p>2012 (A/HRC/22/67, p. 23). In its reply, the Government stated that the three individuals 
</p>
<p>had been handed over to the Public Prosecutor on the charges of &#8220;incit[ing] participation in 
</p>
<p>a strike gathering&#8221; and &#8220;stir[ring] unrest in the oil sector&#8221; (ibid.). During the country visit, 
</p>
<p>government representatives asserted that the Group had had no authorization or mandate to 
</p>
<p>go into the oil fields. While the Special Rapporteur does not dispute the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>position that the oil fields are vital installations on which the economy depends, he does not 
</p>
<p>consider that this necessarily implies that no peaceful assemblies or monitoring of 
</p>
<p>assemblies can take place at those locations. He reiterates that blanket restrictions on 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies are intrinsically disproportionate and should thus not be imposed (see 
</p>
<p>A/68/299, para. 25). 
</p>
<p>30. In the weeks that followed the arrests of the Omani Group for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>members, the authorities reportedly began actively apprehending online activists for their 
</p>
<p>comments on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The police also reportedly 
</p>
<p>cracked down on a peaceful sit-in calling for the release of political detainees and arrested 
</p>
<p>more than 20 people for seditious assembly, blocking traffic, insulting the Sultan and using 
</p>
<p>the Internet to publish defamatory material.13  
</p>
<p>31. Following a series of group trials during July, August and September 2012, the 
</p>
<p>Muscat court of first instance reportedly convicted 29 people and sentenced 28 of them to 
</p>
<p>between 6 and 18 months in prison and to fines ranging from 200 to 1,000 rials.14 
</p>
<p>According to reports, the appeal court in Muscat upheld all the convictions in December 
</p>
<p>2012. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the case of 11 people, including two 
</p>
<p>women, who were convicted in 2012 on charges including insulting the Sultan, using the 
</p>
<p>Internet to send defamatory material, unlawfully gathering and publishing harmful and 
</p>
<p>provocative material. The Special Rapporteur sent a joint appeal to Oman on 27 February 
</p>
<p>2013, 15 days after the 11 detainees reportedly started a hunger strike over delays in 
</p>

</p>
<p>processing their cases (see A/HRC/23/51, case OMN 1/2013). On 22 March, the 
</p>
<p>Government informed the special procedures of the Human Rights Council that the Sultan 
</p>
<p>had pardoned the 11 individuals. 
</p>
<p>33. In August 2013, the Special Rapporteur received information on additional protest 
</p>
<p>movements in Liwa, a city north of Sohar, against the pollution of the waters of the port by 
</p>
<p>petrochemical industries. Police reportedly dispersed the demonstrations with tear gas and 
</p>
<p>water cannons and arrested several people, including Talib al-Mamari, who was elected to 
</p>
<p>the Consultative Council in 2011 and known for his moderate critical opinions. Mr. Al-
</p>
<p>Mamari was reportedly arrested at night at his brother&#8217;s home and charged with inciting a 
</p>
<p>crowd and seditious assembly. His sentence was reportedly upheld by the court of appeal, 
</p>
<p>but overturned by the Supreme Court because of a procedural error. The retrial was held in 
</p>
<p>Muscat on 6 August 2014. He reportedly faces a four-year prison term and is currently in 
</p>
<p>custody awaiting his appeal. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur firmly believes that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association apply both offline and online, as the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>has affirmed in its resolutions 21/16 and 26/13. He was therefore concerned to hear during 
</p>
<p>his visit that the authorities had reportedly employed a variety of tactics to clamp down on 
</p>
<p>and control the use of information and communications technology. There are widespread 
</p>
<p>reports that authorities systematically hack into online accounts and hijack them and flood 
</p>
<p>social media such as Twitter with an endless stream of hashtag references, thus disrupting 
</p>
<p>discussion on specific topics. The example of the Omani Group for Human Rights is 
</p>
<p>instructive. In addition to online surveillance, authorities reportedly went as far as 
</p>
<p>preventing the group members from communicating on WhatsApp. Voice over Internet 
</p>
<p>Protocol services such as Skype are blocked in Oman, a situation that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur experienced first hand. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that States have the 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure that online assemblies are facilitated in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>35. Members of civil society who met with the Special Rapporteur made repeated 
</p>
<p>mention of the Internal Security Forces of Oman, a government agency that they say is 
</p>
<p>primarily responsible for the reported harassment, abduction, unlawful detention and torture 
</p>
<p>of peaceful protestors. The Special Rapporteur wishes to restate his deep regret that his 
</p>
<p>requests to meet with representatives from the agency were not granted. It would appear 
</p>
<p>that the body is a key interlocutor and the Government lost an opportunity to engage in 
</p>
<p>frank discussions on the role it plays. Of greater concern is the opaqueness with which the 
</p>
<p>agency operates. Officials from the Government itself told the Special Rapporteur that the 
</p>
<p>agency is a secret intelligence unit with an unknown configuration and budget that reports 
</p>
<p>directly to the Sultan.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is also unaware as to where the agency stands in relation to 
</p>
<p>the Royal Oman Police, the latter being the authorities officially charged with maintaining 
</p>
<p>law and order in the country. The police is the only body authorized to carry out arrests. Its 
</p>
<p>Directorate General of Operations plans and implements police activities related to 
</p>
<p>maintaining public security and safety. The Directorate also makes decisions on the 
</p>
<p>granting of permits to hold assemblies and the security arrangements during these events. </p>

<p><b> IV. Challenges to the exercise of the right to freedom 
of association 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>37. The right to freedom to form associations is virtually non-existent in Oman, despite 
</p>
<p>the fact that it is nominally protected as a constitutional right under article 33 of the Basic 
</p>
<p>Law. The 1972 Law on Associations, since amended several times,15 places severe and 
</p>
<p>sweeping restrictions on the right, making it virtually impossible to establish a legal 
</p>
<p>association without government consent, cooperation and control. The law, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Limits the type of associations that may be formed, their objectives and the 
</p>
<p>areas that they can cover; 
</p>
<p>(b) Bans political parties; 
</p>
<p>(c) Makes registration mandatory; 
</p>
<p>(d) Gives the Ministry of Social Development unbridled discretion to approve or 
</p>
<p>deny registration applications for any reason the Minister deems relevant; 
</p>
<p>(e) Requires associations to obtain government approval before they work with, 
</p>
<p>or receive funding from, foreign organizations; 
</p>
<p>(f) Requires associations to notify the Government of any planned meeting at 
</p>
<p>least 15 days in advance and to provide a copy of the meeting minutes; 
</p>
<p>(g) Prescribes that a representative of the Government attend the meetings of 
</p>
<p>associations. 
</p>
<p>38. The provisions run counter to the most elementary precepts of international law on 
</p>
<p>the subject of freedom of association, and effectively turn associations into pseudo-
</p>
<p>governmental bodies. It is critical that associations have the ability to remain independent 
</p>
<p>of the Government, as the right to freedom of association is fundamentally a matter of 
</p>
<p>providing a vehicle for individuals to come together and express their concerns, free of 
</p>
<p>official sanction or interference. It is to be expected that people&#8217;s concerns &#8212; in any 
</p>
<p>country &#8212; would include criticism of the Government and its policies. Excessive 
</p>
<p>government control over the establishment and operation of associations is a natural 
</p>
<p>obstacle to that. The Government pledged to amend the law during its universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review in January 2011. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear during his visit that 
</p>
<p>the law was being reviewed, but expresses his disappointment that the Government did not 
</p>
<p>share an official draft of the law or elaborate on the specific changes that were being made. 
</p>
<p>He hopes that the amendments will greatly improve the current legal environment and place 
</p>
<p>the emphasis on creating an enabling environment for civil society. He remains available 
</p>
<p>for technical assistance on the content of the law. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, political parties and other associations that &#8220;are against Oman&#8217;s statutes 
</p>
<p>or social and economic systems&#8221; are banned under article 134 of the Penal Code. Any 
</p>
<p>breach of these provisions results in the dissolution of the association, confiscation of 
</p>
<p>assets, 3 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment of the founding members and the board of directors and 
</p>
<p>a five-year prohibition on their right to hold a leadership position in an association. 
</p>
<p>Members face one to three years&#8217; imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See Royal Decrees 14/2000, 30/2001 and 23/2007. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>40. In addition, the Special Rapporteur refers to the following laws, which also limit the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of association rights in Oman: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Law on Labour Unions gives workers the right to form trade unions.16 
</p>
<p>According to Ministerial Decision 570/2012, a trade union can be formed by any private 
</p>
<p>sector organization with 25 or more employees and, once registered, has an independent 
</p>
<p>legal identity.17 The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the recent efforts made by 
</p>
<p>Oman in bringing Omani law closer into alignment with international standards. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he has received reports criticizing the far-reaching influence of the 
</p>
<p>Government over the General Labour Union, the umbrella organization that serves as a 
</p>
<p>confederation of Oman&#8217;s labour unions; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Law on Nationality provides that an Omani born citizen will lose his/her 
</p>
<p>citizenship if he or she  belongs to a group, party or organization that embraces principles 
</p>
<p>or doctrine harming Oman&#8217;s interests, or either works for a foreign country in any capacity 
</p>
<p>in or outside Oman and does not resign before the imposed deadline or works in favour of a 
</p>
<p>hostile State.18 The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the law could be used to threaten 
</p>
<p>or punish civil society activists who gather to express dissent or criticism in a specific field 
</p>
<p>of common interest. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Practice 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about the restrictive environment for 
</p>
<p>the exercise of the right to freedom of association in Oman.19 The authorities cite security 
</p>
<p>considerations as the rationale for such a restrictive approach to that right in Oman. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur believes strongly that restrictive approaches to both that 
</p>
<p>right and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are actually counter-productive. It is 
</p>
<p>natural and inevitable for people in any society at some point to experience dissatisfaction, 
</p>
<p>the urge to improve things and even anger. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>of association are safety valves that allow such emotions to be released in a non-violent and 
</p>
<p>productive manner. Individuals need to feel that they have the means to bring about change 
</p>
<p>peacefully and to improve things or gain redress. If they do not, they will find other ways to 
</p>
<p>change things and, as has been seen in recent years, many such ways can be extremist, non-
</p>
<p>peaceful or unproductive. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur believes that restrictions on 
</p>
<p>peaceful and open civil society movements are likely to push associations underground, 
</p>
<p>where they are marginalized, criminalized and ultimately more likely to transform into 
</p>
<p>extremist movements. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the role of the Ministry of Social 
</p>
<p>Development in the regulation of associations. The Ministry is an executive-branch body 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 Royal Decree 35/2003, as amended by Royal Decree 74/2006 on Labour Unions, dated 8 July 2006. 
</p>
<p> 17 Ministerial Decision 570/2012 promulgating the formation, functioning and registration of trade 
</p>
<p>syndicates, trade unions and the General Federation of Oman Trade Unions, 15 October 2014. 
</p>
<p> 18 Royal Decree 1/1972 as amended by Royal Decree 38/2014, Nationality, 11 August 2014. 
</p>
<p> 19 The Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women reviewed Oman in 2001 and 2006, and 2011, respectively. The latter Committee said 
</p>
<p>that it was &#8220;concerned about the absence of a vibrant civil society, including autonomous and active 
women&#8217;s human rights organizations&#8221; (see CEDAW/C/OMN/CO/1, para. 31). The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child stated in 2001 that &#8220;insufficient efforts have been made to involve civil society, 
particularly in the area of civil rights and freedoms, with respect to awareness-raising and in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention&#8221; (see CRC/C/15/Add.161, para. 14), but took note in 2006 of the 
&#8220;active role played by civil society in the provision of services, particularly health and social services, 
for example for children with disabilities&#8221; (see CRC/C/OMN/CO/2, para. 20). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>whose Department of Social Societies and Community Clubs exercises vast control over 
</p>
<p>the civil society sector, including handling the registration of associations, monitoring 
</p>
<p>associations&#8217; operations and supervising their activities. In addition, the Department limits 
</p>
<p>registration to associations that fall under the one of its four identified thematic branches:  
</p>
<p>(a) The department of charities and funds, for associations that contribute to 
</p>
<p>social care and economic, social and cultural development; 
</p>
<p>(b) The department of professional associations, for associations that represent 
</p>
<p>professional branches; 
</p>
<p>(c) The department of Omani women&#8217;s associations, for associations that work 
</p>
<p>in the social and cultural spheres;  
</p>
<p>(d) The department of community social clubs, for associations that organize 
</p>
<p>cultural, social and sporting activities.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur finds it troubling that an executive branch body has total 
</p>
<p>authority over who can form and operate an association and on what issues associations can 
</p>
<p>focus. The Minister for Social Development informed the Special Rapporteur that 
</p>
<p>associations would not be denied registration provided that they met the requirements of the 
</p>
<p>law and did not duplicate the activities of an association already registered. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed of situations in Oman where political organizations had been 
</p>
<p>denied registration because their work was &#8220;already covered&#8221; by other associations.20 Other 
</p>
<p>sources told the Special Rapporteur that an association working to protect forest land in the 
</p>
<p>Dhofar region had been denied registration because its work was &#8220;too similar&#8221; to that of 
</p>
<p>another group based in Muscat working more generally on environmental issues. 
</p>
<p>44. In the same vein, the Special Rapporteur received a report indicating that, on 3 June 
</p>
<p>2014, the Ministry of Social Development had rejected the registration application of an 
</p>
<p>association for people with visual disabilities on the basis that an association for the blind 
</p>
<p>already existed in Oman. The association filed a case first in the court of first instance and 
</p>
<p>then in the Court of Appeal, arguing that the definition of &#8220;visual disabilities&#8221; was wider 
</p>
<p>than &#8220;blind&#8221; and that the pre-existing association for the blind was limited to adults. The 
</p>
<p>court ruled against it in June 2014, basing its decision on the rightful use by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Social Development of its margin of discretion, as stipulated in the Law on Associations. 
</p>
<p>45. An adverse effect of the Ministry of Social Development&#8217;s immense power over 
</p>
<p>registrations is the centralization of decision-making in Muscat. As such, it is probably not 
</p>
<p>a coincidence that most of the registered associations in Oman are located in Muscat. This 
</p>
<p>centralization serves to silence the needs and demands of civil society organizations in 
</p>
<p>regions outside the capital. It is not enough for Muscat-based organizations to open 
</p>
<p>branches outside of the capital; there is also a need for robust and independent associations 
</p>
<p>at the local and grass-roots levels.  
</p>
<p>46. Associations can be de-registered if they do not carry out the activities for which 
</p>
<p>they were established. If the association is deemed not to be running smoothly, the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Social Development may step in to suggest restructuring to &#8220;promote efficiency&#8221;. In the 
</p>
<p>view of the Special Rapporteur, this expansive oversight by the Ministry constitutes 
</p>
<p>unjustifiable interference in the operations and activities of associations. 
</p>
<p>47. Independence from the Government and other institutions is one of the founding 
</p>
<p>aspects of the right to freedom of association. The right is meant to empower individuals to 
</p>
<p>come together and work for their interests, so long as they are doing so for legal and 
</p>

</p>
<p> 20 Reply of the Minister of Social Development when questioned about registration arrangements for 
</p>
<p>political organizations, Muscat, 9 September 2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>peaceful purposes. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to accord civil society 
</p>
<p>actors the same freedom to establish themselves as businesses, even where they are 
</p>
<p>working on the same issues. It is unlikely that Government would step in to restructure a 
</p>
<p>private business, even if it was deemed to be &#8220;operating inefficiently&#8221;, or that the 
</p>
<p>Government would prohibit, for example, the establishment of a hotel because another was 
</p>
<p>established in the same area. There is no justifiable reason to distinguish between civil 
</p>
<p>society and business sector organizations, both of which are non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned at the inability to associate of those 
</p>
<p>independent activists who express dissenting views. The activists that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur met with in Oman and elsewhere, from both domestic and international 
</p>
<p>organizations, reported that the right to associate to express critical opinions is virtually 
</p>
<p>non-existent. 
</p>
<p>49. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there were 26 professional 
</p>
<p>associations, 28 charities, 54 women&#8217;s associations, 12 community clubs and 196 labour 
</p>
<p>unions registered in Oman.21 There was, however, a total lack of associations with 
</p>
<p>objectives falling outside the scope of work defined by the Department of Social Societies 
</p>
<p>and Community Clubs. The main activities of registered associations are the support and 
</p>
<p>financing of economic, social and cultural programmes. For example, the work of women's 
</p>
<p>associations is restricted to health, education and poverty reduction. The Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concern that equality between 
</p>
<p>women and men is limited to the public rights and does not extend to the private sphere 
</p>
<p>relations of family and marriage (see CEDAW/C/OMN/CO/1, para. 13). However, there are 
</p>
<p>no women&#8217;s associations in Oman that strive to achieve equality between women and men 
</p>
<p>from a civil and political rights perspective or work on human rights issues, such as 
</p>
<p>violence against women. 
</p>
<p>50. Associations pursuing political reforms and government accountability and 
</p>
<p>transparency are systematically denied registration. For example, the Change and Reform 
</p>
<p>and Association against Corruption associations were both denied registration in 2011. That 
</p>
<p>is all the more striking because both the Government and civil society repeatedly raised the 
</p>
<p>issue of corruption in their meetings with the Special Rapporteur, with all concerned 
</p>
<p>expressing the need to combat it. The Special Rapporteur underlines that this is a point of 
</p>
<p>convergence between the authorities and civil society that Government officials should 
</p>
<p>welcome. Voices from outside the Government are needed to end corruption and hold the 
</p>
<p>Government accountable. It is axiomatic that organizations, whether private or public, 
</p>
<p>require independent, external audits in order to be deemed credible and transparent. 
</p>
<p>51. In meetings with the Government, several officials also emphasized that Omani 
</p>
<p>society valued a culture of consensus. The Special Rapporteur considers that consensus 
</p>
<p>requires open, unhindered dialogue among all stakeholders and should not involve silencing 
</p>
<p>dissenting or critical voices. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that an independent, free 
</p>
<p>and robust civil society is a valuable partner in drawing up and implementing policies for 
</p>
<p>combating corruption and promoting further growth. 
</p>
<p>52. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by the inability of activists in 
</p>
<p>Oman to associate freely online. As noted above, he observed first-hand that access to some 
</p>
<p>of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia through Voice 
</p>
<p>over Internet Protocol and instant messaging services was limited, and a number of 
</p>
<p>bloggers and writers have been imprisoned for allegedly expressing dissenting views 
</p>
<p>online.

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of new communication 
</p>
<p>technologies and the integral role they play in the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association. On 26 June 2014, the Human Rights Council adopted 
</p>
<p>its resolution 26/13, on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the 
</p>
<p>Internet. Furthermore, in its resolution 21/16, the Council reminded States of their 
</p>
<p>obligation to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully 
</p>
<p>and associate freely, online as well as offline. The Special Rapporteur echoes those calls 
</p>
<p>and argues that information and communications technology is integral to the exercise of 
</p>
<p>assembly and association rights. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the technology is 
</p>
<p>both a means to facilitate fundamental rights offline and a virtual space where the rights 
</p>
<p>themselves can be actively exercised.  
</p>
<p><b> V. National Human Rights Commission  
</b></p>
<p>54. Royal Decree 124/2008 of 15 November 2008 establishes the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission and defines its prerogatives. Article 1 of the Decree provides that the 
</p>
<p>Commission is administratively affiliated to the Council of State. The Decree stipulates that 
</p>
<p>the Commission shall be independent and that it has been established for the &#8220;protection 
</p>
<p>and follow up of human rights and freedom in the Sultanate according to basic statute of the 
</p>
<p>State and the international covenants and agreements&#8221;.22  
</p>
<p>55. The Commission is mandated to, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Monitor human rights violations; 
</p>
<p>(b) Liaise with the concerned authorities on matters related to human rights; 
</p>
<p>(c) Submit to the Council of Ministers for approval an annual workplan on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of human rights; 
</p>
<p>(d) Coordinate input on human rights from foreign States, international 
</p>
<p>organizations and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur notes that the International Coordinating Committee of 
</p>
<p>National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights accredited the 
</p>
<p>Commission with B status in November 2013, i.e. not fully in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights (Paris Principles). The Sub-Committee on Accreditation considered the 
</p>
<p>following factors in assigning the grade: 
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Representatives</b>. Royal Decree 124/2004 stipulates that the Commission 
</p>
<p>shall have 14 members, of which two are members of the legislative branch and six of the 
</p>
<p>executive. The Sub-Committee considers that government officials should not be 
</p>
<p>represented in a national human rights institution. For the same reason, members of 
</p>
<p>parliament should not be members of nor participate in the decision-making organs of such 
</p>
<p>institutions. Their presence and participation in the decision-making body of such 
</p>
<p>institutions has the potential to affect both the real and perceived independence of the 
</p>
<p>institution;23 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(b) <b>Mandate</b>. The Decree fails to provide the Commission with a clear mandate 
</p>
<p>and appropriate powers to promote and protect human rights in the areas specifically 
</p>
<p>highlighted by the Paris Principles;24 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Selection</b>. The Decree fails to meet the requirement for clear, transparent and 
</p>
<p>participatory selection of candidates.25 
</p>
<p>57. When reviewing Oman, the Sub-Committee looked at the questions of immunity, 
</p>
<p>tenure of members, interaction with the international human rights system, annual reports, 
</p>
<p>funding and conflict of interests, and encouraged the Commission to advocate for the 
</p>
<p>inclusion in Royal Decree 124/2008 of a specific mandate to encourage the ratification and 
</p>
<p>implementation by Oman of international human rights standards.26 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur echoes the Sub-Committee&#8217;s concerns. Civil society 
</p>
<p>activists similarly expressed a lack of confidence in the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission, and felt that the Commission could do more to bridge the gap between the 
</p>
<p>Government and civil society. The Special Rapporteur agrees. The members of the 
</p>
<p>Commission corroborated that sentiment when they admitted that civil society activists did 
</p>
<p>not approach the Commission with information on violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes the work done by the Commission in monitoring and 
</p>
<p>reporting on peaceful assemblies, including observing the trials of those arrested during 
</p>
<p>such assemblies, while recognizing the limitations in its mandate. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is pleased to learn that Oman supported the recommendations made during its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review to establish an independent national human rights commission and adapt it 
</p>
<p>fully to the Paris Principles, with a broad and clear mandate.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, although the scope of Commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>mandate is of concern, its credibility depends upon how it executes its existing mandate. He 
</p>
<p>was encouraged by the positive energy displayed by the members and staff of the 
</p>
<p>Commission. He notes with appreciation that the Commission is seeking to strengthen its 
</p>
<p>role by, inter alia, advocating for the ratification of ILO conventions No. 87 (1948) 
</p>
<p>concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and No. 98 
</p>
<p>(1949) concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain 
</p>
<p>Collectively; encouraging associations to participate in the next universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>exercise; visiting detainees in prisons; and disseminating information about human rights 
</p>
<p>though meetings with various stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the 
</p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s robust engagement with the issues that fall within the current scope of its 
</p>
<p>mandate is a good indication that a new, better-defined mandate, together with appropriate 
</p>
<p>powers, would be a useful tool in the hands of the Commission.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur remains available to provide technical assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Commission on the rights under his mandate.

</p>
<p>universal periodic review, and responding to requests for technical assistance by the

<p>64. The Special Rapporteur urges OHCHR to continue its activities in providing

<p>technical support to government institutions and civil society. He also urges it to reach out

<p>to local civil society activists, particularly online civil and political rights activists, 
</p>
<p>including women, both within and outside of Muscat.

<p><b> VII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are both 
</b></p>
<p><b>platforms and collective exercises of other fundamental freedoms; they foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability, ethnic equity, cultural diversity, tolerance, participation and good 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance, which in turn promote stability and peace.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>In his meetings with the Government, the Special Rapporteur observed a 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent focus on maintaining peace, order and stability in Oman, often used as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rationale for limiting assembly and association rights. Nevertheless, in his view, 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights are the foundation for true and sustainable stability. Stability flows 
</b></p>
<p><b>organically through involvement and consensus, as part of a social contract in which 
</b></p>
<p><b>everyone freely participates.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The legal environment for the exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association in Oman is problematic and needs to be strengthened 
</b></p>
<p>with reference to international human rights standards. The country&#8217;s impressive 
</p>
<p><b>achievements in building the economy, maintaining stability and modernizing society 
</b></p>
<p><b>are threatened in the long term by a climate in which the populace is not free to 
</b></p>
<p><b>associate and organize itself to address its concerns or pursue its own interests. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Silencing voices of dissent is not a viable approach going forward. When a 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government fails to provide an outlet for popular sentiment, it loses a valuable 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunity to feel the pulse of the nation, and effectively creates a sealed vessel under 
</b></p>
<p><b>pressure that will eventually explode with dire consequences.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes the recommendations below, confident that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government will take their implementation as an opportunity to consolidate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress of Oman towards the realizations of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association. Its efforts would undoubtedly resonate at the regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international levels and influence other countries positively. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates that he stands ready to provide technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation to the Government as it implements the recommendations. </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to offer the following general

</b></p>
<p><b>interest of ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights by everyone in Oman; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Ensure in law and in practice that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association play a decisive role in the emergence and maintenance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective democratic systems as channels for dialogue, pluralism, tolerance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>broadmindedness, where minority or dissenting views or beliefs are respected; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Ensure a conducive and safe environment for everyone exercising or 
</b></p>
<p><b>seeking to exercise his or her rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association, abolish legislation that criminalizes homosexuality and ensure that State 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations to achieve non-discrimination and equality are immediate and not subject 
</b></p>
<p><b>to progressive realization (see A/HRC/26/29, para. 19); 
</b></p>
<p>(e)<b> Ensure that no one is criminalized for exercising the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly or of association, or subjected to threats or use of violence,
