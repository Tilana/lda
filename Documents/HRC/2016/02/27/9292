<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The mandate of the independent expert on minority issues was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/79. The independent expert is required<i>, 
</i>inter alia, to promote the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging 
to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and to identify best practices by 
States and possibilities for technical cooperation by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. The independent expert submitted her previous report to 
the Human Rights Council in February 2007, in which she provided a summary of her activities 
and addressed in detail the thematic issue of minorities, poverty and the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p> The present report provides a summary of the activities undertaken by the independent 
expert. Since the submission of her previous annual report, the independent expert has 
undertaken official country missions to France, from 19 to 28 September 2007, and to the 
Dominican Republic, from 22 to 29 October 2007. Her visit to the Dominican Republic was 
conducted jointly with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> Over the past year, the independent expert has conducted thematic work on issues relating 
to the discriminatory denial or deprivation of citizenship as a tool for exclusion of national, 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, which is the thematic focus of the present report. That 
work included convening an expert seminar on the subject in Geneva in December 2007. 
Minorities often face discrimination and exclusion, and they struggle to gain access to their 
human rights, even under conditions of full and unquestioned citizenship. Denying or stripping 
them of citizenship can be an effective method of compounding their vulnerability, and can even 
lead to mass expulsion. Once denied or deprived of citizenship, minorities are inevitably denied 
protection of their basic rights and freedoms, including minority rights as established in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
and Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p> According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, close to 15 million 
people in more than 49 countries are stateless, and numbers appear to be increasing. Many 
minorities live in a precarious legal situation because, even though they may be entitled under 
law to citizenship in the State in which they live, they are often denied or deprived of that right 
and may in fact exist in a situation of statelessness. While many conditions give rise to the 
creation of statelessness, including protracted refugee situations and State succession, most 
stateless persons today are members of minority groups. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert is pleased to submit to the Human Rights Council her third annual 
report pursuant to Council resolution 2005/79. The present report provides an overview of her 
activities since her previous report, submitted in February 2007 (A/HRC/4/9) as well as a 
thematic analysis of issues as they relate to minorities and the denial or deprivation of 
citizenship. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the presentation of her previous report, the independent expert has undertaken 
official country missions to France, from 19 to 28 September 2007 (A/HRC/7/23/Add.2) and to 
the Dominican Republic, from 22 to 29 October 2007 (A/HRC/7/23/Add.3), the latter conducted 
jointly with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>3. In pursuance of the independent expert&#8217;s mandate to promote the implementation of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Minorities and to identify best practices in every region, she 
welcomes the positive responses of the Government of Guyana and the Government of Greece to 
her request for a country visit in 2008. She looks forward to continuing a dialogue with 
Bangladesh, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Panama, Surinam, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand and Turkey, to whom she has made requests to visit. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Activities 
</b></p>
<p>4. Supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), on 29 and 30 January 2007, the independent expert held an expert consultation aimed 
at assisting regional and national institutions with respect to standard setting and effective 
mechanisms to combat discrimination and protect the rights of minorities. The proceedings of 
the consultation, which was held in close consultation with the Organization of American States, 
considered regional perspectives on minorities, discrimination and intolerance. The outcomes 
contributed substantively to a revised draft Inter-American Convention against Racism and All 
Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance. The expert consultation benefitted from the 
participation of civil society representatives and other international experts and practitioners 
from every region. 
</p>
<p>5. With a view to enhancing her collaboration with United Nations treaty bodies, and 
particularly the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in March 2007, the 
independent expert held a second official dialogue with the Committee, during which she 
discussed possibilities for collaboration with a view to contributing to the Committee&#8217;s capacity 
to consider minority issues in its work, including with respect to its early warning, urgent action 
and follow-up mechanisms. The independent expert has also engaged with the Committee on 
country-specific issues and welcomes opportunities to enhance coordination of their respective 
mandates in this regard. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert has continued her efforts to further the mainstreaming of minority 
issues within the work of the United Nations. She has consulted widely with United Nations 
agencies and bodies, including OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(UNDP). Under the auspices of the OHCHR Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Unit and the 
independent expert, the inter-agency group on minorities was consolidated in 2007. This 
important initiative provides a regular opportunity for the sharing of information and for 
the independent expert to meet with agency representatives. A practical outcome of this 
inter-agency group has been consultation towards the production of a pamphlet entitled 
&#8220;Questions and answers on minority issues&#8221; to assist agency field representatives in their 
handling of minority issues. 
</p>
<p>7. Pursuing her work in the area of poverty alleviation and realization of the Millennium 
Development Goals for minorities, in 2007 the independent expert continued consultations 
with development agencies, including UNDP. Following a commitment made by UNDP in 
early 2007 to work towards a policy/guidance note on minority issues, she has collaborated with 
UNDP as part of a task force established for the development of a resource guide on minority 
issues. An online questionnaire was also completed by UNDP country offices to assist in this 
process. The next step will be to test and validate the resource guide through regional 
consultations, one of which has been proposed in Bratislava in 2008. 
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert considers the prevention of violence and hate crimes against 
minority groups a core obligation of States under the Declaration on the Rights of Minorities and 
other universal standards. This leads to a need to be constantly mindful of early warnings of 
mass atrocities and genocide. In pursuance of that aim, she has sought to strengthen 
communication and collaboration with relevant United Nations bodies and mandates, 
intergovernmental institutions and non-governmental organizations that focus on the prevention 
of genocide and the developing responsibility to protect. In 2007, she held substantive dialogues 
with the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and Mass 
Atrocities, Francis Deng, and his predecessor to consider complementarities and potential 
synergies between their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p>9. In this respect, from 11 to 13 October 2007, the independent expert participated in a 
high-level global conference on the prevention of genocide convened by the McGill University 
Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism. The conference brought together genocide 
survivors, front-line activists and prominent political and civil society leaders from around the 
world, with the objective of helping to shape public debate and policy on genocide prevention. 
The independent expert emphasized the need for enhanced communication within and among 
United Nations bodies, with greater consideration of minority rights long before mass killing 
begins. 
</p>
<p>10. The independent expert welcomes resolution 6/15 adopted by the Human Rights Council at 
its sixth session, in which the Council established a forum on minority issues. The forum will 
provide a platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to persons 
belonging to minorities, which will provide thematic contributions and expertise to the work of 
the independent expert. In accordance with resolution 6/15, the forum will identify and analyse 
best practices, challenges, opportunities and initiatives for the further implementation of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities. The forum will meet for two days annually in Geneva and its work will be guided 
and prepared by the independent expert. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. In her initial report, the independent expert identified, as a key thematic priority for her 
work, enhancing the understanding of minority issues in the context of promoting inclusion and 
stability. In this context, on 6 and 7 December 2007, the independent expert convened an 
expert consultation on the issue of the discriminatory denial or deprivation of citizenship as a 
tool for the exclusion of minorities. The consultation served as a means to benefit from the 
knowledge and experience of affected communities, regional experts, United Nations bodies and 
agencies, representatives of regional intergovernmental institutions and civil society. In addition, 
on 15 October 2007, the independent expert sent a questionnaire to all Member States of the 
United Nations requesting information on issues related to minorities and citizenship. 
The responses to the questionnaire will be made available on the web page of the independent 
expert. 
</p>
<p>12. The section below contains an analysis of the problem of denial or deprivation of 
citizenship as it affects persons belonging to minorities. It is based primarily on the outcome of 
the expert consultation convened by the independent expert in December 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>II. MINORITIES AND THE DISCRIMINATORY DENIAL 
OR DEPRIVATION OF CITIZENSHIP 
</b></p>
<p>13. Minorities often face discrimination and exclusion, and they struggle to have their human 
rights respected even under conditions of full and unquestioned citizenship. Stripping them of 
citizenship can be an effective method of compounding their vulnerability, and even lead to mass 
expulsion. Experience in all regions demonstrates this reality. Once denied or deprived of 
citizenship, minorities are inevitably denied protection of their basic rights and freedoms, 
including minority rights, as established in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p>14. In the present report, citizenship is not considered by the independent expert a condition 
for the enjoyment of all human rights, including minority rights. Rather, international human 
rights law makes clear that only a limited number of rights may be made dependent on 
citizenship: rights to enter and reside permanently within the territory of a State; the right to be 
protected by the State when one is outside its territory; and a set of political rights (for example, 
the right to vote and hold office).<b>1</b> However, citizenship continues to be defined by many States 
as the primary legal bond between an individual and the State, which confers rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Discrimination is both a cause and a consequence of State actions that seek to marginalize 
minorities. The reasons for which States discriminatorily deny or deprive persons of their right to 
citizenship are often rooted in racist ideologies. Evidence demonstrates that discriminatory 
denial or deprivation of citizenship<b>2</b> disproportionately affects persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  In certain situations, economic and social rights are considered by States to be dependent on 
</p>
<p>citizenship. 
<b>2
</b>  The denial and the deprivation of citizenship are quite similar concepts, and the practical 
</p>
<p>consequences for individuals are much the same. However, the distinction may be characterized  
 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in the context of denial or 
deprivation of citizenship is based on the Declaration on Minorities of 1992 and other relevant 
international standards, from which she has identified four broad areas of concern relating to 
minorities globally: (a) the protection of a minority&#8217;s survival and existence within a territory or 
State, including through combating violence against them, forced expulsion and genocide; 
(b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and the right of 
national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to reject 
forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, including 
ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action when 
required; and (d) the guarantee of their right to effective participation in public life, especially 
with regard to decisions that affect them. 
</p>
<p>17. The denial or deprivation of citizenship as a policy or a tool of discrimination against 
minorities speaks to all of these key elements of minority rights, and is therefore also central to 
the work of the independent expert. 
</p>
<p>18. In the section below, the independent expert considers the historical and political context, 
the development of the problem and concerns posed for minorities and for States. Section IV 
examines the application of international human rights law in the context of discriminatory 
denial or deprivation of citizenship. In section V, she considers the consequences of denial or 
deprivation of citizenship with respect to the human rights of minorities. Section VI provides 
examples of affected minorities around the world and identifies specific actions which have been 
directed against them. Recent positive initiatives are also highlighted. In section VII, the 
independent expert considers relevant activities of international, regional and national actors in 
regard to the issue. The report concludes with a series of recommendations. For the purposes of 
the present report, &#8220;nationality&#8221; and &#8220;citizenship&#8221; are used as synonymous terms under public 
international law. 
</p>
<p>19. The country- and community-specific examples provided in the present report were chosen 
to illustrate the issues affecting many more minority communities in all regions. They are not 
presented as being the most problematic situations or as an exhaustive survey. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>20. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), close 
to 15 million people in more than 49 countries are stateless and numbers appear to be 
increasing.<b>3</b> A great many stateless persons today are members of minority groups. Evidence 
from all regions demonstrates that many additional minority populations live in highly 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>thus: those who are prevented from becoming citizens, either at birth or later, are denied 
citizenship; those who lose or are stripped of their citizenship previously held have been 
deprived of citizenship. 
<b>3
</b>  UNHCR, &#8220;The Excluded&#8221;<i>, Refugees</i>, No. 147, issue 3, 2007, p. 2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>precarious legal situations. Even though they may be entitled under law to citizenship in the 
State in which they live, they are often denied or deprived of this right and may in fact exist in a 
situation of statelessness. 
</p>
<p>21. The historical situations that have led to the denial or deprivation of citizenship to minority 
groups are manifold and differ from State to State. Many minority populations are indigenous 
and have lived in their States at least as long as the majority populations. Other minorities were 
established within the State by internal processes of cultural or religious diversification. 
Consequently, such minorities have as great a claim to belonging and to citizenship as the 
majority populations. 
</p><p>22. The centralization of political authority and the creation of defined categories of belonging 
have been associated with the practice of denying and depriving minorities of the right to 
citizenship. The way in which States have historically been constructed also helps to explain how 
minorities may become &#8220;locked out&#8221; of the right to citizenship, including through the 
re-organization of States. In all settings, minorities are subject to being seen in the context of 
wider geopolitical considerations and have sometimes been viewed as extensions of other 
powers, for example, where there is a clearly identifiable kin State with a similar ethnic 
composition. In this context, questions may be raised regarding political allegiance and loyalties. 
</p>
<p>23. Policies which rigidly distinguish between settled native populations and newcomers over 
long periods of time may give rise to racist perceptions and discrimination. Resource issues or 
economic slumps may trigger or strengthen protectionist policies that attempt to exclude 
minorities, or impose prohibitive requirements that block whole ethnic groups from acquiring 
citizenship rights to which they may otherwise be entitled. 
</p>
<p>24. The influence of exclusionary nationalist ideologies has a long history and was 
demonstrated shortly after the First World War, when foreign-born citizens who had been 
naturalized were stripped of their citizenship by countries including Belgium, France, Turkey 
and the Soviet Union. Infamously, the introduction of the Nuremburg laws in Germany and 
Austria deprived Jews born in those countries of their right to citizenship. More recent examples 
demonstrate that minorities denied or deprived of citizenship continue to face dramatic 
consequences, such as mass expulsions from the State. 
</p>
<p>25. State succession, which is often, but not necessarily, a consequence of war, is another 
explanation for the prevalence of discriminatory treatment of people who may not be migrants, 
but may find themselves living under a different jurisdiction. The break-up of the Soviet Union, 
for example, fomented numerous nationality contests which left millions effectively stateless and 
living as minorities in new political contexts. In a similar way, the de-federation and division of 
Czechoslovakia left thousands of Roma in a precarious situation while their citizenship status 
was questioned by both successor States. 
</p>
<p>26. Wars, whether of an inter-State or internal nature, and the processes of national integration 
and State-building triggered by the end of conflicts, have often been central forces generating 
discriminatory practices towards minorities. Disputes regarding citizenship often arise against 
the background of pre-existing ethnic or regional conflict, linked in many cases to broader 
factors of poverty, competition for scarce resources and political instability. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. Whatever the official grounds for conferral of citizenship, access may be manipulated, for 
example, by imposing greater burdens upon individuals belonging to minority groups to &#8220;prove&#8221; 
descent or long-term residency, sometimes reaching far beyond immediate parentage and the 
individual&#8217;s capacity to comply. Poor communities, whether majority or minority, often live 
without documentation and lack the resources to meet bureaucratic conditions; however, the 
obstacles faced by persons belonging to minority groups who lack documentation are far more 
formidable. Mechanisms for denial or deprivation of citizenship are frequently found at an 
administrative level, and revolve around the processes of registration, documentation and 
identification. The authority and discretion of local-level officials may be exercised in a 
discriminatory manner against persons identified as belonging to certain ethnic or religious 
minorities. Such acts may not be subject to appeal or review and are generally made with the 
apparent support of the Government concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INTERNATIONAL LAW CONSIDERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>28. With limited exceptions, States owe a duty to protect and promote the complete panoply of 
human rights of all persons that are present within their territory, whether they are citizens or 
non-citizens, as established in paragraph 10 of general comment No. 31 of the Human Rights 
Committee. The rights of all persons belonging to minorities, as part and parcel of human rights, 
are equally protected.<b>4</b> It is now recognized that the obligation of States to respect the rights of 
minorities is not limited solely to its citizens. 
</p>
<p>29. The distinctions that are permissible between the rights of citizens and non-citizens cannot 
be discriminatory on the basis of gender, race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. 
International law prohibits the discriminatory denial or deprivation of citizenship as a means of 
exclusion of persons belonging to minorities. The section below provides a brief analysis of 
relevant international human rights standards in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Right to a nationality 
</b></p>
<p>30. The right to a nationality is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed without 
discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, ethnicity, language, religion, national origin or 
gender.<b>5</b> Beyond article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims this 
right in unequivocal terms, the right to a nationality is further reiterated in a number of 
international and regional human rights instruments.<b>6 </b>Article 24 (3) of the International Covenant 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  See article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; general comments 
</p>
<p>Nos. 15 and 23 of the Human Rights Committee; articles 2 and 3 of the 1992 Declaration on 
Minorities. 
<b>5
</b>  See article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, paras. 1 and 2. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly state that the child 
</p>
<p>shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to acquire a 
nationality, in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless. Moreover, &#8220;States parties 
undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality&#8221;.  
 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights affirms the right of every child to acquire a nationality. The 
International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination further binds States to 
guarantee this right in a non-discriminatory manner.<b>7</b> At the regional level, this right is 
enunciated in the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention on 
Nationality.<b>8</b> The right to a nationality has been further recognized in international and regional 
jurisprudence, including in the concluding observations of United Nations treaty bodies, notably 
the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Important rulings in this regard have also been made 
by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>31. States must avoid rendering persons stateless and must protect the human rights of persons 
who are stateless. These obligations are codified and elaborated in the Convention on the 
Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. These 
conventions have, however, received very few ratifications.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The two fundamental bases for granting citizenship are the notions <i>jus solis</i> (provision of 
citizenship granted to those born within the territory) and <i>jus sanguinis</i> (provision granted by 
descent). Many States apply some combination of the two, alongside complex rules regarding 
other means of obtaining citizenship, such as through naturalization and registration. States have 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>The Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness mirrors the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child in providing in its first article that States shall grant nationality to all persons born on their 
territory who would otherwise be stateless. 
<b>7
</b>  See article 5 (d) (iii). See also article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, which ensures that this norm is applied equally to men and 
women. The right to a nationality is further recognized and regulated under the recently adopted 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
<b>8
</b>  Article 20 (1) and (3) of the American Convention on Human Rights. The European 
</p>
<p>Convention on Nationality reiterates these same principles under its article 4. Moreover, 
the 2006 European Convention on the Avoidance of Statelessness in relation to State succession 
will, once in force, be an important standard of protection, including in providing for the right to 
a nationality to all who had nationality at the time of State succession if residence and historic 
connection exists. 
<b>9
</b>  Although the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms does not explicitly provide for a right to a nationality, the right has been protected on 
various instances by the European Court, which found, for example, that an arbitrary deprivation 
of citizenship may rise to the level of inhuman or degrading treatment and violate article 3 of the 
European Convention, or even violate the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed 
under article 8 of the Convention<b> </b>(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/23), para. 10. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  Thirty-four and 62 ratifications respectively. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a prerogative to adopt laws governing the acquisition, renunciation or loss of nationality.<b>11</b> 
Article 1 of the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of 
Nationality Laws reflects this customary norm of international law in providing that &#8220;it is for 
each State to determine under its own laws who are its nationals&#8221;. The Convention qualifies this, 
however, by stating that national law &#8220;shall be recognized by other States insofar as it is 
consistent with international conventions, international custom and the principles of law 
generally recognized with regard to nationality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. Since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1930, international law, however, has 
further qualified the prerogative of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, 
renunciation or loss of nationality by requiring that they ensure the full protection of human 
rights in exercising this discretion. Thus, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, for 
example, ruled that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the manners in which States regulate matters bearing on nationality cannot today be 
deemed within their sole jurisdiction; those powers of the State are also circumscribed by 
their obligations to ensure the full protection of human rights. ... The classic doctrinal 
position, which viewed nationality as an attribute granted by the State to its subjects, has 
gradually evolved to a conception of nationality as a human right&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>34. Deprivation of citizenship is, in very limited instances, permissible under international law, 
even if it results in statelessness.<b>13</b> However, any such deprivation must take place with due 
regard to procedural and substantive safeguards, including the right to appeal before an 
independent tribunal. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Centrality of non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>35. States are furthermore bound by the non-derogable international norm of 
non-discrimination, which is of particular relevance to minorities. Non-discrimination on the 
grounds of race is of a customary nature. Article 1 (3) of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, for example, provides that the Convention 
may not be interpreted as affecting in any way the legal provisions of States parties concerning 
nationality, citizenship or naturalization, while clarifying that such provisions do not

</b>  Moreover, the Human Rights Committee qualifies that the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights does not recognize the right of aliens to enter or reside in a State&#8217;s territory 
and that it is in principle a matter for the State to decide who it will admit to its territory. Once 
allowed to enter, however, there is an entitlement to the rights set out in the Covenant.

</b></p>
<p>  Under article 8 of the 1961 Statelessness Convention States are allowed to deprive persons of 
their nationality when, inter alia, such &#8220;nationality has been obtained by misrepresentation or 
fraud&#8221; or when the person has &#8220;conducted himself in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital 
interests of the State&#8221;. See also article 7 of the European Convention on Nationality. </p>

</p>
<p>discriminate against any particular nationality. Furthermore, paragraph 14 of general 
recommendation No. 30 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 
discrimination against non-citizens reiterates this principle in restating that deprivation of 
citizenship on the basis of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin is a breach of States 
parties&#8217; obligations to ensure non-discriminatory enjoyment of the right to a nationality.<b>14</b> In this 
general recommendation, the Committee further called upon States to ensure that particular 
groups of non-citizens were not discriminated against with regard to access to citizenship or 
naturalization, and to pay due attention to possible barriers to naturalization that might exist for 
long-term or permanent residents. The principles of non-discrimination and arbitrariness are 
equally applicable vis-&#224;-vis States&#8217; prerogative to deprive an individual of his or her nationality 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1988/35, para. 107). Moreover, while articles 2 (1) of both the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child list a 
number of prohibited grounds for discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
extents that protection to discrimination against the child that might be based on the identity of 
the parents. 
</p>
<p>36. The Inter-American Court, in its 2005 decision in <i>Dilcia Yean and Violeta Bosico v. 
Dominican Republic</i>, affirmed the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of nationality and the 
application of discriminatory measures in the conferral of citizenship and the enjoyment of rights 
and freedoms on the basis of citizenship.<b>15</b> In the European Union, the specific prohibition of 
discrimination on the basis of nationality is entrenched in the European Community Treaty as 
one of its main principles, and given concrete form in other provisions of the Treaty framework 
in respect of specific situations, including, for example, the free movement of workers (art. 39), 
the right of establishment (art. 43) and the freedom to provide services (art. 50). In the Council 
of Europe, both the European Convention on Nationality and the European Convention on the 
Avoidance of Statelessness in relation to State succession prohibit racial and ethnic 
discrimination in relation to access and deprivation of nationality. 
</p>
<p>37. Differential treatment in conferring nationality will only be lawful if in consonance with 
the legitimate objectives and purposes of the Government within the limits prescribed by the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other 
international human rights treaties, and if applied pursuant to a legitimate aim, which is 
necessary and proportionate to the achievement of that objective.<b>16</b> For example, the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>naturalization rules of Costa Rica were not found to be discriminatory in placing less vigorous 
requirements for naturalization on Central Americans, Ibero-Americans and Spaniards since 
they objectively share much closer historical, cultural and spiritual bonds with the people of 
Costa Rica. The existence of these bonds permits the assumption that these individuals will be 
more easily assimilated within the national community and identify more readily with the 
traditional beliefs, values and institutions which the State has the right and duty to preserve.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Citizenship and the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</b>38. According to the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Bill of Rights, core 
international human rights conventions including, for example, the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and regional 
human rights instruments, everyone is entitled to the enjoyment of all rights and freedoms, 
without distinction of any kind, including national origin, birth or other status.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 15 on the position of aliens 
under the Covenant, provides that the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights apply, in general, to everyone irrespective of reciprocity, and irrespective of 
nationality or statelessness; each one of the listed rights must be guaranteed without 
discrimination between citizens and non-citizens, since non-citizens are protected by the general 
requirement of non-discrimination. Exceptions to this general rule mainly concern rights relevant 
to political participation and freedom of movement. Article 25 of the Covenant makes specific 
reference to &#8220;every citizen&#8221; in relation to the rights to take part in the conduct of public affairs, to 
vote and be elected and to have access to public service.<b>19</b> Also, the Covenant does not recognize 
a right to aliens to enter or permanently reside in a country. States may make a determination in 
that regard. The Covenant only secures the right to freedom of movement for those lawfully 
within the States&#8217; territory. However, the right to leave a country is secured for everyone. 
</p>
<p>40. With regard to economic and social rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights provides in article 2 (3) that developing countries, with due regard to human 
rights and their national economy, may determine to what extent they would guarantee the 
economic rights recognized in the Covenant to non-nationals. Reference to &#8220;due regard to human 
rights&#8221; must be interpreted to secure that this discretion in not applied discriminatorily and 
therefore may not disproportionately affect certain non-national minorities. Additionally, it must

Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  It is interesting to note that the Universal Declaration does not refer to &#8220;citizens&#8221; in article 21 
on political participation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be noted that there are developed countries that are not States parties to the Covenant and some 
that have attached reservations or declarations to their ratifications that are designed to permit 
distinctions between how they approach the economic rights of citizens and non-citizens. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Citizenship and the enjoyment of minority rights 
</b>41. In interpreting article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Human Rights Committee stated in its general comment No. 15, that where aliens constitute a 
minority within the meaning of article 27, they should not be denied the right, in community 
with other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own 
religion and to use their own language. Moreover, in its general comment No. 23 on rights of 
minorities, the Committee took that principle a step further by asserting that, insofar as minority 
rights were applicable to minorities that existed within a State&#8217;s territory, the individuals 
designed to be protected need not be citizens of the State party; neither was it relevant to 
determine the degree of permanence that the term exist connotes. Just as they need not be 
nationals or citizens, they need not be permanent residents. Thus, migrant workers or even 
visitors in a State party constituting such minorities were entitled not to be denied the exercise of 
those rights. This position is further buttressed by the principle that the existence of a national, 
ethnic, religious or linguistic minority in a given State does not depend upon a decision by that 
State but rather is to be established by objective criteria.<b>20</b> Indeed, various suggestions to include 
citizenship as a necessary element in definitions of minorities have been rejected.<b>21</b> 
42. Similarly, the European Court accepted as admissible alleged violations of the European 
Convention irrespective of the fact that the persons belonging to the affected minorities were not 
citizens of States parties concerned.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Discussions have gone beyond examining citizenship as the sole determining criterion to 
define access to certain minority rights; other elements, such as the length of residency in a State, 
have gained relevance in this analysis. In its commentary on the 1992 Declaration on Minorities, 
the Working Group on Minorities, while restating the general principle that citizenship as such 
should not be a distinguishing criterion to exclude some persons or groups from enjoying 
minority rights, argued that other factors could be relevant. Those minorities which, for example,

</b>  General comment No. 23: The rights of minorities (art. 27), 8 April 1994, para. 5.2. 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  For example, in 1979, the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of 
</p>
<p>Minorities refused to endorse Special Rapporteur Francesco Capotorti&#8217;s suggested definition of a 
minority, as it included citizenship as one of its elements. Moreover, there is a risk, and State 
practice in Europe demonstrates, that such inclusion of citizenship as a criterion within States&#8217; 
definitions of minorities, could lead to legitimizing the denial of minority rights to non-citizen 
minorities. See report on Non-citizens and Minority Rights, paras. 10, 20-31 respectively.

</b></p>
<p>  European Commission for Democracy Through Law, Report on Non-citizens and Minority 
Rights, CDL-AD(2007)001, Venice, 15-16 December 2006, para. 18. </p>

</p>
<p>live compactly together in a part of a State&#8217;s territory might be entitled to rights regarding the use 
of language, and street and place names which are different from those who are dispersed, and 
might in some circumstances be entitled to various forms of internal autonomy.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p><b>V. IMPACT OF DISCRIMINATORY DENIAL OR DEPRIVATION  
OF CITIZENSHIP ON MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>44. Despite the above legal framework, States continue to engage in practices that 
discriminatorily deny or deprive persons of citizenship. The consequences of denying or 
depriving citizenship to minority groups are considerable, with a negative impact on the affected 
persons&#8217; living conditions and the degree of their integration in society.<b>24</b> State practice 
demonstrates that citizenship still matters when it comes to the practical aspects of accessing 
many fundamental rights, including minority rights. 
</p>
<p>45. Some States explicitly reserve the enjoyment of minority rights for citizens, or minorities 
legally recognized by the State. Those denied or deprived of citizenship face additional 
challenges to the realization of the right to the protection and promotion of their collective 
cultural identity, including in regard to the recognition and use of minority languages or the 
freedom to practice minority religions. Deprivation of citizenship generally results in the 
inability to participate politically, by silencing minority voices and skewing political 
representation. 
</p>
<p>46. By linking citizenship to ownership rights, employment or access to services, the State 
allows access to wealth and resources to those groups it favours, to the detriment of those it 
wishes to marginalize. Often impoverished and uneducated, they are disempowered, are no 
longer guaranteed the protection of the State and are rendered vulnerable to further 
discrimination. They are often subjected to violent attack, arbitrary expulsion or deportation. A 
minority&#8217;s physical existence in a State can be threatened by mass expulsion on the grounds of 
their lack of citizenship status. 
</p>
<p>47. The marginalization and disenfranchisement of large groups of minorities may undermine 
conditions of human security and sow the seeds for underdevelopment and unrest. If minorities 
are located in border regions, and indeed if there are defined transnational communities, then the 
deliberate exclusion of particular populations may have significant consequences for both 
internal and regional security.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>48. Under such conditions, not only do individuals lose but so do States, in aggregate terms. In 
addition to the dramatic effects of instability and conflict, States lose in terms of lower economic 
output and a reduced fiscal base. Denied full access to higher education and skilled employment, 
persons belonging to minorities cannot contribute to their full potential. Under conditions of 
repression and following programmes of denationalization, States risk creating situations where 
restrictions on educational and employment opportunities encourage brain drain and flight. In 
extreme situations, repercussions can be severe for members of particular minority groups, 
society as a whole, and the wider stability of the State. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  REGIONAL PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>49. While examples of exclusionary citizenship practices are numerous in all regions, the 
section below only provides a brief discussion of a number of country and community examples 
considered during the expert consultation. These are not presented as an exhaustive list of cases, 
nor as the most egregious. Rather, the examples discussed below include a number of promising 
recent developments. However, they remain mere first steps in the right direction. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Africa 
</b></p>
<p>50. The issue of citizenship is often particularly complex in Africa because borders were 
drawn by colonial powers with little regard for the peoples inhabiting the continent. Most 
African States are pluri-ethnic and multicultural. As is set out below, in some cases, minority 
populations were never included in the body of citizens, while in others they were initially 
considered citizens and then intentionally excluded. In recent years, the increasing prevalence of 
multiparty democracy has meant that some politicians have been tempted to denationalize 
specific individuals and entire minority groups for partisan political advantage. At the same time, 
the growing emphasis on national security has meant that people increasingly need to possess 
proof of their identity. However, nomadic and semi-nomadic populations often have links with 
several States but may be unable to prove they possess the nationality of any of them because 
they were never registered at birth and were not issued with personal identity documents. 
</p>
<p>51. In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the question of disputed citizenship is at the heart of the civil war that has 
its origins in the mid-1990s, when political leaders reportedly began manipulating the 
interpretation of ambiguous citizenship provisions to effectively denationalize a large swathe of 
the Ivorian population and exclude political candidates on that basis, while at the same time 
amending the electoral law and Constitution to disqualify certain individuals from running for 
office under the concept of <i>ivoirit&#233;</i>. The conflict in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been attributed to eligibility 
for citizenship of some 3 million immigrant residents, the exploitation of ethnicity for political 
gain and competition for land resources between &#8220;indigenous&#8221; and &#8220;immigrant&#8221; communities.<b>25</b> 
Some optimism stems from the 2007 Ouagadougou peace agreement. Pursuant to that 
agreement, the National Unity Government has conducted late birth registrations and issued birth 
certificates which can be used to establish nationality. Renewed peace and stability will greatly 
depend on the success of this process.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. Among numerous long-standing situations in Africa is the insecure nationality status of the 
Banyamulenge, a minority group considered to be of Tutsi origin, resident in eastern Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. In 1972, a presidential decree granted citizenship to all of Rwandan or 
Burundian origin who had settled in the country before 1950. In 1981, this law was replaced with 
another, which based citizenship rights on descent from the population resident in the territory in 
1885, making it almost impossible for the Banyamulenge to retain citizenship. The recent peace 
process led to the enactment of a new nationality law in 2004 which, together with the 2005 
Constitution, again recognized the Banyamulenge as Congolese nationals on the basis of their 
historic residence in the country. In order for these amendments to achieve their potential, 
including in regard to stability in the region, implementation must be a priority. Members of the 
Banyamulenge minority reportedly continue to be the subject of discriminatory treatment and 
ethnic tensions on this basis. 
</p>
<p>53. The independent expert was also presented with information concerning adherents of the 
Baha&#8217;i faith in Egypt who are reportedly not recognized as a religious minority and experience 
difficulties obtaining identity cards necessary to prove citizenship. Without valid identity cards, 
Baha&#8217;is are said to encounter difficulties in registering their children in school, opening bank 
accounts, establishing businesses and gaining access to government services, including education 
and employment. Preventing the Baha&#8217;is from officially identifying themselves as such violates 
their right to the protection of their minority identity, a problem which is replicated in other 
countries in which they are a religious minority, particularly in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 
January 2008, the Court of Administrative Justice in Cairo reportedly upheld arguments made in 
two cases concerning Baha&#8217;is seeking to restore their full citizenship rights by requesting 
permission to leave the religious affiliation field blank on official documents. The Government is 
urged to implement this ruling. 
</p>
<p>54. According to information presented at the expert consultation, members of the Nubian 
minority in Kenya are, on the basis of their ethnicity and their perceived identification with the 
colonial power, reportedly denied their right to Kenyan nationality, despite the fact that Nubians 
have lived in Kenya for more than 100 years and individuals meet criteria for Kenyan citizenship 
under the Constitution. They are prevented from voting and standing for office, claiming 
employment and owning land. Nubians are not recognized as an ethnic group and are categorized 
only as &#8220;other Kenyan&#8221;. Consequently, Nubians have been discriminated against in the 
registration and issuance of identity documents. To acquire identity documents, they are 
reportedly required to produce their parents&#8217; and their grandparents&#8217; birth certificates, conditions 
that are not made on members of other groups. Discriminatory treatment is considered to be 
based on the notion that the community is not indigenous to Kenya; the Government claims that 
Nubians living in the country are foreigners who have not renounced their Sudanese citizenship. 
</p>
<p>55. In 1989, on the basis of tensions between pastoralists and farmers, the Government of 
Mauritania deprived approximately 70,000 minority black Mauritanians their Mauritanian 
nationality and expelled them en masse to Senegal and Mali. About 20,000 remain in Senegal, 
living in camps with refugee status. Positive developments are now under way since, with the 
support and collaboration of UNHCR, the Government initiated in 2007 a process of voluntary </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>return of those previously expelled. Under a tripartite agreement signed by the Government of 
Mauritania, the Government of Senegal and UNHCR, Mauritania is committed to ensuring that 
returnees enjoy the same rights as other Mauritanian nationals.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Asia 
</b></p>
<p>56. There are a range of situations in Asia in which minority groups have been arbitrarily 
denied or deprived of their nationality, typically because they are viewed as not belonging to the 
mainstream of society on account of their minority status or because their ancestors migrated to 
the territory relatively recently. As in other regions, these situations often result from legislation 
which was designed to exclude specific populations by, for example, imposing evidentiary 
requirements for acquisition or confirmation of citizenship which are impossible to meet. These 
situations are sometimes compounded by discrimination against women in regard to acquisition, 
change and retention of nationality and conferral of nationality on their children. In recognition 
of the negative impact of statelessness, a number of States have recently taken measures to grant 
or confirm nationality of minority populations. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite the fact that the Urdu-speaking minority in Bangladesh, the Biharis, qualify for 
citizenship under the Constitution and nationality legislation, it is reported that an estimated 
300,000 Biharis were, until recently, still being denied citizenship mainly on the basis of 
accusations of disloyalty and political support for Pakistan. For more than 30 years, this minority 
community has reportedly not only been denied citizenship, but also segregated from the rest of 
the population and has faced severe discrimination regarding opportunities to obtain a decent 
living standard, access to education and employment. In a favourable development, the 
Government recommended in September 2007 that citizenship be granted to most of the Bihari 
community habitually residing in Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>58. Participants in the expert consultation described how in 1985, the Citizenship Law of 
Bhutan stripped an estimated 100,000 individuals of ethnic Nepali origin of their citizenship 
rights, a factor leading to their forced expulsion from the country. According to the participants, 
the Bhutanese of Nepali ethnic origin are allegedly prevented from returning to their own 
country, denied the right to a nationality in their country of residence and are de facto stateless. 
Those remaining in Bhutan are also denied citizenship and consequently continue to live in a 
precarious legal limbo and fear similar expulsion from the country. 
</p>
<p>59. According to information given at the expert consultation, the Rohingya in Myanmar are, 
on the basis of their group identity, denied their right to citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship 
Law. They suffer from restrictions on their freedom of movement and right to a family life, 
difficulty in gaining access to civil services, violations of their right to health and education, land 
confiscations, and are subject to forced labour and arbitrary taxes. These deprivations have 
resulted in many Rohingya fleeing as refugees to neighbouring and other countries.

<p>60. In Nepal, ingrained discriminatory sentiments mainly against Madhesis, Dalit and Janjatis 
have been blamed for the denial or deprivation of citizenship and undocumented status of such 
groups. However, the Government recently granted citizenship to about 2.4 million previously 
stateless persons, including approximately 1.2 million Madhesis from the Terai region. This was 
made possible by the introduction of a new citizenship law in 2006, followed by a government 
initiative in early 2007 to create mobile teams which visited the country&#8217;s 75 districts, including 
the remotest of regions, to issue citizenship certificates. Efforts are still needed to ensure that 
those who did not benefit from the latter process may take advantage of opportunities for late 
registration. 
</p>
<p>61. In Sri Lanka, despite having lived there for generations, &#8220;estate&#8221; or &#8220;plantation&#8221; Tamils 
were historically denied the right to Sri Lankan nationality because of their status as plantation 
workers and the country&#8217;s stringent citizenship laws. Following community efforts, in 2003, 
legal developments led to the immediate conferral of citizenship to this minority group. Mobile 
clinics and information campaigns supported by UNHCR and the direct involvement of the 
minority concerned were critical to success. Follow-up is however necessary, as reports indicate 
that the process of obtaining the necessary documentation has slowed down in recent years; a 
problem which may be associated with the ongoing conflict in the country. 
</p>
<p>62. According to information presented by participants at the expert consultation, in the 
Middle East region, denial or deprivation of citizenship is widespread and complex and 
reportedly affects minority groups including, but not limited to, Palestinians, Kurdish 
communities and the Baha&#8217;i minority. In Israel, for example, the Citizenship and Entry into 
Israel Law (Temporary Order) of 31 May 2003 suspends the possibility of Palestinians from the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory from obtaining Israeli citizenship and residence permits in Israel, 
including through family reunification. According to seminar participants, the effect of this 
discriminatory law is that thousands of Palestinian families must separate, emigrate or live 
illegally in Israel under constant risk of arrest and deportation.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>63. According to seminar participants, in 1962, an exceptional census aimed to differentiate 
between Kurds who had a right to live in the Syrian Arab Republic and those who had illegally 
entered from Turkey or Iraq after 1945 was conducted. Thousands were subsequently stripped of 
Syrian citizenship. Reportedly, little notice of the census was given and insufficient information 
was distributed regarding the consequences of not participating. Thousands were unable to 
provide the required documentation proving their residency before 1945. Of over 1.5 million 
Kurds, current estimates of those denied or deprived of citizenship reach 300,000. Stateless 
Kurds are reportedly denied full access to their rights, including the right to own property, to 
have access to public services and to use the Kurdish language in education. While the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has, since 2004, made promises to grant nationality, 
the independent expert is informed that thousands remain registered as Ajanib or foreigners in 
the country.

<p>64. The independent expert was further informed on the situation of the <i>Bidun</i> (which literally 
means &#8220;without&#8221; in Arabic), another minority group that has been disproportionately affected by 
amendments to laws on nationality following State reconstruction in the Gulf region - the 
independence of Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar and the formation of the United Arab Emirates. In 
Kuwait, for example, there are an estimated 130,000 Bidun whose rights were revoked by law in 
the mid-1980s and who have since been unable to naturalize. They reportedly live in appalling 
conditions, are denied the right to employment, travel, education, free medical care, to register 
marriages or in most cases to hold a driving licence. Although the situation has reportedly not 
improved in Kuwait, other States have started to take measures to address the status of the Bidun 
within their territories. In 2001, Bahrain naturalized 2,090 Bidun, who were of Iranian origin but 
no longer maintained links with the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 2006, the United Arab Emirates 
issued directives allowing for the naturalization of the Bidun; in the first phase, the naturalization 
of approximately 1,294 Bidun was recorded.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Europe 
</b></p>
<p>65. In Europe, a number of problems relate particularly to the way citizenship and nationality 
have been constructed in view of State succession and State restoration, as demonstrated in the 
countries of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. As in other regions, minority groups are 
disproportionately affected by the failure to register all children at birth and to issue identity 
documents to all citizens. As a result, in some States, members of the Roma minority and other 
populations are unable to exercise the full range of rights afforded by citizenship. 
</p>
<p>66. In Latvia, according to the Law on Citizenship, only persons who were citizens 
before 17 June 1940 and their descendants received automatic citizenship after independence in 
1991, effectively excluding minorities such as ethnic Russian-speaking minorities. Since 1995, a 
process of naturalization has contributed to solving the problem, however, there are reportedly 
400,000 non-citizens still in the country (an estimated 18 per cent of the population). In Estonia, 
the citizenship law of 1938 was reintroduced in 1992, thereby reportedly excluding one third of 
the population, including ethnic Russian-speaking minorities, from the citizenship of the newly 
independent State. Since the mid-1990s, about 150,000 people have reportedly been naturalized 
in a process which remains far from complete (currently about 8 per cent of the population are 
reported to be stateless). According to information received at the expert consultation, many 
former Soviet citizens who previously resided legally in the Russian Federation have allegedly 
been disenfranchised following entry into force in 2002 of the Federal Laws on Russian 
Citizenship and on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens. 
</p>
<p>67. In Slovenia, thousands of minority residents, including Bosnians, ethnic Albanians from 
Kosovo, Macedonians, Roma and Serbs were, according to information submitted during the 
expert consultation, denied citizenship on the basis of restrictive citizenship laws introduced in 
1991 and a very short time limit was allowed to file applications for minority non-ethnic 
Slovenians. The overall legal framework was improved considerably by the Law on Settling of 
the status of citizens of other Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Successor States in the 
Republic of Slovenia in 1999, although some minorities, including the Roma, reportedly remain 
affected. Participants further explained how The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
implemented an extremely restrictive citizenship law after independence, giving rise to a number </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of categories of excluded groups, most notably ethnic Albanians and Roma. Widely touted 
amendments in 2004 failed to remedy the underlying problem that Macedonian officials fail to 
acknowledge the legitimate ties of a number of categories of persons to the country. 
</p>
<p>68. Despite continuing problems, the region has undergone substantial positive developments, 
mainly because of the work of a number of supranational bodies in Europe, including the 
European Union, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE), which have for some time been addressing these issues in the region. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Latin America and the Caribbean 
</b></p>
<p>69. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the majority of States have a generous tradition of 
conferring nationality on the basis of <i>jus solis</i>; for that reason, few individuals should be left 
stateless at birth. However, lack of resources and infrastructure obstacles have resulted in a low 
percentage of populations having documentation of their civil status. To address this concern, the 
Organization of American States (OAS) is currently focusing on the right to an identity as a 
major policy thrust, placing central importance on universal birth registration as an objective to 
resolve issues related to the denial of citizenship to minorities. OAS member States are currently 
endeavouring to achieve free, timely and universal birth registration in the region by 2015. Chile, 
Cuba and Guyana have reportedly almost reached the goal. 
</p>
<p>70. A notable example where problems persist is the Dominican Republic. Haitians and 
Dominicans of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic experience severe racial 
discrimination, heightened vulnerability to deportation and obstacles to their access to economic 
and social services. Most live in a status of legal limbo as a result of being denied Dominican 
citizenship. The focus of recent controversy is Migration Law 285-04, which presents problems 
of conflicts with the <i>jus soli</i> provision of the Dominican Constitution, retroactivity and 
discriminatory application with respect to people of Haitian descent. The recent implementation 
of a pink birth-certificate registration procedure and &#8220;foreigners-book&#8221; in practice denies 
citizenship to children of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic. Hope for change 
came with the decision in 2005 of the Inter-American Court, which declared that the Dominican 
Republic had breached the international human right to a nationality in its arbitrary and 
discriminatory practice in this regard. However the Government is yet to fully comply with this 
decision.<b>28</b>

<p><b>VII. ACTIVITIES OF INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS

relevant stakeholders in this field worldwide, including by agencies of the United Nations, 
regional intergovernmental organizations and numerous non-governmental organizations. She

(A/HRC/7/23/Add.3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>welcomes the commitment of States to addressing the issues concerned, as evidenced by the 
substantial number of replies received in response to a questionnaire regarding States&#8217; treatment 
of citizenship issues. 
</p>
<p>72. UNHCR is comprehensively implementing its statelessness mandate globally, as required 
by the General Assembly, to ensure progress in identification, prevention and reduction of 
statelessness and the protection of affected persons.<b>29</b> It has expressed its willingness to support 
the work of the independent expert in recognizing that minorities who are denied or deprived of 
citizenship constitute a significant constituency of affected persons. As an example, UNHCR 
is undertaking work with the Government of Viet Nam on the naturalization of former 
Cambodian refugees who are now stateless. Moreover, in November 2007, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
jointly expressed their determination to address statelessness resolutely. 
73. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) is working with partners to implement key 
provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child related to citizenship issues. The 
UNICEF child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse programme focuses on the 
centrality of birth registration as a means to ensure that all children have access to, inter alia, a 
legal identity and therefore all other rights. Other United Nations agencies that are engaged in 
working on citizenship issues include the United Nations Population Fund with regard to census 
and documentation through civil registries. UNDP is working with UNHCR on issues relating to 
social and economic inclusion of stateless populations through poverty reduction programmes 
and the rule of law and directly with the independent expert to enhance its consideration of 
minority issues across its key focus areas. 
</p>
<p>74. During the Geneva expert consultation, the OSCE High Commissioner for National 
Minorities noted the centrality to his conflict-prevention mandate of citizenship issues in Europe, 
particularly as they affect minority groups. While recognizing that much work remains, 
particularly with regard to discriminatory and exclusionary policies practised including Roma 
and others, he emphasized the notable efforts and considerable success of his office in working 
with States to improve citizenship legislation in Europe and to ensure a more balanced and 
successful integration of groups into their respective societies. Work has also been carried out 
with concerned minority groups directly, including Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and 
Latvia and Crimean Tartars. 
</p>
<p>75. Until recently, few non-governmental organizations had addressed citizenship issues in 
their human rights concerns. However, as problems in this field have grown and been 
increasingly recognized, civil society initiatives have increased to engage in monitoring, 
reporting, advocating and litigating to solve problems in denial or deprivation of citizenship. 
This is the case in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Such civil society 
activities should be encouraged and supported by the international donor community.

<p>76. Numerous civil society initiatives include the launch in 2007 of the Citizenship Rights in 
Africa Initiative as a joint initiative by the Open Society Justice Initiative, the International 
Refugee Rights Initiative and the Global Pan Africa Movement. The Citizenship Rights in Africa 
Initiative establishes itself as a campaign dedicated to ending statelessness and the arbitrary 
denial of citizenship in Africa; in this context, it monitors, investigates, documents, denounces 
and, where necessary, litigates cases of statelessness and denial of citizenship rights in Africa. 
Also of note is the symposium on regional integration and citizenship that was held on 
31 August 2007 by the Rwanda Centre for Strategic Studies in Kigali. In Latin America, the 
work of the Movement of Dominican-Haitian Women, in partnership with other national and 
international non-governmental organizations, on the rights of the minority of Dominicans of 
Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, particularly as they relate to the right to nationality, 
has led to establishing international jurisprudence on the right to a nationality and the prohibition 
of arbitrary discriminatory practices in this regard.<b>13</b> The equality and citizenship programme of 
the Open Society Justice Initiative continues to work globally, directly with States and 
communities concerned on issues relating to the rights of non-citizens. Refugees International is 
also acknowledged for its work in reporting on stateless populations around the world. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The independent expert welcomes the important work being done to address and 
combat the causes and consequences of the discriminatory denial or deprivation of 
citizenship of minorities and developments in this regard, and encourages the international 
community to use the present report as a tool to take those steps further. While positive 
practices have been identified, few have fully addressed and resolved the situations faced 
by members of minority communities in all regions. Efforts must be intensified by all 
relevant actors, and most importantly States themselves, which have primary responsibility 
for the protection of the rights and welfare of all individuals residing on their territories 
irrespective of their citizenship status. The independent expert makes the 
recommendations as set out below. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The right to a nationality is a fundamental human right and must be considered as 
such by all States. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> While States have a prerogative to establish laws governing the acquisition, 
renunciation or loss of nationality, they must do so within the framework of international 
human rights law. In situations relating to constitutional amendments or changes to 
national legislation relating to the conferral of citizenship, States should not revoke 
citizenship retroactively. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> States must not arbitrarily deny or deprive minorities of citizenship on the basis of 
colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, language, race or religion. Fundamental fairness, 
including the right to appeal, must be guaranteed in all immigration and citizenship 
procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> With limited exceptions, States must not consider citizenship a condition for the 
enjoyment of human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>82.<b> States are urged to ratify or accede to all relevant international conventions, 
including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, to ensure that 
nationality legislation is consistent with such standards and to fully conform to 
international obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> UNHCR and OHCHR should undertake a study to reveal further the dimensions of 
the statelessness problems of minorities globally. This should include, to the extent possible, 
the collection and analysis of statistical data disaggregated on the basis of gender, ethnic, 
linguistic and religious criteria. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> States must register all children and issue birth certificates immediately after birth in 
a non-discriminatory manner. Where birth registration certificates do not confer 
nationality, States should allow for procedures for citizenship determination by an 
independent body shortly after birth. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> States must grant nationality to children born on their territory if the child would 
otherwise be stateless. In this case, the immigration status of parents should be irrelevant. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> States are urged to allow dual or multiple nationality. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> States are encouraged to facilitate the acquisition of citizenship through 
naturalization procedures or permanent residency to persons lawfully resident in the 
country for a period commensurate with their having created established social, 
economic and community ties in the State. It is recommended that the period be no longer 
than 10 years. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> State requirements for the granting of citizenship should be reasonable and not be 
overly burdensome for individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> States should facilitate full access to identity documentation in a non-discriminatory 
manner. In any determination that supporting documents are fraudulent, the burden 
should be upon the State to prove falsity and such determination should be subject to 
judicial review and appeal. Registration should take into account the particular 
circumstances of persons belonging to minorities, including lack of birth registration when 
ancestors arrived in the territory of the State. Registration costs should be minimal, and 
registration offices should be physically accessible to all. Registration forms should be in all 
national languages and in the languages spoken by large minority populations. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> States should conduct information campaigns on the right to citizenship and 
necessary procedures to obtain recognition of this right, in a language and a form 
accessible to all. Minority groups should be directly involved and represented in relevant 
administrative structures. Mobile campaigns are often a good means of addressing existing 
documentation problems and reaching rural areas.
