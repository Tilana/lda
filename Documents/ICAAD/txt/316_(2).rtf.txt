IN THE MAGISTRATES COURT AT NASINU

Family Court Case No. 427/2006

BETWEEN:

ANA SEINI FATAFEHI
[Applicant]

AND:

KITIONE TALE KALOUCAVA SIKIVOU
[Respondent]

Mr. Aseri Vokololoma for the Applicant
The Respondent is absent

Ruling on Matrimonial Property

01] The Applicant lady filed these form 9 and 12 to acquire the matrimonial property comprised in Certificate in Title No. 12259 (the matrimonial property) commonly referred to as Lot 12 Sarju Prasad Street, Caubati in whole.

02] The Respondent was served by substitute service and the Respondent did not file any objections. The Applicant lives in USA and this matter was heard on 16-07-2012. The Applicant said the Respondent is her ex husband. She filed their marriage certificate and divorce certificate as EX-1 and 2 respectively. The property title certificate was marked as Ex-3

03] I now consider the applicant's evidence, affidavit evidence together with documents. 

04] The Applicant says their matrimonial home was burnt down and the property comprises just vacant land valued at $50,000 (Fifty thousand dollars only) with improvements comprising a burnt residential home valued at $20,000 (Twenty thousand dollars only) .The Valuation Report proves these facts. The Applicant told to the court the she been sending and paying a Caretaker whilst living in the United States of America the sum of $110 per month for the maintenance and daily up keeping of the property the last 5 years without any contribution or assistance by the Respondent. Annexure AF 2 is a copy of receipt of payment by the Caretaker, prove the payments. The Caretaker, Mr. Jiwa Temo also gave evidence at the hearing. I am mindful of that. 

05] The Applicant told that she also gives an undertaking to pay off the outstanding town rates due and owing to the Nasinu Town Council (NTC) over the aforesaid property in the sum of $2,952 if the Court grants order in terms of her application. She annexed and marked these rates as Annexure AF 4 is a copy of the Statement of town rates from NTC in her affidavit.

06] The Applicant also gives undertaking to make reasonable offer of remuneration to Mounga Fatefehi (Sister) for the settlement of the advanced sum or $41,522. 89 advanced to discharge our matrimonial property and salvage the same from mortgagee sale, who subsequently has endorsed a caveat over residential dwellings to safeguard her interest.

07] The Applicant intends to acquire the property in whole as she has been paying for the daily maintenance and up keeping of the same and the Respondent has been vey uncooperative in ensuring that the matrimonial properties are distributed. She further stated; 

1.      
That I fear that if the town rates are not settled with the NTC the likelihood of the matrimonial property being reposed by NTC is high, and the same can even be carried out without my knowledge considering my living in the United States of America.

2.      
That I also fear that Mounga Fatafehi will take legal action against our property for the recovery of her $41,522.89 that was advanced for the discharge of our mortgage, as the same has lost its value because the residential home has been fully destroyed by fire and is unfit for habitual occupancy.

08] The Respondent has not filed any objections to the application. I hold that there is a matrimonial property comprised in Certificate of Title No. 12250 situated at Lot 12 Sarju Prasad Street off Caubati that has never been distributed by a family court or parties' mutual agreement.

09] The Applicant's biological sister (ie. Mounga Fatefehi) has advanced payment of $41,522.89 for the payment of the mortgage as the property was on the verge of being repossessed by Colonial National Bank and she has filed a caveat to register her advanced cash facilities. 

10] It is seen the Applicant has been controlling this property for last five years. The house has been burnt in 2008 and the Applicant has paid $10,035 and $31,522.89 to the bank through her sister. Town rates yet to be paid. The Respondent did not make any claim to this matrimonial property in this case. He has not proved any right but title indicates that he owns half share (Ex-3). 

11] This application is made under s.161 of the Family Law Act. Under the Family Law Act, the court is empowered to make two principal kinds of orders in respect of the property of the parties to the marriage. The first is an order under section 160 of the Act through which a court can make a declaration of the interests of parties to the marriage in their property. The second is an order under section 161 for an alteration of interests of the parties in the property including an order for settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property and an order requiring either or both of the parties to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines. 

12] Specifically the material sections read as follows and I reproduce it for clarity:-

Alteration of property interests
161.-(1) In proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to a marriage or either of them, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate altering the interests of the parties in the property, including- 

(a) an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property; and 

(b) an order requiring either or both of the parties to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines&

 (6) The court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.

Factors to be taken into account
162.-(1) In considering what order (if any) should be made under section 161 in proceedings with respect to any property of the parties to a marriage or either of them, the court must take into account- 

(a) the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of the last-mentioned property, whether or not the last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; 

(b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property, whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them; 

(c) the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent. 

(d) the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under- 

(i)     
any law of the Fiji Islands or of another country; or 

(ii) any superannuation funds or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside the Fiji Islands. 

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) the contribution of the parties to a marriage is presumed to be equal, but the presumption may be rebutted if a court considers a finding of equal contribution is on the facts of the case repugnant to justice, (for example as a marriage of short duration.)

(3) The court must also take into account- 

(a) the age and state of health of the parties; 

(b) the income, property and financial resources, including any interest in inalienable property, of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment; 

(c) whether either party has the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years; 

(d) the commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support- 

(i)     
himself or herself; and 

(ii) a child or another person that the party has a legal or customary duty to support. 

(e) a standard of living that in all circumstances is reasonable; 

(f) the financial resources available to a person if cohabiting with another person; 

(g) the duration of the marriage; 

(h) the terms of any order for spousal or child maintenance made in favour of or against a party; 

(i)     
any other fact or circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account. 

13] The evidence revealed that the Applicant has spent money over the Respondent's share 50% but the Applicant cannot recover that money from the Respondent. Therefore the Applicant seeks sole ownership. In property distribution and settlement the court has jurisdiction to grant such order in terms of section 161 of FLA. I am satisfied with evidence and the document as the Applicant proved her case. 

14] Considering facts before me, I grant following orders;

a)      
The Applicant to have sole ownership of the matrimonial property comprised in Certificate in Title No. 12259 (the matrimonial property) commonly referred to as Lot 12 Sarju Prasad Street, Caubati. 

b)      
The Applicant should settle all dues to others (Third party), banks, town council forthwith.

c)      
Senior Court Officer to dispatch this order forthwith to the Registrar General to amend the title.

d)      
No cost is awarded.

e)      
Appeal period is 30 days from the date of this order. After 30 days Registrar to amend the title and delete the Respondent's name. Thereafter the Applicant is the Sole owner of the Title No. 12259 (the matrimonial property) commonly referred to as Lot 12 Sarju Prasad Street, Caubati. 

f)      
Orders accordingly.
