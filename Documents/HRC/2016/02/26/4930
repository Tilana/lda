</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan and 
on the achievements of technical assistance in the field of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113, 
reviews the current human rights situation in Afghanistan and contains recommendations to 
address diverse human rights problems. This report further provides an update on the 
achievements of technical assistance in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p> The year 2009 was a difficult one for Afghanistan as hard-won gains, particularly in 
relation to human rights, were put in jeopardy. Confidence in the state-building project 
diminished as many Afghans questioned the commitment of elected authorities and their 
international partners to safeguarding their core rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p> The escalation and spread of armed conflict resulted in the highest number of 
civilian casualties recorded since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 and in the further 
erosion of humanitarian space. While the armed opposition was responsible for the 
majority of civilian casualties, deaths as a result of air strikes by international forces 
continued to be a high-profile and contentious issue. However, new tactical directives, 
adopted by the international forces to reduce civilian casualties, appear to have had a 
positive impact. Attacks by anti-Government elements (AGEs) produced high levels of 
violence including, in particular, around the presidential and provincial council elections 
held in August 2009. The presidential election, widely regarded as a deeply flawed process, 
further weakened support for, and confidence in, the Government and its international 
partners, as well as the post-Bonn Agreement state-building project. 
 While greater numbers of women stood for election to public office, threats against 
women in public life and crimes of sexual violence remained serious human rights 
concerns. The adoption of the Shia Personal Status Law, which legitimizes discriminatory 
practices against women, represented a setback for women&#8217;s rights. Widespread impunity 
continued to undermine effective governance in Afghanistan and little progress was 
achieved in terms of accountability for crimes that are directly associated with a long 
history of abuse of power. Journalists and media workers continued to be harassed for

<p>exercising their profession. Conditions of extreme poverty, which affect one third of the 
Afghan people, were further exacerbated by the intensifying conflict, abusive power 
structures and corrosive impunity. 
</p>
<p> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with respect to its submission under the universal 
periodic review of the Human Rights Council. The high-quality report was praised by other 
States as a frank account of the human rights situation that gave a balanced view of 
progress, as well as the persistent challenges in Afghanistan. OHCHR was engaged in other 
technical assistance initiatives detailed in this report, including with the Ministry of Justice 
and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.

<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 and has 
been prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA). Since my last report, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has become 
more challenging, particularly in terms of the intensifying armed conflict, deeply 
entrenched impunity, an electoral process lacking credibility and tainted by allegations of 
fraud, and enduring discrimination against women. Afghans confront serious obstacles to 
the enjoyment of their human rights, as the country struggles with the legacy and 
continuing reality of armed conflict and limited achievements in the democratization and 
state-building process.  
</p>
<p>2. In 2009, Afghanistan was engulfed by levels of political violence not experienced in 
the recent past. Notwithstanding important initiatives to address the issue of civilian 
casualties, the highest civilian death toll since the ousting of the Taliban regime in 2001 
was recorded. Spiralling violence surrounding the contentious presidential election gave 
rise to heightened insecurity and disillusionment with the ability of the Government to 
protect its citizens. The flawed elections also dealt a serious blow to confidence in the 
democratic process, undermining the credibility of the Government and support for its 
international allies. 
</p>
<p>3. The combination of poor governance, lawlessness, and intensifying conflict has 
exacerbated the extreme levels of poverty that characterize 36 per cent of the Afghan 
population. Afghans&#8217; expectations have not been met: there is a pressing need for fair, 
effective and accountable governance to bring about an end to abusive power structures and 
impunity, so that Afghans can enjoy such basic fundamentals as the right to health, food, 
education and shelter.  
</p>
<p>4. The adoption of the Shia Personal Status Law was a regressive step for women&#8217;s 
rights in Afghanistan. States have a responsibility, based on international law, to eliminate 
violence against women and this law is inconsistent with the international treaty obligations 
of Afghanistan and other more progressive legislation the Government has recently adopted 
on violence against women. For this reason, I have strongly recommended that this law be 
repealed. There has been little meaningful progress in strengthening the judicial system and 
respect for the rule of law, an essential precondition for countering the deeply engrained 
culture of impunity in Afghanistan, delivering justice, and restoring confidence in public 
institutions. Also lacking has been the pursuit of a credible official transitional justice 
agenda to secure accountability for, and bring an end to, a long history of egregious human 
rights violations. Also apparent in 2009 was the critical need for improved mechanisms and 
procedures to exclude abusive power brokers and alleged human rights violators from 
public office. Until such measures are taken, efforts to address the many human rights 
challenges facing Afghanistan, including abuse of power and impunity, injustice and 
poverty, are liable to failure. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>

<p>GE.10-10230 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. OHCHR/UNAMA was engaged in the protection cluster established by the 
humanitarian community in 2008, both as the deputy co-chair and as the primary entity 
responsible for protection work focused on the immediate and direct impact of the war on 
civilians. As a key member of the protection cluster, OHCHR/UNAMA has sought to 
mainstream protection within other sectors, and has been actively involved in the 
prioritization of protection-related projects for the Humanitarian Action Plan (HAP). 
7. Anti-Government elements (AGEs) and pro-Government forces (PGF) have 
increasingly conducted operations that put the lives of civilians at risk. The 2009 civilian 
death toll is the highest since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001; August proved to be 
the deadliest month in the year as a result of election-related violence, with 333 civilian 
conflict-related deaths recorded. This reflects a trend of increasing insecurity as well as 
election-related violence. Under international humanitarian law, parties to a conflict have 
an obligation to spare civilians from the effects of armed conflict. Both parties to the 
conflict must respect the rules of war so that civilians do not bear the brunt of the fighting. 
</p>
<p>8. Of the 2,186 casualties recorded from January to November 2009, 69 per cent were 
attributed to AGEs and 23 per cent to PGF. The remaining 8 per cent could not be 
attributed to any of the conflicting parties as some civilians died as a result of undetermined 
causes. This figure represents an increase of 8 per cent over the deaths recorded in the same 
period in 2008.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Anti-Government elements 
</b></p>
<p>9. Anti-Government elements accounted for 69 per cent of civilian deaths from January 
to November 2009. Sixty-six per cent of all civilian deaths attributed to AGEs were brought 
about by indiscriminate suicide and improvised explosive device (IED) attacks, continuing 
the use of asymmetric attacks that accounted for the highest death toll among Afghan 
civilians. Also of great concern was the rate at which AGEs continued to systematically 
intimidate, abduct and conduct targeted assassinations against civilians associated with the 
Government and/or the international military forces (IM Forces). Health-care workers, 
teachers, journalists and construction workers were amongst other groups who were 
consistently targeted by AGEs.  
</p>
<p>10. Although the IM Forces and Afghanistan National Security Forces (ANSF) 
continued to be the primary target of AGE activities, many of these attacks were carried out 
in crowded civilian areas, for example in bazaars and on busy roads, with apparent 
disregard for civilian life and damage to civilian property. On 29 September 2009, at least 
30 individuals were reportedly killed and 19 injured when their bus struck an IED on a 
commercial road in Maywand District of Kandahar Province. Kabul City witnessed a 
number of suicide-bomb attacks against IM Forces in which civilians were killed, including 
a deadly September 17 attack on an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) convoy 
on the road to Kabul International Airport, reportedly killing 20 civilians and injuring 45. 
The Taliban acknowledged responsibility for the incident. AGE military operations carried 
out in villages and other locations where civilians reside, also put civilians at serious risk.  
</p>
<p>11. There were conditions of heightened insecurity around the presidential and 
provincial council elections in August 2009, as AGEs stepped up attacks, threats and 
intimidation against candidates and election workers, aimed at derailing the election 
process and discouraging voter participation, even in areas that were previously less 
affected by the conflict. Some 300 security incidents alone were registered on election day.  </p>
<p>On 15 August, 7 civilians were reportedly killed and at least 90 injured in a suicide-bomb  </p>
<p>blast outside ISAF headquarters in Kabul, while 7 were reportedly killed and at least 50  </p>
<p>injured in a vehicle-borne IED (VBIED) attack near Camp Phoenix in Kabul on 18 August.  </p>
<p>In the latter attack, two United Nations staff members were killed and one injured. In late </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p>October, amid political tensions arising from the protracted delays in announcing the 
presidential results, AGEs attacked a commercial guest house in Kabul, killing eight 
civilians, five of whom were United Nations staff members, and injuring numerous others. 
This was the worst and most deliberate attack perpetrated on the United Nations in 
Afghanistan since the beginning of the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>12. The worsening security situation in the south and south-east of the country and the 
spread of the conflict into various provinces of the centre, north-east and west, had serious 
humanitarian consequences. In addition to civilian death, injury, loss of livelihood, 
destruction of property, displacement and disruption of access to basic services, many aid 
agencies curtailed their humanitarian operations in the face of spreading insecurity and 
lawlessness.  
</p>
<p>13. Despite various appeals to the Taliban, following the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions in 2008, to respect international 
humanitarian law, there was a marked increase in indiscriminate attacks in 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Pro-Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>14. Pro-Government forces were responsible for 23 per cent of civilian deaths from 
January to November 2009; air strikes accounted for 60 per cent of PGF actions, or 14 per 
cent of the total number of civilians killed. The use of air strikes continued to prove the 
most deadly tactic used by PGF and provoked strong public reaction, especially in the wake 
of strikes that resulted in a high loss of civilian life, particularly of women and children.  
</p>
<p>15. There continues to be a need for greater transparency by IM Forces when 
investigating these incidents. There were two particularly high-profile incidents of air 
strikes that led to a large number of civilian casualties. Several high-ranking German 
officials, including the Chief of Staff of the Army and a Government minister, resigned 
amid allegations of a cover-up over the number of civilian casualties resulting from an IM 
Forces air strike against two fuel tankers hijacked by the Taliban, in the north-eastern 
province of Kunduz on 4 September 2009. This air strike claimed the lives of 74 civilians, 
many of them children. On 4 May, an air strike in Bala Baluk district in western province of 
Farah claimed 64 civilian lives. Although the United States of America military 
acknowledged that it had failed to comply with internal military guidelines, a proper 
assessment prior to the attack could have determined whether civilians would have been 
disproportionately harmed and whether it was appropriate to use air strikes in a residential 
area. 
</p>
<p>16. The presence of IM Forces bases situated in urban areas, such as Kabul and some 
provincial capitals, continues to be a major concern. The location of such bases in 
residential areas may conflict with the international humanitarian law principle of 
precaution, which aims at protecting the civilian population from the dangers arising from 
military operations.1 Many smaller bases are often co-located with the ANSF, and 
sometimes with provincial civilian authorities, that are situated in busy civilian areas. For 
example, concerns have been expressed about the United States marines co-located with the 
District Administrator in a smaller base in Delaram bazaar in Nimroz province. This has led 
to more intrusive searches against community members visiting the District Governor, a 
greater risk of a suicide attack being directed against the base and increased the likelihood

 It should be recalled that in the <i>Kupreskic</i> case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
</p>
<p>Yugoslavia stated that this principle is part of customary international law. See case No. IT-95-16-T, 
judgement of 14 January 2000, para. 524 available at http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kupreskic/tjug/en/

<p>of the community being targeted by AGE as &#8220;spies&#8221; for the IM Forces. It is important that 
ISAF and government officials engage with affected communities with respect to their 
concerns over the effects these bases have on the civilian population and the increased 
possibility of them being targeted by the AGEs. 
</p>
<p>17. Some positive steps geared to the reduction of avoidable civilian deaths have been 
taken by the IM Forces. These have included efforts to improve the transparency of 
command structures between ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) &#8211; the latter 
now operating under the Commander of ISAF, and the establishment of both ISAF and 
United States Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) civilian casualty tracking cells aimed at 
investigating claims of civilian casualties attributed to ISAF and USFOR-A. Additionally, a 
new tactical directive issued on 2 July 2009, designed to reduce civilian casualties and 
maintain support by the Afghan population, specifically limits the use of force, such as 
close air support, in residential areas and other populated areas in situations in which there 
is no imminent threat to international troops. Such safeguards reflect the call by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions for the need to verify 
information prior to air strikes and house raids in order to minimize harm to civilians and 
public reaction to such tactics.  
</p>
<p>18. Amongst other concerns related to civilian casualties, is the lack of harmonized 
policies between various troop-contributing countries regarding the issuance of solatia 
payments to victims, as well as civilians&#8217; lack of access to, or awareness of, various 
condolence payment schemes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Conflict-related detention 
</b></p>
<p>19. Conflict-related detention policies in Afghanistan continue to be a major concern 
given the lack of a legal framework which complies with Afghanistan&#8217;s obligations under 
international and national law. OHCHR/UNAMA have continued to invite relevant special 
procedures mandate holders to look into the question of the transfer of detainees from 
detention facilities controlled by various military forces to detention facilities under Afghan 
control. In the Afghan justice system, detainees are often denied fair trial guarantees and 
are often prevented from meeting their lawyers. There have also been continuing 
allegations of physical abuse by Afghan security forces. All this could constitute a violation 
of Afghanistan&#8217;s human rights obligations. The United States administration recently 
indicated that it is to review United States policy regarding detainees at the Bagram Theatre 
Internment Facility (BTIF), notably the provision of an opportunity for detainees to 
challenge the basis for their detention before the Detainee Review Board, including by 
submitting evidence and summoning witnesses. These new improvements to United States 
detention policies are welcome, but they must be matched with genuine guarantees to 
ensure detainees are provided with a meaningful way to challenge the allegations against 
them. It would also be beneficial to the welfare of detainees and the legitimacy of United 
States detention policy for the United States to grant the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission (AIHRC) access to its detention facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. Women stood in greater number as candidates in the August 2009 presidential and 
provincial council elections than in previous elections. However, the responsibility of the 
State to protect and promote women&#8217;s rights and, in particular, to address the problem of 
violence against women and girls, remains a serious challenge. A prominent issue during 
2009 was the variance between new legislation and Afghanistan&#8217;s constitutional guarantees 
and international legal obligations for the protection and enforcement of women&#8217;s rights. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p>21. The Shia Personal Status Law regulates the personal affairs of the Shia community 
on matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance rights and is based on article 131 of 
the Constitution of Afghanistan. The Shia community comprises around 20 per cent of the 
population and the adoption of the law was widely interpreted as a trade-off by the 
President to gain the support of conservative elements for the then upcoming presidential 
election. Signed by the President in March 2009, the law underwent review following 
domestic and international criticism of certain articles which clearly contravened 
constitutional guarantees (articles 24 and 54 of the Afghan Constitution) and violated 
international legal obligations enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, ratified by Afghanistan in 2003, as well as the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Afghanistan acceded in 1983. The 
contentious articles included the obligation that a woman obeys her husband in sexual 
matters; unequal rights regarding divorce, guardianship of children, inheritance and 
enjoyment of property; and limitations on women&#8217;s freedom of movement.  
22. The amended law, as endorsed by presidential decree in July 2009, retained some of 
the contentious provisions that had given rise to criticism. For the most part these 
provisions were not omitted but merely reworded. For example the controversial article 
requiring a wife to provide for the sexual enjoyment of her husband was removed. 
However, Afghan legal experts are of the view that article 162 of the amended law could be 
used by a husband to effectively deny maintenance to a wife if she denies him what he 
perceives as his conjugal rights. 
23. The Shia law, rather than challenging harmful traditional and customary practices, 
has only served to legitimize practices that disadvantage women. While this law directly 
affects the rights of Afghan Shia women and girls, it potentially paves the way for further 
restrictions on the rights of all Afghan women, and jeopardizes hard-won gains in the 
context of efforts to counter violence and discrimination against Afghan women.  
</p>
<p>24. New legislation also included the Law on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women (EVAW), which represents a critical development in the protection and promotion 
of women&#8217;s rights. Endorsed by presidential decree in July 2009, it has yet to be adopted by 
parliament. This law explicitly criminalizes rape, as well as under age and forced marriage, 
and other forms of violence against women. Analysis by both international and domestic 
observers, however, reveals that from a technical perspective the law could fail to meet 
many of its stated aims. Ambiguities relating to unclear definitions that are gender-neutral, 
as well as inadequate reference to existing law such as the Penal Code, could lead to 
problems in its implementation. UNAMA and the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime conducted a thorough analysis of the law and, together with national partners, 
proposed a number of amendments that would better serve to prevent violence against 
women. At the time of writing, parliament was still reviewing these proposals. 
</p>
<p>25. OHCHR/UNAMA, in its report entitled &#8220;Silence is Violence: Stop the Abuse 
against Afghan Women and Girls&#8221; published in July 2009, found that violence against 
women, in both the public and private sphere, continues to be pervasive and widespread. 
Such violence is deeply rooted in Afghan customs, attitudes, and practices (such as <i>baad</i>, 
the giving away of girls as a form of dispute resolution, honour killings, and forced and 
under age marriage) which both compound and legitimize this violence. A culture of 
impunity for crimes against women means that perpetrators are rarely punished; as a 
consequence, violence against women is rarely perceived as criminal conduct which, in 
turn, seriously undermines efforts to prevent it. 
</p>

<p>GE.10-10230 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>women from exercising their right to participate fully in all aspects of public life. This 
includes employment, especially with regard to work perceived as countering traditional 
roles and transgressing social norms. Women with a public profile are often accused of 
immoral behaviour, a message frequently transmitted by conservative religious leaders, 
including those with vested political interests. Attacks, threats and harassment against 
women in public life, often at the hands of AGEs, are a frequent occurrence and in most 
cases go unpunished.  
</p>
<p>27. Sexual violence against Afghan women and girls has, in all probability, continued to 
be underreported. Afghan women have repeatedly reported a loss of faith in law 
enforcement and judicial institutions, which they consider ineffective, dysfunctional, and 
corrupt. The misplaced stigma of sexual violence falling on the victim rather than the 
perpetrator, as well as lack of access to any form of justice or remedies for victims, has 
ensured that sexual violence remains a taboo subject largely unaddressed either by 
Afghanistan&#8217;s law enforcement institutions or by Afghan society.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Transitional justice 
</b>28. Re-establishing the rule of law and ending impunity for egregious human rights 
violations remains crucial to the realization of justice and the enhancement of peace and 
stability in Afghanistan. The time frame for the Action Plan for Peace, Reconciliation and 
Justice (APPRJ) expired in March 2009 with most of its proposed actions not yet 
implemented. The Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board (JCMB), a body responsible 
for implementation of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) in which 
the Action Plan is a benchmark, failed to address the issue and did not take decisive steps to 
envisage a comprehensive strategy to fight against impunity for past and current human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>29. Perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses not only enjoy impunity, but 
were also elected to public office. The effort to vet candidates based on their human rights 
record failed largely due to the inability of the Afghan judicial system to effectively meet 
the provision of the Electoral Law (art. 14). This stipulates that the disqualification of 
candidates for past crimes should be made on the basis of article 62 (3) of the Afghan 
Constitution which states that: &#8220;Presidential candidates should not have been convicted of 
crimes against humanity, criminal act, or deprivation of civil rights by a court.&#8221; The 
provision of this article also applies to the Vice President. Article 85 extends this provision 
to members of parliament. The need to change and improve vetting mechanisms became 
evident when persons with credible allegations of human rights violations and abuses 
against them stood for election or were appointed to senior positions in the Government. 
Their presence greatly undermined the legitimacy and credibility of the election process, 
and cast a shadow over the democratic future of the country. 
</p>
<p>30. In July 2009, the Transitional Justice Coordination Group (TJCG), composed of 20 
representatives of human rights organizations, media and victims&#8217; groups, issued a joint 
press statement calling on presidential candidates to include the Action Plan for Peace, 
Reconciliation and Justice in their presidential campaigns. The group also called upon 
candidates not to negotiate with individuals alleged to have committed human rights 
violations and abuses. UNAMA spoke out against the anticipated presence of these alleged 
perpetrators in the Government both before and after the election. 
</p>
<p>31. UNAMA worked with the Government, as well as with civil society and victim 
groups, to identify strategies to move the transitional justice agenda forward. 
OHCHR/UNAMA, for example, widely distributed the video &#8220;Healing Tears&#8221; which 
contains the testimonies of victims. It proved effective in raising awareness and in creating </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p>a space for civil society to demand justice for egregious human rights violations. In 
addition, UNAMA, jointly with the TJCG, facilitated a three-day workshop in October 
2009 to equip civil society with advocacy skills related to the promotion of human rights 
and justice. Many representatives expressed frustration with the lack of political support, 
both national and international, for the Action Plan, recommending its urgent revision to 
reinvigorate its agenda, with particular emphasis on specific key actions, such as vetting 
and justice reform, to reinforce the rule of law.  
32. UNAMA supported the setting up of victims&#8217; groups, in particular the establishment 
of the Yakawlang Association of Victims in the central highlands, and provided technical 
support to broaden understanding of transitional justice processes. 
33. The issue of securing mass graves was an important focus of the work of UNAMA 
during 2009. The AIHRC has registered more than 200 alleged mass graves in various 
regions of the country. Yet there is no effective system in place to secure these sites once 
uncovered, and official institutions mandated to protect and investigate them have not taken 
decisive action to date. UNAMA has endeavoured to promote mechanisms to fill this 
vacuum. As part of the follow-up to a memorandum of understanding signed in 2007 
between UNAMA and the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the Criminal Investigation 
Department (CID) of the MoI, training was provided to strengthen the forensic capacity of a 
select number of officers assigned to the CID.  
</p>
<p>34. Numerous challenges constrain the protection of mass graves but in April 2009, 
financed and supported by OHCHR, UNAMA facilitated a mission by Physicians for 
Human Rights (PHR) to conduct a preliminary assessment of a grave uncovered at the MoI 
compound. Subsequent to this experience, a project aimed at enhancing para-forensic 
capacity in Afghanistan, entitled &#8220;Securing Afghanistan&#8217;s Past: a Forensic Program to 
Enhance Transitional Justice and Promote Dialogue&#8221; was submitted to the United States 
Department of State and approved in October 2009. 
</p>
<p>35. Mass graves in Afghanistan remain at high risk of destruction. In 2009, of the four 
mass graves uncovered in the provinces of Bamyan, Kunduz and Kabul, three had been 
tampered with. In some cases, the victims&#8217; families exhumed the remains of presumed 
relatives without any official oversight or control. In others, alleged perpetrators or their 
powerful allies attempted to destroy the evidence reportedly associated with these crimes. 
In July 2009, the United States Administration announced an investigation into the alleged 
killing of Taliban prisoners of war by forces of the United States-backed Northern Alliance 
at the end of 2001 in Dasht-e-Leili. PHR has previously reported findings of malicious 
destruction of this mass grave site, apparently aimed at destroying evidence of a war crime.  
</p>
<p>36. Within the reporting period, discussions were under way on the issue of national 
reconciliation and how to engage moderate elements of the Taliban in a negotiation process 
as part of the strategy to secure and stabilize Afghanistan. However, any negotiation 
process with the armed opposition should take full account of the principles enshrined in 
the Afghan Constitution and obligations which derive from international human rights 
treaties and customary human rights law, which preclude amnesty for grave crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Poverty and human rights 
</b></p>

<p>GE.10-10230 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>38. Poor Afghans experience sustained deprivation of the resources, choices, security 
and power that are necessary for the enjoyment of their human rights. Poverty reduction 
needs to focus on abusive structures and institutions of power, opportunities for choice and 
inclusion in decision-making processes, equitable resource allocation, and improved 
security. Deprivation of the enjoyment of human rights is well demonstrated by, for 
example, Afghanistan&#8217;s high child mortality rates and low life expectancy, and by the 
limited progress achieved in access to health care. In this regard, Afghanistan has the 
second highest maternal mortality rate in the world (1,600 maternal deaths per 100,000 live 
births), which points to the failure of the health system to provide care for women.  
39. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), while highlighting 
human rights, does so in a limited way by mainly focusing on civil and political rights. The 
Afghanistan Compact, the outcome of the 2006 London Conference on Afghanistan, 
established the framework for international cooperation with Afghanistan for the following 
five years. However, human rights were grouped with governance and rule of law, thus 
failing to acknowledge the cross-cutting nature of human rights, particularly in the area of 
economic and social development. Similarly, the Compact benchmarks on human rights, 
against which progress is measured, are civil and political rights-oriented, while the 
benchmarks in the economic and social development pillar that have human rights 
relevance are not framed as legal entitlements.  
</p>
<p>40. In October 2009, the Afghanistan United Nations Country Team (UNCT) launched 
the 2010&#8211;2013 United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). Human 
rights perspectives guided the United Nations analysis of development challenges in each 
of the three priority areas: (a) governance, peace and stability, (b) sustainable livelihoods, 
and (c) basic social services covered by UNDAF. UNDAF provides an opportunity to 
refocus development understanding of human rights to include economic and social rights, 
such as education and health. UNDAF recognizes that a key challenge is the collection of 
data that is disaggregated by, at a minimum, sex, age and main population groups, in order 
to have a better understanding of which groups are vulnerable and marginalized. Consistent 
with the human rights-based approach (HRBA) principles of accountability and 
transparency, the United Nations is supporting government efforts to generate 
disaggregated data so that findings from such data are available to inform policy and 
subsequent programming. 
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR collaborated with UNCT in two specific areas in 2009. The first area of 
collaboration was the involvement of UNCT with the reporting process to treaty bodies, 
specifically the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The report of the 
State party will be considered by the Committee at its May session in 2010. The second was 
the questionnaire of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food concerning the response of 
United Nations entities in Afghanistan to the global food crisis. Positive steps include 
improved mapping of the food security situation and the Government&#8217;s ownership of the 
National Risk Vulnerability Assessment, which is used to identify food insecure 
households. Food insecurity is still very high, despite an increase in agricultural production 
in 2009. This indicates the need to move away from an exclusive focus on increasing 
agricultural production towards finding options for increasing the ability of Afghans to 
access the means of procuring food. Three key barriers to procuring adequate food were 
identified: the lack of alternative livelihood options; the numerous land conflicts preventing 
access to available land; and the absence of formal social safety nets. 
</p>
<p>42. The right to food is not explicitly contained in relevant national strategies such as 
the ANDS, the National Health and Nutrition Strategy, or the National Agriculture 
Development Framework; although certain elements such as adequacy and availability have 
been addressed. The right to food is also not expressly included as an obligation in the </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p>Constitution. Concern was also raised about the Government&#8217;s ownership of national 
policies because of its high dependence on aid. 
</p>
<p>43. An OHCHR/UNAMA right to food survey conducted in 2009 found that access to 
adequate food in poor communities is frequently affected by connections to those in power. 
Corruption in food aid limits access for those who cannot afford to pay a bribe or who do 
not receive food aid because it has been diverted elsewhere. There was a marked difference 
in response between men and women, with women disproportionately and negatively 
impacted in accessing adequate food. 
</p>
<p>44. These findings, as well as additional research, contributed to a larger study on the 
human rights dimension of poverty in Afghanistan. This research has shown that abuse of 
power is a critical factor in the marginalization and disempowerment of Afghans living in 
abject poverty. In sum, poverty is neither accidental nor inevitable, but rather reflects the 
way Afghan society is organized, how resources are allocated and used, and the 
accountability, or lack thereof, of decision makers.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Deficits in democracy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Elections 
</b></p>
<p>45. The presidential and provincial council elections took place against a backdrop of 
worsening security conditions, violation of women&#8217;s rights and widespread electoral fraud 
and irregularities, which tainted the legitimacy of the electoral process and its outcome. The 
apparent interest shown by Afghans in the electoral process that was witnessed during the 
campaign did not quite yield the expected level of participation on polling day. UNAMA 
Human Rights collaborated with the AIHRC in a political rights monitoring exercise of the 
election process, producing three reports covering the nomination phase, campaign period, 
and polling day and the audit process. 
</p>
<p>46. The nomination and challenge period complied with electoral laws and regulations, 
and proceeded according to the timetable established. The campaign period, by and large, 
was also conducted in a dignified and engaged manner and stimulated vibrant political 
debates. A greater number of candidates stood for election as compared to previous 
elections. In particular, female candidates running for provincial council seats accounted for 
10 per cent of all candidates, representing an overall increase of 20 per cent compared to 
the previous provincial council elections.  
</p>
<p>47. This situation was in contrast to election-related killings, attacks and threats, mainly 
carried out by AGEs and unknown perpetrators, against candidates, civic educators and 
election officials. Insecurity also severely limited freedom of movement and constrained 
the freedom of expression of candidates and supporters, hampering their ability to 
campaign openly in public gatherings and canvass door-to-door throughout their 
constituencies. These restrictions in turn created significant limitations on freedom of 
association and peaceful assembly.  
</p>

<p>GE.10-10230 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>north-eastern regions. Thirty one civilians, including 11 election officials, were reportedly 
killed on polling day. 
</p>
<p>50. Many Afghans were not able to exercise their right to vote due to insecurity. 
Coupled with dissatisfaction with public institutions, only one third of registered voters, a 
figure which is significantly lower than for the 2004 and 2005 elections, are understood to 
have gone to the polls. Voter participation was regionally diverse: turnout was low in the 
conflict-affected areas in the south and south-east, and higher in more secure areas such as 
the central highlands, northern, western and north-eastern regions. The freedom of voters to 
choose a candidate was inhibited by the conduct of candidates, their agents and local 
commanders, as well as some officials from the Independent Election Commission (IEC) 
and the Government, directing or intimidating voters at polling centres.  
</p>
<p>51. Women&#8217;s right to vote and to stand for election to public office was severely limited 
due to social and cultural norms, and the insecure environment. Some female candidates 
received death threats, and in the more conservative areas were unable to move beyond 
their home base to campaign, restricted instead to door-to-door canvassing in private groups 
and using business cards instead of photographs. Female candidates also had limited access 
to funds for their campaign activities. On polling day itself, there were considerably fewer 
women than men at polling stations. Threats, harassment and attacks on women 
participating in public life and the discriminatory Shia Personal Status Law, which came 
into force prior to the elections, are examples of the impediments facing women in Afghan 
society.  
</p>
<p>52. Most public rallies were concentrated in provincial capitals and there was unequal 
media coverage of presidential candidates by Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA), the 
public service broadcaster. A National Security Council order to domestic and international 
media agencies to refrain from reporting any violence on polling day, coupled with the 
arrest of a number of journalists also restricted media coverage. 
53. Despite a series of anti-fraud mitigating measures prepared in advance of 20 August, 
and the deployment of independent observers throughout the country, allegations of fraud 
and irregularities were overwhelming on polling day. These included allegations of ballot 
box stuffing, proxy voting, under age voting and voters using multiple registration cards. 
Insecurity prevented observers from going to a number of polling stations in the southern, 
south-eastern, eastern and central regions from which a large number of the complaints of 
fraud and irregularities emanated. 
</p>
<p>54. The high level of insecurity, extensive fraud and protracted delays in announcing the 
results damaged the integrity of the 2009 elections, and increased disillusionment among 
Afghans with both the electoral process and their Government. A large number of voters 
and candidates did not regard the elections and their results as credible. Many voters, in 
particular women, were, in effect, disenfranchised.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10230 
</p>
<p>56. Journalists were at high risk of abduction when reporting from conflict-affected 
areas. An Afghan journalist was killed in an IM Forces operation intended to rescue him 
and an international journalist, both of whom were kidnapped by the Taliban at the site of 
the September IM Forces air strike in the northern province of Kunduz. 
</p>
<p>57. Following a protracted legislative process which began in early 2007, the Media 
Law finally came into force in July 2009, however copies of the new law were only made 
publicly available two months later. This delay was interpreted by many as a deliberate 
attempt to maintain full control of the public service broadcaster, RTA, for the duration of 
the elections. Certain provisions of the new Media Law give rise to concern. These include 
lack of clarity on restrictions to media content which leaves scope for violations and abuse: 
similar provisions in the Media Law 2004 were often used to arrest and intimidate 
journalists who had criticized the Government. Additionally, the composition and role of 
the two regulatory bodies (the High Media Council and the Media Commission) allow the 
Government to influence their work and decisions, putting at risk their impartiality and 
independence. 
</p>
<p>58. In March 2009, a multi-stakeholder consultation on freedom of expression was co-
organized by UNAMA, Afghan journalist unions and media organizations, to review issues 
such as access to information, respect for the rule of law (media law) as well as 
transparency and accountability. Participants adopted the Kabul Declaration, which is a 
common agenda for collective action aimed at protecting freedom of expression, fostering 
an independent media and enhancing the safety of journalists and others who express their 
opinion. A committee of Afghan journalist unions and media organizations was formed to 
give effect to the different elements of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>59. Sayed Pervez Kambaksh, the journalism student sentenced to death on charges of 
blasphemy in 2007, later commuted to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment, received a presidential 
pardon in August 2009 and was taken out of the country. His release was attributed to the 
high level of attention this case received, both inside and outside Afghanistan. It is unclear 
whether the release of Kambaksh signals a change that has positive value for journalists and 
broader issues of freedom of expression and opinion. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Institutional capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Institution-building

</b></p>
<p>justice, and prevention of child labour. Despite the call by the General Assembly for a 
moratorium on the death penalty, almost all the recommendations related to the death 
penalty were not accepted by Afghan authorities. OHCHR/UNAMA will continue to 
support the Government in designing an action plan for the implementation of these 
recommendations. This includes efforts to raise awareness on the issue of the death penalty, 
in particular in the light of the deficiencies in due process and fair trial guarantees in 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>62. In relation to the drafting of the country report for the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women, OHCHR/UNAMA is providing technical support and 
assistance to the Steering Committee that will oversee the reporting process. This process is 
designed to assess the present situation of women and girls in Afghanistan and to point out 
the gaps and challenges in the protection and promotion of women&#8217;s rights, thereby 
enabling OHCHR to identify further areas of support in its work on women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission mentoring 
programme 
</b></p>
<p>63. To build further expertise in economic and social rights analysis, a core aspect of the 
work of the AIHRC, OHCHR undertook a mentoring programme with selected AIHRC 
staff based in Kabul. This technical assistance was aimed at broadening the substantive 
knowledge of AIHRC staff in the area of economic and social rights. In addition to its 
signature annual report on the implementation of economic and social rights in 
Afghanistan, the AIHRC submitted its first &#8220;shadow&#8221; report to the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Ministry of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>64. In early 2009, with the support of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, sufficient funds were committed by donors for the first year of operation of the 
Human Rights Support Unit in the Ministry of Justice, for which the United Nations 
Development Programme is the lead agency. Technical support in the conceptualization of 
the structure and programming of the Unit, as well as in all stages of the hiring process, was 
provided by OHCHR. The Human Rights Support Unit is designed to play a major role in 
facilitating a comprehensive understanding and mainstreaming of human rights across line 
ministries. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Support for mainstreaming human rights in national policies

</p>
<p>building of local authorities is one of five core priorities. Participants were members of the 
Dai Kundi Provincial Sectoral Working Groups on Social Protection, Education and Health, 
responsible for their five-year development planning process, linked to the ANDS and the 
Dai Kundi PDP. While there was improvement in the capacity of the sector working groups 
to undertake analysis, follow-up on the planning processes will be essential to achieving a 
more sustainable development programme for the province.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b>67. <b>The year 2009 proved to be a challenging one, in which limited gains for human 
rights in some spheres were offset by reversals in others. Afghanistan now stands at a 
watershed. The new Government faces complex challenges to improving the human 
rights situation, as part of a necessary foundation for peace and prosperity in 
Afghanistan. Long-standing human rights concerns such as entrenched impunity, lack 
of accountability, justice and the rule of law, extreme poverty and discrimination 
against women, need to be urgently addressed as never before, if confidence in the 
Government is to be restored and Afghanistan transformed into a peaceful and 
democratic society. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Both the new Government and the international community must demonstrate 
genuine commitment to advancing human rights in Afghanistan. Human rights should 
be a central plank in ongoing and future strategies to bring about peace, security and 
democratic reform. New impetus is needed to attain the Afghanistan Compact 
benchmark on governance, rule of law and human rights and bring closer to 
realization the full respect and enjoyment of human rights for all the citizens of 
Afghanistan. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government of Afghanistan assumes with serious commitment its 
responsibilities to meet its human rights obligations, as laid down in the Constitution 
of Afghanistan and international human rights treaties to which it is a party. The 
Government and its international partners should ensure that any negotiations 
relating to national reconciliation and Afghanistan&#8217;s institution-building process 
include human rights priorities as part of its central platform. The participation of 
women and other relevant stakeholders and representatives of Afghan civil society 
should also be ensured; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Parties to the armed conflict should promote measures to secure 
compliance with international humanitarian law and respect for the protection of 
civilians, including women and children. Pro-Government forces should pursue and 
strengthen procedures in place to mitigate the impact of the conflict on the civilian 
population, improve systems of due process and accountability with respect to the 
arrest and detention of individuals in armed conflict, and harmonize and raise public 
awareness of condolence schemes. Influence should be brought to bear on anti-
Government elements to desist from attacks on civilian targets, and against 
humanitarian operations and their personnel; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government should take all necessary steps to end discrimination 
against women, including through public condemnation of all forms of violence 
against women and girls, and prosecution of crimes of sexual violence. The Law on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women should be strengthened so that it meets its </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10230 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>stated aims, avoids legal ambiguity and uncertainty, and can be better implemented. 
The Shia Personal Status Law should be repealed. Legal reform should be swiftly 
translated into national policies and programmes aimed at empowering women and 
promoting and protecting their rights. Women&#8217;s participation in decision-making 
processes with respect to peacebuilding and reconciliation talks should be ensured; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government and its international partners should demonstrate 
greater commitment to the pursuit of a comprehensive strategy to address impunity 
and to ensure the rights of all Afghans to justice, truth, reparation and guarantees of 
non-recurrence of egregious human rights violations. The rule of law, including the 
judicial system should be strengthened, and improved vetting mechanisms that 
exclude alleged human rights abusers from standing for election in the 2010 
parliamentary elections be put in place; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Efforts should continue to be made to ensure that the human rights 
perspective is fully integrated into the implementation of the Afghanistan National 
Development Strategy (ANDS), which serves as the country&#8217;s poverty reduction 
strategy, and other development policies and programmes aimed at alleviating 
poverty. Measures to address corruption, abuse of authority and lack of 
accountability in official institutions, in addition to other factors contributing to the 
discrimination and marginalization of poor Afghans, should be adopted without delay. 
The implementation of the ANDS should comply with the Government&#8217;s national and 
international human rights obligations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Government should take the necessary steps to foster a free and 
independent media as an essential step towards promoting freedom of expression, and 
ensuring the right of Afghans to receive and impart information. This is also crucial to 
securing informed participation in, and bolstering the integrity of, the 2010 
parliamentary elections. Journalists should be provided with greater protection in 
exercising their professional duties in an environment free from interference, 
intimidation and violence. The provisions of the new Media Law that could potentially 
restrict freedom of information should be reviewed and amended; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) 
should be further strengthened and supported in its role as the national human rights 
institution responsible for promoting and protecting human rights in Afghanistan and 
bridging the gap between the Government and civil society. The Government should 
ensure substantial and sustainable funding to the AIHRC and protect its 
independence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The Government is strongly urged to implement the recommendations 
emanating from its universal periodic review by the Human Rights Council, in 
particular those recommendations relating to the death penalty. In the light of serious 
deficiencies in the criminal justice system, a moratorium should be reintroduced, as 
the first step to the eventual abolition of the death penalty.
