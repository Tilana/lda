<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 1 of Section 78.037 of the Nevada
Revised Statutes (the &#147;Nevada Law&#148;) empowers a corporation to 
eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director or officer to the 
corporation or its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a 
director or officer, but such a provision must not eliminate or limit the 
liability of a director or officer for (a) acts or omissions which involve 
intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law or (b) the payment 
of distributions in violation of Section 78.300 of the Nevada Law. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 1 of Section 78.7502 of the 
Nevada Law empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party 
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed 
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or 
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by 
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or 
agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation 
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, 
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (an &#147;Indemnified Party&#148;), 
against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts 
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in 
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Indemnified Party acted 
in good faith and in a manner the Indemnified Party reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to 
any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe the 
Indemnified Party&#146;s conduct was unlawful. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 2 of Section 78.7502 of the 
Nevada Law empowers a corporation to indemnify any Indemnified Party who was or 
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or 
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a 
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person acted in the 
capacity of an Indemnified Party against expenses, including amounts paid in 
settlement and attorneys&#146; fees actually and reasonably incurred by the 
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if the Indemnified Party acted under standards similar to those set forth 
above, except that no indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue
or matter as to which the Indemnified Party shall have been adjudged to be 
liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation 
unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was 
brought determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances the 
Indemnified Party is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such 
expenses as the court deems proper. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law further 
provides that to the extent an Indemnified Party has been successful on the 
merits or otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to
in subsection (1) or (2) described above or in the defense of any claim, issue 
or matter therein, the corporation shall indemnify the Indemnified Party against
expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by 
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 1 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada
Law provides that any discretionary indemnification under Section 78.7502 of the
Nevada Law, unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to Subsection 2 of 
Section 78.751, may be made by a corporation only as authorized in the specific 
case upon a determination that indemnification of the Indemnified Person is 
proper in the circumstances. Such determination must be made (a) by the 
stockholders, (b) by the board of directors of the corporation by majority vote 
of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or 
proceeding, (c) if a majority vote of a quorum of such disinterested directors 
so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of such disinterested
directors cannot be obtained. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada
Law provides that a corporation&#146;s articles of incorporation or bylaws or an
agreement made by the corporation may require the corporation to pay as incurred
and in advance of the final disposition of a criminal or civil action, suit or 
proceeding, the expenses of officers and directors in defending such action, 
suit or proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on 
behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately 
determined by a court that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the 
corporation. Said Subsection 2 further provides that the provisions of that 
Subsection 2 do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which 
corporate personnel other than officers and directors may be entitled under 
contract or otherwise by law. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Subsection 3 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada
Law provides that indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or 
ordered by a court pursuant to said Section 78.751 does not exclude any other 
rights to which the Indemnified Party may be entitled under the articles of 
incorporation or any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested 
directors or otherwise, for either an action in his official capacity or in 
another capacity while holding his office. However, indemnification, unless 
ordered by a court pursuant to Section 78.7502 or for the advancement of 
expenses under Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law, may not be made
to or on behalf of any director or officer of the corporation if a final 
adjudication establishes that his or her acts or omissions involved intentional 
misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the 
cause of action. Additionally, the scope of such indemnification and advancement

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Section 78.752 of the Nevada Law empowers a 
corporation to purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial 
arrangements on behalf of an Indemnified Party for any liability asserted 
against such person and liabilities and expenses incurred by such person in his 
or her capacity as an Indemnified Party or arising out of such person&#146;s 
status as an Indemnified Party whether or not the corporation has the authority 
to indemnify such person against such liability and expenses. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Bylaws of the Company provide for 
indemnification of Indemnified Parties substantially identical in scope to that 
permitted under the Nevada Law. Such Bylaws provide that the expenses of 
directors and officers of the Company incurred in defending any action, suit or 
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, must be 
paid by the Company as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition
of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on 
behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it is 
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the director or 
officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. </P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Company hereby undertakes to file, 
during the period in which any offers or sales are being made, a post-effective 
amendment to this registration statement to include any prospectus required by 
section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and to reflect in such prospectus any 
material change in the information contained in this registration statement and 
to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the 
securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the 
offering. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The Company hereby undertakes to deliver or 
cause to be delivered with the prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus
is sent or given, the latest annual report to security holders that is 
incorporated by reference to the prospectus and furnish pursuant to any meeting 
the requirements of Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Exchange Act; and, to 
deliver or cause to be delivered to each person to whom the prospectus is sent 
or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically incorporated by
reference in the prospectus. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>The undersigned hereby undertakes that, for 
purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of 
the Company&#146;s annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit 
plan's annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a 
new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the 
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona 
fide offering thereof. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>Insofar as indemnification for liabilities 
arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and 
controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission 
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Exchange Act 
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification 
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses 
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in 
the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such 
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter 
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public 
policy as expressed in the Exchange Act and will be governed by the final 
adjudication of such issue.</P>

Plan or any other plan maintained by the Company, with respect to shares of 
Stock having an aggregate fair market value, determined as of the date the 
Option is granted, in excess of $100,000. Should it be determined that an 
Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan exceeds such maximum for any 
reason other than a failure in good faith to value the Stock subject to such 
option, the excess portion of such option shall be considered a Nonstatutory 
Option. To the extent the employee holds two (2) or more such Options which 
become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, the foregoing 
limitation on the exercisability of such Option as Incentive Stock Options under
the Federal tax laws shall be applied on the basis of the order in which such

it is granted, and no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Holder 
shall, by its terms, be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from 
the date of the Option. Unless otherwise specified by the Board or the Committee
in the resolution authorizing such Option, the date of grant of an Option shall

any regulatory body, or (iv) the perfection of any exemption from any such 
withholding, listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval is

with procedures established by the Board or Committee to assure that such 
deferrals comply with applicable requirements of the Code including, at the 
choice of Participants, the capability to make further deferrals for 
distribution after retirement. Any deferred distribution, whether elected by the
Participant or specified by the Stock Award Agreement, Restricted Stock Purchase
Offers or by the Board or Committee, may require the payment be forfeited in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c). Dividends or dividend equivalent
rights may be extended to and made part of any Stock Award or Restricted Stock 
Purchase Offers denominated in Stock or units of Stock, subject to such terms, 
conditions and restrictions as the Board or Committee may establish.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>(c) <U>Cancellation and 
Rescission of Grants. </U>Unless the Stock Award Agreement or Restricted Stock 
Purchase Offer specifies otherwise, the Board or Committee, as applicable, may 
cancel any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Grants at any time if the Participant 
is not in compliance with all other applicable provisions of the Stock Award 
Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer, the Plan and with the following 
conditions:</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(i) A Participant shall 
not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any
business which, in the judgment of the chief executive officer of the Company or
other senior officer designated by the Board or Committee, is or becomes 
competitive with the Company, or which organization or business, or the 
rendering of services to such organization or business, is or becomes otherwise 
prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company. For 
Participants whose employment has terminated, the judgment of the chief 
executive officer shall be based on the Participant's position and 
responsibilities while employed by the Company, the Participant's post-
employment responsibilities and position with the other organization or 
business, the extent of past, current and potential competition or conflict 
between the Company and the other organization or business, the effect on the 
Company's customers, suppliers and competitors and such other considerations as
are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and circumstances. A Participant 
who has retired shall be free, however, to purchase as an investment or 
otherwise, stock or other securities of such organization or business so long as
they are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-
counter, and such investment does not represent a substantial investment to the 
Participant or a greater than ten percent (10%) equity interest in the 
organization or business.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(ii) A Participant shall 
not, without prior written authorization from the Company, disclose to anyone 
outside the Company, or use in other than the Company's business, any 
confidential information or material, as defined in the Company's Proprietary 
Information and Invention Agreement or similar agreement regarding confidential 
information and intellectual property, relating to the business of the Company, 
acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the 
Company.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(iii) A Participant shall 
disclose promptly and assign to the Company all right, title and interest in any
invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the Participant 
during employment by the Company, relating in any manner to the actual or 
anticipated business, research or development work of the Company and shall do 
anything reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a patent where 
appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(iv) Upon exercise, 
payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant, the Participant shall certify on a form
acceptable to the Committee that he or she is in compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the Plan. Failure to comply with all of the provisions of this 
Section 6(c) prior to, or during the six months after, any exercise, payment or 
delivery pursuant to a Grant shall cause such exercise, payment or delivery to 
be rescinded. The Company shall notify the Participant in writing of any such 
rescission within two years after such exercise, payment or delivery. Within ten
days after receiving such a notice from the Company, the Participant shall pay 
to the Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result 
of the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant. Such payment
shall be made either in cash or by returning to the Company the number of shares
of Stock that the Participant received in connection with the rescinded 
exercise, payment or delivery.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>(d) 
<U>Nonassignability.</U></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(i) Except pursuant to 
Section 6(e)(iii) and except as set forth in Section 6(d)(ii), no Grant or any 
other benefit under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or payable to 
or exercisable by, anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted.</P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(ii) Where a Participant 
terminates employment and retains a Grant pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii) in order 
to assume a position with a governmental, charitable or educational institution,
the Board or Committee, in its discretion and to the extent permitted by law, 
may authorize a third party (including but not limited to the trustee of a 
&#147;blind&#148; trust), acceptable to the applicable governmental or 
institutional authorities, the Participant and the Board or Committee, to act on
behalf of the Participant with regard to such Awards.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>(e) <U>Termination of 
Employment. </U>If the employment or service to the Company of a Participant
terminates, other than pursuant to any of the following provisions under this 
Section 6(e), all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Stock Awards or Restricted 
Stock Purchase Offers shall be cancelled immediately, unless the Stock Award 
Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer provides otherwise:</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(i) <U>Retirement Under a 
Company Retirement Plan. </U>When a Participant's employment terminates as a 
result of retirement in accordance with the terms of a Company retirement plan, 
the Board or Committee may permit Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase 
Offers to continue in effect beyond the date of retirement in accordance with 
the applicable Grant Agreement and the exercisability and vesting of any such 
Grants may be accelerated.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(ii) <U>Rights in the Best
Interests of the Company. </U>When a Participant resigns from the Company and, 
in the judgment of the Board or Committee, the acceleration and/or continuation 
of outstanding Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers would be in the 
best interests of the Company, the Board or Committee may (i) authorize, where 
appropriate, the acceleration and/or continuation of all or any part of Grants 
issued prior to such termination and (ii) permit the exercise, vesting and 
payment of such Grants for such period as may be set forth in the applicable 
Grant Agreement, subject to earlier cancellation pursuant to Section 9 or at 
such time as the Board or Committee shall deem the continuation of all or any 
part of the Participant's Grants are not in the Company's best interest.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(iii) <U>Death or 
Disability of a Participant.</U></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:144px" align=justify>1. In the event of a 
Participant's death, the Participant's estate or beneficiaries shall have a 
period up to the expiration date specified in the Grant Agreement within which 
to receive or exercise any outstanding Grant held by the Participant under such 
terms as may be specified in the applicable Grant Agreement. Rights to any such 
outstanding Grants shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution in
the following order: (a) to beneficiaries so designated by the Participant; if 
none, then (b) to a legal representative of the Participant; if none, then (c) 
to the persons entitled thereto as determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction. Grants so passing shall be made at such times and in such manner 
as if the Participant were living.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:144px" align=justify>2. In the event a 
Participant is deemed by the Board or Committee to be unable to perform his or 
her usual duties by reason of mental disorder or medical condition which does 
not result from facts which would be grounds for termination for cause, Grants 
and rights to any such Grants may be paid to or exercised by the Participant, if
legally competent, or a committee or other legally designated guardian or 
representative if the Participant is legally incompetent by virtue of such 
disability.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:144px" align=justify>3. After the death or 
disability of a Participant, the Board or Committee may in its sole discretion 
at any time (1) terminate restrictions in Grant Agreements; (2) accelerate any 
or all installments and rights; and (3) instruct the Company to pay the total of
any accelerated payments in a lump sum to the Participant, the Participant's 
estate, beneficiaries or representative; notwithstanding that, in the absence of
such termination of restrictions or acceleration of payments, any or all of the 
payments due under the Grant might ultimately have become payable to other 
beneficiaries.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:144px" align=justify>4. In the event of 
uncertainty as to interpretation of or controversies concerning this Section 6, 
the determinations of the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall be binding 
and conclusive.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>7. <U>Change in Control</U>.<I> 
</I></B>Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Grant Agreement, in the 
event of a Change in Control, 50% of the vesting restrictions applicable to each
Participant&#146;s Grant(s) shall terminate fully and the Participant shall 
immediately have the right to the delivery of share certificates or exercise of 
Options, i.e. to the extent that a Participant&#146;s Option(s) are unvested, 
50% of such unvested portion shall vest.</P>

<P style="margin:0px; page-break-before:always" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>8. <U>Investment Intent</U></B>. All 
Grants under the Plan are intended to be exempt from registration under the 
Securities Act provided by Rule 701 thereunder. Unless and until the granting of
Options or sale and issuance of Stock subject to the Plan are registered under 
the Securities Act or shall be exempt pursuant to the rules promulgated 
thereunder, each Grant under the Plan shall provide that the purchases or other 
acquisitions of Stock thereunder shall be for investment purposes and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Further, 
unless the issuance and sale of the Stock have been registered under the 
Securities Act, each Grant shall provide that no shares shall be purchased upon 
the exercise of the rights under such Grant unless and until (i) all then 
applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies shall 
have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its 
counsel, and (ii) if requested to do so by the Company, the person exercising 
the rights under the Grant shall (A) give written assurances as to knowledge and
experience of such person (or a representative employed by such person) in 
financial and business matters and the ability of such person (or 
representative) to evaluate the merits and risks of exercising the Option, and 
(B) execute and deliver to the Company a letter of investment intent and/or such
other form related to applicable exemptions from registration, all in such form 
and substance as the Company may require. If shares are issued upon exercise of 
any rights under a Grant without registration under the Securities Act, 
subsequent registration of such shares shall relieve the purchaser thereof of 
any investment restrictions or representations made upon the exercise of such 
rights.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>9. <U>Amendment, Modification, Suspension
or Discontinuance of the Plan</U></B>. The Board may, insofar as permitted by 
law, from time to time, with respect to any shares at the time not subject to 
outstanding Grants, suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any 
respect whatsoever, except that without the approval of the shareholders of the 
Company, no such revision or amendment shall (i) increase the number of shares 
subject to the Plan, (ii) decrease the price at which Grants may be granted, 
(iii) materially increase the benefits to Participants, or (iv) change the class
of persons eligible to receive Grants under the Plan; provided, however, no such
action shall alter or impair the rights and obligations under any Option, or 
Stock Award, or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer outstanding as of the date 
thereof without the written consent of the Participant thereunder. No Grant may 
be issued while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated, but the rights 
and obligations under any Grant issued while the Plan is in effect shall not be 
impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify>In the event of any change in the 
outstanding Stock by reason of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or 
reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger, or similar event, the 
Board or the Committee may adjust proportionally (a) the number of shares of 
Stock (i) reserved under the Plan, (ii) available for Incentive Stock Options 
and Nonstatutory Options and (iii) covered by outstanding Stock Awards or 
Restricted Stock Purchase Offers; (b) the Stock prices related to outstanding 
Grants; and (c) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations
for such Grants. In the event of any other change affecting the Stock or any
distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of Stock, such 
adjustments as may be deemed equitable by the Board or the Committee, including 
adjustments to avoid fractional shares, shall be made to give proper effect to 
such event. In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of 
property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Board or the 
Committee shall be authorized to issue or assume stock options, whether or not 
in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, and other Grants 
by means of substitution of new Grant Agreements for previously issued Grants or
an assumption of previously issued Grants. </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>10. <U>Tax Withholding</U></B>. The 
Company shall have the right to deduct applicable taxes from any Grant payment 
and withhold, at the time of delivery or exercise of Options, Stock Awards or 
Restricted Stock Purchase Offers or vesting of shares under such Grants, an 
appropriate number of shares for payment of taxes required by law or to take 
such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy 
all obligations for withholding of such taxes. If Stock is used to satisfy tax 
withholding, such stock shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value when the 
tax withholding is required to be made.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>11. <U>Availability of 
Information</U></B>. During the term of the Plan and any additional period 
during which a Grant granted pursuant to the Plan shall be exercisable, the 
Company shall make available, not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days 
following the close of each of its fiscal years, such financial and other 
information regarding the Company as is required by the bylaws of the Company 
and applicable law to be furnished in an annual report to the shareholders of 
the Company.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><B>12. <U>Notice</U></B>. Any written notice
to the Company required by any of the provisions of the Plan shall be addressed 
to the chief personnel officer or to the chief executive officer of the Company,
and shall become effective when it is received by the office of the chief 
personnel officer or the chief executive officer.</P>

In addition to such other rights or indemnifications as they may have as 
directors or otherwise, and to the extent allowed by applicable law, the members
of the Board and the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against the 
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily 
incurred in connection with the defense of any claim, action, suit or 
proceeding, or in connection with any appeal thereof, to which they or any of 
them may be a party by reason of any action taken, or failure to act, under or 
in connection with the Plan or any Grant granted thereunder, and against all 
amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved
by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in 
satisfaction of a judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, except
in any case in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such 
claim, action, suit or proceeding that such Board or Committee member is liable 
for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties; provided 
that within sixty (60) days after institution of any such action, suit or Board 
proceeding the member involved shall offer the Company, in writing, the 
opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same.</P>

</B></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=center><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>THIS STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT
(the &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is entered into as of _________________, 20__
by and between _________________________ (hereinafter referred to as 
&#147;<U>Grantee</U>&#148;) and Mexus Gold US, a Nevada corporation (hereinafter
referred to as the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), pursuant to the Company&#146;s 
2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;). Any capitalized term 
not defined herein shall have the same meaning ascribed to it in the Plan.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=center><B>R E C I T A L S:</B></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>A. Grantee is an employee,
director or consultant of the Company, and in connection therewith has rendered 
services for and on behalf of the Company or an Affiliate.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>B. The Company desires to 
issue shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock to Grantee for the consideration
set forth herein to compensate Grantee for past services to the Company and/or 
to provide an incentive for Grantee to remain a service provider of the Company 
and to exert added effort towards its growth and success.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>NOW, THEREFORE, in 
consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, and for other good 
and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>1. <B><U>Issuance of 
Shares</U></B>. The Company hereby offers to issue to Grantee an aggregate of 
___________) shares of Common Stock of the Company (the 
&#147;<U>Shares</U>&#148;) on the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless 
this offer is earlier revoked in writing by the Company, Grantee shall have ten 
(10) days from the date of the delivery of this Agreement to Grantee to accept 
the offer of the Company by executing and delivering to the Company two copies 
of this Agreement, without condition or reservation of any kind whatsoever, 
together with the consideration to be delivered by Grantee pursuant to Section 2
below, if applicable. If the Grantee does not accept the offer represented by 
this Agreement as set forth above within ten (10) days, such offer shall be null
and void.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>2. 
<B><U>Consideration</U></B>. The consideration for the grant of the Shares shall
be the services already rendered to the Company by the Grantee. The total value 
of the services provided shall be reported to tax authorities as being 
$___________, which is equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares 
granted.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>3. <B><U>Vesting of 
Shares</U></B>. The Shares shall be fully vested as of the date of this 
Agreement.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>4. <B><U>No Right to 
Continued Service</U>.</B> The issuance of the Shares does not confer upon 
Grantee any right to continue as an Employee or Director of, or Consultant to, 
the Company or an Affiliate, nor does it limit in any way the right of the 
Company or an Affiliate to terminate Grantee&#146;s employment or other 
relationship with the Company or an Affiliate, at any time, with or without 
cause.</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>5. <B><U>Tax 
Consequences</U></B>. Grantee understands that Grantee (and not the Company) 
shall be responsible for the Grantee&#146;s own tax liability that may arise as 
a result of the grant of the Shares. Grantee represents that Grantee has 
consulted any tax consultants Grantee deems advisable in connection with the
receipt of the Shares and that Grantee is not relying on the Company or the 
Company&#146;s counsel for any tax advice. The Company intends to report the 
value of the Shares granted, at the value describe in Section 2, to appropriate 
tax authorities. The Company has the authority to require Grantee to remit to 
the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, and local taxes 
required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a 
result of the receipt of the Shares.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>

<B><U>Miscellaneous</U>.</B></P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:96px" align=justify>(a) This Agreement shall 
bind and inure to the benefit of the parties&#146; heirs, legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns.</P>

Within such sixty (60)<B>-</B>day period, except as may otherwise be 
specifically provided in this Option Agreement or any other agreement between 
Optionee and the Company which has been approved by the Board, Optionee may 
exercise the Option only to the extent the same was exercisable on the date of

<P style="margin:0px; page-break-before:always" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(d) In
the event of the Termination of Service of Optionee for Cause (as defined 
below), unless otherwise determined by the Board, (A) the Option shall expire as
of the date of the first occurrence giving rise to such termination or upon the 
Expiration Date, whichever is earlier; (B) Optionee shall have no rights with 
respect to any unexercised portion of the Option; and (C) any Option Shares 
issued in respect of the exercise of the Option on or after the date of the 
first act and/or event constituting Cause shall have occurred shall be deemed to
have been issued in respect of an expired option, and shall thereupon be deemed 
null and <I>void ab initio</I>, and Optionee shall have no claims to, or rights 
in, any such Option Shares. &#147;Cause&#148; means with respect to Optionee, 
the occurrence of any of the following events, as reasonably determined by the 
Board in each case: (i) Optionee&#146;s commission of any felony or any crime 
involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United 
States or any state thereof; (ii) Optionee&#146;s commission, or attempted 
commission, of, or participation in, a fraud or act of dishonesty against the 
Company or any Affiliate, or any of their respective employees, officers or 
directors; (iii) Optionee&#146;s intentional, material violation of any contract
or agreement between the Optionee and the Company or any Affiliate or of any 
statutory duty owed to the Company or any Affiliate; (iv) Optionee&#146;s 
unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company&#146;s or an Affiliate&#146;s 
material confidential information or trade secrets; (v) Optionee&#146;s gross 
misconduct in connection with Optionee&#146;s service to the Company or an 
Affiliate; or (vi) Optionee&#146;s failure to promptly return all documents and 
other tangible items belonging to the Company or its Affiliates in the 
Participant&#146;s possession or control, including all complete or partial 
copies, recordings, abstracts, notes or reproductions of any kind made from or 
about such documents or information contained therein, upon a Termination of 
Service for any reason. &#147;Cause&#148; shall not require that a civil 
judgment or criminal conviction have been entered against, or guilty plea shall 
have been made by, Optionee regarding any of the matters referred to in clauses 
(i) through (vi). Accordingly, the Board shall be entitled to determine 
&#147;Cause&#148; based on its good faith belief. If the Optionee is criminally 
charged with a felony or similar offense, that shall be a sufficient, but not a 
necessary, basis for such a belief. Unless otherwise specifically provided in 
the Grant Notice, the foregoing definition of &#147;Cause&#148; shall apply for 
all purposes relating to the Option, notwithstanding any employment or other 
agreement by and between Optionee and the Company or any Affiliate thereof that 
defines a termination on account of &#147;Cause&#148; (or a term having similar 
meaning).</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(e) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option is subject to earlier termination upon
a Change in Control, as provided in Section 3(b) above and in Section 11 of the 
Plan, or upon the dissolution of the Company. If the Option will terminate in 
connection with a Change in Control, the Company shall provide written notice to
Optionee of a proposed transaction constituting a Change in Control, not less 
than ten (10) days prior to the anticipated effective date of the proposed 
transaction.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(f) 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no portion of any Option which 
is not exercisable by Optionee upon the Termination of Service of such Optionee 
shall thereafter become exercisable, regardless of the reason for such 
termination, except as may otherwise be specifically provided in this Option 
Agreement or any other agreement between Optionee and the Company which has been
approved by the Board.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>7. <U>No Right to 
Continued Service</U>.</B> The Option does not confer upon Optionee any right to
continue as an Employee or Director of, or Consultant to, the Company or an 
Affiliate, nor does it limit in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate
to terminate Optionee&#146;s employment or other relationship with the Company 
or an Affiliate, at any time, with or without Cause.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>8. <U>Notice of Tax 
Election</U>.</B> If Optionee makes any tax election relating to the treatment 
of the Option Shares under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 
Optionee shall promptly notify the Company of such election.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>

<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(a) 
Although the Company has made a good faith attempt to qualify the Option as an 
incentive stock option within the meaning of Sections 421, 422 and 424 of the 
Code (if the Grant Notice provides that the Option is an Incentive Stock 
Option), the Company does not warrant that the Option granted herein constitutes
an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; within the meaning of such sections, or 
that the transfer of Option Shares will be treated for federal income tax 
purposes as specified in Section 421 of the Code.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(b) 
Optionee shall notify the Company in writing within fifteen (15) days of each 
disposition (including a sale, exchange, gift or a transfer of legal title) of 
the Option Shares made within two years after the issuance of such Option 
Shares.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:8px; text-indent:88px" align=justify>(c) If 
the Grant Notice provides that the Option is an Incentive Stock Option, Optionee
understands that if, among other things, he or she disposes of any Option Shares
granted within two years of the granting of the Option to him or her or within 
one year of the issuance of such shares to him or her, then such Option Shares 
will not qualify for the beneficial treatment which Optionee might otherwise

<P style="margin:0px">Gentlemen:</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>We have acted as special 
counsel to Mexus Gold US, a Nevada corporation (the &quot;Company&quot;), in 
connection with the preparation for filing with the U. S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission of a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (&quot;Registration 
Statement&quot;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Registration 
Statement relates to the registration of 30,000,000 shares (&quot;Shares&quot;) 
of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&quot;Common 
Stock&quot;), issuable pursuant to the Company&#146;s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan 
(the &#147;2016 Plan&#148;).</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>We have examined the 2016 
Plan and such corporate records, documents, instruments and certificates of the 
Company, and have reviewed such other documents as we have deemed relevant under
the circumstances. In such examination, we have assumed without independent 
investigation the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, 
the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, 
and the conformity of any documents submitted to us as copies to their 
respective originals. &nbsp;As to certain questions of fact material to this 
opinion, we have relied without independent investigation upon statements or 
certificates of public officials and officers of the Company.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>Based upon, subject to the
foregoing and assuming that (i) the Company reserves for issuance under the 2016
Plan an adequate number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock and 
(ii) the consideration required to be paid in connection with the issuance and
sale of shares of Common Stock under the 2016 Plan is actually received by the 
Company as provided in the Plan, we are of the opinion that the Shares, when 
issued in accordance with the 2016 Plan, will be legally issued, fully paid and 
non-assessable.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>In connection with this 
opinion, we have examined the Registration Statement, the Company's Certificate 
of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, and such other documents as we have 
deemed necessary to enable us to render the opinion hereinafter expressed.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
