<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/5, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
continue to prepare and submit to the Council an annual report on the question of the 
realization in all countries of economic, social and cultural rights, with a special focus on 
access to justice relating to violations of economic, social and cultural rights (para. 18). The 
legal protection of economic, social and cultural rights has already been considered in 
previous reports prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.1 
Since then, a number of developments in the United Nations human rights system have 
further clarified the issues and obligations that should be taken into account by Member 
States in ensuring access to justice for violations of economic, social and cultural rights. In 
the present report, the Secretary-General reviews some of these developments and 
considers, firstly, the scope of the right to an effective remedy for violations of economic, 
social and cultural rights, as elaborated by United Nations human rights treaty bodies and 
special procedures mandate holders. Following this review, he discusses the principal 
barriers to access to justice that constitute a violation of the right to an effective remedy. 
The report concludes with an identification of the due process requirements that the United 
Nations treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders have proposed for remedial 
proceedings relating to economic, social and cultural rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to a remedy for violations of economic, social 
and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. The right to a remedy for violations of human rights is fundamental to the very 
notion of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides in its article 8 
that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for 
acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.2 This 
applies equally to all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. However, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights lacks a specific provision 
requiring States parties to provide effective remedies in such cases &#8212; in contrast with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes such a clause in 
article 2, paragraph 3. Any lack of clarity has, however, since been largely overcome as a 
result of the interpretative work of United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the work 
of the special procedures mandate holders over the last 20 years, a period during which the 
United Nations human rights system has consistently recognized the right to an effective 
remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>3. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has played an important 
role in this regard. In one of its key general comments setting out the scope of the 
obligations arising from article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, the Committee noted that 
&#8220;among the measures which might be considered appropriate [to achieve the full realization 
of the rights of the Covenant], in addition to legislation, is the provision of judicial 
remedies with respect to rights which may, in accordance with the national legal system, be 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See, for example, the 2006 report of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council (E/2006/86). 
 
</p>
<p>2
 See also the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
</p>
<p>art. 6, and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims 
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law. </p>


<p>considered justiciable&#8221;.3 Since then, the Committee has consistently affirmed that 
appropriate means of redress, or remedies, must be available to any aggrieved individual or 
group,4 and that, as a measure to ensure the implementation of the Covenant at the national 
level, any persons or groups who have experienced violations of their economic, social and 
cultural rights should have access to effective judicial or other appropriate remedies at both 
national and international levels.5  
</p>
<p>4. Other treaty bodies have reached similar conclusions. Both the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families have determined that 
migrant workers, and specifically women migrant workers, must have access to remedies 
for rights violations that occur in the workplace.6 The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has urged States parties, among other things, to take all necessary measures to abolish all 
forms of child labour and to regulate the working environment and conditions for working 
adolescents so as to ensure that they are fully protected and have access to legal redress 
mechanisms.7  
</p>
<p>5. Special procedures mandate holders and subsidiary bodies of the Human Rights 
Council have emphatically affirmed the right to a remedy. The Special Rapporteur on extreme 
poverty and human rights has called on States to establish effective, affordable and accessible 
procedures, including non-formal dispute resolution mechanisms, in accordance with human 
rights standards, to support persons living in poverty seeking justice, taking into account the 
specific barriers that they face gaining access to justice.8 According to the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to food, justiciability is essential to the realization of the right to food.9 Similarly, 
the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights noted with approval the 
view of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that the victims of violations 
of the right to health should have access to effective judicial or other appropriate remedies at 
both the national and international levels.10 Other United Nations experts have held that an 
effective legal remedy ensures that the right will be viewed as an entitlement and not an act of 
charity,11 corrects for local power imbalances,12 facilitates accountability,13 and allows for the 
development of specific jurisprudence.14

<p>6. The legal protection of the right to a remedy for violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights has recently been strengthened by the adoption and recent entry into force of 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which allows the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to consider 
communications alleging violations of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. The entry into 
force of the Optional Protocol provides an international remedial mechanism which will 
reinforce the justiciability of all economic, social and cultural rights.15 Many United Nations 
experts, including special procedures mandate holders, have since affirmed their 
interpretation of the Optional Protocol as a clear expression of the fact that the fulfilment of 
economic, social and cultural rights is not a matter of charity but one of legal obligation.16 
</p>
<p><b> III. The character of effective domestic remedies 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to an effective remedy for economic, social and cultural rights violations 
may, in principle, be satisfied either by a judicial remedy or by administrative remedies 
subject to judicial appeal when appropriate.17 Several treaty bodies and special procedures 
mandate holders have also indicated that administrative remedies may be sufficient if 
subject to judicial review. Although the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has stated that either form of remedy may be sufficient, it has emphasized that 
&#8220;whenever a Covenant right cannot be made fully effective without some role for the 
judiciary, judicial remedies are necessary&#8221;, and that an effective judicial remedy is 
considered an appropriate, and perhaps even necessary, means of realizing economic, social 
and cultural rights, since other means &#8220;could be rendered ineffective if they are not 
reinforced or complemented by judicial remedies.&#8221;18 Moreover, even when an 
administrative remedy is permissible, it is typically essential that there be a judicial appeal 
available for review of the administrative resolution of the issue.19 To justify the failure to 
provide any judicial recourse, a State would need to show that such recourse was neither an 
appropriate means for realizing economic, social and cultural rights nor necessary for that 
purpose, which, according to the Committee, would be difficult to demonstrate.20 
</p>
<p>8. As failure to comply with State obligations in the field of economic, social and 
cultural rights often affects groups of rights holders in a similar situation, allowing for 
collective or group remedies is, in many cases, indispensable for the realization of the right 
to an effective remedy. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
repeatedly recognized that groups that have suffered violations of their economic, social 
and cultural rights must have access to a remedy, whether judicial or administrative.21

<p>Examples of such collective or group remedies drawn from different legal systems include, 
inter alia, class actions, collective <i>amparo</i>, public interest litigation, <i>actio popularis</i> and 
recognizing the standing of national human rights institutions, public defenders or equality 
bodies to represent groups. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also stated that it 
might be mandatory to allow for collective complaints when &#8220;large numbers of children&#8221; 
suffer similar economic, social and cultural rights violations.22 The Special Rapporteur on 
extreme poverty and human rights has indicated that remedial mechanisms must allow for 
collective complaints,23 while the Special Rapporteur on the right to education has argued 
that groups must have a right of action for rights violations24 and that &#8220;legal standing should 
be given the broadest possible interpretation&#8221;.25 
</p>
<p>9. In some circumstances, an appropriate procedure available prior to the actual 
infringement of an economic, social or cultural right may be an important component of the 
right to a remedy. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has asserted 
that, in the case of the rights to social security, housing, and water, State action that could 
interfere with the enjoyment of the right must be preceded by an opportunity for genuine 
consultation with those affected, timely and full disclosure of information on the proposed 
measures, reasonable notice of proposed actions, legal recourse and remedies for those 
affected, and legal assistance for obtaining legal remedies.26 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health effectively concurred in this finding, 
adding that accountability can be prospective in nature, and requires that &#8220;at all times the 
State must be able to demonstrate and justify how it is discharging its obligations.&#8221;27 
Potentially affected individuals must have access to information about the measures and be 
able to challenge their adequacy.28 
</p>
<p>11. The right to an effective remedy entails that the remedy must be capable of 
providing adequate reparations for the violation. The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has clearly stated that all victims of violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights should be entitled to adequate reparation, including restitution, 
compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition.29 Other treaty bodies have made 
similar findings, such as the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which recognized the 
need for a broad range of reparations for violations of the rights of the child, and 
specifically acknowledged such a right for violations of the right to health.30 The Special

<p>Rapporteurs on the right to health,31 on the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation,32 on extreme poverty and human rights,33 and on toxic waste34 have also stated 
that the right to a remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights requires the 
provision of reparations in appropriate circumstances. For its part, the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has found that a local remedy which would constitute a bar 
to proceedings for failure to exhaust local remedies must be available, effective and 
sufficient.35 
</p>
<p>12. Restitution requires restoring the circumstances that existed prior to the violation, to 
the degree that it is possible.36 However, where it is impossible to restore the prior 
circumstances, compensation must cover the costs that resulted from the rights violation.37 
Affording the victims satisfaction for the rights violation involves making a formal 
commitment to respect the right,38 an effort that is closely linked to providing guarantees of 
non-repetition. Guarantees of non-repetition may include concrete reforms to law and 
policy connected to the violation as well as the sanctioning of responsible actors.39 It is 
important, in effecting reparation, to ensure differential attention to the special needs and 
vulnerabilities of different categories of victims, such as children, who have distinct 
capacities and developmental requirements.40 Differential attention may require providing 
services, such as &#8220;medical and psychological assistance, legal support and measures of 
rehabilitation&#8221;,41 in response to these special needs. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal framework for domestic remedies 
</b></p>
<p>13. In order to fulfil the right to a remedy, the general legal framework establishing the 
national strategy for ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social or cultural rights must 
provide for remedial mechanisms regarding violations. According the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, framework laws should establish &#8220;institutional 
responsibility for the implementation of the right to health &#8230; and possible recourse 
procedures.&#8221;42 Other treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders have 
emphasized the need to incorporate provisions in national laws concerning remedial 
procedures. The Committee on Migrant Workers asserted that both monitoring mechanisms 
and complaints procedures should be incorporated into the national legal framework.43 The 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, and the Special

<p>Rapporteur on the right to education have determined that national law must establish 
domestic remedies to address alleged violations of those rights.44 
</p>
<p>14. The legal framework establishing domestic remedies should consider allowing the 
application of international human rights norms in remedial proceedings, as well as any 
applicable domestic constitutional or legislative provisions that give legal status to 
international human rights norms.45 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has repeatedly asserted that the incorporation in the domestic legal order of 
international instruments recognizing rights &#8220;can significantly enhance the scope and 
effectiveness of remedial measures and should be encouraged.&#8221;46 The domestic application 
of treaty provisions should also involve States taking effective measures to increase 
awareness of human rights norms among the judiciary, and ensuring that judicial training 
takes full account of the justiciability of internationally recognized human rights.47  
</p><p>15. The United Nations human rights system has recognized the usefulness of the direct 
incorporation of human rights treaties into domestic legal systems.48 In the case of any 
conflict with domestic legislation, United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures 
mandate holders have emphasized that precedence should be accorded to human rights 
instruments.49 The issue of incorporation also arises regarding the domestic effect of non-
self-executing treaties. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
maintained that States should avoid a priori assumptions that human rights treaties are not 
self-executing.50 In fact, both the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education have made reference to various treaty norms 
that courts and other domestic adjudication mechanisms should consider to be self-
executing.51 
</p>
<p><b> V. Barriers to access to justice for violations of economic, social 
and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. For a remedial mechanism to constitute an effective remedy for an economic, social 
and cultural rights violation, it must be &#8220;accessible to everyone without discrimination.&#8221;52 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed the need for effective 
access to justice for economic, social and cultural rights violations.53 Similarly, the 
Committee on Migrant Workers has repeatedly expressed concern that migrant workers

<p>lack effective access to justice for economic, social and cultural rights violations54 and has 
frequently recommended that States ensure such access.55 This section will consider several 
aspects of access that the United Nations system has dealt with in more detail, including 
physical accessibility, affordability, legal assistance, access to information, and equality of 
access. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Physical accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>17. A fundamental aspect of the right to access remedies for economic, social and 
cultural rights violations is to ensure physical access to such remedies. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has indicated that, as a basic matter, individuals must 
be able to physically access the means of seeking remedy for economic, social and cultural 
rights violations.56 United Nations experts, including the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation57 and the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty 
and human rights,58 as well as the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee,59 have 
repeatedly alluded to physical access to justice. Physical accessibility is of particular 
concern in the case of persons with disabilities that render it more difficult to physically 
access police stations, courts, State administrative offices and other infrastructure that may 
be necessary for mobilizing the law.60 It is also important for people living in remote areas, 
as the distances involved in travelling to the locations of established justice mechanisms 
can seriously impede their effective access.61 Finally, women migrant workers may also 
have difficulties with physical accessibility if employers confine them to their work sites 
and restrict outside communication.62  
</p>
<p><b> B. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>18. Beyond physical accessibility, economic barriers often prevent access to remedies. 
According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, remedies for 
violations of these rights must be affordable for all, with &#8220;related administrative and legal 
costs &#8230; based on the principle of equity&#8221;.63 Similarly, the Committee on Migrant Workers 
expressed concern that certain migrant workers would be unable to seek redress through 
means free of legal fees,64 while the Committee on the Rights of the Child has affirmed that 
States must eliminate economic barriers to access to justice.65 Among United Nations 
system experts, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has identified 
economic accessibility as one of the principal barriers limiting access to justice,66 while the

<p>Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation has 
emphasized that remedies must be financially accessible to the poor.67 To ensure economic 
accessibility, formal fees should be reduced or eliminated and attention should be paid to 
other costs that might limit access to justice.68 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>19. Access to adequate legal assistance in pursuing a remedy is essential to the right to a 
remedy for economic, social and cultural rights violations. As the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights has stated, &#8220;legal assistance for obtaining remedies should be 
provided within maximum available resources.&#8221;69 Several concluding observations adopted 
by treaty bodies emphasize that available legal assistance is crucial following a violation of 
economic, social and cultural rights.70 Other treaty bodies have confirmed the need for 
access to legal assistance and representation in pursuing remedies for economic, social and 
cultural rights violations.71 United Nations experts agree that legal assistance is necessary in 
the context of economic, social and cultural rights violations to ensure that all have access 
to justice.72 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has added that 
&#8220;national ombudspersons, human rights commissions, and similar national human rights 
institutions should be permitted to address violations of the right&#8221;,73 thus proposing an 
expansion of the avenues for victims to access legal aid, present complaints and obtain legal 
redress.74

  In the regional sphere, the inter-American human rights system has recognized the State&#8217;s obligation 
</p>
<p>to remove any obstacles to accessing justice that result from economic status. Furthermore, the 
Plenary Assembly of the XIV Ibero-American Judicial Summit adopted the 100 Brasilia Rules on 
Access to Justice for Vulnerable Groups which provide guidance for ensuring access to justice for 
persons in vulnerable situations, and have been endorsed by the judiciaries, public defenders and 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s offices of several Latin American countries. Both the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have imposed in certain 
circumstances an obligation to provide free legal services to those in need to prevent a violation of 
their right to a fair trial and effective judicial protection. The Commission has set out three factors to 
be assessed in determining the need for free legal counsel in specific cases, namely the resources 
available to the litigant, the complexity of the issues involved and the significance of the rights at 
issue. The European Court of Human Rights has also highlighted that the requirement of legal 
representation before a court should not constitute a barrier to access justice (see European Court of 
Human Rights, <i>Airey </i>v.<i> Ireland</i>, 9 October 1979, paras. 26&#8211;28). </p>


<p><b> D. Access to information 
</b></p>
<p>20. States have a general obligation to provide access to the information necessary to 
pursue remedies, with the goal of ensuring awareness of available remedies and remedial 
procedures. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has affirmed on 
multiple occasions that States must provide the information necessary for individuals to 
seek remedies for economic, social and cultural rights violations.75 The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child has also indicated that children should receive information about 
available remedies and that special attention should be paid to increasing awareness of 
these among children and their representatives.76 The Committee on Migrant Workers has 
expressed concern that migrant workers lack sufficient awareness of available remedies,77 
and has asserted that both States of origin78 and destination79 have obligations to provide 
information. Finally, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
has noted that lack of knowledge of available remedies can affect the right of access to 
justice for women migrant workers.80 Similar statements have been made by the Special 
Rapporteur on the human right to safe water and sanitation and the Special Rapporteur on 
extreme poverty and human rights.81  
</p>
<p>21. The information provided on available remedies for rights violations must be 
understandable to all82 and available in local languages, including those of minority and 
indigenous groups.83 It should include details about existing law and procedures.84 This may 
require that States &#8220;make legal materials, such as laws, judgements, trial transcripts and 
adjudication procedures, available and reasonably accessible.&#8221;85  
</p>
<p><b> E. Equality of access 
</b></p>
<p>22. Access to justice for violations of economic, social and cultural rights must be 
provided for all on the basis of equality without discrimination. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has upheld this principle in a variety of contexts,

<p>stressing the need for remedies in case of discrimination,86 and many other treaty bodies 
have affirmed it, including the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women,87 the Committee on the Rights of the Child,88 and the Committee on Migrant 
Workers.89 The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing and the Special Rapporteur on 
extreme poverty and human rights have stated that remedies for economic, social and 
cultural rights violations cannot discriminate against certain groups of rights holders, but 
must be available to all on an equal footing.90 Particular attention should be paid to direct or 
indirect discrimination on the basis of poverty,91 social marginalization,92 age,93 caste,94 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status.95  
</p>
<p>23. Ensuring equal access to justice for economic, social and cultural rights violations 
requires repealing or modifying any laws that effectively prevent certain groups from 
accessing remedies. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
has emphasized that laws affecting a work permit upon receipt of a complaint may prevent 
or discourage women migrant workers from accessing remedies,96 while the Committee on 
Migrant Workers has indicated that domestic workers as a group must not be systematically 
excluded from remedial systems through categorization as non-workers.97 However, in 
some circumstances it might not be sufficient to require that laws and regulations 
concerning access to legal remedies for economic, social and cultural rights violations do 
not discriminate. In some cases, such as those of undocumented women migrant workers or 
homeless people, procedural laws and regulations should include proactive measures to 
ensure access to justice by such categories of persons.98 Affirmative protection will be 
important when it is likely that a person will suffer discrimination in access to justice based 
on group membership. 
</p>
<p>24. The obligation to ensure equality of access to justice requires that States eliminate 
inequality or discrimination in fulfilling the various components of the right of access to 
justice. For instance, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
has determined that the obligation to provide legal assistance and legal aid must be fulfilled 
equally for women migrant workers who have suffered violations under labour and 
employment laws.99 According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child: &#8220;States may 
have to provide special assistance to children who face obstacles to accessing justice, for 
example, because of language or disability or because they are very young.&#8221;100 In this sense, 
the various aspects concerning access to justice &#8212; such as the rights to physical access,

<p>affordability and access to information &#8212; must be fulfilled equally and without 
discrimination. Special emphasis has been placed on ensuring that administrative and 
judicial mechanisms respect the right to equality for those who historically have been 
discriminated against in remedial proceedings. This includes having a victim-sensitive and 
human rights-based approach in managing the proceedings and in resolving the matter. In 
that respect, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has underscored that, for matters 
affecting children, the legal reasoning of all judicial and administrative judgements and 
decisions should be based on the principle of the best interests of the child. The Committee 
and other experts have also stressed that the design and implementation of adjudication 
mechanisms must ensure that children are afforded an opportunity to be heard and that due 
weight should be given to those views in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Right to due process for remedies relating to economic, social 
and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>25. The duty to realize economic, social and cultural rights imposes an obligation on 
States to establish &#8220;appropriate venues of redress&#8221; such as courts or administrative 
mechanisms.101 For the realization of such rights, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has indicated that States parties should institute policies and strategies at the 
national level that ensure the establishment of effective mechanisms and institutions where 
they do not exist, including administrative authorities, ombudspersons and other national 
human rights institutions, courts and tribunals.102 Remedies can be an adequate venue of 
redress if they are accessible,103 affordable,104 timely or prompt,105 effective,106 legitimate,107 
predictable,108 compatible with rights,109 and transparent.110 They also must be equitable,111 
requiring that they provide means to include the &#8220;poorest and most disadvantaged and 
marginalized&#8221;.112 
</p>
<p>26. Administrative and other remedial mechanisms cannot replace a right to judicial 
remedy when it is necessary to realize economic, social and cultural rights. As the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has determined, &#8220;whenever a 
Covenant right cannot be made fully effective without some role for the judiciary, judicial 
remedies are necessary.&#8221;113 In such cases, States have a duty to guarantee victims seeking 
remedies for alleged violations of economic, social and cultural rights proper access to the 
judicial system.114 Courts and tribunals must adjudicate complaints promptly, expeditiously,

<p>effectively, impartially and independently.115 Judicial remedies regarding economic, social 
and cultural rights violations must, inter alia, be accessible, affordable, and equitable. The 
remainder of this section will discuss the characteristics that both administrative and 
judicial mechanisms must have in order to fulfil the right to due process for victims of 
economic, social and cultural rights violations, in the terms set forth by United Nations 
treaty bodies and experts. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Competence, independence, transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>27. As recalled by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, remedial 
proceedings for economic, social and cultural rights violations require competent and 
independent administrative and judicial bodies.116 One way to assure the competence of 
those in charge of adjudicating complaints is by providing training on international legal 
standards regarding economic, social and cultural rights. The Committee on Migrant 
Workers and other treaty bodies has emphasized the importance of providing training on 
the human rights treaties to the officials involved in the protection of rights, &#8220;particularly 
public prosecutors, judges, magistrates and personnel involved in the administration of 
justice.&#8221;117 States have also been requested to ensure that the training is provided on a 
permanent and continuous basis.118  
</p>
<p>28. Adjudication mechanisms, whether judicial or administrative, must also be 
independent. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education has noted that the very 
purpose of adjudicating alleged violations of that right is &#8220;to have a credible, independent 
body monitoring the legal compliance of State actors in the field of education.&#8221;119 
Independence of adjudicatory bodies cannot be limited to formal legal or constitutional 
requirements but also must include guarantees to ensure the de facto independence of 
officials, judges and magistrates.120 Various special rapporteurs have stated that 
independence requires proper financing, as well as adequate human resources allocations to 
and institutional structure of the adjudicative bodies.121 
</p><p>29. Finally, courts and other remedial mechanisms for economic, social and cultural 
rights violations must be transparent and accountable. The Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights has emphasized that, because the realization of rights requires good 
governance, the courts and administrative bodies responsible for providing remedies for 
rights violations must be both transparent and accountable.122 In this regard, both United 
Nations treaty bodies and experts have emphasized the State duty to combat corruption 
among officials responding to economic, social and cultural rights violations.123 The 
Committee on Migrant Workers has underscored that States must take a proactive role in 
eliminating corruption, including by investigating and sanctioning those involved.124

<p><b> B. Expeditious proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>30. States should ensure that remedies for economic, social and cultural rights violations 
are able to provide an answer in a prompt and timely fashion.125 As the fulfilment of 
economic, social and cultural rights is often linked to the livelihood of rights holders, 
remedies require special diligence, celerity and expeditious decisions in order to be 
effective.126 United Nations treaty bodies and experts have made extensive reference to this 
requirement, stating that remedial proceedings must be timely, prompt and expeditious.127 
Although there is no legal stipulation as to the appropriate length of any given 
administrative proceeding or judicial process, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights made clear that proceedings should not result in &#8220;unwarranted delays&#8221; in 
the preliminary stages of proceedings or in arriving at a final decision.128 The 
reasonableness and adequacy of the length of the decision must take into account the 
specific nature of the controversy and the specific needs of claimants, especially of those 
whose are most in need of an expeditious response, such as children or migrant workers 
facing deportation.129  
</p>
<p>31. Specific issues arise in the context of migrant workers who might return to their 
States of origin, voluntarily or otherwise, prior to the resolution of remedial proceedings for 
economic, social and cultural rights violations.130 The Committee on Migrant Workers has 
emphasized that States should design remedial proceedings so that victims are not barred by 
the length of proceedings from filing and pursuing a complaint regarding violations of their 
rights.131 As alluded to in paragraph 23 above, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women has indicated that the right to access justice may be affected 
when, upon complaint, a migrant worker loses a work permit, making it financially difficult 
&#8220;to remain in the country for the duration of the trial, if any.&#8221;132 In the case of migrants 
returned to their country of origin, States may consider entering into bilateral agreements 
that permit these migrants to have access to justice in the country of employment.133 
</p>
<p><b> C. Reasonably simple and inexpensive proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>32. Administrative and judicial remedies must be designed based on a principle of 
equity and affordability. As a consequence, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has determined that remedies must not be &#8220;unreasonably costly&#8221;.134 If any

<p>fee or other direct or indirect cost is introduced, it should be guided by a principle of 
equity.135 Moreover, the Committee has highlighted the State&#8217;s obligation to provide legal 
recourse that is not &#8220;unreasonably complicated&#8221;.136 The right to reasonably simple 
proceedings especially benefits those who have been historically discriminated against or 
those who are in particular circumstances of vulnerability. In that sense, United Nations 
experts have called upon States to avoid proceedings that are complex, overly legalistic or 
employ legal jargon or use languages that make it difficult for disadvantaged people to 
understand the proceedings and its consequences and interfere with their ability to demand 
the fulfilment of their rights.137 
</p>
<p><b> D. Fair opportunity to prove the violation 
</b></p>
<p>33. Remedial proceedings must ensure that the victim of an economic, social or cultural 
rights violation has a fair opportunity to prove his or her claim. In considering the principle 
of equality of arms, United Nations experts have signaled the importance of not presuming 
conditions of equality between the parties in a dispute when practice and experience have 
shown otherwise. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed the 
need to include measures to balance inequalities between parties, including provision for 
shifting the burden of proof. The Committee has stated, in that regard, that &#8220;where the facts 
and events at issue lie wholly, or in part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities 
or other respondent, the burden of proof should be regarded as resting on the authorities, or 
the other respondent, respectively.&#8221;138  
</p>
<p><b> E. Reasoned decision on the merits 
</b></p>
<p>34. To make administrative and judicial remedial mechanisms effective, the final 
decision must include the reasons on which it is based and indicate any applicable 
reparations. For the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, effectively 
addressing economic, social and cultural rights violations entails the opportunity of arriving 
at a final decision on the merits of the case.139 This resolution should include a reasoned 
basis for the decision, that is, an explanation of the decision on the merits of the legal claim 
on which the complaint is founded. Another crucial aspect of the content of the decision, 
when a breach of a right has been found, is the determination of the reparations that are to 
be provided and effectively implemented. As previously indicated, the right to an effective 
remedy requires that the remedy must be capable of providing adequate reparations for the 
rights violation.140  
</p>
<p><b> F. Effective enforcement of the decision 
</b></p>
<p>35. Finally, States have also an obligation to take steps in order to ensure that decisions 
will be enforced or implemented. The purpose of any remedial proceeding is to give effect

<p>to the economic, social and cultural rights contained in various human rights instruments. 
Therefore, follow-up and enforcement mechanisms must be established and be available 
and accessible in practice. As a way to promote enforcement, United Nations special 
rapporteurs have recommended implementing diverse measures, including sanctions, 
against those who interfere with the implementation of rights enshrined in the 
instruments.141 Additionally, as enforcement should be considered as an integral part of the 
proceedings,142 this right must be understood in conjunction with the requirement of a 
&#8220;prompt decision&#8221; when examining the length of a trial or proceeding. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b>36. <b>The right to effective access to justice for economic, social and cultural rights 
violations is well established in the United Nations human rights protection system. 
The system has both recognized the right and established extensive guidance on how 
States should ensure its realization. In this sense, the system reflects a broader trend 
among international human rights protection mechanisms requiring that States create 
adequate remedial mechanisms for economic, social and cultural rights violations. 
Failure to provide effective remedial mechanisms that can lead to reparations for 
economic, social and cultural rights violations can itself amount to a breach of human 
rights obligations.
