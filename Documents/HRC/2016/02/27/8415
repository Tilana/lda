<p><b>  Mission to Ecuador</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Government of Ecuador, under President Rafael Correa, has undertaken major 
reforms to improve human rights protection, including constitutional renewal, prison 
reform, an increase in justice sector and witness-protection spending and social and 
economic initiatives to improve the lives of disadvantaged citizens. Many ministers have a 
strong commitment to human rights. Nevertheless, Ecuador faces major challenges relating 
to extrajudicial executions.  
</p>
<p> The homicide rate has skyrocketed in Ecuador over the past 20 years. The 
Government has taken significant steps to begin to address the problem of hired killers, but 
there is an urgent need to put an end to the practice whereby police and prosecutors often 
do not undertake serious investigations where the victim has a police record.  
</p>
<p> In the north, the conflict in Colombia has now spilled over into Ecuador. The 
number of illegal armed groups operating at the border has grown significantly. They have 
engaged in physical abuses and killings of civilians. The armed forces of Ecuador have had 
difficulty countering the groups, and in some areas appear to be unable or unwilling to do 
so. Furthermore, abuses have been committed by the military against civilians. 
</p>

<p> Killings alleged by the media and officials to have resulted from the application of 
indigenous justice are prominently reported. The Special Rapporteur, however, found no 
evidence of any such killings in recent years. Reporting to the contrary confuses formal 
justice carried out in accordance with indigenous traditions, with lynchings, which are 
arbitrary or vengeful attacks against a suspected criminal. 
</p>
<p> Lynching, social cleansing and abuses by rural juntas are serious problems in some 
areas of the country, but are underreported and insufficiently studied. 
</p>
<p> Impunity is a significant cause and aggravator of all of these types of killings. Police 
and prosecutors are often poorly trained and resourced. Witnesses often do not know about 
or trust the witness protection programme. The courts are slow. Corruption and threats in 
the criminal justice system are common and skew &#8220;justice&#8221; in favour of the violent, wealthy 
and powerful. 
</p>
<p> The Government&#8217;s Truth Commission, which examined violations from 1984 to 
2008, constitutes an important blow to impunity. While some have attacked its composition 
and independence, the Commission nevertheless amassed an invaluable amount of 
information on abuses. It is essential that this information be acted upon. 
</p>
<p> For many in the international human rights community, Ecuador is largely off the 
radar screen. As a result, Ecuador suffers from a lack of humanitarian assistance and of 
monitoring and promotion activities. 
</p>
<p> In meetings with senior officials at the conclusion of his mission, the Special 
Rapporteur found them very receptive to his preliminary recommendations and 
conclusions. Because of the general commitment in the Government to the promotion of 
human rights, he is optimistic that the reforms recommended in the present report will be 
seriously considered.

<p><b> I. Ecuador-Colombia border killings 
</b></p>
<p>1. The extent of organized crime, guerrilla and State violence at the northern border of 
Ecuador is not widely appreciated. Across the border in Colombia, these issues receive 
significant domestic and international attention. While the level of violence is notably 
worse in Colombia, the conflict has clearly spilled into Ecuador, with extremely negative 
consequences for those living in the provinces of Sucumb&#237;os and Esmeraldas. Civilians are 
subjected to harassment, unlawful taxes, stealing and violence from a range of non-State 
actors, including the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), ex-
paramilitary groups and traffickers. Civilians are also subjected to violence from State 
forces. The Special Rapporteur gratefully acknowledges comments received on the present 
report from the Government of Ecuador in April 2011. The suggested factual changes have 
been made and the comments as a whole have been included (see appendix II). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Growth of illegal armed group violence  
</b></p>
<p>2. The northern border province of Sucumb&#237;os has long suffered from FARC 
infiltration, but has had little State or other illegal armed group presence. FARC control led 
to serious violations of the rights of civilians, as described below. The presence of a single-
armed actor had, however, one positive effect: there was little competition between armed 
actors over the control of resources. The attendant costs to civilians of such competition 
were thus minimized. 
</p>
<p>3. Since early 2008, however, the armed actor presence has increased and diversified, 
the dynamics of control have become unstable, and civilian security has deteriorated. As 
Colombian efforts to fight illegal armed groups have pushed them to marginal areas of 
Colombia, they have increasingly crossed into Ecuador. Furthermore, following a 
Colombian airstrike on a FARC base in Sucumb&#237;os in March 2008, Ecuador&#8217;s military 
presence in the area has greatly increased. The military&#8217;s presence had been welcomed by 
many civilians weary of the lack of security. However, one effect of increased State 
presence has been the dispersal of FARC camps and increased numbers of FARC members 
choosing to live among civilians in order to disguise their presence from the military. This 
has increased the opportunity for FARC abuses, and complicated the place of civilians in 
the military&#8217;s anti-FARC strategy.  
</p>
<p>4. Witnesses, Government officials and interlocutors working closely with affected 
populations described how the newer criminal groups enter Ecuador for a range of reasons. 
They cross the border to obtain goods, to traffic drugs and weapons, or to temporarily 
escape the intensity of conflict in Colombia. Illegal armed groups have bases in Ecuador, 
where the military has found weapons and explosives. Sucumb&#237;os province in particular is 
especially inviting to the groups because of the ease with which the border can be crossed; 
the existence of many villages along the border, which provide a steady source of food, 
information and forced labour; the presence of major roads through the province, and a 
large airport for travel and transporting goods; and the existence of a large town, providing 
supplies, health care and ease of concealment. 
</p>
<p>5. The growing number of illegal armed groups in Ecuador has led, inevitably, to 
competition for these resources. The consequences for civilians have been disastrous. The 
groups force civilians to &#8220;cooperate&#8221; with them: to pay taxes, provide food and shelter, hide 
weapons, make uniforms and provide information on the activities of other armed groups 
and State actors. In some cases, they also forcibly recruit civilians, including minors, to 
fight. The groups can obtain control through simply being the only armed presence in an 
area; or, where there is no State presence, they can obtain a level of community support by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>being the only group capable of enforcing basic order and security. They also threaten 
civilians to secure their cooperation; abuses take place when civilians refuse to comply with 
group demands.  
</p>
<p>6. The violence has particularly affected rural Ecuadorians, indigenous groups and 
displaced Colombians. One rural resident explained that the FARC, which was in de facto 
control of her area, forced residents to pay &#8220;taxes&#8221; on the corn they sold, punished common 
crimes (such as stealing) and forced her family to give the guerrillas food. She also stated 
that her neighbours&#8217; two sons had been abducted by the FARC to fight. Interlocutors 
working with the Colombian refugee population in Sucumb&#237;os noted that the population in 
Sucumb&#237;os had grown significantly in recent years &#8211; from an average of two new asylum-
seekers per day in 2007-2008 to 50-60 per day in 2010 &#8211; and they are easy targets of both 
illegal armed group and State abuse.1 In addition, indigenous groups living along the border 
have been held captive, driven off their land or used as forced labour.2 
</p>
<p>7. Where armed groups compete with each other for influence over the civilian 
population, it becomes increasingly difficult for civilians to meet the various groups&#8217; 
interests. Harassment of civilians escalates as each group vies for control. Abuses have also 
been exacerbated by civilians using the violence of armed groups for their own personal 
ends. For example, interlocutors noted that one could deal with a personal enemy (for 
example, a neighbour with whom one was in a land conflict) by reporting to the local 
paramilitary group that the enemy supported the guerrillas. 
</p>
<p>8. Pursuit of the illegal activities by armed groups requires them to control the 
population and transport routes, which has in turn led to &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; and high 
homicide rates in some border towns. In some towns, the murder rate exceeds 100 murders 
per 100,000 inhabitants, a rate that puts these areas among the most dangerous in the 
world.3 Many interlocutors cited the grim example of Puerto del Carmen, a small town of 
some 4,000 residents that has experienced one to three assassinations per week over at least 
the past two years. Interlocutors did not understand how this extreme insecurity had been 
permitted to prevail for so long, given the presence in the vicinity of an army battalion, a 
police station and a naval presence. While it is certainly difficult to address such violence, 
there appears to be a total lack of will on the part of authorities to combat crime in the 
town. 
</p>
<p>9. Indeed, across the northern region, it was difficult to get a clear sense of the 
effectiveness of Ecuador&#8217;s police and military response to illegal armed groups. The 
statistics provided by military officials are difficult to reconcile with one other. On the one 
hand, between 2007 and 2009, troop numbers in the region quadrupled. The number of 
military operations has grown substantially from just 22 in 2007 to 248 in 2009. 
Information provided by the military also indicates that significantly increasing numbers of 
</p>
<p>  
 1 I was particularly concerned to learn that a list prepared by the Ecuadorian armed forces containing 
</p>
<p>the names of some 430 Colombians living at the northern border who allegedly &#8220;supported or 
collaborated&#8221; with illegal armed groups was widely available. The publication of the list makes it all 
too easy for armed actors to target named individuals. I was provided reliable information that a 
number of those on the list were Colombian refugees wrongly accused of illegal activity. Some had to 
be urgently moved from the area. 
</p>
<p> 2 The Federation of Kichwa Nationality Organizations of Sucumb&#237;os provided detailed information on 
internal displacement of indigenous persons. In a number of border towns, the number of indigenous 
families had dramatically dropped from 2000 to 2008. For example, in Puerto Mestanza, the 
population fell from 86 to 4 families. 
</p>
<p> 3 Countries with the highest reported homicide rates include Colombia (61 in 2002), South Africa (49.6 
in 2002) and Brazil (30.4 in 2002). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;clandestine installations&#8221; of armed groups have been discovered: 12 in 2005, 47 in 2007, 
and 156 in 2009.  
</p>
<p>10. On the other hand, very few group members have been either arrested or killed. 
Military officials in Sucumb&#237;os provided information on just four incidents in which group 
members were killed.4 I was also informed of the deaths of five members of the Ecuadorian 
military during the same period.5 I was told by officials that just three armed group 
members were captured in 2010. When I asked judges about drug trafficking cases, they 
said that while an estimated 30 per cent of their cases in Sucumb&#237;os were drug-related, the 
charges were generally just for small quantities of possession. The significant traffickers 
were rarely prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>11. The low rate of armed group fatalities is surprising in the context of a significant 
military presence attempting to suppress violent criminal groups. It could be taken as a 
positive indication that the military is addressing such violence without engaging in the 
types of unlawful killings seen in other countries. This explanation is difficult to sustain, 
however, given the very low rate of military fatalities, few arrests of group members 
despite the extensive activity of illegal armed groups, the increased military presence, the 
large number of installations found and the pressing need for civilian protection in the 
region. Officials provided no satisfactory information as to why the arrest rate was so low. 
Some interlocutors suggested that it was partly due to high levels of -community infiltration 
by armed groups, which enabled them to hide, as well as to evade capture by obtaining 
information on troop movements. Other interlocutors, including police officials, indicated 
that, in certain areas, security forces simply ignored armed group activity because of fear or 
bribery, and that they themselves were sometimes involved in trafficking. 
</p>
<p>12. Impunity for the various armed group crimes was described as &#8220;pervasive&#8221;. 
Witnesses were generally too terrified of retribution to make any official complaint. 
Moreover, they generally did not believe that the police would be able or willing to take 
any real action. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Abuses by the armed forces  
</b></p>
<p>13. The most common violations of human rights law reportedly committed by the 
armed forces fell outside the scope of my mandate. These abuses include forced entry into 
homes, stealing and public humiliation (including forced nudity). Such abuses appeared to 
be common and committed with impunity. I was informed of a number of grave cases of 
torture and sexual violence, including cases of rape and putting chilli on victims&#8217; bodies. 
</p>
<p>14. I was also provided information on a number of killings committed by the military. 
One case is emblematic of the problems. It involved the killing of one Ecuadorian and two 
Colombians on 18 January 2010. It began when the military encountered three men on a 
<i>piragua</i> (river boat). The military initially claimed that the men were wearing FARC 
uniforms, although the story subsequently changed and the men were said to have been 
wearing dark or camouflaged clothing. The military claim that, when instructed to stop, the 
men responded by opening fire. The soldiers returned fire to protect themselves. Officials 
stated that the <i>piragua</i> then took off. It was subsequently revealed that two of the men had 
died at the scene, and a third had died from his injuries while being taken down river by 
civilians attempting to help him. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Killings (reported to me as &#8220;killed during combat&#8221;) took place on 10 October 2008, 13 March 2009, 
</p>
<p>18 January 2010 (three killed) and 18 April 2010 (two killed). 
 5 30 January 2008 (two killed), 3 February 2009 (one killed), 25 March 2009 (two died during rescue 
</p>
<p>operation). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>15. A number of elements in the above case make the military&#8217;s version of events 
suspect. In part, it is difficult to understand why guerrillas were out on a boat in broad 
daylight on a river known to be patrolled (informed interlocutors noted that this would be 
exceptionally rare); why the military did not pursue the <i>piragua</i>; how a simple river boat 
could so successfully get away from a military patrol; or why the bodies were not picked up 
by the military. Testimony from civilian witnesses would, if accurate, explain many of 
these anomalies. They indicate that the men were civilians, not uniformed, not engaged in 
suspicious activity and did not fire at the military. At the time of my visit, the incident was 
being investigated. However, witnesses and the families of the deceased were under 
pressure not to testify. One of the witnesses told me that she received a call saying that if 
she pursued the case, she would end up dead. Some of those responsible for investigating 
have also allegedly received threats. Such threats appear to be common when officials are 
accused of abuses; in other similar cases of serious alleged abuses about which I was 
informed, witnesses, family members and non-governmental organizations have also been 
offered money or threatened in exchange for dropping cases.  
</p>
<p>16. Reports of abuses by security forces in Sucumb&#237;os have increased significantly since 
mid-2009. Interlocutors suggested various reasons for this. In part, it was said to be due to 
the rapid militarization in the region and the increased numbers of troops on patrol, which, 
simply put, increases opportunities for abuse. Some experts also suggested that the military 
forces were not consistently well-trained and did not have much combat, counter-
insurgency or other relevant field experience. They did not know how to best protect or 
even deal with civilians in such a complex, multi-armed actor environment. This partly 
explained cases in which, for example, victims &#8211; who has been forced by the FARC to give 
the guerrillas food &#8211; were then interrogated by the military, accused of being FARC 
supporters, and harassed or beaten. 
</p>
<p>17. Importantly, interlocutors stated that one of the most significant causes of the 
increase in reported abuses was a change in leadership among the military&#8217;s top officials in 
the region. Previously, military relationships with communities were largely positive and 
officers spent time building trust. Today, however, the military are said to spend much less 
time with community members and to have become far more antagonistic and aggressive. 
Community trust has eroded, cutting the military off from civilian information, and thereby 
inhibiting the former&#8217;s ability to gain important intelligence. To compensate for the loss, 
the military engage in abusive tactics to force information from civilians. 
</p>
<p>18. Military relations with civil society and humanitarian actors have also deteriorated 
with the change in leadership. Support for civil society has declined, with obstruction at 
military checkpoints as well as harassment of activists and raids on properties of non-
governmental organizations. Cooperation has soured further following civil society 
attempts to obtain justice for victims of military abuses by publicizing incidents and 
seeking prosecutions of soldiers. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Homicide and hired killers 
</b></p>
<p>19. The national homicide rate has skyrocketed in the past 20 years, almost doubling 
from 10.3 murders per 100,000 in 1990 to 18.7 in 2009. The rate for 2010 is expected to be 
even higher; the first five months of 2010 showed a 7.39 per cent increase over the same 
period in 2009.6 The increase is attributed to various factors, including greater organized 
</p>
<p>  
 6 From 1,136 homicides from January to May 2009 to 1,220 in 2010. The rates in some provinces are 
</p>
<p>significantly higher. In 2009, the provinces with the highest homicide rates were Esmeraldas (62.40), 
Sucumb&#237;os (44.39) and Santo Domingo (38.5). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>crime activity, expanded drug trafficking, high drug and alcohol abuse rates and economic 
insecurity. Ineffective policing, breakdowns in law and order and failures in the criminal 
justice system have led private citizens to resort to murder and made punishment unlikely. 
</p>
<p>20. The use of hired killers (<i>sicarios</i>) to carry out murders has been the subject of 
significant media attention and instilled fear in the population. These killings are commonly 
committed by masked men, working alone or in small groups, who shoot at their victim 
from a passing motorcycle. The killers are rarely identified and almost never captured. 
</p>
<p>21. I met with many officials, experts and witnesses in order to understand the dynamics 
and causes of this phenomenon. Hired killings are not new to Ecuador, and numerous cases 
of politically motivated hired killings occurred through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the 
extent and nature of the problem has significantly changed in recent years. Although media 
sensationalization has exaggerated the scale of the problem, it is clear that the number of 
hired killings has increased notably. They are increasingly used to &#8220;solve&#8221; a range of 
personal, business, narco-trafficking and organized crime problems.7 Between 11 and 14 
per cent of homicides in 2010 were estimated to be hired killings, amounting to around 450 
killings per year. This has contributed significantly to the increase in the homicide rate. 
</p>
<p>22. In analysing the problem, it is important to distinguish between &#8220;professional&#8221; and 
unprofessional hired killers. The latter are poorly trained, relatively inexpensive and 
generally used in disputes within families or among neighbours. Such personal relationship 
disputes are now a major cause of hired killings. The deficiencies in the justice system are 
an important factor contributing to the use of hired killers in these contexts. Individuals 
conclude that taking private action to &#8220;resolve&#8221; a dispute is likely to be more effective than 
relying on the police and the courts. Such action is facilitated by the disturbing ease with 
which a private citizen can find a killer. In many towns, there are known locations (e.g., 
certain bars) where a killer can be readily hired. Killers have also been known to openly 
advertise their services on the Internet. They can be relatively inexpensive: police estimates 
ranged from $200-$10,000, depending on the victim, the &#8220;skill&#8221; and reputation of the killer, 
and how complicated the killing would be. Others said that killers could be hired in some 
areas for as little as $20. Members of the police stated that the killers were predominantly 
uneducated, unemployed males (including, sometimes, minors). They may be recruited by 
criminal organizations, might join together in small informal groups, or operate 
independently. Because such killings are so rarely punished, becoming a <i>sicario</i> has 
become a desirable career choice for some otherwise poor and unemployed men, fuelling 
the growth of available and cheap killers. 
</p>
<p>23. More professional and thus more expensive killers are often hired by an &#8220;intellectual 
author&#8221;, who pays a middleman to arrange the hit. The killers and middlemen are often 
linked to organized crime groups, and sometimes carry out political killings. In the past, 
many professional killers were foreigners, but the trade is now increasingly home-grown. I 
was also provided evidence that some police and ex-police have worked as hired killers. 
The nature of the professional killing &#8220;business&#8221; makes it especially important that 
investigations should not focus solely on the individual killers, but should examine the 
broader context and the various actors involved. 
</p>
<p>24. &#8220;Loan sharks&#8221; are also often implicated in hired killings. Because of the difficulty of 
obtaining bank loans, many poorer Ecuadorians have to turn to the informal sector and loan 
sharks, who charge exorbitant interest rates (reportedly as high as 10 per cent per day) and 
</p>
<p>  
 7 Organized crime is a serious and growing problem in Ecuador. According to information received, 
</p>
<p>there are over 700 gangs, many of which are based in Guayas and Pichincha. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>are known to use killers to punish those who cannot repay their loans, or to intimidate 
family members to pay. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government response 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Government now acknowledges the seriousness of the problem, and in 2010 
began to take strong measures to address it. 
</p>
<p>26. Expert advisers have been brought in from Colombia and France to assist at the 
policy level, and an inter-agency police team has been created to coordinate the police 
response. Importantly, a specialized police intelligence group (Unidad de la Lucha Contra 
el Crimen Organizado or ULCO) has been created to counter organized crime, including by 
researching the methods employed by hired killers and the causes of the killings. Witness 
protection is being strengthened, and rewards will be offered for information on organized 
crime activity. 
</p>
<p>27. In some cities, stronger steps have been taken to &#8220;geo-reference&#8221; criminal incidents, 
so that police patrols can be increased in especially affected areas, and greater attention has 
been given to the loan shark problem. The police also indicated that more would be done to 
investigate online advertisements posted by would-be hit men. In Guayas, motorcycles 
were required to display registration details, which led to a small drop in killings. Controls 
were also placed on alcohol consumption, and efforts were increased to close non-licensed 
premises. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Settlement of accounts 
</b></p>
<p>28. The measures taken by the Government to date are important and should be 
continued and strengthened. However, my investigations clearly indicated that a significant 
factor in the thriving business of hired killings is the near complete impunity that killers 
enjoy. In part, this is due to factors that are difficult for the Government to control, such as 
the reluctance of surviving family members to report killings and the absence or fear of 
witnesses. 
</p>
<p>29. Impunity also results, however, from the unwillingness of police and prosecutors to 
fully investigate all hired killings. From my meetings with police and prosecutor officials, it 
became clear that they consider many hired killings cases to be what they categorized as a 
&#8220;settling of accounts&#8221;. While it is desirable to categorize different types of killings in order 
to shed light on the motives and causes, the &#8220;settling of accounts&#8221; category is currently 
being used in a highly problematic way, which seriously hinders efforts to reduce hired 
killings. 
</p>
<p>30. First, the category is ill-defined and does little to illuminate the problem or facilitate 
its resolution. I asked many different officials what they understood the term to mean, and 
received as many different answers. Among the competing interpretations suggested to me 
were any case of revenge killing; inter-gang or inter-criminal violence; killings where the 
victim had a criminal record; or where both the victim and killer were believed to have 
records. Some used it where the victim had merely a police record, which can exist as a 
result of many forms of contact with the police, quite apart from actual criminality. 
Members of the police in Guayas told me that an estimated 40 per cent of victims of hired 
killers had police records, and so they assumed that many of those killings were connected 
to broader criminal activity. It was often simply assumed that the killings were part of 
organized crime rivalry, an assumption that curiously led to a lack of police interest in 
further investigation rather than the opposite, as might reasonably be expected. 
</p>
<p>31. Second, it gives unjustified importance to a victim&#8217;s criminal or police record. It 
makes little sense to automatically treat every case in which a victim had a police record as 
a case of inter-gang violence. It makes even less sense to assume a settling of accounts </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>without information about whether the killer or the person ordering the killing had a 
criminal record. 
</p>
<p>32. Third, it is clear, despite some official denials, that settling of accounts cases are 
investigated less seriously than other cases. I received reliable evidence from a range of 
sources, including officials, that cases in which victims have a police record are generally 
not comprehensively pursued. It was clear, especially in Guayaquil, that once the settling of 
accounts determination was made, in-depth investigations were rarely conducted by police 
and prosecutors. Such cases are either considered too difficult and not worthy of the same 
attention as cases involving &#8220;innocent&#8221; victims, or relatively easy to neglect because family 
members are too afraid to push them forward. This policy is mistaken and deeply 
counterproductive. It denies justice to the victim&#8217;s family, leaves the perpetrator free to kill 
again and sends a message that it is easy to get away with murder. It also prevents the 
police from obtaining information on criminal networks that would facilitate more effective 
prosecutions against organized crime groups. 
</p>
<p>33. Fourth, the category provides a convenient cover for not pursuing killings in which 
the police themselves or other officials were involved. Once a case is categorized as a 
settling of accounts, the likelihood of a serious investigation diminishes dramatically. It is 
thus ideal for the purposes of covering up crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Killings by police 
</b></p>
<p>34. While I was provided information on some serious cases of unlawful killings by 
police, it did not warrant the conclusion that police killings are pervasive or carried out 
pursuant to official policy. The types of police killings include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Killings connected with police work. This includes individuals tortured to 
death during purported interrogations, and criminal suspects killed when they could and 
should have been arrested; 
</p>
<p> (b) Police involvement in hired killings. This could be due to police connections 
to organized crime, or as a second source of income for the police involved. I received 
allegations of police involvement in hired killings in Los Rios, as well as in the killing of a 
23 year-old man in Lago Agrio on 8 March 2010; 
</p>
<p> (c) Police involvement in social cleansing groups. Police throughout the country 
denied any involvement in social cleansing. There is no doubt, however, that it has 
occurred, as shown by the now infamous case of &#8220;JRG&#8221;, who was shot by police on 20 
February 2010. It was later discovered that JRG was himself a police officer, involved in 
executions (especially of suspected criminals) in Los Rios; 
</p>
<p> (d) Killings related to personal (e.g., familial, neighbour) disputes.  
</p>
<p>35. Estimates of the number of individuals killed by police varied, depending on the 
source. Because of the different periods covered, the statistics are difficult to compare. One 
non-governmental organization reported 164 extrajudicial executions by police from 2000 
to 2006. According to information provided by the Ministry of Government, 27 individuals 
had been killed by the police in the period 2000-2009. The Police Inspector-General&#8217;s 
office told me that the police were responsible for 90 incidents (104 killings) from 2005 to 
</p><p>2010. However, little meaningful information was provided on the circumstances of these 
cases such that a determination of the lawfulness of the killings could be reliably made. 
Officials simply recalled two cases of deliberate, premeditated murder by the police in the 
past year. Statistics provided by the police commander showed that there were 83 cases 
involving deaths caused by police from 2005 to 2010; 36 cases occurred during police 
operations, and 47 were accidents, intra-familial or interpersonal cases, or involved alcohol </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>abuse. The 36 police operation cases were said to have occurred in exchanges with 
criminals. Guayas had by far the highest rate of killings during police operations (47 per 
cent). 
</p>
<p>36. My investigations revealed two significant problems with the way that the 
Government deals with these cases.  
</p>
<p>37. First, the quality of the information recorded by the Government with respect to 
police killings is poor. The information officially provided to me was very general in 
nature, and not revealing as to the extent, nature or causes of police killings. No one 
institution appeared to keep full records of complaints made against police, or of 
disciplinary and criminal processes and their outcomes. As a result, it was impossible to 
determine what proportion of the police killings were likely extrajudicial executions, and 
what proportion of those were appropriately punished. Until recently, not even complaints 
against police were tracked at the national level; each police station kept its own records, 
and while the &#8220;most important&#8221; cases were supposed to be brought to the attention of the 
Inspector-General, many were just kept in individual stations. The abysmal state of police 
statistics means that officials are unable to have any real sense of the extent of police 
misconduct, which are the particular problem areas or of changes in police conduct over 
time. For example, the statistics provided to me by the Inspector-General&#8217;s office show a 
dramatic increase in the recorded number of police killings from 2005 to 2010. Just three 
killings were recorded in 2005, seven in 2006, 21 in 2007, 15 in 2008, 28 in 2009 and 16 to 
June 2010. The officials did not know, however, whether the actual number of killings had 
increased by 900 per cent or whether the increase was simply the result of improved 
recordkeeping. 
</p>
<p>38. Second, all the evidence points to the conclusion that the internal affairs section of 
the police department, despite reasonably elaborate formalities, does not in fact operate 
effectively or independently in investigating allegations of police misconduct. There is no 
external police oversight mechanism to compensate for this gap. Senior police officials 
reported that, in the exceptional cases where police did kill, there were no cover-ups, and 
the alleged perpetrator would face both internal disciplinary and criminal justice 
procedures. However, officials in the Inspector-General&#8217;s office openly recognized that 
control of the police force was inadequate, and that internal affairs sections were not 
accorded the necessary importance. Officials acknowledged the need for reform, and some 
changes were being implemented, including the creation of a centralized database of 
complaints against police and training for inspectors. While these are steps in the right 
direction, there remains a need for more far-reaching reform. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Social cleansing 
</b></p>
<p>39. Evidence from around the country indicates that social cleansing killings occur 
regularly, but it remains unclear if the Government is doing anything meaningful to address 
the problem. This is largely due to the continued official policy of denying the existence of 
such killings, despite clear evidence to the contrary. 
</p>
<p>40. Some of the killings are committed by illegal armed groups, often in connection 
with their drug trafficking operations. On one main road in Putumayo, Sucumb&#237;os, for 
example, robberies on public buses were known to occur frequently. The road was also an 
important transport route for drugs and weapons, and the FARC and others armed groups 
fought each other for its control. In the month or so before my visit, some 30 bodies were 
found along the road. Each showed signs of having been tortured. Although the cases were 
still being investigated at the time of my visit, interlocutors noted that the evidence strongly 
suggested that the killings were carried out by traffickers intent on (a) making the route </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>safer for trafficking; (b) gaining the support of the local residents, who were fed up with the 
robberies; and (c) using fear to encourage the population to accept the traffickers&#8217; control of 
the area. 
</p>
<p>41. In other cases, the killings appear to be part of an attempt by a group to gain control 
of an area by purportedly enforcing &#8220;law and order&#8221; and by punishing &#8220;undesirables&#8221;. I was 
provided copies of social cleansing notices from Sucumb&#237;os in which groups stated that 
they had &#8220;made the irrevocable decision to attack violence with violence&#8221;, and threatened 
to murder sex workers and &#8220;drug dealers, thieves, carjackers, kidnappers, and young drug 
users&#8221;. They also stated that the group already had its &#8220;first cleansing list&#8221; and would begin 
killing soon. They asked the community to collaborate by distributing the leaflets widely. 
</p>
<p>42. To my knowledge, similar flyers were distributed in La Concordia, Manab&#237; and 
Guayaquil. The pamphlets all warned of the elimination of &#8220;criminals&#8221; and those who 
&#8220;have relationships with such people.&#8221; In Guayas, LGBT activists had also received such 
notices. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Rural juntas 
</b></p>
<p>43. Rural juntas (<i>Juntas de defensa del campesinado</i>) were originally formed by rural 
residents to promote development and to prevent cattle rustling and other common crimes. 
Their existence is largely explained by the lack of State presence in many rural areas of 
Ecuador and the consequent need for a substitute authority. However, I was provided 
detailed information about serious abuses committed by some juntas against the 
communities they were ostensibly created to protect. 
</p>
<p>44. The rural juntas are strongest in the Sierra provinces of Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, 
Chimborazo and Bolivar, and also in some areas of Los Rios. There are no settled statistics 
on their size, but most estimates suggest at least 500 local juntas, with total membership of 
between 20,000 and 80,000 members. The juntas are organized by parish, and each local 
area has a president, elected by residents. The local juntas come together in a nationwide 
federation. 
</p>
<p>45. It was extremely difficult to obtain information on the juntas from officials. Official 
responses to my questions about the juntas varied wildly, and many officials were reluctant 
to speak about them in any depth. One asserted that juntas were simply &#8220;political&#8221; groups 
and did not abuse residents. One claimed that juntas had previously engaged in their own 
law and order activities, but now worked with the police and had received human rights 
training. Another stated that they were &#8220;social, development organizations for rural areas&#8221; 
and had &#8220;no relationship with the police&#8221;. One official stated that they were &#8220;organized 
civilian brigades&#8221; that sometimes conducted patrols and provided information to the police. 
He stated that they were not armed, although they were sometimes involved in rural 
security, and that police sometimes gave them uniforms. He stated that the police did not 
allow the groups to administer justice themselves, and that if the juntas detained an alleged 
criminal, they would hand him or her over to the police. A police intelligence officer stated 
that rural juntas were well organized to provide their own security, and that they had 
committed some violence against residents. One official recalled a case from Los Rios, in 
which officials investigated alleged &#8220;excesses&#8221; by a junta. 
</p>
<p><b>  Abuses by juntas 
</b></p>
<p>46. My interviews with representatives of non-governmental organizations, witnesses 
and victims painted, however, a much more disturbing picture. While some residents 
support the juntas because they provide security in the absence of the State, or facilitate 
basic service provision, others live in fear of the groups. They described cases in which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>juntas threatened, kidnapped, tortured or killed individuals. Cases of abuse generally fell 
into one of the four categories listed below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Personal animosity 
</b></p>
<p>47. Many of the cases of abuse appeared to be motivated by personal animosity, 
implemented by the collective power of the junta. In one case, one member of a family was 
accused of the robbery and assault of someone with close ties to the junta. The members of 
the family were threatened and pushed off their land by junta members. In another case, 
following private disputes over land use with a junta member, the victims were abused and 
kidnapped by the local junta. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Junta law and order 
</b></p>
<p>48. Some cases appear to be the result of the junta&#8217;s imposition of local &#8220;law and order&#8221;. 
According to witnesses and domestic advocates, these groups punish and beat those who 
disobey their rules. They intervene in cases of alleged criminal activity, as well as domestic 
issues; for example, if someone complained to the junta that a neighbour had stolen his 
livestock or that his wife had left, the junta would step in to &#8220;resolve&#8221; the matter. In some 
areas, juntas impose strict curfews and patrol the streets at night. I spoke with individuals 
who never left their homes after dark for fear of being beaten for breaking the curfew. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Control of local population 
</b></p>
<p>49. Other abuses are related to junta attempts to secure and maintain control over an 
area. A lack of community support has both political and economic effects on a junta; they 
charge for their services, so support is necessary for a junta&#8217;s existence. Juntas have 
threatened community members with retaliation (such as cutting off a family&#8217;s water 
supply) for not supporting it. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.  Prevention of accountability 
</b></p>
<p>50. According to testimony by non-governmental organizations, juntas have used force 
to control the criminal justice system. If a junta member is involved in litigation, other 
members may threaten or kidnap opposing lawyers, judges or other officials not aligned 
with the junta&#8217;s interests. Domestic advocates investigating the juntas have also received 
threats, including advice that &#8220;you can&#8217;t touch the juntas without being stung&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. Witnesses and non-governmental organizations informed me that officials rarely 
respond effectively to their complaints about junta activity. This was borne out by officials 
who were generally unwilling or unable to answer questions about junta abuses, let alone 
acknowledge the need to investigate juntas. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Confusion between indigenous justice and lynching 
</b></p>
<p>52. All too often, lynching (also called private or mob justice) is confused with 
indigenous justice in the media and by officials. In some cases, the confusion results from 
ignorance. In others, there appears to be an intentional conflation of two very distinct 
issues. The frequent mischaracterizations hinder genuine analysis of the issues, inhibit 
appropriate Government reforms and reinforce negative stereotypes of indigenous 
Ecuadorians. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Lynching 
</b></p>
<p>53. Lynching is a major problem in Ecuador, deserving of significantly more 
Government attention than it presently receives. According to one report, at least 153 
people were killed and 165 seriously injured in mob justice events from 1994 to 2008. One 
non-governmental organization reported 33 lynching cases in 2009. It is likely that these 
numbers are an undercount, as incidents in isolated areas are unlikely to be reported. 
</p>
<p>54. Generally, lynching involves community members, often acting in groups, attacking 
suspects accused of crimes such as stealing, violence or murder. Many lynching incidents 
occur shortly after the alleged crime took place, and appear to reflect a relatively 
spontaneous outpouring of anger at suspected criminal behaviour. The reports I received 
involved individuals being beaten unconscious to the point where they sometimes died, or 
being burned alive, stabbed or mutilated. For example, on 18 March 2009, a 35 year-old 
man in Quito was beaten and burned for allegedly stealing a bull. On 17 May 2009, in Los 
Rios, two youths, 16 and 24 years of age, were accused of killing a 17 year-old, pulled out 
of a police cell by a crowd, then beaten and burned to death. 
</p>
<p>55. In other countries where lynching takes place, it is largely driven by the lack of any 
(or any effective) policing and by failures in the criminal justice system, which lead 
individuals to believe that the only way to address crime is to take justice into their own 
hands.8 The lack of State presence means that this response can be carried out unchecked, 
with little fear of punishment. Given the poor state of the criminal justice system in 
Ecuador and the fact that lynchings are known to occur most frequently in poor, rural and 
indigenous areas with little State presence, experience suggests that the same factors also 
encourage killings in Ecuador. The phenomenon has been poorly studied, however, and 
much more work is needed to address the root causes of the violence in the specific context 
of Ecuador.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous justice 
</b></p>
<p>56. &#8220;Indigenous justice&#8221; is justice carried out in accordance with indigenous traditions. 
In stark contrast to lynching cases, it does not involve the arbitrary or vengeful application 
of violence. Indigenous justice is intended to reintegrate a wrongdoer back into the 
community, and is a formal process conducted by indigenous leaders and community 
members. 
</p>
<p>57. Article 171 of the Constitution recognizes indigenous justice systems insofar as they 
do not violate the Constitution or human rights, and Ecuador has ratified the Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) of the International Labour Organization. Some 
high-level Government officials, however, have attacked indigenous justice as being 
&#8220;savage&#8221; and &#8220;intolerable&#8221;, and new legislation has been drafted with little consultation 
with indigenous groups. 
</p>
<p>58. Official statements and media accounts often give the impression that killings and 
beatings are common in indigenous justice. This is simply false. In fact, when pressed, 
interlocutors &#8211; academics, officials and non-governmental organizations &#8211; could only name 
one case of a death sentence being handed down following a formal indigenous justice 
process, and in that case the death sentence was not actually applied. Officials with 
knowledge of the issue noted that they actually had not received real reports of deaths 
</p>
<p>  
 8 See A/64/187. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>related to indigenous justice for many years, and that any indications to the contrary 
resulted from confusing lynching with indigenous justice. 
</p>
<p>59. Such confusion reflects a failure to come to grips with the realities of lynching. In 
contrast to calls to minimize, restrict or abolish indigenous justice, it might actually be 
appropriate to strengthen it in situations in which lynching is caused by the absence of the 
State. Confusing lynching with indigenous justice strengthens racist stereotyping and 
reinforces anti-indigenous sentiment. Much official rhetoric was widely perceived as being 
designed to discredit indigenous movements and weaken their political power, especially 
since concerns about indigenous justice coincided with strong indigenous opposition to 
Government positions on issues such as mining and water. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Threats to human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>60. Murders of human rights defenders have not occurred in large numbers in Ecuador. 
However, I received numerous reports of threats against them, as well as against 
humanitarian actors, union activists and social movement and indigenous leaders. In some 
cases, activists were offered bribes to stop their work. In other cases, individual activists 
working for women&#8217;s rights on the northern border were told they would be burned alive if 
they continued their work. LGBT activists in Guayas have received social cleansing 
notices, and some of those working to document alleged junta abuses have been threatened. 
One non-governmental organization received a letter threatening to kill its members for 
speaking out about a case they had presented to me. 
</p>
<p>61. Individuals working on extractive industry issues have frequently received threats. 
While mining in Ecuador has traditionally been small-scale and family run, since 2000 the 
Government has been promoting large-scale mining. This has intensified activist opposition 
and led to many reported attacks and death threats, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; June 2010: Alleged death threat against Santiago Escobar, a witness who testified 
that a Chevron contractor tampered with evidence relating to a trial against 
Chevron&#8217;s activities in the Amazon. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; April 2010: Three indigenous Sarayaku men, whose community have been 
advocating against oil exploration in Pastaza province, were attacked with dynamite 
and shot. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; May 2009: Joel Vicente Zhunio Samaniego, who protested during a meeting 
between officials, locals and a mining company, was publicly threatened by 
officials. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; April 2009: Attacks and threats occurred against Etelvina de Jes&#250;s Misacango 
Chu&#241;ir in connection with her opposition to mining in Azuay. 
</p>
<p>62. In many such cases, official responses were said to be inadequate: threats were not 
investigated or protection was not adequately provided. 
</p>
<p>63. Other activists were killed. Iv&#225;n Muela, a well-known union and labour rights 
lawyer, was shot four times on 21 January 2010 by two hit men on a motorcycle. The 
killers were unidentified at the time of my visit, but he had long received threats.  
</p>
<p>64. On 6 July 2010, during my mission, Germ&#225;n Antonio Ram&#237;rez Herrera was 
kidnapped and murdered. His killers have yet to be found. He was a forensic doctor, trained 
in investigating allegations of torture, and had documented injuries suffered by prisoners 
following a police raid on the Quecedo prison in Los Rios. He had received threats 
previously, especially in connection with his stated intent to testify about prisoner abuse. I 
was informed that Dr. Ram&#237;rez had wanted to discuss these abuses with me, but he was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>killed before we were able to meet. I witnessed the fear this killing spread through the 
medical profession and activist communities in the country. Some of those with information 
were afraid to openly testify for fear of meeting the same fate. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>65. Impunity for each of the forms of extrajudicial executions analysed in the present 
report is almost assured. Some officials were openly critical of the judicial system, 
describing it as &#8220;precarious&#8221; and having a &#8220;very, very low success rate&#8221;. In fact, Ecuador 
has one of the lowest rates of accountability for killings in any country I have visited. 
Officials estimate that just 1 to 3 per cent of reported killings are punished. Given 
intelligence estimates that the police in Sucumb&#237;os are probably notified of only 1 out of 
every 3 or 4 killings that take place, the overall conviction rate is probably less than 1 per 
cent. Corruption, fear of retribution, inefficiency, lack of will and inadequate training and 
resources at each stage of the criminal justice system ensure that most perpetrators are 
never punished. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Police investigations and forensics  
</b></p>
<p>66. The quality and effectiveness of police investigations were roundly criticized by 
judges, prosecutors, ombudsmen and human rights actors. 
</p>
<p>67. The problems are evident from the earliest stages. In practice, police do not even 
begin to investigate murders unless the victim&#8217;s family makes a complaint. Many witnesses 
and family members said they were too afraid of being killed to do so. As a result, 
numerous cases do not even get through the investigation phase. Sometimes the police 
inform complainants that they can only undertake investigations if the family of the 
deceased pay for vehicles and other travel expenses. 
</p>
<p>68. Interlocutors who regularly review police reports (such as prosecutors, judges and 
ombudsmen) noted that many police do not have the skills necessary for the complexities of 
murder cases. Some police acknowledged the need for better training. Judges described 
police investigations as &#8220;primitive&#8221; and often counter-productive. One prosecutor with over 
40 years of experience described contemporary police investigative practice as &#8220;little 
different from the 1970s&#8221;. Prosecutors in Guayas noted that even basic computer and 
information technology was lacking in many police offices. Ombudsmen in some areas 
noted that the police often relied on intimidation and force to obtain information. 
</p>
<p>69. Forensic capacity is lacking. While the central forensics laboratory now has much of 
the necessary basic capacity (such as ballistics and toxicology) and had plans to acquire 
DNA analysis equipment by the end of 2010, regional capacity was much weaker. Police 
officials in Sucumb&#237;os admitted that autopsies were not done well because of poor 
facilities. Prosecutors and judges around the country complained of the poor quality of 
forensic reporting, and that it hindered prosecutions. Some forensic reports are falsified and 
crime scene analysis is often very weak. Smaller towns may only have one forensic doctor, 
making timely and comprehensive examinations difficult. In some areas, such as 
Sucumb&#237;os, forensic doctors charged victims&#8217; families for forensic services. The costs (for 
example, $40 for a forensic exam, $180 for blood work) are prohibitive for many families. 
While some officials denied that families ever had to pay for forensic services, I received 
ample evidence that they are being charged by certain offices. 
</p>
<p>70. Forensic laboratories are not structurally independent of the judicial police, leading 
to the perception that the laboratories may not always function with the necessary 
independence. This matters most in cases where police have been implicated in abuse or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>where police may have been threatened or bribed by perpetrators. Officials working in this 
area, including forensics specialists and police, stated that an independent forensics agency 
would be an important reform to address perceptions of bias. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prosecution service 
</b></p>
<p>71. While there are many dedicated individual prosecutors in Ecuador, interlocutors 
described their &#8220;complete mistrust&#8221; in the prosecution service as a whole, its &#8220;inefficiency&#8221;, 
its widespread corruption, and hiring based on connections rather than merit. I was told that 
cases &#8220;can disappear for $200&#8221;. Ombudsmen told me that they repeatedly sent letters to 
prosecutors asking about the progress of cases, but rarely received replies. 
</p>
<p>72. Judges stated that homicide investigations were often deeply flawed and case 
presentations so unconvincing that it was impossible to convict. One judge described the 
work of prosecutors as &#8220;absolutely dreadful&#8221;. Another stated that, in order to convict 
defendants, he had no option but to relax the way he applied standards of evidence and 
proof; otherwise, abysmal conviction rates would be even lower. 
</p>
<p>73. The situation in Sucumb&#237;os was especially troubling. The prosecutor was roundly 
criticized for failing to carry out his duties. Interlocutors stated that it was difficult to 
convince him even to register complaints in some circumstances, such as when the alleged 
perpetrators were members of the military. In some cases, sustained advocacy by 
international and local non-governmental organizations was required in order to achieve 
registration, and ensuring effective investigations in sensitive cases was a herculean task. 
</p>
<p>74. Prosecutors often neglect cases that are not relentlessly pushed by the deceased&#8217;s 
family. One family was advised by a police official not to pursue a murder case because the 
evidence might well be leaked and it would be easy to pay off the police, prosecutors or 
judges. Thus, prosecution would involve great personal risk, with little likelihood of 
success. 
</p>
<p>75. In Guayas, poor cooperation between police and prosecutors has been a major 
problem. A specialized police-prosecutor unit was recently created to focus on organized 
crime and to increase cooperation and effectiveness in such cases. It is yet too early to 
assess this much-needed reform. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Courts and the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>76. The judiciary too was often criticized for its susceptibility to bribery and other 
illegitimate influence, particularly in cases involving organized crime and officials. The 
courts were also strongly criticized for their slowness. One case filed in 2001 was not heard 
until 2010. Some delays are due to the lack of judges in many areas, which leads to 
unmanageable case loads. It is also due to the lack of accountability in relation to case 
management. Prosecutors stated that delays tended to be most acute in the National Court 
of Justice. The Government and the Chief Justice are to be commended for recent reforms 
seeking greater efficiency. 
</p>
<p>77. Many judges receive threats and some acknowledged the risks involved in judging 
sensitive cases. Judges, especially in remote areas, are vulnerable to intimidation by 
wealthy or violent defendants, and more systematic efforts are needed to protect them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>78. Witness insecurity is extraordinarily high. Given the growth and power of organized 
crime and the use of hired killers, an effective witness protection programme is an absolute 
necessity in the fight against impunity. At the time of my mission, 3,625 individuals were 
under some form of protection. The programme can provide full protection to witnesses, as 
well as medical, social and psychological assistance. It has a presence in each of the 24 
provinces, and offers a range of levels of protection. 
</p>
<p>79. Many witnesses, however, never enter the programme. Most of the witnesses I spoke 
with either did not know about or trust it. Many tried to avoid being noticed or identified at 
all costs, and thus did not make complaints to the police or prosecutors or speak to non-
governmental organizations or the media. In essence, they felt they had to choose between 
personal security and justice. 
</p>
<p>80. To receive protection, victims or witnesses must present a complaint to the 
prosecutor. Witnesses often saw prosecutors as part of the problem, however. They were 
seen as susceptible to corruption, too connected to perpetrators or just ineffective. 
</p>
<p>81. Witnesses were also reluctant to trust the programme because its security is provided 
by Government police, and witnesses assumed collaboration between witness protection 
police and the rest of the service. In fact, the former are separate and specialized, but the 
perception of close links persists and needs to be addressed more forcefully. 
</p>
<p>82. To their credit, programme officials acknowledged that more could be done to raise 
public awareness about the programme. The programme planned to launch a 1-800 number, 
together with an outreach campaign. Although the Government significantly increased the 
programme&#8217;s funding in 2011 from $90,000 to $1 million (of the $5 million requested by 
the programme), further increases are needed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Ombudsmen 
</b></p>
<p>83. Ombudsmen are widely considered to be independent and reliable, and provide a 
trustworthy forum to which victims can make complaints. As a result, many complaints are 
received, making it also an important source of information about the functioning of the 
overall justice system. 
</p>
<p>84. Nevertheless, the ombudsman&#8217;s office lacks power to require official action or to 
enforce decisions. It lacks teeth, even to compel the provision of information by the 
authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Truth Commission 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Truth Commission has been an important Government initiative to address 
endemic impunity. It began work in January 2008, and published its final report of some 
2,400 pages on 7 June 2010. It investigated alleged crimes from 1984 to 2008, took over 
600 witness statements and reviewed over 300,000 pages of declassified police and military 
documents. Its final report names over 450 alleged perpetrators against whom the 
Commission considered there were sufficient grounds to presume responsibility for 
wrongdoing. The bulk of the report addresses abuses committed from 1984 to 1988, during 
the Government of President Le&#243;n Febres Cordero. The Commission found that the 
Cordero Government responded to subversive groups through a range of unlawful means, 
including forced disappearances, torture, sexual violence and killings. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>86. The report records 68 victims of extrajudicial executions. Many of the victims were 
members or presumed members of the clandestine leftist groups &#8220;&#161;Alfaro Vive, Carajo!&#8221; 
and M-19. Others were suspected criminals or innocent bystanders, as in the well-known 
2003 Fybeca case, in which eight people were killed by police responding to a robbery. 
Some of the victims were killed during street marches. 
</p>
<p>87. Some with whom I met &#8211; particularly police and opposition political figures &#8211; did 
not believe the Commission was sufficiently independent to ensure the credibility of its 
findings. They felt that some Commission members were too close to alleged victims, that 
the composition of the Commission&#8217;s support committee (because it included victims&#8217; 
families) undermined its independence, and that the Commission was unduly influenced by 
Government pressure. A number of police and military officials told me that the report only 
provided one side of the relevant history, especially as it pertained to attempts in the 1980s 
to counter clandestine groups. Some officials stated that the Commission was under 
pressure to focus on abuses committed from 1984 to 1988 (as opposed to abuses committed 
under the current Government). Others who strongly supported the Commission&#8217;s findings 
on the Cordero period were nevertheless concerned that the Commission downplayed 
recent abuses, especially in Sucumb&#237;os. 
</p>
<p>88. In contrast, many others considered that the Commission served a very important 
purpose by acknowledging the suffering of victims and families and by beginning the 
process of accountability. They felt that the composition of the support committee and the 
Commission&#8217;s structure allowed the silence to be broken on Government abuses, and gave 
victims an important level of ownership over justice initiatives affecting them. Some 
expressed the view that those who criticized the Commission were &#8220;perpetrator groups&#8221; 
who would never be happy with any attempt to redress past wrongs. 
</p>
<p>89. Those who have criticized the Commission raise important concerns, and highlight 
the need for inquiries to be &#8211; and to be seen to be &#8211; independent and objective. I also have 
due process and security concerns about the manner in which alleged perpetrators were 
named in the final report. However, the detailed and extensive information recorded 
constitutes an enormous accomplishment, especially because of the large amount of official 
material declassified and the hundreds of witness and victim statements taken. 
</p>
<p>90. The challenge now is ensuring that this information is securely archived and 
followed up with criminal prosecutions in appropriate cases. In this respect, the 
Government&#8217;s response to the Commission has so far been very positive. The Ministry of 
Justice told me it was planning to re-open cases mentioned in the report. The office of the 
prosecutor has recently set up a special department of 20 prosecutors to carry out 
Commission-related investigations, and was planning to set up regional justice centres. The 
Government will need to ensure that families are assisted during this process, that victim 
outreach occurs and protection provided when needed. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National police  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Government should establish a high-level expert commission to evaluate 
the performance of the police force. The commission should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Study the effectiveness of police investigations, the causes of 
inadequacies and the role of the police force in sustaining high impunity rates; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Propose structural and operational reforms to enhance the police force&#8217;s 
capacity to respond effectively to rising rates of serious crime, including extrajudicial 
executions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Study whether there is a need for an independent forensics unit; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Study ways to ensure stronger civilian oversight of the police, including 
the possibility of creating a separate police ministry. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Government should create a new entity to receive and investigate 
allegations of police abuse. This entity should have sufficient resources, power and 
independence to investigate allegations of police abuse in a credible, objective and 
effective manner. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Police recordkeeping, particularly in relation to allegations of police abuse, 
should be substantially improved. The Inspector-General should ensure that full 
records are kept of all complaints made, and that investigations, disciplinary actions, 
prosecutions and results are tracked. Statistics should be publicly reported on a 
regular basis. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The practice of charging civilians for needed forensic services should cease 
immediately. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Hired killers 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should build on its recent initiatives to address the problem of 
hired killings by adopting a national strategy to combat this growing phenomenon. 
Efforts should be made to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Study the causes of the growth of hired killings, with an analysis of how 
and why they occur; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Expand &#8220;geo-referencing&#8221; of killings, and tailor policing accordingly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promote greater cooperation between police and prosecutors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Promote investigation and prosecution strategies that target not only the 
hired killer but also the intellectual author, middleman and others involved; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Address the problem of loan sharks and their role in hired killings, and 
to consider reforms to the formal loan sector to enable more citizens to take out legal 
loans;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Require police to investigate all cases of hired killings thoroughly, 
regardless of whether families formally complain or the deceased had a police record; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) End the use of the vague &#8220;settlement of accounts&#8221; classification by police 
and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The witness protection programme should be improved through increased 
funding and capacity, and far greater community outreach. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The programme should be administered independently of the police and 
prosecution services. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Consideration should be given to establishing a specialized programme or 
guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> D. Northern border abuses 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>To address allegations of abuses by the armed forces operating along the 
northern border of Ecuador, soldiers should be given more extensive training, 
including: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Training in how to work constructively with the civilian population and 
civil society; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) How to apply and distinguish between human rights and international 
humanitarian law standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) How to deal humanely with displaced persons and refugees; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Improved training in countering illegal armed groups and trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Commanders should make clear that any abuse of civilians will not be 
tolerated. Civilians should be informed of how and to whom they can make 
complaints concerning the behaviour of the armed forces, and the confidentiality of 
complaints should be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>More effort should be made to prosecute members of illegal armed groups, 
especially those that abuse civilians. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Independent investigations should be undertaken of allegations of military or 
police collusion with illegal armed groups in the north, especially in border towns 
experiencing very high levels of trafficking and illegal armed actor violence. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>An independent evaluation of the performance of local prosecutors should be 
undertaken. In sensitive cases, such as those involving allegations against Government 
officials, consideration should be given, to attributing authority to prosecute to 
national-level prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Truth Commission 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Government and the National Assembly should follow up on the work of 
the Truth Commission, including by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensuring that relevant cases are re-opened and that criminal 
investigations are undertaken; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensuring that victims and families can easily obtain information on the 
progress of investigations and are provided legal assistance where needed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Providing appropriate compensation to victims and families; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Creating an archive of the Commission&#8217;s documentation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensuring that witnesses have access to witness protection. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Truth Commission should publish and widely disseminate a short version 
of its report, designed for a popular audience and translated into appropriate 
languages. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Lynching and indigenous justice  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Despite official and popular representations to the contrary, there are 
essentially no cases of indigenous justice in Ecuador that fall within my mandate (in 
other words, there are few, if any, cases of death following an indigenous justice </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>process). The media and officials should be careful to clearly distinguish between 
lynching and indigenous justice. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Indigenous justice is recognized in the Constitution and is an important part of 
the country&#8217;s legal system. Reforms should only be undertaken in consultation with 
indigenous groups. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>A strategy to address the problem of lynchings should be developed by the 
Government in consultation with experts, civil society and indigenous and rural 
organizations. This should include reporting on the location and nature of lynching 
incidents, examination of their causes and prosecutions of perpetrators. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Rural juntas 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Government should appoint an expert to report to it and the National 
Assembly on the current composition and operations of the rural juntas. Particular 
attention should be given to documenting any unlawful activities, such as &#8220;punishing&#8221; 
residents or interfering with the criminal justice system. Appropriate action should be 
taken to eliminate such practices. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The national police and prosecution services should establish a joint specialist 
team to investigate allegations of junta abuses, and prosecute in appropriate cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. International community 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The international community should continue to monitor human rights issues 
in Ecuador, to provide appropriate advice and assistance and to cooperate with local 
groups. </b></p>

<p><b>  Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p> I visited Ecuador from 5 to15 July 2010. I travelled to Quito (Pichincha), Lago 
Agrio (Sucumb&#237;os) and Guayaquil (Guayas). 
</p>
<p> I met with officials at all levels. This included the Minister and Vice Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister for the Coordination of Internal and 
External Security, the Minister of Government, Police and Culture and the Vice Minister of 
Defence. I met with the mayors of Guayaquil and Lago Agrio and the Governor of Guayas. 
I met with the Attorney-General, members of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, members of the 
Constitutional Court, the National Court of Justice and provincial criminal judges, the 
President and members of the National Assembly, the Chief of police and members of the 
police force throughout the country, the Police Inspector-General, the Chief of the Joint 
Command of the military and commanders in Sucumb&#237;os, the Ombudsman and his regional 
representatives, and with members of the Truth Commission. 
</p>
<p> I also met with many non-governmental and humanitarian organizations, as well as 
the members of the United Nations country team, members of the diplomatic community, 
religious leaders, police association representatives, scholars and other independent experts. 
I also met with a large number of witnesses and victims, many of whom travelled long 
distances to meet me, and at risk to their personal security. 
</p>
<p> I am very grateful to the United Nations Human Rights Adviser in Quito and his 
superb staff for their assistance and advice in the preparation of my mission. </p>

<p><b>  Comments on the advance unedited version of the report 
made by the Government of Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Aumento de la violencia de los grupos armados ilegales 
</b></p>
<p><i>9. De hecho, en toda la regi&#243;n norte fue dif&#237;cil hacerse una idea clara de la eficacia de 
la respuesta de la polic&#237;a y el ej&#233;rcito ecuatorianos a los grupos armados ilegales. Las 
estad&#237;sticas facilitadas por oficiales militares no son f&#225;ciles de conciliar entre s&#237;. Por un 
lado, entre 2007 y 2009 el n&#250;mero de efectivos en la regi&#243;n se cuadruplic&#243;. El n&#250;mero de 
operaciones militares se increment&#243; sustancialmente, pasando de apenas 22 en 2007 a 250 
en 2009. La informaci&#243;n proporcionada por el ej&#233;rcito tambi&#233;n indica un r&#225;pido aumento 
de las &quot;instalaciones clandestinas&quot; de grupos armados descubiertas: 18 en 2005, 53 en 
2007 y 183 en 2009. 
</i></p>
<p>El Comando Conjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas ha informado que las operaciones en el a&#241;o 
2009 fueron de 248. Las instalaciones clandestinas desarticuladas por las Fuerzas Armadas 
en el a&#241;o 2005 fueron 12; 2007 fueron 47; 2009 fueron 156, por lo que es necesario que los 
datos sean rectificados. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violaciones cometidas por las fuerzas armadas 
</b></p>
<p><i>13. Las violaciones m&#225;s comunes de las normas de derechos humanos cometidas 
presuntamente por las fuerzas armadas caen fuera del alcance de mi mandato. 
Comprenden el allanamiento de morada, robos y actos de humillaci&#243;n p&#250;blica (como el 
hecho de forzar a las personas a desnudarse en p&#250;blico). Estos abusos parecen ser 
comunes y quedan impunes. Fui informado tambi&#233;n de varios casos graves de tortura y 
violencia sexual, incluidos casos de violaciones y de aplicaci&#243;n de aj&#237; en el cuerpo de las 
v&#237;ctimas.

<p>&#8226; En el caso de la presunta violaci&#243;n a la se&#241;orita. Perea Saavedra Aura, por personal 
militar perteneciente a la BS-56 &#8220;TUNGURAHUA&#8221;, se abri&#243; la Indagaci&#243;n Previa 
N&#186;. 116-2010, dirigida por el Dr. Jos&#233; Beltr&#225;n, Agente Fiscal que realiza el 
procedimiento respectivo, de acuerdo a lo dispuesto en el Art. 160 de nuestra 
Constituci&#243;n que dispone que los miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas ser&#225;n juzgados 
por los &#243;rganos de la Funci&#243;n Judicial, en raz&#243;n de que la presunta infracci&#243;n penal 
habr&#237;a tenido lugar cuando el personal militar realizaba actividades particulares, en 
horarios distintos a los laborales. 
</p>
<p>Es necesario observar que la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica del Ecuador determina en el 
Cap&#237;tulo Tercero de la Funci&#243;n Ejecutiva, Secci&#243;n Tercera, Fuerzas Armadas y Polic&#237;a 
Nacional Art. 160 [&#8230;] &#8220;los miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas y de la Polic&#237;a Nacional 
ser&#225;n juzgados por los &#243;rganos de la Funci&#243;n Judicial; en el caso de delitos cometidos 
dentro de su misi&#243;n espec&#237;fica ser&#225;n juzgados por salas especializadas en materia militar y 
policial&#8221;. Bajo esta consideraci&#243;n, las Fuerzas Armadas Ecuatorianas no poseen tribunales 
u &#243;rganos de justicia propios que juzguen los posibles actos ilegales, evitando de esta 
manera cualquier tipo de injerencia en la justicia. Es derecho de todas y todos los 
ecuatorianos de acuerdo a la norma constitucional, el acceso a la justicia y su efectivo 
ejercicio, a trav&#233;s de una participaci&#243;n constante en el proceso, para evitar de esta manera la 
impunidad y consecuentemente determinar autores c&#243;mplices y encubridores respecto del 
cometimiento de un delito.  
</p>
<p>Se debe considerar que el procedimiento de investigaci&#243;n, sobre cualquier denuncia, es 
competencia privativa de la Fiscal&#237;a, Cap&#237;tulo cuarto Funci&#243;n Judicial y justicia ind&#237;gena, 
secci&#243;n s&#233;ptima, Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado art&#237;culo 192 &#8220;La Fiscal&#237;a dirigir&#225; la

con sujeci&#243;n a los principios de oportunidad y m&#237;nima intervenci&#243;n penal, con especial 
atenci&#243;n al inter&#233;s p&#250;blico y a los derechos de las v&#237;ctimas&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><i>14. Tambi&#233;n recib&#237; informaci&#243;n sobre varios homicidios cometidos por el ej&#233;rcito. Un 
caso emblem&#225;tico ilustra los problemas que existen. Se trat&#243; de la muerte de un 
ecuatoriano y dos colombianos, ocurrida el 18 de enero de 2010. El incidente comenz&#243; 
cuando el ej&#233;rcito se encontr&#243; con tres hombres que viajaban en una piragua. Los militares 
sostuvieron inicialmente que los hombres vest&#237;an el uniforme de las FARC, pero m&#225;s tarde 
la historia cambi&#243; y se dijo que llevaban ropa oscura o de camuflaje. El ej&#233;rcito sostiene 
que cuando les ordenaron detenerse, abrieron fuego en su contra. Los soldados 
respondieron disparando a su vez. Los oficiales declararon que despu&#233;s de eso la piragua 
se hab&#237;a alejado. Posteriormente se supo que dos de los hombres hab&#237;an muerto en el acto, 
y el tercero hab&#237;a sucumbido a las heridas mientras era transportado r&#237;o abajo por 
algunos civiles, que intentaban ayudarlo. 
</i></p>
<p>Las Fuerzas Armadas ecuatorianas actualmente, no han recibido sentencias emitidas por 
juez competente que determinen la responsabilidad penal de miembros de Fuerzas 
Armadas, respecto de delitos de homicidio, considerado en el informe como un hecho 
verificado.  
</p>
<p><i>15. Varios elementos de este caso hacen que la versi&#243;n del ej&#233;rcito resulte sospechosa. 
En parte, cuesta comprender por qu&#233; tres guerrilleros se habr&#237;an encontrado en un bote, a 
plena luz del d&#237;a, en un r&#237;o que se sab&#237;a que estaba patrullado (interlocutores informados 
observaron que eso habr&#237;a sido excepcionalmente raro); por qu&#233; los militares no 
persiguieron la piragua; c&#243;mo pudo una sencilla embarcaci&#243;n fluvial alejarse as&#237; de una 
patrulla militar, o por qu&#233; los militares no recuperaron los cuerpos. El testimonio de los </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p><i>testigos civiles, si es exacto, explica muchas de estas anomal&#237;as. Los testigos indicaron que 
los hombres eran civiles, no uniformados, que no estaban realizando ninguna actividad 
sospechosa y que no abrieron fuego contra los militares. Cuando realic&#233; mi visita, estaba 
en curso la investigaci&#243;n del incidente. Sin embargo, los testigos y los familiares de los 
muertos estaba siendo objeto de presiones para que no testimoniaran. Una testigo me dijo 
que hab&#237;a recibido una llamada en que se le hab&#237;a advertido de que si llevaba adelante la 
causa acabar&#237;a muerta. Al parecer, algunos de los responsables de la investigaci&#243;n 
tambi&#233;n han recibido amenazas. Esas amenazas parecen ser comunes cuando hay oficiales 
involucrados: en otros casos similares de graves violaciones presuntas de los que fui 
informado, testigos, familiares y organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) hab&#237;an 
recibido ofertas de dinero y amenazas para que abandonaran las causas. 
</i></p>
<p>El caso detallado en los numerales l4 y 15 del informe, suscitado el 18 de enero de 2010, ha 
llegado a conocimiento del se&#241;or Fiscal de Sucumb&#237;os, con el expediente N&#186;. 037-2010, en 
el cual se encuentran sindicados oficiales y un se&#241;or General, lo que evidencia que Fuerzas 
Armadas no ejerce presiones o intimidaciones para evitar que se inicien acciones legales.  
</p>
<p>Respecto del mencionado caso suscitado el 18 de enero de 2010, esta Secretar&#237;a de Estado 
no puede determinar aspectos de hecho o de derecho sobre un proceso de investigaci&#243;n 
instaurado ante la instancia competente. Sin embargo, si resultado de este proceso se 
determinan responsabilidades por acci&#243;n u omisi&#243;n y se emite una resoluci&#243;n judicial, &#233;sta 
ser&#225; cumplida a cabalidad por las Fuerzas Armadas. 
</p>
<p>Adem&#225;s, se debe observar que la descripci&#243;n de los hechos en el informe no incluye la 
versi&#243;n entregada a la fiscal&#237;a por parte de Fuerzas Armadas, actualmente no existe 
sentencia ejecutoriada, contra el personal militar sindicado. 
</p>
<p>Es necesario establecer que el compromiso de Fuerzas Armadas con la sociedad civil, es 
estructural, y en este contexto se han tomado medidas de prevenci&#243;n como los 
procedimientos a seguir en caso de una presunta violaci&#243;n a los derechos humanos, 
emitidos por el Comandante General de la Fuerza Terrestre en el a&#241;o 2011. 
</p>
<p><i>16. Los informes de violaciones cometidas por las fuerzas de seguridad en Sucumb&#237;os 
han aumentado considerablemente desde mediados de 2009. Algunos interlocutores 
sugirieron varias razones que podr&#237;an explicar este aumento. Por una parte, se dijo que 
pod&#237;a deberse a la r&#225;pida militarizaci&#243;n de la regi&#243;n y al mayor n&#250;mero de soldados que 
patrullaban la zona, lo que, de por s&#237;, aumentaba las oportunidades de cometer abusos. 
Algunos expertos tambi&#233;n se&#241;alaron que las fuerzas militares no siempre estaban bien 
preparadas y no ten&#237;an gran experiencia en el combate, la contrainsurgencia u otras tareas 
sobre el terreno. No sab&#237;an cu&#225;l era el mejor modo de proteger o incluso de tratar a los 
civiles en ese complejo entorno en que hab&#237;a m&#250;ltiples agentes armados. Eso explicaba en 
parte los casos en que, por ejemplo, v&#237;ctimas que hab&#237;an sido forzadas por las FARC a 
proporcionar alimentos a los guerrilleros hab&#237;an sido luego interrogadas por el ej&#233;rcito, 
acusadas de ser seguidoras de las FARC, y hostigadas o golpeadas. 
</i></p>
<p>En la normativa de las Fuerzas Armadas ecuatorianas se encuentran reglas de conducta 
apegadas a los derechos humanos, mismas que son transversalizadas en las disposiciones 
operativas, cualquier hecho de agresi&#243;n a la ciudadan&#237;a es sancionado administrativamente, 
de ser el caso ser&#225; puesto a conocimiento de las autoridades competentes. 
</p>
<p><i>17. Un elemento importante es que algunos interlocutores afirmaron que una de las 
causas del aumento de las violaciones notificadas hab&#237;a sido un cambio ocurrido en los 
m&#225;s altos mandos del ej&#233;rcito en la regi&#243;n. Antes, las relaciones del ej&#233;rcito con las 
comunidades eran en su mayor parte positivas y los oficiales se preocupaban de inspirar 
confianza. Ahora, sin embargo, los militares dedicaban, al parecer, mucho menos tiempo a 
compartir con miembros de la comunidad y se hab&#237;an vuelto m&#225;s antagonistas y agresivos. 
La confianza de la comunidad hab&#237;a disminuido, lo que hab&#237;a privado al ej&#233;rcito de la </i></p>

importante informaci&#243;n de inteligencia. A fin de compensar esta p&#233;rdida, los militares 
empleaban t&#225;cticas abusivas para obligar a los civiles a proporcionar informaci&#243;n.

<p>La confianza de la comunidad hab&#237;a disminuido, lo que hab&#237;a privado al ej&#233;rcito de la

</p>
<p><i>18. Las relaciones del ej&#233;rcito con la sociedad civil y los agentes humanitarios tambi&#233;n 
se han deteriorado con el cambio en los altos mandos. El apoyo a la sociedad civil ha 
mermado y hay casos de obstrucci&#243;n en los puestos de control del ej&#233;rcito, acoso de 
activistas y redadas de los locales de ONG. La cooperaci&#243;n se ha deteriorado a&#250;n m&#225;s tras 
los intentos de la sociedad civil de obtener justicia para las v&#237;ctimas de los abusos del 
ej&#233;rcito dando publicidad a los incidentes y abogando por el enjuiciamiento de los 
soldados. 
</i></p>
<p>Como se se&#241;ala en el informe, efectivamente se ha incrementado personal militar en 
frontera norte. De conformidad con el art&#237;culo 158 de la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica &#8220;las 
Fuerzas Armadas tienen como misi&#243;n fundamental la defensa de la soberan&#237;a y la 
integridad territorial&#8221;, de ello se desprende que Fuerzas Armadas deben desplegar 
operaciones para garantizar condiciones de seguridad que permitan a las personas que 
habitan en la frontera norte el ejercicio de sus derechos. Por consiguiente, el incremento del 
personal militar, es un esfuerzo del Estado por precautelar el derecho a la seguridad de los 
ciudadanos y ciudadanas de la frontera norte; y, la incomodidad de la poblaci&#243;n por el 
aumento del personal militar, es una reacci&#243;n l&#243;gica a las actividades de mayor control, 
pero no se puede catalogar como un hecho concreto que ha desencadenado presuntas 
violaciones masivas a los derechos humanos.
