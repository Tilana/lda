<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Senegal was held at the 2nd meeting 
on 21 October 2013. The delegation of Senegal was headed by Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of 
Justice. At its 10th meeting held on 25 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Senegal. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Senegal: Botswana, Spain and the Republic 
of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Senegal: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/SEN/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/SEN/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/SEN/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, the 
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to Senegal through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister of Justice began his address by highlighting the cooperation of Senegal 
with the universal periodic review mechanism and its commitment to promoting and 
protecting human rights. The reputation that Senegal had acquired for defending human 
rights reflected its experience as a democratic State founded on the rule of law, illustrated 
and strengthened by the peaceful change of Head of State in 2012. 
</p>
<p>6. On 28 June 2013, Senegal had amended its Nationality Code, thus ending the 
different treatment of men and women in terms of transmitting Senegalese nationality 
through marriage, descent or adoption. In 2010, Senegal had passed a groundbreaking law 
establishing absolute gender parity in elected and partly elected bodies. The representation 
of women in the Senegalese Parliament had increased from 33 to 64 members of parliament 
out of 150 or 43 per cent of the total. 
</p>
<p>7. Similarly, new multisectoral policies had been implemented to combat female 
genital mutilation and other forms of violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>8. With regard to health, the delegation said that the budget allocated to the responsible 
Ministry had increased between 2000 and 2013, from 48.69 billion CFA francs (CFAF) to </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.13-18935 
</p>
<p>CFAF 123.692 billion. Senegal had launched an initiative to provide universal health 
insurance, with the objective of covering 75 per cent of the population by 2017. 
</p><p>9. Support for persons with disabilities remained a priority for the Government. In 
2010, a social orientation law had been adopted to protect them. An equal opportunities 
card was being created that would allow bearers to access essential services free of charge. 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, a national programme of family security grants had been implemented 
to make impoverished families less vulnerable. The programme awarded family security 
grants of CFAF 100,000 per year to 250,000 families living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>11. Combating child trafficking was one of the major themes of the National Strategy on 
Economic and Social Development. On 5 June 2013, Senegal had adopted a road map to 
the elimination of the worst forms of child labour by 2016. Awareness of the subregional 
dimension of this problem had led to consultation on the matter with neighbouring 
countries. 
</p>
<p>12. In the past decade, particular efforts had been made to build schools. Between 2000 
and 2010, the number of facilities had increased from 449 to 1,958 in preschool education, 
from 4,751 to 8,198 in primary education, from 455 to 917 in middle school education and 
from 111 to 326 in secondary education. In the same period, the gross enrolment rate had 
increased from 2.3 per cent to 9.8 per cent in preschool education, from 67.2 per cent to 
94.4 per cent in primary education, from 19.6 per cent to 45 per cent in middle school 
education and from 9.3 per cent to 19.4 per cent in secondary education.  
</p>
<p>13. Senegal also attached great importance to press freedom and the sector was 
characterized by media pluralism, with more than 200 media outlets that expressed 
themselves freely, subject to respect for the privacy of others, citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms, 
and public order. The recommendation relating to the decriminalization of press offences 
was being considered as part of the bill on a press code.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stressed that the Government was taking the necessary steps to 
improve conditions in places of detention. The National Observatory of Places of 
Deprivation of Liberty had been operational since 2012 and emphasis had also been placed 
on preventing lengthy pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>15. As part of the fight against impunity, members of the defence and security forces 
found to be involved in acts of torture had been subject to legal proceedings. However, the 
best example of the country&#8217;s desire to respect its international commitments in the fight 
against impunity was the creation of the Extraordinary African Chambers to try the former 
Chadian President, Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;.  
</p>
<p>16. The Government supported the current reform of the Senegalese Human Rights 
Committee and would take all the necessary measures to ensure that it conformed to the 
Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights (Paris Principles) and recover its &#8220;A&#8221; status. A well-known human rights 
activist had been appointed to lead the revitalization of the Committee.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation believed that the progress made since 2009 had been significant. 
Nevertheless, challenges and constraints remained and Senegal was making consistent and 
determined efforts to confront and overcome them in the near future. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

categories: combating discrimination; places of detention; access to economic, social, and 
cultural rights; and combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>57. The Senegalese Government had taken a three-pronged approach to combating 
excision, which was harmful to women&#8217;s health. The practice was punished, awareness of it </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-18935 
</p>
<p>was being raised among the population, and women who performed it were offered 
alternative occupations so that they could stop. Several regions had renounced the practice; 
of around 5,000 communities, more than 4,500 had announced that they had abandoned 
excision. Efforts were now focused on the remaining 500 communities, using the three-
pronged approach mentioned previously. Furthermore, the Senegalese authorities had noted 
the need to develop regional cooperation in order to render their approach more effective. 
</p>
<p>58. Efforts had been made with regard to the situation of children, particularly in the 
area of education. Ten years&#8217; compulsory schooling, from the age of 6 to 16, had made it 
possible to get children off the streets. Particular attention had been paid to girls&#8217; education 
and their baccalaureate results in 2010 and 2011 had been very encouraging. In fact, 40 per 
cent of those who had passed that examination had been girls. It was also important to 
highlight the modernization of the <i>daraas</i>, which gave children a real education in Arabic, 
French and the national languages and took them off the streets, where they were exposed 
to danger. 
</p>
<p>59. Regarding places of detention, the position of Director of the National Observatory 
of Places of Deprivation of Liberty had been created in 2011 in accordance with the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Although the resources at its disposal were not yet 
sufficient, the aim was to enable the Observatory to make unannounced visits to the 37 
places of detention in Senegal. After visiting prisons, the Observatory had made 
recommendations relating to health, food and reducing prison overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>60. In Senegal, homosexuality was not an offence as such; article 319 of the Criminal 
Code referred to unnatural acts. Being homosexual was not an offence in Senegal and no 
legal proceedings had been brought against persons based solely on their homosexuality. 
</p>
<p>61. Senegal had decided to try the former Chadian president Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; in 
accordance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment and the universal competence mechanism. He had been accused 
of several crimes and it would be for the competent courts to determine the truth of the 
accusations. Senegal undertook to guarantee him due process and a fair, impartial and 
transparent trial, free from any kind of pressure.  
</p>
<p>62. Under Senegalese legislation, rape was an offence punishable by between 5 and 10 
years&#8217; imprisonment, and a 10-year sentence was automatically handed down in cases of 
the rape of a child under 13. 
</p>
<p>63. Gabon welcomed the ratification by Senegal of virtually all international and 
regional legal instruments and noted its cooperation with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. It noted its commitment to promote and protect human rights and combat all 
forms of discrimination. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Germany commended Senegal for its progress in eradicating FGM. It asked whether 
the Children&#8217;s Code would define a child as a person up to the age of 18 and whether the 
Family Code would ensure a minimum age of marriage of 18. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>65. Ghana commended Senegal on pursuing its efforts to expand basic education for 
boys and girls and universal health care, and to continue promoting gender parity. It 
encouraged Senegal to counter any complacency in promoting and protecting human rights. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Greece noted continued restrictions in freedom of expression and was concerned 
about the situation involving children&#8217;s rights. It also noted that Senegal continued to 
discriminate against sexual orientation. It made recommendations. </p>

of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons and by reports of torture 
referenced by the Committee against Torture. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>71. Italy asked Senegal for further information on ongoing legislative reforms to combat 
gender discrimination, the plan to eliminate excision (especially monitoring initiatives and 
implementation resources) and envisaged additional measures to regulate Koranic schools 
and eradicate child panhandling. It made a recommendation.  
</p>

reflected by its detailed national report for the second cycle. It made recommendations.

extremism, slavery and enforced begging. It asked about the strategic programme for

marriage. It made recommendations.  
</p>
