SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
("Exchange Act") regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in and incorporated by reference into this report
are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States
("U.S.") Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans,
believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify
forward-looking statements herein. These statements relate to, among other things: the closing of pending
transactions and the effects of such transactions, including the fact that the transactions contemplated by the
Noble exchange agreements are subject to continuing diligence between the parties and accordingly, may
not occur within the expected timeframe or at all; estimated future production (including the components of
such production), sales, expenses, cash flows, liquidity and balance sheet attributes; estimated crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) reserves; the impact of prolonged depressed commodity prices,
including potentially reduced production and associated cash flow; anticipated capital projects, expenditures
and opportunities, including our expectation that 2016 cash flows from operations will approximate cash flows
from investing activities; expected capital budget allocations; our operational flexibility and ability to revise
our development plan, either upward or downward; availability of sufficient funding and liquidity for our capital
program and sources of that funding; expected positive net settlements on derivatives in the second half of
2016; that we expect quarter-over-quarter production growth; future exploration, drilling and development
activities, including non-operated activity, the number of drilling rigs we expect to run and lateral lengths of
wells; expected 2016 production and cash flow ranges and timing of turn-in-lines; our evaluation method of
our customers' and derivative counterparties' credit risk; effectiveness of our derivative program in providing a
degree of price stability; potential for future impairments; expected sustained relief of gathering system
pressure; compliance with debt and senior notes covenants; impact of litigation on our results of operations
and financial position; that we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; our belief that certain
proposed initiatives in Colorado may not qualify to be included on the ballot in 2016; and our future strategies,
plans and objectives.
The above statements are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements herein. Although
forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect our good faith judgment, such statements can only
be based on facts and factors currently known to us. Forward-looking statements are always subject to risks
and uncertainties, and become subject to greater levels of risk and uncertainty as they address matters further
into the future. Throughout this report or accompanying materials, we may use the terms “projection” or similar
terms or expressions, or indicate that we have “modeled” certain future scenarios. We typically use these
terms to indicate our current thoughts on possible outcomes relating to our business or the industry in periods
beyond the current fiscal year. Because such statements relate to events or conditions further in the future,
they are subject to increased levels of uncertainty.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
changes in worldwide production volumes and demand, including economic conditions that might impact
demand;
volatility of commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and the risk of an extended period of
depressed prices;
•reductions in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility;
impact of governmental policies and/or regulations, including changes in environmental and other laws, the
interpretation and enforcement related to those laws and regulations, liabilities arising thereunder and the
costs to comply with those laws and regulations;
•declines in the value of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs properties resulting in further impairments;
•changes in estimates of proved reserves;
•inaccuracy of reserve estimates and expected production rates;
•potential for production decline rates from our wells being greater than expected;
•timing and extent of our success in discovering, acquiring, developing and producing reserves;
availability of sufficient pipeline, gathering and other transportation facilities and related infrastructure to
process and transport our production and the impact of these facilities and regional capacity on the prices we
receive for our production;
•timing and receipt of necessary regulatory permits;
•risks incidental to the drilling and operation of crude oil and natural gas wells;
•future cash flows, liquidity and financial condition;
•competition within the oil and gas industry;
•availability and cost of capital;
•
•
•our success in marketing crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;
•effect of crude oil and natural gas derivatives activities;
impact of environmental events, governmental and other third-party responses to such events, and our ability
to insure adequately against such events;
•cost of pending or future litigation;
•effect that acquisitions we may pursue have on our capital expenditures;
•our ability to retain or attract senior management and key technical employees; and
•success of strategic plans, expectations and objectives for our future operations.
 
Further, we urge you to carefully review and consider the cautionary statements and disclosures, specifically
those under the heading "Risk Factors," made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K"), filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 22, 2016, and our other filings with the SEC
Table of contents
for further information on risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects, which are incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein. We
caution you not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event
or circumstance occurring after the date of this report or currently unknown facts or conditions or the
occurrence of unanticipated events. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this
cautionary statement.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
PDC Energy, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a domestic independent exploration and production
company that produces, develops, acquires and explores for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, with primary
operations in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio. Our operations in
the Wattenberg Field are focused in the horizontal Niobrara and Codell plays and our Ohio operations are
focused in the Utica Shale play. As of June 30, 2016, we owned an interest in approximately 3,000 gross
wells. We are engaged in two business segments: Oil and Gas Exploration and Production and Gas
Marketing.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PDC, our
wholly-owned subsidiary Riley Natural Gas ("RNG") and our proportionate share of our four affiliated
partnerships. Pursuant to the proportionate consolidation method, our accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements include our pro rata share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of
the entities which we proportionately consolidate. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of our financial statements for
interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.
Accordingly, pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial information included in
audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2015 condensed
consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited statements, but does not include disclosures
required by U.S. GAAP. The information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Form
10-K. Our results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting
Standards Board issued their converged standard on revenue recognition that provides a single,
comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it
is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. The standard outlines a five-step approach to apply the underlying principle: (1) identify the contract
with the customer, (2) identify the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the
transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and (5) recognize
revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to
the standard intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on
principal versus agent considerations when recognizing revenue. The revenue standard is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period. The revenue standard can be adopted under the full retrospective method or simplified transition
method. Entities are permitted to adopt the revenue standard early, beginning with annual reporting periods
after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on our condensed
consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's
ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard requires management to assess an entity's ability to
continue as a going concern at the end of every reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosures in
certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of
2016. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update aimed at increasing the transparency and
comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about related leasing arrangements. For leases with terms of more than 12
months, the accounting update requires lessees to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying asset
and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the lease asset and liability will initially be
measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent
measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend upon the classification of
the lease as either a finance or operating lease. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted, and is to be
applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are
currently evaluating the impact these changes may have on our condensed consolidated financial
statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update on stock-based compensation intended to simplify
several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment award transactions. Areas of
simplification include income tax consequences, classification of the awards as either equity or liabilities and
the classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We expect to
adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Determination of Fair Value
Our fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement
in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to
the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the
fair value hierarchy levels. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly
observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived from observable market data by
correlation or other means.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market
activity.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We measure the fair value of our derivative instruments based upon a pricing model that utilizes market-
based inputs, including, but not limited to, the contractual price of the underlying position, current market
prices, crude oil and natural gas forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration
of each outstanding position, volatility factors and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the
effect of our credit standing on the fair value of derivative liabilities and the effect of our counterparties' credit
standings on the fair value of derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default
swap rates and the duration of each outstanding derivative position.
We validate our fair value measurement through the review of counterparty statements and other supporting
documentation, the determination that the source of the inputs is valid, the corroboration of the original source
of inputs through access to multiple quotes, if available, or other information and monitoring changes in
valuation methods and assumptions. While we use common industry practices to develop our valuation
techniques and believe our valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market
participants, changes in our pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly
different fair values.
Our fixed-price swaps, basis swaps and physical purchases are included in Level 2 and our collars and
physical sales are included in Level 3. The following table presents, for each applicable level within the fair
value hierarchy, our derivative assets and liabilities, including both current and non-current portions,
measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of our derivative contracts is the
implied volatility curve, which is provided by a third-party vendor. A significant increase or decrease in the
implied volatility, in isolation, would have a directionally similar effect resulting in a significantly higher or
lower fair value measurement of our Level 3 derivative contracts. There has been no change in the
methodology we apply to measure the fair value of our Level 3 derivative contracts during the periods
covered by this report.
    
Non-Derivative Financial Assets and Liabilities
The carrying value of the financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximate
fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
We utilize fair value on a nonrecurring basis to review our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible
impairment when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying
value of such properties. The fair value of the properties is determined based upon estimated future
discounted cash flow, a Level 3 input, using estimated production and prices at which we reasonably expect
the crude oil and natural gas will be sold.
The liability associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors may be
settled in cash or shares of our common stock. The carrying value of this obligation is based on the quoted
market price of our common stock, which is a Level 1 input. The liability related to this plan, which was
included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, was immaterial as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015.
 
The portion of our long-term debt related to our revolving credit facility approximates fair value due to the
variable nature of related interest rates. We have not elected to account for the portion of our debt related to
our senior notes under the fair value option; however, as of June 30, 2016, we estimate the fair value of the
portion of our long-term debt related to our 7.75% senior notes due 2022 to be $521.3 million, or 104.3% of
par value. We determined these valuations based upon measurements of trading activity and broker and/or
dealer quotes, respectively, which are published market prices, and therefore are Level 2 inputs.
The carrying value of our capital lease obligations approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the
imputed interest rates and the duration of the related vehicle lease.
Concentration of Risk
Derivative Counterparties. Our derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by our
counterparties. We primarily use financial institutions who are also lenders under our revolving credit facility
as counterparties to our derivative contracts. To date, we have had no counterparty default losses relating to
our derivative arrangements. We have evaluated the credit risk of our derivative assets from our
counterparties using relevant credit market default rates, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for
each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding derivative position. Based on our evaluation, we have
determined that the potential impact of nonperformance of our counterparties on the fair value of our
derivative instruments was not significant at June 30, 2016, taking into account the estimated likelihood of
nonperformance.

In October 2014, we sold our entire 50% ownership interest in PDCM to an unrelated third-party. As part of
the consideration, we received a promissory note (the “Note”) for a principal sum of $39.0 million, bearing
interest at varying rates beginning at 8%, and increasing annually. Pursuant to the Note agreement, interest is
payable quarterly, in arrears, commencing in December 2014 and continuing on the last business day of
each fiscal quarter thereafter. At the option of the issuer of the Note, an unrelated third-party, interest can be
paid-in-kind (the “PIK Interest”) and any such PIK Interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of
the Note. As of June 30, 2016, the issuer of the Note had elected the PIK Interest option. The principal and
any unpaid interest is due and payable in full in September 2020 and can be prepaid in whole or in part at
any time without premium or penalty. If an event of default occurs under the Note agreement, the Note must
be repaid prior to maturity. The Note is secured by a pledge of stock in certain subsidiaries of the unrelated
third-party, debt securities and other assets.
On a quarterly basis, we examine the Note for evidence of impairment, evaluating factors such as the
creditworthiness of the issuer of the Note and the value of the underlying assets that secure the Note. We
performed our quarterly evaluation and cash flow analysis as of March 31, 2016 and, based upon the
unaudited year-end financial statements and reserve report of the issuer of the Note received by us in late
March 2016 and existing market conditions, determined that collection of the Note and PIK Interest was not
reasonably assured. As a result, we recognized a provision and recorded an allowance for uncollectible
notes receivable for the $44.0 million outstanding balance as of March 31, 2016, which was included in the
condensed consolidated balance sheet line item other assets.
Under the effective interest method, we recognized $1.2 million of interest income related to the Note for the
three months ended March 31, 2016, of which $1.0 million was PIK Interest, and we recognized $1.1 million
and $2.2 million of interest income related to the Note for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively, of which $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, was PIK Interest.
Additionally, we recorded a $0.7 million provision and allowance for uncollectible notes receivable to impair a
promissory note related to a previous divestiture as collection of the promissory note is not reasonably
assured based on the analysis we performed as of March 31, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, there has been no change to our assessment of the collectibility of the notes or related
interest since March 31, 2016.
Commencing in the second quarter of 2016, we have ceased recognizing interest income on the notes and
are accounting for the notes under the cash basis method.

NOTE 4 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for crude oil,
natural gas and NGLs. To manage a portion of our exposure to price volatility from producing crude oil and
natural gas, we utilize the following economic hedging strategies for each of our business segments.
•
•
For crude oil and natural gas sales, we enter into derivative contracts to protect against price declines in
future periods. While we structure these derivatives to reduce our exposure to changes in price associated
with the derivative commodity, they also limit the benefit we might otherwise have received from price
increases in the physical market; and
For natural gas marketing, we enter into fixed-price physical purchase and sale agreements that qualify as
derivative contracts. In order to offset the fixed-price physical derivatives in our natural gas marketing, we
enter into financial derivative instruments that have the effect of locking in the prices we will receive or pay
for the same volumes and period, offsetting the physical derivative.
We believe our derivative instruments continue to be effective in achieving the risk management objectives
for which they were intended. As of June 30, 2016, we had derivative instruments, which were comprised of
collars, fixed-price swaps, basis protection swaps and physical sales and purchases, in place for a portion of
our anticipated production through 2018 for a total of 71,560 BBtu of natural gas and 9,214 MBbls of crude oil.
The majority of our derivative contracts are entered into at no cost to us as we hedge our anticipated
production at the then-prevailing commodity market prices.
We have not elected to designate any of our derivative instruments as hedges, and therefore do not qualify for
use of hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recorded in
the statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments related to our Oil and Gas
Exploration and Production segment are recorded in commodity price risk management, net. Changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments related to our Gas Marketing segment are recorded in sales from and cost
of natural gas marketing.

We evaluate and update our estimated annual effective income tax rate on a quarterly basis based on current
and forecasted operating results and tax laws. Consequently, based upon the mix and timing of our actual
earnings compared to annual projections, our effective tax rate may vary quarterly and may make quarterly
comparisons not meaningful. A tax expense or benefit unrelated to the current year income or loss is
recognized in its entirety as a discrete item of tax in the period identified. The quarterly income tax provision is
generally comprised of tax expense on income or benefit on loss at the most recent estimated annual
effective tax rate, adjusted for the effect of discrete items.
The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was a 37.9% and 37.5% benefit on
loss compared to a 39.1% and 39.4% benefit on loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The
effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 is based upon a full year forecasted tax
benefit on loss and is greater than the statutory federal tax rate, primarily due to state taxes and percentage
depletion, partially offset by nondeductible officers’ compensation and nondeductible lobbying expenses. The
effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 differs from the statutory rate primarily due
to state taxes and nondeductible officers' compensation, partially offset by percentage depletion and domestic
production deduction. There were no significant discrete items recorded during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 or June 30, 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, there is no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of the date of this report, we are
current with our income tax filings in all applicable state jurisdictions and are not currently under any state
income tax examinations. We continue to voluntarily participate in the Internal Revenue Service's ("IRS")
Compliance Assurance Program for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. With respect to the 2014 tax year, we have
agreed to a post filing adjustment with the IRS which resulted in an immaterial tax payment for the 2014 tax
year. The IRS has fully accepted the 2014 federal return, as adjusted.

Senior Notes
3.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2016. In November 2010, we issued $115 million aggregate principal
amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2016 (the "Convertible Notes") in a private placement to
qualified institutional buyers. The maturity for the payment of principal was May 15, 2016. At December 31,
2015, our indebtedness included the Convertible Notes. Upon settlement in May 2016, we paid the aggregate
principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus cash for fractional shares, totaling approximately $115.0
million, utilizing proceeds from our March 2016 equity offering. Additionally, we issued 792,406 shares of
common stock for the $47.9 million excess conversion value. See Note 11, Common Stock, for more
information.
7.75% Senior Notes Due 2022. In October 2012, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of
7.75% senior notes due October 15, 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”) in a private placement to qualified
institutional buyers. The 2022 Senior Notes accrue interest from the date of issuance and interest is payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15. The indenture governing the 2022 Senior Notes
contains customary restrictive incurrence covenants. Capitalized debt issuance costs are being amortized as
interest expense over the life of the 2022 Senior Notes using the effective interest method.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the 2022 Senior Notes and expect
to remain in compliance throughout the next 12-month period.
Credit Facility
Revolving Credit Facility. We are party to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (sometimes referred to as the
"revolving credit facility"). The revolving credit facility matures in May 2020 and is available for working
capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and to support letters of
credit. The revolving credit facility provides for a maximum of $1 billion in allowable borrowing capacity,
subject to the borrowing base. In May 2016, we completed the semi-annual redetermination of our revolving
credit facility by the lenders, which resulted in the reaffirmation of our borrowing base at $700 million;
however, we have elected to maintain the aggregate commitment at $450 million. The borrowing base is
based on, among other things, the loan value assigned to the proved reserves attributable to our crude oil and
natural gas interests, excluding proved reserves attributable to our affiliated partnerships. The borrowing base
is subject to a semi-annual size redetermination based upon quantification of our reserves at June 30 and
December 31, and is also subject to a redetermination upon the occurrence of certain events. The revolving
credit facility is secured by a pledge of mortgages of certain producing crude oil and natural gas properties.
Our affiliated partnerships are not guarantors of our obligations under the revolving credit facility.
We had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2016, compared to $37.0 million
outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding balance on our
revolving credit facility, exclusive of fees on the unused commitment and the letter of credit noted below, was
2.6% per annum as of December 31, 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, RNG had an irrevocable standby letter of credit of approximately $11.7 million in favor of
a third-party transportation service provider to secure firm transportation of the natural gas produced by third-
party producers for whom we market production in the Appalachian Basin. The letter of credit currently
expires in September 2016 and is automatically extended annually in accordance with the letter of credit's
terms and conditions. The letter of credit reduces the amount of available funds under our revolving credit
facility by an amount equal to the letter of credit. As of June 30, 2016, the available funds under our revolving
credit facility, including the reduction for the $11.7 million letter of credit, was $438.3 million. In addition to our
currently elected commitment of $450 million, we have an additional $250 million of borrowing base
availability under the revolving credit facility, subject to certain terms and conditions of the agreement.
The revolving credit facility contains covenants customary for agreements of this type, with the most restrictive
being certain financial tests on a quarterly basis. The financial tests, as defined per the revolving credit
facility, include requirements to: (a) maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 and (b) not exceed a
maximum leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all the revolving
credit facility covenants and expect to remain in compliance throughout the next 12-month period.

Our estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on historical experience in plugging and
abandoning wells, estimated economic lives and estimated plugging and abandonment cost considering
federal and state regulatory requirements in effect. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-
free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised. In 2016, the credit-adjusted risk-free rates
used to discount our plugging and abandonment liabilities ranged from 7.6% to 8.0%. In periods subsequent
to initial measurement of the liability, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time, revisions to either the amount of the

NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Firm Transportation, Processing and Sales Agreements. We enter into contracts that provide firm
transportation, sales and processing agreements on pipeline systems through which we transport or sell
crude oil and natural gas. Satisfaction of the volume requirements includes volumes produced by us,
purchased from third parties and produced by our affiliated partnerships and other third-party working interest
owners. We record in our financial statements only our share of costs based upon our working interest in the
wells. These contracts require us to pay these transportation and processing charges whether or not the
required volumes are delivered. As natural gas prices continue to remain depressed, certain third-party
producers under our Gas Marketing segment have begun and continue to experience financial distress,
which has led to certain contractual defaults and litigation; however, to date, we have had no material
counterparty default losses. As of June 30, 2016, we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of
approximately $0.9 million. We have initiated several legal actions for breach of contract, collection, and
related claims against certain third-party producers that are delinquent in their payment obligations, which
have to date resulted in one default judgment. There have been no collections received to date and and some
of the third-party producers have shut-in their wells.
A group of independent West Virginia natural gas producers has filed, but not served on RNG, a complaint in
Marshall County, West Virginia, naming Dominion Transmission, Inc. (“Dominion”), certain entities affiliated
with Dominion, and RNG as defendants, alleging various contractual, fiduciary and related claims against the
defendants, all of which are associated with firm transportation contracts entered into by plaintiffs and relating
to pipelines owned and operated by Dominion and its affiliates. RNG is aware of this lawsuit filing but has not
received formal service of process which commences the litigation against RNG. Furthermore, at this time,
RNG is unable to estimate any potential damages associated with the claims, but believes the complaint is
without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its defenses.
The following table presents gross volume information related to our long-term firm transportation, sales and
processing agreements for pipeline capacity:

Litigation. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that it considers normal to its business. The
Company reviews the status of these proceedings on an ongoing basis and, from time to time, may settle or
otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions that management believes are in the best interests
of the Company. There is no assurance that settlements can be reached on acceptable terms or that adverse
judgments, if any, in the remaining litigation will not exceed the amounts reserved. Although the results
cannot be known with certainty, we currently believe that the ultimate results of such proceedings will not
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Environmental. Due to the nature of the natural gas and oil industry, we are exposed to environmental risks.
We have various policies and procedures to minimize and mitigate the risks from environmental
contamination. We conduct periodic reviews and simulated drills to identify changes in our environmental risk
profile. Liabilities are recorded when environmental damages resulting from past events that require
remediation are probable to require remediation and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, we had accrued environmental liabilities in the amount of $4.0 million and
$4.1 million, respectively, included in other accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. We are not aware of any environmental claims existing as of June 30, 2016 which have not been
provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on our financial statements; however, there can be no
assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change or that unknown past non-compliance with
environmental laws will not be discovered on our properties.
In August 2015, we received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request (the "Information Request")
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). The Information Request sought, among other
things, information related to the design, operation, and maintenance of our production facilities in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado. The Information Request focused on historical operation and design
information for 46 of our production facilities and asks that we conduct sampling and analyses at the identified
46 facilities. We responded to
14

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
the Information Request in January 2016. We continue to meet with the EPA and provide additional
information, but cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time.
In addition, in December 2015, we received a Compliance Advisory pursuant to C.R.S. § 25-7-115(2) from the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Quality Control Commission's Air Pollution
Control Division alleging that we failed to design, operate, and maintain certain condensate collection,
storage, processing and handling operations to minimize leakage of volatile organic compounds to the
maximum extent possible at 65 facilities consistent with applicable standards under Colorado law. We are in
the process of responding to the advisory, and working with the agency on specific response processes, but
cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time.
Employment Agreements with Executive Officers. Each of our senior executive officers may be entitled to a
severance payment and certain other benefits upon the termination of the officer's employment pursuant to
the officer's employment agreement and/or the Company's executive severance compensation plan. The
nature and amount of such benefits would vary based upon, among other things, whether the termination
followed a change of control of the Company.
NOTE 11 - COMMON STOCK
Sale of Equity Securities
In March 2016, we completed a public offering of 5,922,500 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, at a price to us of $50.11 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $296.6 million, after deducting
offering expenses and underwriting discounts, of which $59,225 is included in common shares-par value and
$296.5 million is included in additional paid-in capital ("APIC") on the June 30, 2016 condensed consolidated
balance sheet. The shares were issued pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed
with the SEC in March 2015. Upon maturity of our Convertible Notes in May 2016, we paid the aggregate
principal amount, plus cash for fractional shares, totaling approximately $115.0 million, utilizing proceeds
from the offering. Additionally, we issued 792,406 shares of common stock for the premium in excess of the
conversion price of $42.40 per share.
In March 2015, we completed a public offering of 4,002,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, at a price to us of $50.73 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $202.9 million, after deducting
offering expenses and underwriting discounts, of which $40,020 is included in common shares-par value and
$202.8 million is included in APIC on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The shares were issued
pursuant to the effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC in March 2015.

Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs")
The SARs vest ratably over a three-year period and may be exercised at any point after vesting through ten
years from the date of issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the awards, upon exercise, the executive officers will
receive, in shares of common stock, the excess of the market price of the award on the date of exercise over
the market price of the award on the date of issuance.
In January 2016, the Compensation Committee awarded 58,709 SARs to our executive officers. The fair
value of each SAR award was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model using the
following assumptions:

at the time of grant. Expected volatilities were based on our historical volatility. We do not expect to pay or
declare dividends in the foreseeable future.

Restricted Stock Awards
Time-Based Awards. The fair value of the time-based restricted shares is amortized ratably over the requisite
service period, primarily three years. The time-based shares generally vest ratably on each anniversary
following the grant date provided that a participant is continuously employed.
In January 2016, the Compensation Committee awarded to our executive officers a total of 61,634 time-based
restricted shares that vest ratably over a three-year period ending in January 2019.

Total compensation cost related to non-vested time-based awards, net of estimated forfeitures, and not yet
recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as of June 30, 2016 was $21.7 million.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Market-Based Awards. The fair value of the market-based restricted shares is amortized ratably over the
requisite service period, primarily three years. The market-based shares vest if the participant is continuously
employed throughout the performance period and the market-based performance measure is achieved, with a
maximum vesting period of three years. All compensation cost related to the market-based awards will be
recognized if the requisite service period is fulfilled, even if the market condition is not achieved.
In January 2016, the Compensation Committee awarded a total of 24,280 market-based restricted shares to
our executive officers. In addition to continuous employment, the vesting of these shares is contingent on the
Company's total shareholder return ("TSR"), which is essentially the Company’s stock price change including
any dividends, as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies. The shares are measured over a
three-year period ending on December 31, 2018 and can result in a payout between 0% and 200% of the total
shares awarded. The weighted-average grant date fair value per market-based share for these awards was
computed using the Monte Carlo pricing model using the following assumptions:

NOTE 12 - EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is similarly computed, except that the
denominator includes the effect, using the treasury stock method, of unvested restricted stock, outstanding
SARs, stock options, Convertible Notes and shares held pursuant to our non-employee director deferred
compensation plan, if including such potential shares of common stock is dilutive.

In November 2010, we issued our Convertible Notes, which gave the holders the right to convert the
aggregate principal amount into 2.7 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $42.40 per
share. The Convertible Notes matured in May 2016. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt, for additional information.
Prior to maturity, the Convertible Notes were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the
treasury stock method if the average market share price exceeded the $42.40 conversion price during the
period presented. Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes were excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as the effect

NOTE 13 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We separate our operating activities into two segments: Oil and Gas Exploration and Production and Gas
Marketing. All material inter-company accounts and transactions between segments have been eliminated.
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production. Our Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment includes all of
our crude oil and natural gas properties. The segment represents revenues and expenses from the production
and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Segment revenue includes crude oil, natural gas and NGLs
sales, commodity price risk management, net and well operation and pipeline income. Segment income
(loss) consists of segment revenue less production cost, exploration expense, impairment of properties and
equipment, direct general and administrative expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
Gas Marketing. Our Gas Marketing segment purchases, aggregates and resells natural gas produced by
unrelated third-parties. Segment income (loss) primarily represents sales from natural gas marketing and
direct interest income, less costs of natural gas marketing and direct general and administrative expense.
Unallocated Amounts. Unallocated income includes unallocated other revenue, less corporate general and
administrative expense, corporate DD&A expense, interest income and interest expense. Unallocated assets
include assets utilized for corporate general and administrative purposes, as well as assets not specifically
included in our two business segments.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this report, should be read in conjunction
with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
Further, we encourage you to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Financial Overview
Production volumes increased substantially to 5.2 MMboe and 9.8 MMboe for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, representing increases of 54% and 56%, respectively, as compared to the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in production volumes was primarily attributable to our
successful horizontal Niobrara and Codell drilling program in the Wattenberg Field. Crude oil production
increased 26% and 35% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the
same prior year periods. Crude oil production comprised approximately 38% and 40% of total production in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Our ratio of crude oil production to total production decreased
as expected as we shifted our focus to the higher gas to oil ratio inner core area of the Wattenberg Field. We
expect our ratio of crude oil to total production to increase during the second half of 2016 as we move drilling
operations back toward the middle core area of the Wattenberg Field. Natural gas production increased 73%
and 69% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015. NGL production increased 93% and 85% for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Our inner core wells have shown
stronger wet gas production than anticipated, which has contributed to the growth of gas and NGL production.
The majority of our wells turned-in-line during the three months ended March 31, 2016 occurred toward the
end of the quarter, while wells turned-in-line during the three months ended June 30, 2016 occurred more
evenly throughout the period. As expected, this drove our quarter-over-quarter production increase of
approximately 0.6 Mboe, or 14%. We expect the timing of the wells to be turned-in-line during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 to be relatively even, similar to the timing for the three months ended
June 30, 2016. We expect a modest increase in production for the third quarter as compared to the second
quarter. For the month ended June 30, 2016, our average production rate was 58 MBoe per day, up from 42
MBoe per day for the month ended June 30, 2015.
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales, coupled with the impact of settled derivatives, increased during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 relative to the same prior year periods. Crude oil, natural gas and
NGLs sales increased to $110.8 million and $186.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $96.9 million and $171.0 million in the same prior year periods due to 54% and 56%
increases in production, respectively, offset in part by 26% and 30% decreases, respectively, in the realized
price per barrel of crude oil equivalent ("Boe"). The realized prices per Boe were $21.33 and $19.07 for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $28.79 and $27.32, respectively, for
the same prior year periods. Positive net settlements on derivatives increased to $53.3 million and $120.1
million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to positive net
settlements on derivatives of $44.1 million and $94.5 million in the same prior year periods, due to lower
crude oil and natural gas index settlement prices. As a result of these increases, crude oil, natural gas and
NGLs sales and the impact of net settled derivatives totaled $164.1 million and $306.3 million during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $141.0 million and $265.5 million
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. This represents increases of 16% and
15% during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same prior year
periods. The realized prices per Boe, including the impact of net settlements on derivatives, were $31.58 and
$31.36 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $41.88 and $42.40 for
the same prior year periods, respectively.
Additional significant changes impacting our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016
include the following:
Negative net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 was $146.1 million compared to a negative net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative
positions of $93.1 million during the same prior year period. The decrease in fair value of unsettled derivative
positions was primarily attributable to a more significant upward shift in the crude oil and natural gas forward
curves that occurred during the current quarter as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015; and
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $107.0 million during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $70.1 million in the same prior year period, primarily due to increased
production.

Additional significant changes impacting our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016
include the following:
Negative net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions during the six months ended June 30,
2016 was $201.8 million compared to a negative net change in the fair value of unsettled derivative positions
of $76.8 million during the same prior year period. The decrease in fair value of unsettled derivative positions
was primarily attributable to a higher beginning-of-period fair value of derivatives instruments that settled
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and an upward shift in the crude oil and natural gas forward
curves that occurred during the second quarter of 2016;
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to $204.4 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $125.9 million in the same prior year period, primarily due to increased
production and, to a lesser extent, a higher weighted-average depreciation, depletion and amortization rate;

made available to us. As a result, we recognized a provision and recorded an allowance for uncollectible
notes receivable for the $44.7 million outstanding balance as of March 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, there
has been no change to our assessment of the collectibility of the notes. See Note 3, Fair Value of Financial
Instruments - Notes Receivable, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this report for additional information.
In March 2016, we completed a public offering of 5,922,500 shares of our common stock at a price to us of
$50.11 per share. Net proceeds of the offering were $296.6 million, after deducting offering expenses and
underwriting discounts. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay all amounts then
outstanding on our revolving credit facility, the principal amount owed upon the maturity of the Convertible
Notes in May 2016 and retained the remainder for general corporate purposes.
The Convertible Notes matured in May 2016. We paid the aggregate principal amount, plus cash for fractional
shares, totaling approximately $115 million, utilizing proceeds from the offering. Additionally, we issued
792,406 shares of common stock for the excess conversion value.
In June 2016, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Energy, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries
("Noble") to consolidate certain acreage positions in the core area of the Wattenberg Field. Pursuant to the
terms of the agreements, this strategic trade includes leasehold acreage only, and does not include
production or wellbores. We expect to receive approximately 13,500 net acres in exchange for approximately
11,700 net acres, subject, in each case, to title examination and other customary adjustments. The difference
in net acres is primarily due to variances in net revenue interests. This acreage trade is expected to increase
opportunities for longer horizontal laterals with significantly increased working interests, while minimizing
potential surface impact. We anticipate closing this transaction early in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Available liquidity as of June 30, 2016 was $547.4 million compared to $402.2 million as of December 31,
2015. Available liquidity as of June 30, 2016 is comprised of $109.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$438.3 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. These amounts exclude an
additional $250 million available under our revolving credit facility, subject to certain terms and conditions of
the agreement. In May 2016, we completed the semi-annual redetermination of our revolving credit facility by
the lenders, which resulted in the reaffirmation of the borrowing base at $700 million. We have elected to
maintain the aggregate commitment level at $450 million. With our current derivative position, available
liquidity and expected cash flows from operations, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to allow us to fund
our operations and execute our expected 2016 development program.
Operational Overview
Drilling Activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we continued to execute our strategic plan to
grow production while preserving our financial strength and liquidity by managing our capital spending to
approximate our cash flows from operations. Through July 2016, we ran four automated drilling rigs in the
Wattenberg Field. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we spud 76 horizontal wells and turned-in-
line 81 horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field. We also participated in 24 gross, 6.5 net, horizontal non-
operated wells that were spud and 12 gross, 3.2 net, horizontal non-operated wells which were turned-in-line.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we drilled and completed five wells in the Utica Shale, three of
which were turned-in-line during the period. Of these three wells, one is a 10,000 foot lateral well located in
Guernsey County and two are 6,000 foot lateral wells located in Washington County. We plan to turn-in-line
the two remaining wells over the next several months.
    
2016 Operational Outlook
We are raising the mid-point of our production range and now expect our production for 2016 to be between
21.0 MMBoe and 22.0 MMBoe and that our production rate will average approximately 58,000 to 60,000 Boe
per day. Our revised 2016 capital forecast of $400 million to $420 million is focused on continuing to provide
value-driven production growth by exploiting our substantial inventory of reasonable rate-of-return projects in
the Wattenberg Field.
Wattenberg Field. As a result of increased working interests in planned wells resulting from the anticipated
acreage exchange with Noble, we reduced the number of rigs in the Wattenberg Field drilling plan to three
beginning in August 2016. With the reduction from four drilling rigs to three in the Wattenberg Field, our 2016
capital forecast has been slightly reduced to approximately $375 million in the field, comprised of
approximately $340 million for our operated drilling program and approximately $20 million for non-operated
projects. The remainder of the Wattenberg Field capital is expected to be used for leasing, workover projects
and other capital improvements. We plan to spud 128 and turn-in-line 140 horizontal Niobrara or Codell wells
and participate in approximately 15 gross, 4.0 net, non-operated horizontal opportunities in 2016. During the
six months ended June 30, 2016, we invested approximately $182 million, or approximately 49%, of our 2016
capital forecast for the Wattenberg Field.
Utica Shale. As of June 30, 2016, all of our drilling and completion activity in the Utica Shale for 2016 has
been completed as described above. We plan to turn-in-line the two remaining wells during the second half of
2016 once midstream pipeline facilities are available for connection. Additionally, we plan to perform modest
amounts of drill site preparation and to pursue infill leasing opportunities. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we have invested approximately $25 million of our total 2016 capital forecast for the Utica
Shale of approximately $30 million.

2016 Operational Flexibility
In December 2015, the Board of Directors approved our 2016 development plan. This plan, which primarily
focuses on the drilling program in the Wattenberg Field, was based upon our goal to preserve our balance
sheet by managing our capital spending to approximate our cash flows from operations. Additionally, with the
proceeds from our March 2016 equity offering and settlement of our convertible notes in May 2016, we
believe we have further strengthened our balance sheet, while concurrently increasing production and cash
flows.
We maintain significant operational flexibility to reduce the pace of our capital spending. We will continue to
monitor future commodity prices, and should prices remain depressed or further deteriorate, we believe an
adjustment to our development plan may be appropriate. We believe we have ample opportunities to reduce
capital spending, including but not limited to: working with our vendors to achieve further cost reductions;
reducing the number of rigs being utilized in our drilling program; and/or managing our completion schedule.
The production impact of reduced 2016 capital spending would be felt primarily in 2017 and thereafter, as our
anticipated long-term production growth would likely be reduced. This operational flexibility is maintained
with little exposure to incurring additional costs, given that all of our acreage in the Wattenberg Field is held
by production, a reduction in rigs would not cause us to incur substantial idling costs as our rig commitments
are short term (30 to 90 days), and we do not anticipate having additional material unfulfilled transportation
commitment fees.
Ballot Initiative Update
Certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic
fracturing in particular, have advanced various alternatives for ballot initiatives which would result in
significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural gas development in the state. Proponents of two such
initiatives have submitted signatures in an effort to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot in November
2016. The signatures are subject to a verification process to be conducted by the Colorado Secretary of State.
This process could take up to 30 days. We do not know what the outcome of this process will be. However,
based on unofficial reports regarding the number of signatures submitted and the expectation that some
signatures will be invalidated, we believe there is a substantial likelihood that the initiatives will not qualify for
the ballot. If the initiatives qualify and are approved by the voters of Colorado, the proposals will take effect by
the end of 2016.
One of the initiatives that could appear on the ballot, which we refer to as the “local control” initiative, would
amend the state constitution to give city, town and county governments the right to regulate, or to ban, oil and
gas development and production within their boundaries, notwithstanding rules and approvals to the contrary
at the state level. The other initiative, which we refer to as the “setback” initiative, would amend the state
constitution to require all new oil and gas development facilities to be located at least 2,500 feet away from
any occupied structure or “area of special concern,” broadly defined to include public and community drinking
water sources, lakes, rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, creeks, irrigation canals, riparian areas,
playgrounds, permanent sports fields, amphitheaters, public parks and public open space. The current
minimum required setback between oil and gas wells and occupied structures is generally 500 feet. If
implemented, the 2,500 foot setback proposal would effectively prohibit the vast majority of our planned future
drilling activities and would therefore make it impossible to pursue our current development plans. The local
control proposal would potentially have a similar effect, depending on the nature and extent of regulations
implemented by relevant local governmental authorities.
Because substantially all of our current operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face
with respect to these proposals, and possible similar future proposals, are greater than those of our
competitors with more geographically diverse operations. We cannot predict the outcome of the potentially
pending initiatives or possible future regulatory developments.
See Part II, Item1A, Risk Factors, for additional information regarding the ballot initiatives.

Production for the second quarter of 2016 was 5.2 million Boe, up from 3.4 million Boe in the second quarter
of 2015. Year-to-date, production was 9.8 million Boe, up from 6.3 million Boe in the first six months of 2015.
Production increased as a result of continued drilling and completion activities as discussed in Operational
Overview. Gathering system line pressures decreased following the commissioning of DCP’s Lucerne II plant
in the summer of 2015, down to levels that were consistent with our projections. We continued to experience
24% lower line pressures in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the comparable period of 2015 on our
primary service provider’s system. Line pressures averaged 225 pounds per square inch gage ("psig") during
the second quarter of 2015 and averaged 170 psig during the second quarter of 2016. Line pressures began
to build during the quarter as system volumes increased and the region experienced warmer weather. Other
contributing factors to the increase in line pressures were our primary service provider experiencing
significant unexpected downtime during the quarter on some of its major plants, as well as performing
extensive scheduled maintenance on one of its higher capacity gas plants. As a result of the increased line
pressures, we experienced a curtailment of our legacy vertical well gas production of approximately 1.2 MMcf
per day, or 6% of our vertical production, at the end of June, representing approximately 0.5% of our total
Wattenberg Field gas production, along with associated oil production. The 170 psig average line pressure
experienced during the quarter had negligible impact on our horizontal production. We expect the gathering
system pressures on the primary service provider’s system to stabilize and then decrease as cooler weather
arrives by the end of the third quarter of 2016.
Our secondary midstream service provider, which currently gathers and processes approximately 36% of our
Wattenberg Field gas, has limited its capital program in 2016, which has resulted in a curtailment of
approximately 10 MMcf per day of our 2016 volumes. To help mitigate the impact of this curtailment, we have
elected to contribute upfront capital of $0.6 million to our secondary midstream service provider to facilitate
timely connection of certain of our well pads. We expect to be reimbursed by our secondary midstream
service provider for this amount during the fourth quarter of 2016. With continued pressure on commodity
prices impacting their revenue, we have seen more requests for upfront capital contributions by our third-party
midstream service providers in order to ensure well connections are completed in a timely manner. We
expect this trend to continue, and we will evaluate these requests on an individual basis. We rely on our third-
party midstream service providers to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace
with our production growth. As a result, the timing and availability of additional facilities going forward is
beyond our control. Falling commodity prices have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by
some third parties, increasing the risk that sufficient midstream infrastructure will not be available in future
periods.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Pricing. Our results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly
the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and our ability to market our production effectively. Crude oil,
natural gas and NGL prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. While the price of crude oil
decreased during the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, prices increased substantially during
the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 as the number of U.S. crude oil rigs and
inventories declined. Natural gas prices decreased during the first half of 2016 when compared to the same
prior year period. Although we did experience improved pricing by the end of the second quarter of 2016, due
to an oversupply of nearly all domestic NGLs products, our average realized sales price for NGLs during the
first half of 2016 reflected the same low levels seen during the last quarter of 2015. With the initiation of
ethane exports and increased demand for NGLs, we are starting to see NGL prices trend upward.
Crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, financial markets and
national and international politics. In the Wattenberg Field, crude oil is sold under various purchase contracts
with monthly and longer term pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. We have
entered into longer term commitments ranging from three months to six months to deliver crude oil to
competitive markets and these agreements have resulted in significantly improved deductions compared to
the comparable period in 2015. We continue to pursue various alternatives with respect to oil transportation,
particularly in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward further improving pricing and limiting our use of
trucking of production. We began delivering crude oil in accordance with our long term commitment to the
White Cliffs Pipeline, LLC ("White Cliffs") pipeline in July 2015. This is one of several agreements we have
entered into to facilitate deliveries of a portion of our crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma market. In addition,
we have signed a long-term agreement for gathering of crude oil at the wellhead by pipeline from several of
our pads in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward minimizing truck traffic, increasing reliability and
reducing the overall physical footprint of our well pads. We began delivering crude oil into this pipeline during
the fourth quarter of 2015 and the system was fully operational on certain wells in the first half of 2016. In the
Utica Shale, crude oil and condensate is sold to local purchasers at each individual pad based on NYMEX
pricing, adjusted for differentials, and is typically transported by the purchasers via truck to local refineries, rail
facilities or barge loading terminals on the Ohio River.

Natural gas prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, availability of pipeline
capacity and supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The price we receive for our natural
gas produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on CIG and local utility prices, adjusted for certain deductions,
while natural gas produced in the Utica Shale is based on TETCO M-2 pricing. We anticipate that the
significant Appalachian pipeline differentials that impact our Utica Shale natural gas will continue through
2016.
Our price for NGLs produced in the Wattenberg Field is based on a combination of prices from the Conway
hub in Kansas and Mt. Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed. The NGLs produced in the Utica
Shale are sold based on month-to-month pricing to various markets. While NGL prices had been declining,
we have seen a stabilization of prices in the second quarter of 2016. We expect NGL prices to remain stable
amid indications that prices could increase later in 2016.
Our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are recorded under either the “net-back” or "gross" method of
accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. We use the "net-back" method of accounting
for natural gas and NGLs, as well as the majority of our crude oil production, from the Wattenberg Field and
for crude oil from the Utica Shale as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide
transportation, gathering and processing services. We sell our commodities at the wellhead and collect a
price and recognize revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs
downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price. The net-back
method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based.
We use the "gross" method of accounting for Wattenberg Field crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs
and Saddle Butte pipelines and for natural gas and NGLs sales related to production from the Utica Shale as
the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services. Under this method, we
recognize revenues based on the gross selling price and recognize transportation, gathering and processing
expenses. As a result of the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte agreements, during the six months ended June 30,
2016, our Wattenberg Field crude oil average sales price increased approximately $1.65 per barrel because
we recognized the costs for transportation on the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte pipelines as an increase in
transportation expense, rather than as a deduction from revenues.
Lease Operating Expenses
The $1.0 million increase in lease operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in
contract labor, $0.3 million in leased generators and $0.9 million in other lease operating expenses, offset in
part by a decrease of $0.5 million in regulatory compliance projects. Lease operating expenses during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 were comparable to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Lease operating
expenses per Boe decreased 29% and 34% to $2.63 and $2.97 during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $3.71 and $4.52 during the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, respectively. The significant decreases in lease operating expense per Boe were the result of
production growth of 54% and 56%, respectively.
Production Taxes
Production taxes are directly related to crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales. The $2.2 million and $2.4
million increases in production taxes during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were primarily related to the 14% and 9%
increases in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales, respectively, and 2015 production taxes reflecting
downward adjustments related to ad valorem rates for production in 2014 and 2015.
Transportation, Gathering and Processing Expenses
The $3.2 million and $5.9 million increases in transportation, gathering and processing expenses during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015 were mainly attributable to oil transportation cost on the White Cliffs and Saddle Butte
pipelines as we began delivering crude oil on these pipelines in July 2015 and December 2015, respectively.
We expect to continue to incur these oil transportation costs pursuant to our long-term transportation
agreements.
Commodity Price Risk Management, Net
We use various derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices. We have in
place a variety of collars, fixed-price swaps and basis swaps on a portion of our estimated natural gas and
crude oil production. Because we sell all of our natural gas and crude oil production at prices similar to the
indexes inherent in our derivative instruments, adjusted for certain fees and surcharges stipulated in the
applicable sales agreements, we ultimately realize a price, before contract fees, related to our collars of no
less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for our commodity swaps, we ultimately realize the fixed
price related to our swaps, less deductions. See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed presentation of our
derivative positions as of June 30, 2016.
Commodity price risk management, net, includes cash settlements upon maturity of our derivative instruments
and the change in fair value of unsettled derivatives related to our crude oil and natural gas production.
Commodity price risk management, net, does not include derivative transactions related to our natural gas
marketing, which are included in sales from and cost of natural gas marketing. See Note 3, Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details of our derivative financial instruments.
Net settlements are primarily the result of crude oil and natural gas index prices at maturity of our derivative
instruments compared to the respective strike prices. Net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives is
comprised of the net asset increase or decrease in the beginning-

of-period fair value of derivative instruments that settled during the period and the net change in fair value of
unsettled derivatives during the period. The corresponding impact of settlement of the derivative instruments
that settled during the period is included in net settlements for the period as discussed above. Net change in
fair value of unsettled derivatives during the period is primarily related to shifts in the crude oil and natural gas
forward curves and changes in certain differentials. See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of net
settlements on our various derivatives.

Impairment of proved and unproved properties. Amounts represent the write-down of certain capitalized well
costs on our properties as the expected development date for these locations are beyond the limits of the
SEC five-year rule. Further deterioration of commodity prices could result in additional impairment charges to
our crude oil and natural gas properties.
Amortization of individually insignificant unproved properties. Amounts relate to insignificant leases that were
subject to amortization. The decreases in amortization during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were due to an impairment in the third quarter of
2015 that significantly reduced the carrying value of our Utica Shale leases.
Land and buildings. The impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying value over the estimated
fair value, less the cost to sell, of a field operating facility in Greeley, Colorado, and 12 acres of land located
adjacent to our Bridgeport, West Virginia, regional headquarters. The fair values of these assets were
determined based upon estimated future cash flows from unrelated third-party bids, a Level 3 input.

General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense increased $2.9 million to $23.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $20.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was
primarily attributable to a $2.7 million increase in payroll and employee benefits, of which $1.3 million was
stock-based compensation.
General and administrative expense increased $4.6 million to $46.4 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $41.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily
attributable to a $3.3 million increase in payroll and employee benefits, of which $1.6 million was stock-based
compensation, a $0.7 million increase in costs for consulting and other professional services and a $0.4
million increase in marketing and government relations activities.
    
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense
Crude oil and natural gas properties. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties is directly
related to proved reserves and production volumes. DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas
properties was $106.1 million and $202.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to $69.0 million and $123.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The period-over-period
change in DD&A expense related to crude oil and natural gas properties was primarily due to the following:

Non-crude oil and natural gas properties. Depreciation expense for non-crude oil and natural gas properties
was $0.9 million and $2.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to $1.1 million and $2.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
Provision for Uncollectible Notes Receivable
A provision for uncollectible notes receivable of $44.7 million was recorded during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 to impair two third-party notes receivable whose collection is not reasonably assured. See
Note 3, Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Notes Receivable, to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $0.9 million and $0.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The decreases were primarily attributable
to decreases in interest on the Convertible Notes as they matured in May 2016.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased $1.0 million and $0.5 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, as we ceased recognizing non-cash interest
income on two third-party notes receivable.

Provision for Income Taxes
See Note 6, Income Taxes, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this report for a discussion of the changes in our effective tax rate for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The effective tax rate of
37.9% and 37.5% benefit on loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, is based on
forecasted pre-tax loss for the year adjusted for permanent differences. The forecasted full year effective tax
rate has been applied to the quarter-to-date pre-tax loss resulting in a tax benefit for the period. Because the
estimate of full-year income or loss may change from quarter to quarter, the effective tax rate for any particular
quarter may not have a meaningful relationship to pre-tax income or loss for the quarter or the actual annual
effective tax rate that is determined at the end of the year.
Net deferred income tax liability at June 30, 2016 decreased $102.3 million compared to December 31, 2015.
This decrease is primarily attributable to the significant positive net settlements from derivatives during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and the significant negative net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives
held at June 30, 2016.
Net Loss/Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
 
Net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $95.5 million and $167.0 million compared to
net loss of $46.9 million and $29.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted net
loss, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, was $5.1 million and $41.9 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to adjusted net income of $10.8 million and $17.9 million for the same prior
year periods. The quarter-over-quarter changes in net loss are discussed above, with the most significant
changes related to the decrease in commodity price risk management activity income and the increase in
crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales and DD&A expense. The year-over-year changes in net loss are
discussed above, with the most significant changes related to the decrease in commodity price risk
management activity income and the increase in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales, DD&A expense and
provision for uncollectible notes receivable. These changes similarly impacted adjusted net income (loss),
with the exception of the tax effected net change in fair value of unsettled derivatives. See Reconciliation of
Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, below, for a more detailed discussion of this non-U.S. GAAP financial
measure.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, our revolving
credit facility, proceeds raised in debt and equity market transactions and asset sales. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016, our primary sources of liquidity were the net proceeds received from the March 2016
public offering of our common stock of $296.6 million and net cash flows from operating activities of $197.8
million. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay all amounts then outstanding on our
revolving credit facility, the principal amounts owed upon the maturity of the Convertible Notes in May 2016,
and retained the remainder for general corporate purposes.
Our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is the sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.
Fluctuations in our operating cash flows are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our
production volumes. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and we manage this volatility through
our use of derivative instruments. We enter into commodity derivative instruments with maturities of no greater
than five years from the date of the instrument. For instruments that mature in three years or less, our debt
covenants restrict us from entering into hedges that would exceed 85% of our expected future production from
total proved reserves for such related time period (proved developed producing, proved developed non-
producing and proved undeveloped). For instruments that mature later than three years, but no more than our
designated maximum maturity, our debt covenants limit us from entering into hedges that would exceed 85%
of our expected future production from proved developed producing properties during that time period. We
may choose not to hedge the maximum amounts permitted under our covenants. Therefore, we may still have
significant fluctuations in our cash flows from operating activities due to the remaining non-hedged portion of
our future production. Given current commodity prices and our hedge position, we expect that positive net
settlements on our derivative positions will continue to be a significant positive component of our 2016 cash
flows from operations. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of our derivatives was a net asset of $61.9 million.
Based on the forward pricing strip at June 30, 2016, we would expect positive net settlements totaling
approximately $75.9 million during the second half of 2016. However, based upon our current hedge position
and assuming current strip pricing, during periods subsequent to 2016 our derivatives may no longer be a
significant source of cash flow, and may result in cash outflows. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, net settled derivatives comprised approximately 61% and 65%, respectively, of our cash flows from
operating activities. See Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included
elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our derivatives positions by year of maturity.
Our working capital fluctuates for various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in the fair value of our
commodity derivative instruments and changes in our cash and cash equivalents due to our practice of
utilizing excess cash to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At June 30,
2016, we had working capital of $131.9 million compared to $30.7 million at December 31, 2015. The
increase in working capital as of June 30, 2016 is primarily the result of an increase in cash and cash
equivalents and the repayment of the Convertible Notes in May 2016, offset in part by a decrease in the fair
value of unsettled derivatives.
In recent periods, including the first half of 2016, we have been able to access borrowings under our revolving
credit facility and to obtain proceeds from the issuance of securities. We ended June 2016 with cash and
cash equivalents of $109.1 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $438.3 million, for a
total liquidity position of $547.4 million, compared to $402.2 million at December 31, 2015. These amounts
exclude an additional $250 million available under our revolving credit facility, subject to certain terms and
conditions of the credit agreement. The increase in liquidity of $145.2 million, or 36.1%, during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to net cash flows from operating activities of $197.8 million
and net cash flows from financing activities of $141.3 million, primarily due to the
29
Table of contents
PDC ENERGY, INC.
March 2016 public offering of our common stock, offset in part by cash paid for capital expenditures of $235.7
million. Our liquidity position was reduced by the cash payment of approximately $115 million upon the
maturity of our Convertible Notes in May 2016. With our current derivative position, liquidity position and
expected cash flows from operations, we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our planned drilling
operations for the next 12 months. We cannot, however, assure sources of capital available to us in the past
will be available to us in the future.
In March 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Effective upon
filing, the shelf provides for the potential sale of an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock or
preferred stock, either separately or represented by depository shares, warrants or purchase contracts, as
well as units that may include any of these securities or securities of other entities. The shelf registration
statement is intended to allow us to be proactive in our ability to raise capital and to have the flexibility to raise
such funds in one or more offerings should we perceive market conditions to be favorable. Pursuant to this
shelf registration, we sold approximately four million shares of our common stock in March 2015 in an
underwritten public offering at a price to us of $50.73 per share and approximately six million shares of our
common stock in March 2016 in an underwritten public offering at a price to us of $50.11 per share.
Our revolving credit facility borrowing base is subject to a redetermination each May and November, based
upon a quantification of our proved reserves at each June 30 and December 31, respectively. In May 2016,
we completed the semi-annual redetermination of our revolving credit facility by the lenders, which resulted in
the reaffirmation of our borrowing base at $700 million. However, we elected to maintain the aggregate
commitment level at $450 million. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is May 2020. We had no
outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2016. While we have added and expect to
continue to add producing reserves through our drilling operations, the effect of any such reserve additions on
our borrowing base could be offset by other factors including, among other things, a prolonged period of
depressed commodity prices or regulatory pressure on lenders to reduce their exposure to exploration and
production companies.
Our revolving credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. The covenants require that we
maintain: (i) total debt of less than 4.25 times the trailing 12 months earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, depletion and amortization, change in fair value of unsettled derivatives, exploration expense,
gains (losses) on sales of assets and other non-cash, extraordinary or non-recurring gains (losses)
("EBITDAX") and (ii) an adjusted current ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0. Our adjusted current ratio is adjusted by
eliminating the impact on our current assets and liabilities of recording the fair value of crude oil and natural
gas derivative instruments. Additionally, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are added to
the current asset calculation and the current portion of our revolving credit facility debt is eliminated from the
current liabilities calculation. At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants with a 1.0
times debt to EBITDAX ratio and a 4.0 to 1.0 current ratio. We expect to remain in compliance throughout the
next year.
The indenture governing our 7.75% senior notes due 2022 contains customary restrictive covenants that,
among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (a) incur additional debt, (b)
make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase, redeem or retire
capital stock, (c) sell assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries, (d) restrict the payment of
dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to us, (e) create liens that secure debt, (f) enter into
transactions with affiliates and (g) merge or consolidate with another company. At June 30, 2016, we were in
compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance throughout the next year.
See Part I, Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for our discussion of credit risk.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities. Our net cash flows from operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices,
production volumes, net settlements from our derivative positions, operating costs and general and
administrative expenses. Cash flows from operating activities increased by $51.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to increases in net
settlements from our derivative positions of $25.7 million and crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of $15.2
million and the increase in changes in assets and liabilities of $18.6 million related to the timing of cash
payments and receipts. These increases were offset in part by the increase in transportation, gathering and
processing expenses of $5.9 million. The key components for the changes in our cash flows provided by
operating activities are described in more detail in Results of Operations above.
Adjusted cash flows from operations, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, increased $32.8 million during the
six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was
primarily due to the same factors mentioned above for changes in cash flows provided by operating activities,
without regard to timing of cash payments and receipts of assets and liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S.
GAAP financial measure, decreased by $16.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of recording a provision for
uncollectible notes receivable of $44.7 million and the increase in transportation, gathering and processing
expenses of $5.9 million and general and administrative expense of $4.6 million, offset in part by increases in
net settlements from our derivative positions of $25.7 million and crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of
$15.2 million. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, below, for a more detailed
discussion of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.
 
Investing Activities. Because crude oil and natural gas production from a well declines rapidly in the first few
years of production, we need to continue to commit significant amounts of capital in order to maintain and
grow our production and replace our reserves. If capital is not available or is constrained in the future, we will
be limited to our cash flows from operations and liquidity under our revolving credit facility as the sources for
funding our capital expenditures.
30
Table of contents
PDC ENERGY, INC.
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of the acquisition, exploration and development of crude
oil and natural gas properties, net of dispositions of crude oil and natural gas properties. Net cash used in
investing activities of $230.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily related to cash
utilized for our drilling operations, including completion activities. For the full year 2016, we expect that our
cash flows from operations will approximate our cash flows from investing activities.
 
Financing Activities. Net cash from financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by
approximately $55.5 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net cash from financing
activities of $141.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily related to the $296.6 million
received from the issuance of our common stock in March 2016, partially offset by the $115.0 million payment
of principal amounts owed upon the maturity of the Convertible Notes and net payments of approximately
$37.0 million to pay down amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility.
Drilling Activity
 
The following table presents our net developmental drilling activity for the periods shown. Productive wells
consist of wells spud, turned-in-line and producing during the period. In-process wells represent wells that
have been spud, drilled or are waiting to be completed and/or for gas pipeline connection during the period.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, that have or are
reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Commitments and Contingencies
See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this report.
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP required management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates or in the underlying
accounting assumptions and estimates used in these critical accounting policies from those disclosed in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in our 2015 Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on February 22, 2016.
Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures
We use "adjusted cash flows from operations," "adjusted net income (loss)" and "adjusted EBITDA," non-
U.S. GAAP financial measures, for internal management reporting, when evaluating period-to-period
changes and, in some cases, providing public guidance on possible future results. These measures are not
measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for, net income (loss) or cash flows from operations, investing or financing activities, and should not
be viewed as liquidity measures or indicators of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-
U.S. GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies. Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in order to
help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously
reported results of operations. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and
publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.
Adjusted cash flows from operations. We define adjusted cash flows from operations as the cash flows
earned or incurred from operating activities, without regard to changes in operating assets and liabilities. We
believe it is important to consider adjusted cash flows from operations, as well as cash flows from operations,
as we believe it often provides more transparency into what drives the changes in our operating trends, such
as production, prices, operating costs and related operational factors, without regard to whether the related
asset or liability was received
31

or paid during the same period. We also use this measure because the timing of cash received from our
assets, cash paid to obtain an asset or payment of our obligations has been only a timing issue from one
period to the next as we have not had significant accounts receivable collection problems, nor been unable to
purchase assets or pay our obligations. See the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Adjusted net income (loss). We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss), plus loss on
commodity derivatives, less gain on commodity derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives,
each adjusted for tax effect. We believe it is important to consider adjusted net income (loss), as well as net
income (loss). We believe this measure often provides more transparency into our operating trends, such as
production, prices, operating costs, net settlements from derivatives and related factors, without regard to
changes in our net income (loss) from our mark-to-market adjustments resulting from net changes in the fair
value of unsettled derivatives. Additionally, other items which are not indicative of future results may be
excluded to clearly identify operating trends.
Adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus loss on commodity derivatives,
interest expense, net of interest income, income taxes, impairment of properties and equipment, depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense and accretion of asset retirement obligations, less gain on commodity
derivatives and net settlements on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial
performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net
income (loss), and should not be considered an indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA includes certain non-cash costs incurred by the Company and does not take into
account changes in operating assets and liabilities. Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted
EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We believe adjusted
EBITDA is relevant because it is a measure of our operational and financial performance, as well as a
measure of our liquidity, and is used by our management, investors, commercial banks, research analysts
and others to analyze such things as:
•
•operating performance and return on capital as compared to our peers;
financial performance of our assets and our valuation without regard to financing methods, capital structure
or historical cost basis;
•our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations; and
•the viability of acquisition opportunities and capital expenditure projects, including the related rate of return.

In May 2016, the EPA issued a draft Information Collection Request that will impact all known operators in the
U.S. and which is aimed at regulating existing onshore oil and gas sources. The EPA also finalized a rule
regarding source determination and permitting requirements for the onshore oil and gas industry under the
Clean Air Act.  Under this final rule, our operations could be subject to increased permitting costs and more
stringent control requirements. In June 2016, the EPA published amendments to the 2012 NSPS OOOO rules
focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from the oil and natural
gas industry. The EPA also finalized pretreatment standards for the discharge of wastewater to publicly-
owned treatment works for the onshore oil and gas extraction industry. Other agencies have also published
new proposed or final rules impacting the onshore oil and gas industry. For example, the U.S. Department of
Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued an additional notice of
proposed rulemaking in June 2016 related to the safety of transmission and gathering lines. In addition, in
March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule to alter how it identifies critical habitat for
endangered and threatened species, which could expand the reach of the Endangered Species Act
depending on how it is implemented.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market-Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management
We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rate risks, commodity price risk and credit risk. We
have established risk management processes to monitor and manage these market risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our interest bearing cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash accounts and the interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our
7.75% senior notes due 2022 have a fixed rate and, therefore, near-term changes in interest rates do not
expose us to risk of earnings or cash flow loss; however, near-term changes in interest rates may affect the
fair value of our fixed-rate debt.
As of June 30, 2016, our interest-bearing deposit accounts included money market accounts, certificates of
deposit and checking and savings accounts with various banks. The amount of our interest-bearing cash,
cash equivalents and restricted cash as of June 30, 2016 was $90.2 million with a weighted-average interest
rate of 0.3%. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our interest-bearing deposits as of June 30, 2016, we estimate
that a 1% increase in interest rates would increase interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 by
approximately $0.5 million.
As of June 30, 2016, we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.
    
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of crude oil, natural gas
and NGLs. Pursuant to established policies and procedures, we manage a portion of the risks associated
with these market fluctuations using derivative instruments. These instruments help us predict with greater
certainty the effective crude oil and natural gas prices we will receive for our hedged production. We believe
that our derivative policies and procedures are effective in achieving our risk management objectives.

Based on a sensitivity analysis as of June 30, 2016, we estimate that a 10% increase in natural gas and
crude oil prices, inclusive of basis, over the entire period for which we have derivatives in place, would have
resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our derivative positions of $63.0 million, whereas a 10% decrease in
prices would have resulted in an increase in fair value of $63.0 million.
See Note 3, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a summary of our open
derivative positions, as well as a discussion of how we determine the fair value of and account for our
derivative contracts.
Credit Risk
Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations.
We attempt to reduce credit risk by diversifying our counterparty exposure and entering into transactions with
high-quality counterparties. When exposed to significant credit risk, we analyze the counterparty’s financial
condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those
limits on an ongoing basis. We monitor the creditworthiness of significant counterparties through our credit
committee, which utilizes a number of qualitative and quantitative tools to assess credit risk and takes
mitigative actions if deemed necessary. While we believe that our credit risk analysis and monitoring
procedures are reasonable, no amount of analysis can assure performance by our counterparties.
Our Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are
concentrated with a few predominately large customers. This concentrates our credit risk exposure with a
small number of large customers. Amounts due to our Gas Marketing segment are from a diverse group of
entities, including major upstream and midstream energy companies, financial institutions and end-users in
various industries. As natural gas prices continue to remain depressed, certain third-party producers under
our Gas Marketing segment have begun and continue to experience financial distress, which has led to
certain contractual defaults and litigation; however, to date, we have had no material counterparty default
losses. We have initiated several legal actions for breach of contract, collection and related claims against
certain third-party producers that are delinquent in their payment obligations, which have to date resulted in
one default judgment. There have been no collections received to date and and some of the third-party
producers have shut-in their wells and we expect this trend to continue for this segment.
A group of independent West Virginia natural gas producers has filed, but not served on RNG, a complaint in
Marshall County, West Virginia, naming Dominion, certain entities affiliated with Dominion, and RNG as
defendants, alleging various contractual, fiduciary and related claims against the defendants, all of which are
associated with firm transportation contracts entered into by plaintiffs and relating to pipelines owned and
operated by Dominion and its affiliates. At this time, RNG is unable to estimate any potential damages
associated with the claims, but believes the complaint is without merit and intends to vigorously pursue its
defense.
We primarily use financial institutions which are lenders in our revolving credit facility as counterparties for
our derivative financial instruments. Disruption in the credit markets, changes in commodity prices and other
factors may have a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. To date, we have had no
material counterparty default losses from our derivative financial instruments. See Note 4, Derivative
Financial Instruments, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report
for more detail on our derivative financial instruments.

Disclosure of Limitations
Because the information above included only those exposures that existed at June 30, 2016, it does not
consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain
or loss with respect to interest rate and commodity price fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise
during the period, our commodity price risk management strategies at the time, and interest rates and
commodity prices at the time.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e).
Based on the results of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we made no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Information regarding our legal proceedings can be found in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies –
Litigation, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
We face many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating
results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of
our 2015 Form 10-K. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this
report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K,
except for the following:
Ballot initiatives have been proposed in Colorado that would impose draconian limitations on statewide oil
and gas development activities or could result in vastly expanded authority of local governments to regulate
or prohibit oil and natural gas production and development in their jurisdictions. Proponents of two such
initiatives have submitted signatures in an effort to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot in November
2016. Either of these proposals could result in an effective ban on new development operations in areas
where we have significant leasehold and existing production, and one of these proposals might affect
production from existing wells. If either initiative is implemented and survives legal challenge, it would have a
severe impact on our development plans and on our results of operations, financial condition and reserves.
Future initiatives, legislation or regulations may be adopted with similar effects.
As previously disclosed, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development
generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have advanced various alternatives for ballot initiatives which
would result in significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural gas development in the state. Proponents of
two such initiatives have submitted signatures in an effort to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot in
November 2016. The signatures are subject to a verification process to be conducted by the Colorado
Secretary of State. This process could take up to 30 days.  We do not know what the outcome of this process
will be. If approved by the voters of Colorado, the proposals will take effect by the end of 2016.
One of the initiatives, which we refer to as the “local control” initiative, would amend the state constitution to
give city, town and county governments the right to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas development and
production within their boundaries, notwithstanding rules and approvals to the contrary at the state level. If
implemented, this amendment could result in our operations being subject to a variety of different, and
possibly inconsistent, requirements in numerous different jurisdictions within the state of Colorado, and could
prohibit exploration, development and production altogether in some or all of these jurisdictions. This would
likely materially increase our costs and make our operations less efficient, and it could prevent us from
developing and producing significant properties.
 
The other initiative, which we refer to as the “setback” initiative, would amend the state constitution to require
all new oil and gas development facilities to be located at least 2,500 feet away from any occupied structure
or “area of special concern,” broadly defined to include public and community drinking water sources, lakes,
rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, creeks, irrigation canals, riparian areas, playgrounds, permanent
sports fields, amphitheaters, public parks and public open space. The current minimum required setback
between oil and gas wells and occupied structures is generally 500 feet. The Colorado Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission has estimated that implementation of the
36
Table of contents
proposed initiative would make drilling unlawful on approximately 90% of the surface area of the state of
Colorado, and approximately 85% of the surface area of Weld County. If passed, this proposal would
effectively prohibit the vast majority of our planned future drilling activities, and would therefore make it
impossible to continue to pursue our current development plans. This would have a highly material and
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reserves.
Because substantially all of our current operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face
with respect to these proposals, and possible similar future proposals, are greater than those of our
competitors with more geographically diverse operations. We cannot predict the outcome of the potentially
pending initiatives or possible future regulatory developments.
