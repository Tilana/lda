<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Tha</b>iland&#8217;s <b>comments on the report of the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>1. Thailand takes note of the findings and appreciates the recommendations made by 
the Special Rapporteur (SR) on trafficking in persons, especially women and children.  In 
general, these reflect the current situation of trafficking in persons in the country. 
</p>
<p>2. As part of the ongoing dialogue with the SR, Thailand notes that some of the 
recommendations made during the visit and in the SR&#8217;s report have already been taken up 
by the Thai side, including improving service provision and protection for both regular and 
irregular migrant workers; structural and legal reforms in anti-corruption; and expansion of 
the regularization period for migrant workers, among others. Other recommendations will 
be considered in due course.  Thailand will continue the dialogue and remain in close 
coordination with the SR and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>3. Nevertheless, Thailand notes that the report contains inaccuracies or errors 
concerning relevant laws, policies and processes.  Where specific incidents or cases are 
mentioned, the report also provides insufficient information for the relevant Thai agencies 
to take further action.  In this regard, Thailand wishes to provide comments regarding these 
errors of fact or law as well as information on recent developments since the visit of the SR 
in August 2011 as follows:  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary  
</b></p>
<p>4. Comments on the low rate of and delays in prosecution may be misleading.  
&#8220;Prosecution&#8221; must be understood to include several processes, involving case filing for 
</p>
<p>court consideration, court proceedings and court ruling.  We would thus appreciate the SR&#8217;s 
further clarifications on specific processes she sees as causing the delays.  In fact, all 
trafficking in persons cases were filed for prosecution by the Office of the Attorney General 
(OAG) in 2010, with only 1 case dropped in 2011, representing 100 percent and over 95 
percent prosecution rate, respectively.  Moreover, in the Court of First Instance, ruling 
decisions have already been made for all human trafficking cases.  
</p>
<p>5. Comments on insufficient efforts to tackle the root causes and on restrictive 
immigration policies fail to acknowledge the fact that in many countries, including 
Thailand, immigration policies do facilitate regulated migration, while also forming a part 
of national security mechanisms and preventive measures against the exploitation of the 
facilitation of people movement.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology  
</b></p>
<p>6. <b>(No. 2)</b> Corrections need to be made on the venue of field visits and on the agencies 
involved.  In this regard, the SR visited Mae Sot District in Tak Province and also met with 
representatives of the National Human Rights Council (NHRC) in Bangkok. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background: Migration trends in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region 
</b></p>
<p>7. <b>(No. 4)</b> Thailand is aware of migrant workers being recruited by unscrupulous 
brokers.  Therefore, we have fostered close cooperation with neighbouring countries in 
setting up and promoting a legal labour recruitment system.  So far, 106,733 migrant 
workers (74,399 Cambodians, 24,464 Laotians and 7,870 Myanmar nationals) have been 
recruited through bilateral MOUs on labour migration management.  The MOUs provide 
migrant workers with social welfare, rights protection and safe migration.  Bilateral 
meetings with Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar are also convened on a regular basis to 
promote dialogue on policy implementation.   
</p>
<p>8. <b>(No. 5. and Recommendation X)</b>  As of February 2012, 631,773 migrants have 
completed their nationality verification process (NV process).  As for the latest 
developments, the Cabinet approved on 13 February 2012 the extension of the NV process 
until 14 June 2012 for the remaining 300,482 migrant workers from Cambodia, Lao PDR 
and Myanmar, who registered during 2010 and are awaiting the verification.  Included in 
the waiting list are an additional 1,047,612 migrant workers registered during June &#8211; July 
2011, the number of which comprises 253,722 Cambodians, 17,116 Laotians and 686,774 
Myanmarese.  Should the NV process be completed within the extended deadline, there will 
be a total of 1,979,867 regularized migrant workers.  To further facilitate the process, 
Thailand and Myanmar have jointly set up 5 new NV centres which came into operation in 
March 2012 in Chiang Mai, Surat Thani, Samut Sakhon, Samut Prakan Provinces and 
Bangkok.  There are now 8 NV centres in total.  Meanwhile, Thailand and Cambodia have 
set up 2 additional NV centres in Bangkok, located at the Cambodian Embassy and the 
MOL.  
</p>
<p>9. Regarding comments on the high costs and inadequate information on the NV 
process, the government has reduced for the duration of 2011 - 2014, visa application fees 
for migrant workers who have completed the NV process from 2,000 Baht (approximately 
USD 66) to 500 Baht (approximately USD 16).  Information on the NV process including 
the reduced application fee, as well as migrants&#8217; rights, are widely and constantly 
</p>
<p>disseminated to migrant workers through pamphlets (in the Khmer, Laotian and 
Myanmarese languages) and migrant networks. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>(No. 6)</b> Thailand rejects that there is deep-rooted discrimination against migrants.  
Thai laws provide protection to all persons living in the country on an equal basis.  The 
Department of Labour Protection and Welfare (DLPW), Ministry of Labour (MOL) is 
tasked to ensure that migrant workers, notwithstanding their immigration status or 
nationality, receive benefits, safety and social welfare in accordance with the 1998 Labour 
Protection Act.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>11. <b>(No .9)</b> Despite the fact that government agencies have vigorously carried out the 
prevention and suppression of trafficking in persons, there exists a correlation between the 
economic disparities between Thailand and its neighbouring countries and the growing in 
demand for low-skilled labour.  Therefore, other factors, including root causes of migration, 
alternative development options in the countries of origin,  awareness raising campaigns on 
immigration procedures at the destination country and promotion of legal migration, should 
also be taken into consideration in order to project a balanced view on the situation of 
labour exploitation in the country.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>12. <b>(No. 11)</b> Regarding comments on compensation for debt bondage and forced labour 
migrants, Thailand wishes to underline that all migrant workers are entitled to 
compensation according to the 1998 Labour Protection Act.  In 2011, in the Bangkok area 
alone, the DPLW filed 3 cases for compensation.  In the first case, the entrepreneur of a 
jewelry factory was charged for the use of child labour (Laotian national) under 18 years 
old, without paying adequate overtime and minimum wages.  In the second case, a pickle 
business owner in Nonthaburi Province was charged for employing child labour under the 
age of 15 without informing the Labour Inspection Unit and for paying wages lower than 
the minimum rate.  And in the third case, a case was filed against a garment factory seeking 
compensation for 43 Myanmarese migrant workers that were earlier rescued by the Thai 
authorities.  Based on victim identification, it was found that 15 (5 men, 10 women) of the 
rescued migrant workers were victims of trafficking.  The other 28 persons (7 men, 21 
women) were, however, illegal immigrants without work permits.   
</p>
<p>13. In response to comments on the Din Daeng case, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Police Unit raided and rescued Myanmarese labour migrants from a garment factory in Din 
Daeng District on 19 April 2011. Following an investigation, the DPLW fined the 
entrepreneur 781,013.43 Baht (USD 26,033) for monthly wages.  However, since the 
entrepreneur refused to comply, the DPLW is currently in the process of filing a case 
against the entrepreneur. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>(No. 10, 12, 22)</b> Thailand is concerned with the information presented by the SR on 
forced labour in fishing boats, particularly the reference to the use of child labour.  We 
would appreciate it if detailed information and references to these cases could be shared, in 
order to allow relevant agencies to conduct follow-up investigations and bring the 
perpetrators to justice, as well as help prevent further persons at risk from falling prey to 
traffickers.  
</p>
<p>15. The 1998 Labour Protection Act prohibits the use of child labour under 15 years old.  
A newly drafted MOL Regulation, repealing Ministerial Regulation No.10 and due to come 
into effect soon, prohibits the employment of children under 18 years of age to work on 
fishing boats, except  for children at the age of 15 years whose father/mother/parents work 
on that particular fishing boat.  It also provides more protection to workers in sea fishery by 
applying protection to fishing boats with one worker or more (instead of twenty or more 
workers in the previous regulation), whether or not the fishing boats operate in Thai 
territorial waters.  
</p>
<p>16. The National Policy and Plan (NPP) for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour (2009 -2014) also called for a review of the list of hazardous work (for children 
under the age of 18) in accordance with 1998 Labour Protection Act and Ministerial 
Regulation No. 6 to include work in fishing boats, among others.  The list defines the types 
of hazardous work that cannot be performed by children under 18 years of age.  The list is 
awaiting submission to the Cabinet and is expected to be issued during the course of 2012.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition to prioritizing cooperation with Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, the 
Thai government is currently considering the proposal of the Government of Bangladesh to 
establish an MOU on Recruitment and Employment of Labour in the Fishery Industry in 
light of possible bilateral cooperation to help solve the labour shortage. Such an 
arrangement will further help ensure migrant workers&#8217; possession of seaman books and 
</p>
<p>protect migrant labour against debt bondage and illegal brokers.   
</p>
<p>18. <b>(No. 15)</b> Investigation of the case in which 15 Vietnamese women were rescued and 
8 alleged offenders were arrested (4 Taiwanese, 1 Chinese and 3 Myanmarese) is ongoing.  
The Thai and Vietnamese authorities worked in close coordination to assist the return of all 
Vietnamese women. This was the only case of this nature thus far identified. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative, policy and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>(No. 17)</b> As a signatory to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime (UNTOC), the relevant Thai agencies are expediting internal legal processes for the 
ratification of the UNTOC, including in particular passing of the draft Anti-Transnational 
Organized Crime Act.  Thailand will organize an inter-agency seminar and a Workshop on 
the Ratification and Implementation of UNTOC and its two Protocols in 2012 under the 
auspices of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons &amp; Related 
Transnational Crime.  These activities aim to explore ways to support countries, such as 
Thailand, that in the process of signing or ratifying the UNTOC in pushing forward their 
respective national processes, overcoming potential obstacles, and to exchange experiences 
between government agencies and international organizations, such as IOM and UNODC.  
</p>
<p>20. <b>(No. 18 </b>&#8211;<b> 23)</b> In addition to legislation related to anti-human trafficking mentioned 
in the report, it is pertinent to mention other significant legal measures.  A case in point is 
the 1979 Immigration Act, which is an important instrument in preventing illegal entry and 
in undermining trafficking networks.  
</p>
<p>21. <b>(No. 21)</b> In clarification of inaccurate references to legal measures against forced 
prostitution, the 1996 Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act, in fact, criminalizes 
the detention, deprivation of liberty, assault, threat of force imposed on another person to 
commit prostitution with a punishment of imprisonment.  It also punishes the owner, 
supervisor or manager of a prostitution business, while providing protection for victims of 
forced prostitution from punishment via a system of victim referral to centres for protection 
and occupational development.  
</p>
<p>22. <b>(No. 22)</b> Regarding the role of the 1998 Labour Protection Act in protecting labour 
in the informal sector, the Labour Protection Act prescribes guidelines on working 
conditions and environment, types of hazardous work, wages and leave entitlement, and 
sanitation.  Its provisions also include protection for full time workers in the agricultural 
sector.  Furthermore, the Social Security Act of 1990 provides overarching protection for 
workers in the informal sector, while the Ministerial Regulation on protection of labour in 
the agricultural sector of 2004 protects seasonal workers.  The draft Ministerial Regulation 
on Domestic Service will prohibit children under the age of 15 years from working as 
domestic workers, and provide details on suitable working conditions, wages and leave 
entitlements, as well as protection from discrimination and sexual harassment.  
</p>
<p>23. <b>(No. 23)</b> Instead of mentioning only the Child Protection Act (2003), other measures 
of the country to protect Children&#8217;s rights, particularly the right to education and birth 
</p>
<p>registration, should also be noted.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Identification of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>(No. 32, 34)</b> Inaccuracies could be found in the mention of the role of the Royal 
Thai Police (RTP).  Instead of assuming the role of the sole victim identification agency, 
the RTP collaborates with other agencies in what is known as a multi-disciplinary team to 
identify victims. Composed of police officers, social workers, IGOs and NGOs, doctors and 
psychologists, among others, the multi-disciplinary team works together to ensure fair 
treatment and protection for victims.  Victim protection mechanisms reach out to both at-
risk persons and vulnerable groups.  Victims under protection are accommodated at 77 
temporary shelters and 9 Protection and Occupational Development Centres throughout the 
country. They are also guaranteed access to legal and judicial procedures services, 
interpretation facilities, medical treatment and return and reintegration assistance.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>25. <b>(No. 33)</b> The comment on deep-rooted corruption at all levels of law enforcement is 
too sweeping and an unfair generalisation.  Combating corruption has long been recognized 
as a significant step towards sustainable development and, in turn, towards the elimination 
of human trafficking.  Thailand ratified the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) 
in March 2011.  The government has tasked 3 agencies to implement obligations under the 
Convention: 1) Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) for overseeing 
the implementation; 2) Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) for asset recovery; and, 3) 
Office of the Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) for cases involving 
public officials below the level of Director and local administration.  Thailand is currently 
undertaking legal and structural reforms in compliance with the UNCAC, which will 
enhance the effectiveness of actions against corrupt officials.  
</p>
<p>26. <b>(No. 36)</b> On labour inspection, the MOL, through the Department of Welfare and 
Labour Protection (DWLP) and the Department of Employment (DOE), conducts labour 
inspection in an integrated manner with the RTP, the Ministry of Interior (MOI), the 
MSDHS, and the military.  
</p>
<p>27. Labour inspections conducted by the DWLP targets all employees irrespective of 
their nationality and focuses on two aspects: employment agreement and working condition 
according to the 1998 Labour Protection Act; and occupational safety and health of the 
2011 Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Act. In 2011, 5,299 establishments 
with 158,381 migrant workers were inspected. 13,891 out of 16,334 employees who filed 
petitions for benefits under the 1998 Labour Protection Act in 2011, received compensation 
of 378,225,550.27 Baht (USD 12,607,518) in total.   
</p>
<p>28. Meanwhile, the official inspections conducted by the DOE focuses on 
establishments employing or citizens providing accommodation for or illicit networks 
smuggling illegal migrant workers, particularly from Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, in 
accordance with the 1978 Alien Employment Act and the 1979 Immigration Act. In 2011, 
29,434 establishments with 237,016 migrant workers and 967 employers were charged as a 
result of the inspections.  
</p>
<p>29. Comments on the MOL&#8217;s unwillingness to intervene in situations of trafficking in 
migrant workers are unfair.  Once a labour inspector finds such a case, the RTP and the 
MSDHS will lead a multi-disciplinary team in conducting identification of potential 
trafficked victims. The DOE will assist migrant workers in filing for compensation from 
employers.  In 2011, 15,171 employees filed petitions to call for their benefits according to 
the Labour Protection Act while 12,253 cases were considered leading to a total 
compensation of 240,569,960 Baht (USD 8,018,999) 
</p>
<p>30. <b>(No. 37)</b> Comments on the lack of appropriate infrastructures and services to 
facilitate victim identification should recognize the difference between hotline detection 
and victim screening.  Prior to the conclusion of the victim identification process, the 
screening mechanism requires well-trained officials to present affirmative and sound 
arguments and a thorough evaluation of situation drawing upon evidential proof. Moreover, 
the MSDHS has equipped the hotline Phone No. 1300 with interpretation resources in 
collaboration with the IOM by adding Myanmarese interpreters, through a teleconference 
system, to the existing services in 3 languages (Thai, English, and Laotian). 
</p>
<p>31. In addition, the Operational Centres of the MOL were set up in 3 hot spot provinces 
where migrants predominantly work (Ranong, Tak and Samut Sakhon Provinces) with 
interpretation service to facilitate communication between migrant workers and authorities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Protection, recovery and reintegration of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>(No. 38, 40)</b> On the standards of victim assistance and interpretation service 
accessibility, Thailand has put in place interpreters for the Laotian, Khmer and 
Myanmarese languages, notably in the 9 main Protection and Occupational Training 
Centres, to help social workers facilitate interviews with migrant workers.  Legal aid, 
medical services, and non formal education from the Ministry of Education are also 
provided in the shelters.  
</p>
<p>33. The allegation of detention of trafficked victims in police cells for case prosecution 
is inaccurate.  Once migrant workers are identified as trafficked victims, they will be 
assisted by social workers and provided accommodation at shelters while they go through a 
3 month rehabilitation process and pre-trial deposition.  For those screened out and 
considered illegal immigrants, they will be deported at their point of entry at the earliest 
opportunity.  
</p>
<p>34. <b>(No. 41)</b> Comments on the failure of media to respect trafficking victims&#8217; privacy 
may reflect a misunderstanding.  The Anti-Trafficking in Persons (ATIP) Act prohibits the 
publication or promotion of information and pictures of trafficking victims.  There is no 
media, as of present, which has transgressed the said provision.      
</p>
<p>35. <b>(No. 46)</b> On prolonged stay and delayed return, the return of trafficking victims is 
evaluated on the basis of a victim-centered approach.  Relevant agencies have to complete 
the process of evaluating psychological readiness, pending witness hearing, filing for 
compensation, and tracing for and contacting victim&#8217;s family. This process is crucial to 
prevent re-victimization and ensure safe return and reintegration.  
</p>
<p>36. <b>(No. 47)</b> On professional staffing at Kredtrakarn shelter, it should be noted that the 
Laotian language is very similar to Thai, and thus the need for interpreters to assist Laotian 
residents may be less. Regarding on-site medical services, the government has put in place 
nurses and psychologists on a 24-hour service basis.  Part-time doctors will also check up 
on victims once a week.  Besides a public health centre in the proximity of the shelter, 
trafficking victims in need of emergency treatment will be referred within 15 minutes to 
one of the many hospitals nearby.   
</p>
<p>37. <b>(No. 48)</b> On the implementation of section 37 of the ATIP Act, the MOI issued, in 
February 2011, a Ministerial Regulation on Permission for victims of trafficking in persons 
to stay in the country.  In November 2011, 8 trafficking victims (7 Myanmarese and 1 
Chinese) were granted a renewable permission for temporary stay in Thailand for a period 
of 6 months.  In addition, the other 14 persons (12 Laotians and 2 Cambodians) were 
granted a temporary stay permit in January 2012.  
</p>
<p>38. As for trafficking victims&#8217; right to work, the MOL has, on 29 February 2012, issued 
the Ministerial Regulation on occupations allowed for trafficking victims.  These 
occupations comprise domestic workers and labourers, including at least 24 types of labour 
work/industries.  Concurrently, the MSDHS is establishing guidelines for the issuance of 
work permits to enable the MOL to fully implement the Ministerial Regulation.  
</p>
<p>39. Despite the fact that Section 37 has not yet been fully implemented, in practice, 
trafficking victims in two shelters (the Protection and Occupational Development Centre 
for male victims in Pathumthani and Ranong Provinces), are already allowed to work in 
</p><p>2011.  Approximately 60 male trafficked victims currently work outside the shelters during 
the day and return to the shelters at night.  In addition, residents at the shelters are offered 
vocational training which includes dress-making, beautician training, traditional weaving, 
wickerwork, arts and crafts, cooking, batik painting and traditional massage.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> F. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>(No. 55)</b> While training is being scaled up, comments on a low prosecution rate due 
to the lack of adequate training of prosecutors are unjustified. During the visit, the SR had 
productive discussions with representatives from the OAG on the training of prosecutors in 
cooperation with the ASEAN Regional Trafficking in Persons Project (ARTIP) and the US 
Government.  Over 550 prosecutors and 100 government officials have received such 
training to upgrade their capacity.  Moreover, the OAG published the first trafficking in 
persons prosecution guidelines for the use of prosecutors nationwide.  
</p>
<p>41. On prosecutors using other related legislation instead of the ATIP Act, there are two 
factors that must be borne in mind. First, the &#8220;no crime without law&#8221; principle is applied on 
trafficking crime committed prior to the enactment of the ATIP Act.  Secondly, as the 
trafficking crime is multi-faceted in nature, this has resulted in the employment of other 
related legislation in parallel with the ATIP Act.  
</p>
<p>42. <b>(No. 56) </b>Regarding comments on the delays in prosecution and conclusions of trials, 
Thailand has put in place deposition and pre-trial discovery in the Court of First Instance to 
allow trafficking victims to return home in a timely fashion.  However, Thailand is bound 
by its obligations to international practice to ensure the safety and security of victims.  
Their return requires nationality confirmation, household registration and risk assessment, 
which may take some time for the verification of victim&#8217;s origin in his/her home country, as 
earlier clarified in paragraph 25.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Redress 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>(No. 57) </b>On difficulties in seeking compensation, prosecutors and police officers are 
required to inform trafficking victims of their rights in seeking compensation.  
Interpretation service is also provided during the course of investigation.  
</p>
<p>44. <b>(No. 58) </b>On compensation cases filed under the ATIP Act, Thailand provides 
training for all prosecutors on civil proceedings for compensation solicitation on a regular 
basis.  A compensation case filed under the ATIP Act may be channeled through three 
possibilities: 1) the victim shall be asked whether to avail himself/herself of the possibility 
for civil case compensation; 2) compensation under the ATIP Act shall be submitted 
through the MSDHS; and, 3) other civil proceedings, which do not duplicate with filing for 
compensation under the ATIP Act (since Thai law does not support the practice of 
&#8220;ambulance chasing&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>45. <b>(No. 59) </b>Seeking compensation in criminal proceedings by the trafficked persons 
may be done under the &#8220;Criminal Procedure Code,&#8221; not the Penal Code.  During 2009 &#8211; 
2011, the Department of Rights and Liberties Protection, the Ministry of Justice has filed 
altogether 53 cases for compensation, of which 17 cases were approved, 22 are under 
consideration of the committee, while 14 were rejected due to lack of evidence and ill 
intention in entering the country. Victims were awarded compensation ranging from 
400,000 to 600,000 Baht (USD 13,333&#8211;20,000) per person. In addition, the OAG has 
started, since 2011, filing for compensation for trafficking victims in sexual exploitation 
cases under the ATIP Act.  
</p>
<p>46. <b>(No. 60)</b> On the comment that the rate of success in labour proceedings is higher 
than that in trafficking crime, Thailand wishes to underline the different nature between 
labour laws and the anti-trafficking law.  Labour laws are aimed at promoting good 
relations between employers and employees.  Hence, compromising between the two 
parties, including paying compensation, is commonly found as a way to settle disputes.   </p>

</p>
<p><b> H. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>(No. 62)</b> Comments on the deportation of trafficked victims may reflect a 
misunderstanding.  Prior to their return, trafficked victims must go through an evaluation 
process as stated in paragraph 25.  The return of trafficked victims facilitated by the Thai 
Immigration Bureau (TIB) is upon request and through coordination between the MSDHS 
and local Myanmar authorities to ensure the safety and security of the returnees.  At present 
the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) has collaborated with the Myanmar 
government in the role of  border guard force.  Thus, should there be concern about security 
issues for returning migrants, Myanmar authorities would investigate the case.  For 
comments on temporary stay, please refer to paragraph 27.  
</p>
<p>48. <b>(No. 64)</b> On the lack of effective recruitment regulations, please see paragraph 7.  
</p>
<p>49. <b>(No. 66)</b> Comments on the restriction of the rights of ethnic minorities and children 
of irregular migrants requires further clarification.  Thailand reaffirms the rights to 
education and access to medical and health services for all, including the children of ethnic
