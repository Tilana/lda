<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, 
Asma Jahangir </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 4/10 of 30 March 2007, recalls all resolutions 
on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief 
that have been adopted by the General Assembly and by the Commission on Human Rights and 
requests the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief to report on this issue to the 
Human Rights Council at its sixth session. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur gives an overview of the mandate&#8217;s issues of 
concern according to the categories of her framework for communications. This structure enables 
her to summarize the pressing issues, as analysed during the 21 years of mandate practice, with 
regard to intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur highlights worrying situations where the freedom to adopt, change 
or renounce a religion or belief has been infringed, for example when State agents try to convert, 
reconvert or prevent the conversion of persons. While the right to freedom to worship is not 
limited to members of registered religious communities, many believers belonging to religious 
minorities are not allowed to worship or conduct any religious activities without State approval 
or prior registration. Since believers are in a situation of special vulnerability whenever they find 
themselves in places of worship, States should pay increased attention to attacks on places of 
worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such attacks are properly prosecuted and tried. 
Women, persons deprived of their liberty, refugees, children, minorities and migrant workers can 
be identified as particularly vulnerable groups with regard to their freedom of religion or belief. 
The right to life and the right to liberty are also frequently infringed as evidenced by numerous 
cases of killings and arbitrary detention for reasons of religion or belief. States have to ensure 
that their constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of 
freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the 
provision of effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom of religion or belief is 
violated. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, States should devise proactive strategies in order to prevent such 
violations. Education could serve as an essential tool in creating a genuine human rights culture 
in society. Schools may be a suitable place for learning about peace, understanding and tolerance 
among individuals, groups and nations in order to develop respect for pluralism. In addition, 
inter-religious and intra-religious dialogue is vital for the prevention of conflicts. Such a 
dialogue should not only include religious leaders but could also involve initiatives at the 
grass-roots level. Teachers, children and students could benefit from voluntary opportunities of 
meetings and exchanges with their counterparts of different religions or beliefs, either in their 
home country or abroad. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 4/10 
of 30 March 2007, in which the Council recalled all resolutions on the elimination of all forms of 
intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief that have been adopted by the 
General Assembly and by the Commission on Human Rights and requested the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief to report on this issue to the Council at its 
sixth session. 
</p>
<p>2. In March 2007, the Special Rapporteur has presented her annual report to the 
fourth session of the Council (A/HRC/4/21) and will shortly submit her interim report to the 
Third Committee of the General Assembly which will also include an update of her mandate 
activities. Against this background, the Special Rapporteur takes advantage of the present report 
to focus on substantive questions and intends to give an overview of the mandate&#8217;s issues of 
concern according to the categories of her framework for communications. This structure enables 
her to summarize the pressing issues, as analysed during the 21 years of mandate practice, with 
regard to intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>3. The framework for communications assembles and categorizes the international human 
rights standards pertaining to freedom of religion or belief. These standards can be found in 
covenants, treaties, general comments, declarations and resolutions ratified or adopted by States 
or competent United Nations bodies. The full text of the framework for communications was 
annexed to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last report to the Commission on Human Rights 
(E/CN.4/2006/5, annex) and enables her to determine which elements, if any, of the mandate are 
raised by the allegations received. In the meantime, the Special Rapporteur has developed this 
framework into an online digest which illustrates the international standards with pertinent 
excerpts of the mandate-holders&#8217; findings since 1986 according to the substantive categories. 
The online digest is available on the website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights.<b>1</b> The Special Rapporteur used the framework&#8217;s categories also in many of her 
observations in the latest report on the summary of cases transmitted to Governments and replies 
received (A/HRC/4/21/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>4. In her conclusions and recommendations contained in the present report, the Special 
Rapporteur assesses the situation with regard to freedom of religion or belief worldwide. She 
urges all States and non-State actors to abide by the applicable international human rights 
standards and she recommends preventive measures in order to ensure a peaceful coexistence of 
the members of various religions and beliefs as well as non-believers. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  OVERVIEW OF THE MANDATE&#8217;S ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to provide a <i>tour d&#8217;horizon</i> of the mandate&#8217;s issues of 
concern according to the categories of her framework for communications. The first category 
deals with elements of the right to freedom of religion or belief and the right to manifest one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>religion or belief. The second category covers discrimination in relation to freedom of religion or 
belief. The third category deals with vulnerable groups, including women, children, refugees, 
members of minorities and persons deprived of their liberty. The fourth covers situations where 
the right to freedom of religion intersects with violations of other human rights, such as the right 
to freedom of expression and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. The fifth category deals with cross-cutting issues including 
international provisions on limitations and derogations. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>6. Human Rights Council resolution 4/10 states that &#8220;religion or belief, for those who profess 
either, is one of the fundamental elements in their conception of life and that freedom of religion 
or belief should be fully respected and guaranteed&#8221;. Due to the problem of finding a satisfactory 
definition of the &#8220;protected religion or belief&#8221;, the pertinent international human rights standards 
provide for a broad view of these concepts. Consequently, freedom of religion or belief is not 
limited in its application to traditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional 
characteristics or practices analogous to those of traditional religions. Furthermore, it has been 
established that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
&#8220;protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion 
or belief&#8221;.<b>2</b> The Special Rapporteur follows the approach of interpreting the scope of 
application of the freedom of religion or belief in a large sense, bearing in mind that 
manifestations of this freedom may be subject to such limitations as are prescribed by law and 
are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>7. Throughout her mandate, the Special Rapporteur received numerous allegations that an 
individual&#8217;s freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief had been infringed 
whereas article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) provides that the right 
to freedom of thought, conscience and religion &#8220;includes freedom to change his religion or 
belief&#8221;. Furthermore, article 18 of ICCPR recognizes the right &#8220;to have or to adopt a religion or 
belief of his choice&#8221; and the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance 
and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (1981 Declaration) makes general provision 
for the &#8220;freedom to have a religion or whatever belief of his choice&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
would like to emphasize that the variety of formulations used to refer to the acknowledgement 
and development of religious freedom do not amount to a denial of the right to change religion. 
In the same line of reasoning, the Human Rights Committee observed in its general comment 
No. 22 that &#8220;the freedom to &#8216;have or to adopt&#8217; a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom 
to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#8217;s current religion or belief with 
another or to adopt atheistic views, as well as the right to retain one&#8217;s religion or belief&#8221;.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>8. Violations and limitations of the freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or belief 
are unacceptable and still occur too often. The Special Rapporteur has identified four broad types 
of situations in this regard: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Situations, where State agents try to convert, reconvert or prevent the conversion of 
persons, for example by threatening to kill them or their relatives, depriving them of 
their liberty, torturing and ill-treating them or threatening to dismiss them from their 
jobs; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Situations, where religious conversion is prohibited by law and punished accordingly, 
e.g. through arrests for &#8220;apostasy&#8221; charges, suspension of all contracts and inheritance 
rights, the annulment of marriages, loss of property or the removal of children; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Situations, where members of majority religious groups seek to convert or reconvert 
members of religious minorities by violent means, including cases where believers 
attack members of minority religious groups or their places of worship with the aim of 
converting them; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Situations, where so-called &#8220;unethical&#8221; conversions have been reported, i.e. where 
members of religious groups try to convert other people by &#8220;unethical&#8221; means such as 
the promise of material benefit or by taking advantage of the vulnerable situation of the 
person whose conversion is sought. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, it would not 
be advisable to criminalize non-violent acts performed by non-State actors in the 
context of the propagation of their religion, because that may pave the way for 
persecution of religious minorities. She recommends that cases of alleged &#8220;unethical&#8221; 
conversion be addressed on a case-by-case basis, examining the context and 
circumstances in each individual situation and dealt with in accordance with the 
common criminal and civil legislation. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the 
opinion that the adoption of laws criminalizing <i>in abstracto</i> certain acts leading to 
&#8220;unethical&#8221; conversion should be avoided, in particular where these laws could apply 
even in the absence of a complaint by the converted person. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Freedom from coercion 
</b></p>
<p>9. Article 18 (2) of ICCPR states that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to coercion which would 
impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice&#8221;. The term &#8220;coercion&#8221; is 
to be broadly interpreted and includes the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions by a 
State to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations, 
to recant their religion or belief or to convert as well as policies or practices having the same 
intention or effect. Consequently, a law prohibiting conversion would constitute a State policy 
aiming at influencing individual&#8217;s desire to have or adopt a religion or belief and is therefore not 
acceptable under human rights law. Furthermore, each State also has the positive obligation of 
ensuring that the persons on their territory and under their jurisdiction, including members of 
religious minorities, can practise the religion or belief of their choice free of coercion and fear. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>10. Whereas the choice of religion or belief is part of the <i>forum internum</i>, which allows for no 
limitations, the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be subject to such limitations 
as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others. The following subcategories deal with facets of the 
right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief in greater detail. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Freedom to worship 
</b>11. The freedom to worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief and the 
freedom to make, acquire and use the necessary articles and materials related to the rites or 
customs of a religion or belief is also frequently infringed. Believers, particularly those 
belonging to religious minorities, are sometimes not allowed to worship or conduct any religious 
activities without State approval or prior registration. The Special Rapporteur wishes to 
emphasize that the right to freedom to worship is not limited to members of registered religious 
communities, since registration should not be a precondition for practising one&#8217;s religion, but 
only for the acquisition of a legal personality and related benefits. 
</p>
<p>12. However, the freedom to worship is not unlimited. For example religious rituals which 
involve a human sacrifice would obviously violate the fundamental rights of others and 
consequently these rituals may be prohibited by law. Women seem to be particularly 
vulnerable to become victims of cruel rituals such as the immolation of widows 
(see E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.2, paras. 152-154). 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Places of worship 
</b>13. The Special Rapporteur receives a significant number of allegations related to cases where 
places of worship or religious properties had been attacked or otherwise subjected to other forms 
of restriction. Places of worship, cemeteries, monasteries or community headquarters have more 
than a material significance for the religious community attached to them. Believers are in a 
situation of special vulnerability whenever they find themselves in places of worship, given the 
nature of their activities. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States should 
pay increased attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such 
attacks are properly prosecuted and tried. Furthermore, attacks or other forms of restriction on 
places of worship or other religious sites and shrines in many cases violate the right not only of a 
single individual, but the rights of a group of individuals forming the community that is attached 
to the place in question. In its resolution 55/254 on &#8220;Protection of Religious Sites&#8221; the 
General Assembly encourages all States to promote &#8220;a culture of tolerance and respect for the 
diversity of religions and for religious sites, which represent an important aspect of the collective 
heritage of humankind&#8221;. However, places of worship have also been misused by non-State actors 
for illegitimate purposes, including as a depository for weapons or as a hideout for holding 
hostages. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that these actions by themselves may 
desecrate the place of worship. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Religious symbols 
</b>14. The concepts of worship, observance and practice of religion or belief extend to the display 
of symbols and they may also include customs such as the wearing of distinctive clothing or 
head coverings. The activities of the mandate have revealed two distinct issues of concern in this 
regard. On the one hand, many believers in various parts of the world are prevented from 
identifying themselves through the display of religious symbols, while on the other hand people 
in other countries are required to display religious symbols in public. The fundamental objective 
should be to safeguard both the positive freedom of religion or belief by voluntarily displaying 
religious symbols, and also the negative freedom from being forced to display religious symbols. 
In her 2006 annual report, the Special Rapporteur has formulated a set of general criteria, 
including &#8220;neutral indicators&#8221; and &#8220;aggravating indicators&#8221;, in order to evaluate - from a human 
rights law perspective - legislative and administrative actions which restrict or prohibit the 
display of religious symbols (E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 51-60). 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Observance of holidays and days of rest 
</b>15. The freedom to observe days of rest and to celebrate holidays and ceremonies in 
accordance with the precepts of one&#8217;s religion or belief is particularly significant since it allows 
believers to perform a series of ceremonies and religious customs that often have spiritual 
connotations. With regard to the situation in several countries, the Special Rapporteur has noted 
a number of good examples of legislation granting recognition to the religious holidays of 
various communities, allowing exemptions on religious grounds in schools or guaranteeing the 
right to conscientious objection for reasons of belief. Furthermore, religious holidays are often an 
opportunity to invite the leaders of other communities and get to know them, their cultures and 
their religions, as well as to promote interfaith dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Appointing clergy 
</b>16. The right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief also includes the freedom to 
train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders. Religious communities have 
varied hierarchical structures and different approaches in designating their leaders. Undue 
interference in the training of religious leaders can lead to a shortage of appropriate leaders. 
Furthermore, some States encroach on the appointment procedure of religious leaders or require 
approval by the authorities for certain promotions within religious groups. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the freedom of religion or belief also protects the 
conduct by religious groups of their basic affairs, such as the freedom to choose their religious 
leaders, priests and teachers.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Teaching and disseminating materials (including missionary activity) 
</b>17. The question of missionary activities and other forms of propagating one&#8217;s religion has 
been at the centre of the mandate on freedom of religion or belief since its inception in 1986. 
Many communications sent by the mandate-holders pertain to alleged infringements of the right 
to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications or to teach a religion or belief in places 
suitable for these purposes. Pertinent examples include censorship, bans, confiscation and 
destruction of religious literature, even though these materials did not advocate national, racial or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence according to 
article 20 (2) of ICCPR. The second mandate-holder, Abdelfattah Amor, has noted that 
&#8220;proselytism is itself inherent in religion, which explains its legal status in international 
instruments and in the 1981 Declaration&#8221; (A/51/542/Add.1, para. 12). The Special Rapporteur 
has also held that missionary activity is accepted as a legitimate expression of religion or belief 
and she has emphasized that missionary activity cannot be considered a violation of the freedom 
of religion and belief of others if all involved parties are adults able to reason on their own and if 
there is no relation of dependency or hierarchy between the missionaries and the objects of the 
missionary activities. 
</p>
<p><b>(g) The right of parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children 
</b>18. The liberty of parents or legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of 
their children in conformity with their own convictions is not always respected. Some small 
children are denied access to the religious education in accordance with the choice of their 
parents or are even compelled to receive religious instruction against their wishes. The Final 
Document of the 2001 International Consultative Conference on School Education in Relation to 
Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and Non-Discrimination notes, inter alia, &#8220;the right of 
parents, families, legal guardians and other legally recognized caregivers to choose schools for 
their children, and to ensure their religious and/or moral education in conformity with their own 
convictions, and with such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by 
the competent authorities, in a manner consistent with the procedures followed in the State for 
the application of its legislation and in accordance with the best interest of the child&#8221;. 
Furthermore, children from families of religious minorities are sometimes forced, against the 
wishes of their families and perhaps against their own will, to marry members of the majority 
religion and to adopt their faith. The girl child appears to be particularly vulnerable to such 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>(h) Registration 
</b>19. The Special Rapporteur has noted that domestic registration requirements appear often to 
be used as a means to limit the right of freedom of religion or belief of members of certain 
religious communities. However, freedom of religion or belief is not limited to members of 
registered religious communities. Consequently, registration should not be a precondition for 
practising one&#8217;s religion, but may only be appropriate for the acquisition of a legal personality 
and related benefits. In the latter case, registration procedures should be easy and quick and not 
depend on extensive formal requirements in terms of the number of members or the time a 
particular religious group has existed. No religious group should be empowered to decide about 
the registration of another religious group. Finally, re-registration requirements that operate 
retroactively or fail to protect vested interests should also be questioned and an adequate 
transition period should be envisaged concerning the application of new registration rules. 
</p>
<p><b>(i) Communicate with individuals and communities on religious matters at the national 
and international level 
</b></p>
<p>20. Persons belonging to minorities have the right to establish and maintain, without any 
discrimination, free and peaceful contacts with other members of their group and with persons </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>belonging to other minorities, as well as contacts across frontiers with citizens of other States to 
whom they are related by national or ethnic, religious or linguistic ties. However, the freedom to 
communicate in matters of religion and belief at the national and international levels has been 
jeopardized in some cases. In order to avoid any form of discrimination, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that no mention of religion should be included on passports, on identity card 
application forms or on any other administrative documents. 
</p>
<p><b>(j) Establish and maintain charitable and humanitarian institutions/solicit and receive 
funding 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Commission on Human Rights urged States to ensure that, in accordance with 
appropriate national legislation and in conformity with international human rights law, the 
freedom for all persons and members of groups to establish and maintain religious, charitable or 
humanitarian institutions is fully respected and protected. However, on a domestic level, some 
religious communities are not authorized to extend their religious activities into social, health or 
educational matters. Moreover, their right to solicit and receive voluntary financial and other 
contributions from individuals and institutions is sometimes restricted and the registration 
procedure is used to prevent funding from abroad. The right to establish such institutions and to 
receive funding is not unlimited, however, any limitations imposed must be prescribed by law 
and must be necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of others, e.g. in order to prevent that such institutions are misused for advancing 
their cause through militant means and violence. 
</p>
<p><b>(k) Conscientious objection 
</b>22. Many individuals have claimed the right to refuse to perform military service 
(conscientious objection) on the basis that such right derives from their freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion. The first mandate-holder, Mr. Angelo Vidal d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro, 
developed a set of criteria concerning cases of conscientious objection (E/CN.4/1992/52, 
para. 185). Conscientious objectors should be exempted from combat but could be required to 
perform comparable alternative service of various kinds, which should be compatible with their 
reasons for conscientious objection, should such service exist in their country. To avoid 
opportunism, it would be acceptable if this service were at least as onerous as military service, 
but not so onerous as to constitute a punishment for the objector. They could also be asked to 
perform alternative service useful to the public interest, which may be aimed at social 
improvement, development or promotion of international peace and understanding. 
Conscientious objectors should be given full information about their rights and responsibilities 
and about the procedures to be followed when seeking recognition as conscientious objectors, 
bearing in mind that application for the status of conscientious objector has to be made within a 
specific time frame. The decision concerning their status should be made, when possible, by an 
impartial tribunal set up for that purpose or a by a regular civilian court, with the application of 
all the legal safeguards provided for in international human rights instruments. There should 
always be a right to appeal to an independent, civilian judicial body. The decision-making body 
should be entirely separate from the military authorities and the conscientious objector should be 
granted a hearing, and be entitled to legal representation and to call relevant witnesses. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>23. Issues of discrimination have been at the heart of the mandate since its inception in 1986, 
when the mandate was still entitled &#8220;Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance&#8221;. The 
framework for communications tries to analyse the various aspects involved in discrimination 
according to the subcategories of discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, inter-religious 
discrimination, tolerance and the issue of State religions. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief/inter-religious  
discrimination/tolerance 
</b></p>
<p>24. The mandate practice throughout the past 21 years illustrates the importance of effective 
legal remedies for victims of intolerance or of discrimination based on religion or belief. There 
is plenty of evidence of inter-religious discrimination and violence; however, examples of 
intra-faith intolerance and discriminatory attitudes towards non-believers or dissenting 
individuals should also not be forgotten. The Special Rapporteur observed that there is a need to 
create better harmony between religious communities to enable them to live side by side and in 
mutual respect. Efforts to promote inter-religious dialogue at all levels should not only be 
praised, but also actively supported by Governments. Religious leaders regularly organize 
high-level meetings at the international level to promote inter-religious dialogue and the Special 
Rapporteur encourages more intergovernmental dialogue on the issues relating to her mandate, 
so as to increase the involvement of the relevant policymakers. Harmony between and among 
religious communities can only flourish if Governments remain committed to the promotion of 
freedom of religion or belief in a neutral and balanced manner. 
</p>
<p>25. In order to promote ideals of tolerance and understanding, education on international and 
national standards in respect of freedom of religion and belief should be included in school and 
university curricula and teaching staff must receive proper training in this regard. Similarly, 
education should be aimed at inculcating, from early childhood, a spirit of tolerance and respect 
for the spiritual values of others. The Madrid Final Document (see E/CN.4/2002/73, appendix) 
may serve as useful guidance for educational policies aimed at strengthening the promotion and 
protection of human rights, eradicating prejudices and conceptions incompatible with freedom of 
religion or belief and ensuring respect for and acceptance of pluralism and diversity in the field 
of religion or belief as well as the right not to receive religious instruction inconsistent with his 
or her conviction. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  State religion 
</b></p>
<p>26. In its general comment No. 22, the Human Rights Committee states &#8220;that the fact that a 
religion is recognized as a State religion or that it is established as official or traditional or that 
its followers comprise the majority of the population, shall not result in any impairment of the 
enjoyment of any of the rights under the Covenant, including articles 18 and 27, nor in any 
discrimination against adherents to other religions or non-believers&#8221;. The notion of an official or 
State religion must never be exploited at the expense of the rights of minorities and the rights 
linked to citizenship. Formal or legal distinctions between different kinds of religious or 
faith-based communities carry the seed of discrimination insofar as such a distinction in their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>status implies a difference in rights or treatment. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur has 
voiced her concerns that the legalization of such a distinction between different categories of 
religion is liable to pave the way for future violations of the right to freedom of religion or for 
discrimination on the basis of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>27. It is possible to identify within the framework of the mandate a number of groups whose 
members find themselves in a vulnerable situation: women, persons deprived of their liberty, 
refugees, children, minorities and migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Women 
</b></p>
<p>28. Women are in a particularly vulnerable situation as evidenced by numerous urgent appeals 
and allegation letters sent by various Special Rapporteurs. Since intolerance and discrimination 
is often applied with regard to multiple identities of the victim or group of victims, many women 
suffer from aggravated discrimination with regard to their religious, ethnic and sexual identities. 
A comprehensive thematic study by the second mandate holder (E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.2) lists the 
different types of discrimination against women, such as practices that are harmful to the health 
of women, discrimination against women within the family, attacks on the right to life, honour 
killings, and attacks on their dignity, such as restrictions on the education of women or their 
exclusion from certain functions. Furthermore, this study reveals that there are many cultural 
practices to be found among peoples having many diverse religious traditions. While many 
religions have combated cultural practices which undermine the status of women, some harmful 
practices such as female genital mutilation are perpetuated in the name of religion or imputed to 
religion. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the importance of ensuring that the right 
to freedom of religion or belief adds to the values of human rights and does not unintentionally 
become an instrument for undermining freedoms. Women all too often are required to negotiate 
with male religious leaders and with other members of their own communities in order to 
exercise their full human rights. Women themselves have to be empowered since they continue 
to be largely excluded from the decision-making process within most religious communities. 
Similarly, at a time when much emphasis is put on inter-religious dialogue, the absence of 
women&#8217;s voices from that dialogue is striking. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Persons deprived of their liberty 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur has been receiving a growing number of reports of alleged 
violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief of persons deprived of their liberty, either 
as prisoners or in the context of an armed conflict. Because the opportunity to practise one&#8217;s 
religion in private or in public might easily be restricted by the fact of detention, the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners make specific reference to the need for prison 
authorities to allow prisoners to observe their religion and to have access to a minister of that 
religion. In the context of an armed conflict, too, there are obligations to respect the religion and 
religious practices of prisoners of war, interned persons and other types of detainees, who shall 
be treated alike without any adverse distinction founded on religion or faith. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that it is crucial to provide the personnel of detention 
facilities with adequate training, raising awareness and enhancing their sensitivity about their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>duty to promote and respect international human rights standards for the treatment of prisoners, 
in particular the right to freedom of religion. Finally, the religious beliefs of a detainee should 
under no circumstances be used by the authorities against the detainee in order, for instance, to 
extract information from him or her. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>30. Refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum-seekers also face problems worldwide 
both on legal and factual levels, for example on their domestic or international refugee routes or 
when applying for asylum on religious grounds. Decision makers have been criticized for not 
always taking a consistent approach, especially when applying the term &#8220;religion&#8221; contained in 
the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and when 
determining what constitutes &#8220;persecution&#8221; in this context.<b>3</b> Furthermore, detailed knowledge of 
the applicant&#8217;s religion does not necessarily correlate to the risk of persecution since individuals 
may get persecuted also for imputed beliefs. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize 
that religion based refugee claimants - in line with the standards as to the other Convention 
grounds - should not be required to hide their religion or to practise in secret in order to avoid 
persecution. 
</p>
<p>31. Moreover, the principle of non-refoulement according to article 33 of the 1951 Geneva 
Convention may be connected to freedom of religion or belief, since no Contracting State shall 
expel or return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories 
where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his religion. Persecution can also be 
linked to conscientious objection to military service when the punishment for desertion or draft 
evasion is disproportionate for a Convention reason or when the refusal to serve is based on 
genuine political, religious, or moral convictions, or valid reasons of conscience. The assessment 
of the asylum application may be particularly complicated concerning refugees <i>sur place</i>, 
i.e. persons who were not refugees at the time of leaving their country, but who become a 
refugee at a later date. Suspicions regarding the sincerity of asylum claims arise particularly 
when the asylum-seeker becomes a refugee <i>sur place</i> as a result of his own actions, e.g. by 
converting after his arrival in the country of asylum to a religion which would make him prone to 
persecution in his home country if he were to be returned. However, such conversion post 
departure should not give rise to a presumption that the claim is fabricated and the immigration 
authorities should evaluate the genuineness of the conversion on a case-by-case basis taking into 
account the applicant&#8217;s past and present circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Children 
</b></p>
<p>32. The first report of the mandate holder d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro already concluded that &#8220;children 
of believers are subject to discrimination of various kinds, such as ill-treatment and humiliation 
at school, expulsion from school or a ban on embarking on higher education, pressure to deny 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  See UNHCR, Religion-Based Refugee Claims under article 1A (2) of the 1951 Convention 
</p>
<p>and/or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (HCR/GIP/04/06). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>their faith, and even in certain extreme cases imprisonment, torture and summary execution&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/1987/35, para. 70). Such discriminatory treatment derives both from governmental 
actions and from incidents provoked by non-State actors. States must respect the rights and 
duties of the parents to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her freedom of 
religion or belief in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. At the same 
time, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning 
children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, 
administrative authorities or legislative bodies. The issue of religious symbols worn by pupils at 
State schools illustrates the delicate balancing exercise involved, i.e. on the one hand to protect 
the autonomy of minors who may be pressured or forced to wear religious symbols and on the 
other hand not to deny the right of those minors who have freely chosen to wear a religious 
symbol as part of their religious belief. Education should be aimed at strengthening the 
promotion and protection of human rights, eradicating prejudices and conceptions incompatible 
with freedom of religion or belief, and ensuring respect for and acceptance of pluralism and 
diversity in the field of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>33. Another difficult issue is the question to decide who is competent - and until when - to 
decide whether children could or should change their religion or belief. The Special Rapporteur 
has taken the position that the choice of religion is restricted by the parents&#8217; rights to determine 
their child&#8217;s religion up to an age where the child is capable of doing so on his or her own. Such 
a case-by-case approach is also supported by article 12 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, which requests States parties to &#8220;assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her 
own views to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child 
being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>34. The mandate practice shows that national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are 
in a particularly vulnerable situation. The identity of many minorities is defined by various 
aspects and several instances of discrimination, for example when based both on racial and on 
religious motives, are aggravated by the effects of multiple identities. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to emphasize that States have an obligation under international human rights law to 
guarantee the right of minorities to profess and practise their own religion. The State remains 
responsible even when abuses are committed against minorities by non-State actors and States 
are also required to encourage conditions for promoting the identity, including the religious 
identity, of minorities. 
</p>
<p>35. It has to be borne in mind that while a certain religion may be a minority in one part of the 
world and suffer accordingly, it may constitute the religion of the majority of the population in 
another part of the world. Religious minorities face various forms of discrimination and 
intolerance, both from policies, legislation and State practice. Issues of concern relate to 
obstacles in the official registration procedures as well as inappropriate limitations when 
disseminating materials and displaying religious symbols. Furthermore, some religious 
minorities are adversely affected by manifestations of rejection or violence from non-State actors 
and by threats to their very existence as a specific community. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>36. Article 12 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families mirrors the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion as provided for in article 18 of ICCPR. The population of many countries features a 
considerable number of migrant workers and their vulnerable situation requires special attention. 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned by several limitations placed on the right of migrant 
workers and members of their families to manifest their religion or belief. For example, 
foreigners who do not belong to the major religion in one country, are not allowed to build 
places of worship or carry out prayers or religious rituals outside of their homes. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that many limitations are implemented as a matter of practice rather than a 
matter of law and consequently they may fail to comply with article 18 (3) of ICCPR which 
requires that any limitation on the right to manifest one&#8217;s freedom of religion or belief must be 
prescribed by law. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur questions to what extent these 
limitations are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of others. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that all persons 
within a particular country, and not just the citizens of that country, have the right to freedom of 
religion or belief, including the right to manifest that belief. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Intersection of freedom of religion or belief with other human rights 
</b></p>
<p>37. Human rights are exercised in a context where rights coexist with each other. In this 
regard, most international human rights conventions provide that, in the exercise of their human 
rights, individuals have to respect the rights of others. However, the coexistence of rights does 
not only imply that rights should be seen in a restrictive manner because of the existence of other 
rights; it also implies the fundamental notion of interdependency of human rights. This is 
emphasized by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World 
Conference on Human Rights in 1993, which proclaimed that &#8220;[a]ll human rights are universal, 
indivisible and interdependent and interrelated&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Freedom of expression including questions related to religious  
conflicts, religious intolerance and extremism 
</b></p>
<p>38. The intersection of freedom of religion or belief with other human rights can be illustrated 
by the relationship to freedom of expression. In response to the offensive publication of 
representations of the Prophet Muhammad by the media in some countries starting in late 2005, 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur for the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as well as the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance issued a joint press release.<b>4</b> The three mandate holders recalled that religion or 
belief, for anyone who professes either, is one of the fundamental elements in his or her 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>conception of life and that freedom of religion or belief is protected as one of the essential rights 
by article 18 of ICCPR. They also recalled that respect for the right to freedom of expression, as 
articulated in article 19 of ICCPR, constitutes a pillar of democracy and reflects a country&#8217;s 
standard of justice and fairness. Peaceful expression of opinions and ideas, either orally, through 
the press or other media, should always be tolerated. The press must enjoy large editorial 
freedom to promote a free flow of news and information, within and across national borders, thus 
providing an arena for debate and dialogue. Nevertheless, the use of stereotypes and labelling 
that insult deep-rooted religious feelings do not contribute to the creation of an environment 
conducive to constructive and peaceful dialogue among different communities. The Special 
Rapporteurs urged all parties to refrain from any form of violence and to avoid fuelling hatred. 
They also encouraged States to promote the interrelated and indivisible nature of human rights 
and freedoms and to advocate the use of legal remedies as well as the pursuance of a peaceful 
dialogue on matters which go to the heart of all multicultural societies. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred, the report 
(A/HRC/2/3, paras. 44-47) further to Human Rights Council decision 1/107 notes the following: 
&#8220;According to article 20 of the Covenant, &#8216;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred 
that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8217;. In 
its general comment 11, the Human Rights Committee holds that the measures contemplated by 
article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant constitute important safeguards against infringement of 
the rights of religious minorities and of other religious groups to exercise the rights guaranteed 
by articles 18 and 27, and against acts of violence or persecution directed towards those groups. 
[&#8230;] The Special Rapporteur notes that article 20 of the Covenant was drafted against the 
historical background of the horrors committed by the Nazi regime during the Second World 
War. The threshold of the acts that are referred to in article 20 is relatively high because they 
have to constitute advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred. Accordingly, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the opinion that expressions should only be prohibited under article 20 if they 
constitute incitement to imminent acts of violence or discrimination against a specific individual 
or group.&#8221; She concluded that &#8220;[a]t the global level, any attempt to lower the threshold of 
article 20 of the Covenant would not only shrink the frontiers of free expression, but also limit 
freedom of religion or belief itself. Such an attempt could be counterproductive and may 
promote an atmosphere of religious intolerance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Right to life, right to liberty 
</b></p>
<p>40. Every human being has the inherent right to life which shall be protected by law and 
everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. The occurrence of armed conflict and 
civil wars caused, inter alia, by religious factors, has lead to heavy losses of life. Also in 
countries where there is no prevailing climate of civil war, confrontations between religious 
communities may lead to violence and cause the death of many persons. The right to liberty is 
also frequently infringed as evidenced by numerous cases of arbitrary arrest and detention for 
reasons of religion or belief, including house arrest, internal exile, imprisonment and assignment 
to a re-education or labour camp. With regard to the reward for the killing of an individual in 
pursuance of a religious ruling, the first mandate holder d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro recalled article 6 of 
ICCPR and emphasized &#8220;that a decision which has not been issued by an independent tribunal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>where the accused would be entitled to defend himself with the assistance of legal counsel, to 
call witnesses and to exercise the right of appeal cannot be accepted. Offering a reward for the 
killing of such a person constitutes an incitement to crime and a call to religious hatred which is 
liable to legal prosecution in all countries where the rule of law prevails&#8221; (E/CN.4/1993/62, 
para. 79). 
</p>
<p>41. Human rights obligations of States are not limited to abstaining from committing direct 
violations of freedom of religion or belief or other fundamental human rights. Their obligations 
also consist in ensuring the free exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief by 
protecting religious communities and enabling them to practise their faith in all security. States 
also have a positive obligation to bring the perpetrators of acts of violence or of other acts of 
religious intolerance to justice and to promote a culture of religious tolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman  
or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly urged States to ensure that no one 
within their jurisdiction is subjected to torture and Governments were reminded that corporal 
punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or 
even to torture. Religious convictions are occasionally put forward to justify certain harmful 
practices. Some parents, whose religious doctrine postulated physical punishment of children as 
legitimate and necessary, considered the prohibition of corporal punishment of schoolchildren as 
an infringement of their right to provide for their children&#8217;s education according to their religious 
convictions; however, the international case law rejects this interpretation as incompatible with 
human rights standards, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore, in a 
country visit report, the Special Rapporteur analysed certain forms of punishment contained in 
sharia penal codes and she came to the conclusion that stoning or amputation constitute, if not 
torture, at least cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment that is prohibited in absolute terms by 
various international conventions. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Cross-cutting issues 
</b></p>
<p>43. The mandate practice has also dealt with a number of cross-cutting issues such as 
derogations, limitations, legislative issues as well as the role of defenders of freedom of religion 
or belief and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Derogation 
</b></p>
<p>44. The fundamental character of the freedom to thought, conscience and religion is reflected 
in the fact that article 18 of ICCPR cannot be derogated from, even in time of public emergency, 
as stated in article 4 (2) thereof. This aspect of freedom of religion or belief not only implies that 
no individual can be deprived of this right even in time of emergency, but also that States should 
avoid equating certain religions with terrorism as this may have adverse consequences on the 
right to freedom of religion or belief of all members of the concerned communities. Similarly, 
terrorist acts which are carried out by non-State actors in the name of religion ought to be 
delinked from religion, so that these actions are not associated with freedom of religion or belief. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Limitation 
</b></p>
<p>45. The permissibility of limitations is independent of the issue of derogability. Even in 
times of most serious public emergencies, States that interfere with the freedom to manifest 
one&#8217;s religion or belief must justify their actions by referring to the requirements specified in 
article 18 (3) of ICCPR. Consequently, freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be 
subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public 
safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that restrictions may not be imposed for discriminatory 
purposes or applied in a discriminatory manner and limitations must be directly related and 
proportionate to the specific need on which they are predicated. The burden of justifying a 
limitation upon the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief lies with the State. The chosen 
measures should promote religious tolerance and avoid stigmatizing any particular religious 
community. Furthermore, the principles of appropriateness and proportionality need to be 
thoroughly respected both by the administration and during possible legal review. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Legislative issues 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly urged States to &#8220;ensure that their 
constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of 
thought, conscience, religion and belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the provision of 
effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, 
the right to practise freely one&#8217;s religion, including the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief, is 
violated&#8221;. While some States already have institutions such as an ombudsperson for human 
rights, the Special Rapporteur has encouraged the creation of bodies or institutions dealing 
specifically with complaints and conciliation in matters of religion or belief. Such an 
organization should have genuine autonomy and independence of government. Its task could be 
to receive and consider complaints as well as to initiate and pursue inquiries on its own motion. 
Lastly, it could be responsible for conciliation or mediation, in cooperation with domestic 
judicial bodies, and for dealing with disputes arising from discrimination based on religion or 
belief. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the human rights obligations of 
States also consist in ensuring the free exercise of freedom of religion or belief and bringing the 
perpetrators of acts of religious intolerance to justice. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Defenders of freedom of religion or belief  
and non-governmental organizations  
</b></p>
<p>47. Members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and groups based on religion or 
belief play an essential and dynamic role in promoting freedom of religion or belief. The Special 
Rapporteur is particularly grateful for the information she receives from NGOs as well as for 
their input during country visits, highlighting cases of religious intolerance, discrimination and 
persecution. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s model questionnaire, which is available online,<b>5</b> is

 <p> 
</p>
<p>designed to facilitate and tailor to the mandate the submission of information with regard to 
potential or actual violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief. Furthermore, NGOs 
may also help in ensuring an effective follow-up to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations in her 
communications reports and to the mandate holder&#8217;s recommendations in country reports. 
</p>
<p>48. The terms of reference for fact-finding missions by Special Rapporteurs 
(see E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V) provide, inter alia, for &#8220;assurance by the Government that no 
persons, official or private individuals who have been in contact with the special 
rapporteur/representative in relation to the mandate will for this reason suffer threats, harassment 
or punishment or be subjected to judicial proceedings&#8221;. However, there have been cases of 
reprisals against persons cooperating with representatives of United Nations human rights 
bodies, including the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Since 1993, these 
cases as well as incidents where private individuals have been hampered in their efforts to avail 
themselves of United Nations human rights procedures have been documented in reports of the 
Secretary-General.<b>6</b> It is imperative that Governments abide by their assurances and the Special 
Rapporteur will remain vigilant in order to protect individuals who try to cooperate with her 
mandate. Furthermore, she hopes that all incidents of intimidation or reprisals against human 
rights defenders will be scrutinized persistently by the judiciary, the media and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The 21 years of mandate practice confirm the statement in Human Rights Council 
resolution 4/10 that &#8220;the disregard for and infringement of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, in particular the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, 
continue to bring, directly or indirectly, wars and great suffering to humankind&#8221;. Many 
further efforts need to be made at the international and national levels in order to eliminate 
intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. The right to freedom of religion 
or belief is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed by various international legal 
instruments, some of them are legally binding and others are so-called soft law. In her 
framework for communications (E/CN.4/2006/5, annex) the Special Rapporteur compiled 
the international human rights standards concerning freedom of religion or belief, 
including those referred to in Human Rights Council resolution 4/10. The Special 
Rapporteur also uses the framework&#8217;s structure of thematic categories in the present

<p>50. <b>Particularly worrying are cases where the freedom to adopt, change or renounce 
a religion or belief has been infringed, for example when State agents try to convert, 
reconvert or prevent the conversion of persons. While the right to freedom to worship is 
not limited to members of registered religious communities, many believers belonging to

<p><b>religious minorities are not allowed to worship or conduct any religious activities without 
State approval or prior registration. Since believers are in a situation of special 
vulnerability whenever they find themselves in places of worship, States should pay 
increased attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that all perpetrators of such 
attacks are properly prosecuted and tried. Women, persons deprived of their liberty, 
refugees, children, minorities and migrant workers can be identified as particularly 
vulnerable groups with regard to their freedom of religion or belief. The right to life and 
the right to liberty are also frequently infringed as evidenced by numerous cases of killings 
and arbitrary detention for reasons of religion or belief. States have to ensure that their 
constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom 
of thought, conscience, religion and belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the 
provision of effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom religion or belief is 
violated. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>States and non-State actors have to abide by the applicable international human 
rights standards. Furthermore, rather than waiting until acts of intolerance and 
discrimination based on religion or belief have been perpetrated, it would be advisable for 
States to devise proactive strategies in order to prevent such violations. Consequently, 
education could serve as an essential tool in creating a genuine human rights culture in 
society. Especially primary and secondary schools may be a suitable place for learning 
about peace, understanding and tolerance among individuals, groups and nations in order 
to develop respect for pluralism. States, academic institutions and NGOs should be 
encouraged to elaborate models for education in religion and ethics in accordance with 
international human rights instruments, as a follow-up to the 2001 International 
Consultative Conference on school education in relation to freedom of religion and belief, 
tolerance and non-discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Furthermore, inter-religious and intra-religious dialogue is vital for the prevention of 
conflicts. Religions may examine ways of managing the expression of their own internal 
diversity while at the same time incorporating a genuinely pluralist culture. Inter-religious 
and intra-religious dialogue should not only include religious leaders but could also involve 
initiatives at the grassroots level. In this regard, it may be useful to take into account the 
perspectives of believers who are dispassionate about their faith and of non-believers. 
Teachers, children and students could also benefit from voluntary opportunities of 
meetings and exchanges with their counterparts of different religions or beliefs, either in 
their home country or abroad. Consequently, States should be encouraged to consider 
promoting regional or international cultural exchanges in the field of education, for 
example by concluding agreements relating to such exchange programmes and by 
providing funding for related grassroots activities.
