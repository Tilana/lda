<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on 
their activities (see Appendix I).   
</p>
<p>2.  At the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures, held in Geneva from 23 to 
27 June 2008, mandate holders supported the periodic issuance of a joint communications  
report to prevent inconsistencies among mandate holders reporting on the same 
communications to the Council; avoid duplication and rationalize documentation; allow the 
examination of cross-cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of 
communications and any follow-up would feed into the universal periodic review process 
more effectively (A/HRC/10/24, para 34-35). In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of 
special procedures mandate holders decided that a joint communications report would be 
prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with this decision being reconfirmed by the 
seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 2010. Mandate holders decided that 
the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27).  
</p>
<p>3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60). 
</p>
<p>4.  The report strengthens transparency, efficiency and reduces documentation and 
related costs. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other 
entity are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks.  
</p>
<p>5. Communications are reproduced in the language in which they were sent.  Replies 
received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are included with translations into English, where 
available.  
</p>
<p>6. This report covers all urgent appeals and letters of allegations sent by special 
procedures mandate holders between 1 December 2011 and 15 March 2012 and all replies 
received between 1 February 2012 and 15 May 2012. Communications sent before 1 
December 2011 are reported in A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/18/51 respectively. 
</p>
<p>7. The report also includes replies received between 1 February 2012 and 15 May 
2012, relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 
December 2011. Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by 
the respective State.   
</p>
<p>9. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint 
urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates.  It does not contain other types 
of communications issued by these mandates, processed according to their own distinctive 
procedures, which will continue to be reported exclusively in the annual reports of these 
two working groups. 
</p>
<p>10. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of concerned victims who would 
otherwise have their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual 
has expressively consented or requested to include his or her name in the public report. In 
the original communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the </p>


<p>Government concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been blackened 
out in State replies to preserve the presumption of their innocence. 
</p>
<p>11. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent between 1 December 2011 and 15 March 
2012, and responses received in relation to these communications until 15 May 2012. </p>

<p>Allegation of arrest, detention, conviction and upholding of sentence on appeal on 
charges of &#8220;Creating a disturbance&#8221;. According to information received, on 21 March 
</p>
<p>2011, Ms. Wang Lihong was criminally detained as part of a Government crackdown 
against human rights defenders following anonymous on-line calls for a &#8222;Jasmine 
Revolution&#8223;. She remained in detention at Beijing Chaoyang District Police Detention 
</p>
<p>Centre and was formally charged on 21 April. The charge allegedly relates to her 
participation in a peaceful demonstration which was held on 16 April 2010, outside a 
court in Fujian Province where the trial of three bloggers on charges of slander was 
taking place. On 12 August 2011, the trial proceedings took place and reportedly 
concluded after two and a half hours.  The judge allegedly continuously interrupted 
Ms. Wang Lihong as she delivered her final statement and her lawyers were not 
allowed time to finish their concluding statements.. On 9 September 2011, Ms. Wang 
Lihong was allegedly found guilty of &#8220;creating a disturbance&#8221; by the Wenyuhe Court 
</p>
<p>in Chaoyang District, Beijing, and sentenced to nine months in prison. On 20 October 
2011, the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8223;s Court reportedly rejected Ms. Wang 
Lihong&#8223;s appeal.

<p>Allegations of threats and abusive messages directed against Mr. Thanassis Tartis, 
lawyer for the Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM), Mr. Panayote Dimitras, spokesperson 
of GHM and member of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) General 
Assembly, as well as against Mr. Pavlos Voskopoulos, a representative of the 
Macedonian minority community in Greece. According to reports received, Messrs. 
Tartis and Dimitras both testified during the preliminary hearing of the trial of 
members of the Hellenic Coast Guard who appeared before the Naval Court of 
Piraneus for violation of Article 2 of the Antiracism Law 927/7 due to the statements 
made during the Greek Independence Day Parade, which took place on 25 March 
</p><p>2011. Allegations indicate that after the preliminary hearing, Mr. Tartis was pursued 
by supporters of the accused coastguards but managed to escape. The police who 
were present reportedly did not take any action against the agitators nor did they 
attempt to protect Mr. Tartis. It is reported that following this hearing hundreds of 
abusive messages and threats appeared on the internet.

<p>Alleged acts of intimidation. According to information received, on 5 November 
2011, two plainclothes policemen called the name of Mr. Shyamal Roy, founder of 
the organisation &#8220;Dodhichi&#8221;, aimed at reporting human rights violations committed 
</p>
<p>by authorities of the state of West Bengal and at promoting women&#8223;s rights and the 
right to education, while they were outside is house.  They told him that they had 
come to seize his SIM card and alleged that they were the Sub-Inspector and 
Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police at Sonarpur Police Station. Reportedly they wanted 
to confiscate other items belonging to him but Mr. Roy requested a legal order from 
the court. The two policemen called the Officer-in-Charge of Sonarpur Police Station 
before leaving and telling Mr. Roy that they would come back. Mr. Roy allegedly 
sends text messages to inform civil society groups about cases of human rights 
violations occurred in his community and to make people aware of their human 
rights.

<p>Allegation that the proposed Peaceful Assembly Bill may unduly restrict the right to 
assemble peacefully. According to the information received the Peaceful Assembly 
Bill tabled at the Malaysian Parliament on 22 November 2011, contains serious 
limitations to the free exercise of the right to peaceful assembly. These include the 
imposition of broad restrictions and conditions on assemblies; a ban on street 
protests; a vague definition of assembly; a prohibition on non-citizens and citizens 
under 21 years of age to assemble peacefully; a prohibition on children attending 
peaceful protests; a restrictive notification procedure;  full discretion given to the 
police to recording assemblies but only 'reasonable' access to media; and excessive 
discretional authority and power to law enforcement officials and the Minister 
charged for home affairs for matters related to assemblies and their conduct. Grave 
concern is further expressed that the new legislation may prevent people in Malaysia 
from expressing their dissent in public spaces without fear of being detained or 
sanctioned.

Follow-up letter to replies by the Government of Australia on two previous 
communications concerning the mandatory detention regime and the Agreement 
between Australia and Malaysia on Transfer and Resettlement of 25 July 2011. While 
welcoming positive measures taken towards the issuing of bridging visas during 
assessment of asylum claims and the progressive release in community of asylum-
seekers and undocumented migrants in detention, concern is expressed at the policy 
of the Government to retain a mandatory detention regime. In regard to the 
Agreement between Australia and Malaysia, concern is expressed at the fact that the 
Government intends to pursue such policy, including with States such as Malaysia 
that are not parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the ICCPR and the CAT. 
Concern is further expressed at the absence of provisions of individual protection in 
the Memorandum of Understanding of 19 August 2011 with Papua New Guinea. The 
letter seeks clarification on the above issues and invites the Government of Australia 
to engage in a dialogue with the Special Rapporteur in this regard.

Alleged impact on human rights compliance and accountability for human rights 
violations of proposed new legislation and recent domestic court decisions.  
According to the information received, although the Status of Forces Agreement 
between the United States and Iraq will expire on 31 December 2011, some U.S. 
private military and security companies will remain in the country.  The legal status 
and accountability of PMSCs in Iraq and elsewhere is unclear.  The Civilian 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which would extend United States jurisdiction over 
PMSC employees that commit certain crimes while working for the United States 
abroad, contains a carve-out for authorised intelligence activities that undermines the 
possibility of comprehensive criminal accountability for PMSC employees involved 
in serious human rights violations.  Also according to information received, several 
recent United States court cases directly relate to, or potentially affect, contractor 
accountability: Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, Minneci v. Pollard, Al-Quraishi v. 
Nakhla, Al Shimari v. CACI, Saleh v. Titan and Mohamed v. Jeppeson Dataplan.

<p>Alleged killing of a journalist. According to information received Mr. Rafiq Tagi may 
have been killed because of his work as a journalist. Mr. Tagi, was attacked by 
unknown assailants on 19 November 2011, suffering multiple stab wounds. He died 
on 25 November 2011 as a result of his injuries.  Prior to his death Mr. Tagi had 
published an article entitled 'Iran and the Inevitability of Globalization' in which he 
reportedly criticised the Iranian Government. Previously Mr. Tagi had received death 
threats for his criticism of the Government of Iran. In 2007, Mr Tagi had been 
sentenced to three years in prison on charges of religious hatred by the Sabail district 
court in Baku, for allegedly publishing an article linking religious influence to the 
lack of economic and political development in the country. The article was allegedly 
interpreted as insulting Islam and sparked protests in Azerbaijan and Iran. 
Information received indicated that a Fatwa was issued ordering that he be executed.

<p>Alleged imminent execution after a trial that did not comply with international fair 
trial safeguards. According to information received, Mr. Dzmitry Kanavalau and Mr. 
Uladzslau Kavalyou were arrested on 12 April 2011, in connection with series of 
bomb attacks in Belarus. Mr. Kanavalau was found guilty of committing terrorist 
attacks and producing explosives and Mr. Kavalyou was found guilty as an 
accomplice and for failing to inform the authorities. Their sentences were confirmed 
by the Supreme Court of Belarus. The only appeal remaining was for clemency with 
the President, within ten days of the sentence being passed. If rejected, the two men 
would be at imminent risk of execution. It was alleged that during the trial Mr. 
Kanavalau retracted his confession, claiming that it was obtained under duress. He 
indicated that during interrogation the investigator had threatened to shoot him. It was 
also alleged that there was no forensic evidence linking the two accused to the crimes 
and that the security camera footage which was relied on by the prosecution had been 
tampered with.

impeding the legitimate work of a human rights association. According to the 
information received, the Federal High Court upheld the freeze of all assets of the 
Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), now known as the Human Rights 
Council (HRCO), as approved by the Charities and Societies Agency (ChSA) in 
</p><p>2009. It is alleged that the measure, adopted in the context of the implementation of

<p>Alleged ill-treatment and on-going detention of members of the Human Rights

2011, Mr. Azamjon Formonov was subjected to beatings and ill-treatment while in 
detention at the 64/71 Special Regime Colony to force him to write a letter 
concerning his treatment while in detention. Other members of HRSU, Messrs. 
Nasim Isakov, Alisher Karamatov and Gaybullo Jalilov, continue to be detained and 
have allegedly been subjected to ill-treatment as well while in detention. Mr. Zafar  
Rahimov remains in detention since being imprisoned in October 2007.  Mr. 
Khabibilla Okpulatov remains in detention since 2005 and his sentence was extended 
in August 2009 before he was due to be released. Mr. Azamjon Formonov and Mr.

<p>Alegaci&#243;n de que la Fiscal&#237;a ha solicitado que se extienda la medida de privaci&#243;n

Caracas que se extienda por dos a&#241;os la medida de privaci&#243;n preventiva de libertad 
dictada contra la Jueza Mar&#237;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, privada de libertad desde el 10 
de diciembre de 2009. La fiscal  encargada del caso habr&#237;a presentado la petici&#243;n 
debido a que el art&#237;culo 244 del C&#243;digo Org&#225;nico Procesal Penal establece que una 
persona no puede estar detenida por m&#225;s de dos a&#241;os si no le ha sido dictada 
sentencia condenatoria, a menos que el Ministerio P&#250;blico pida una pr&#243;rroga cuando 
existan causas graves que lo justifiquen. Esta solicitud de la Fiscal&#237;a se deber&#237;a 
entonces al hecho que la jueza Afiuni habr&#237;a debido salir libre el 10 de diciembre de 
2011 al cumplirse 2 a&#241;os de su prisi&#243;n preventiva sin condena.

<p>Alleged rape of Internally Displaced woman. According to information received, Ms. 
TKP is a 28 year old Internally Displaced woman of Tamil origin from Vishvamadhu 
(Mullaitheevu district) Sri Lanka. She was allegedly beaten and raped by two military 
men on 6 June 2010. The case was allegedly reported to the commander of the 12th 
mile post army camp on 7 June 2010 who reportedly offered Ms. TKP money in 
order to dissuade her from pursuing her case any further. It is also reported that on 7 
June 2010, Ms. TKP lodged another complaint with the police. It is further alleged 
that the case was taken up by the Kilinochichi district court on 14 June 2010 where 
the victim gave her testimony reportedly in the presence of more than 100 military 
men inside the court. Medical results by the Vavunia hospital which reportedly 
confirmed that she was raped were also presented to the court. On 16 July 2010, the 
case was committed to the Jaffna High Court.

Alleged decision to abolish funding for interpretation and translation in health care. 
According to the information received, the decision of the Ministry for Health, 
Welfare and Sport to abolish funding for interpretation and translation in health care 
from 2012 will have a negative effect on the diagnosis, treatment and health 
education of persons with limited command of the Dutch language, as well as 
migrants who had insufficient time to learn the language. The new requirement that 
patients pay for the costs of interpretation will allegedly restrict access to health care 
for many migrants, especially those who lack financial means. It is further alleged 
that it may also cause persons who do not speak Dutch to avoid seeking health care 
altogether, thus impeding effective disease surveillance and leading to potential 
societal health risks, besides the adverse effects on those individuals.

Alleged dire social and economic conditions of the Attawapiskat First Nation, 
northern Ontario, Canada, and the alleged poor living conditions in aboriginal 
reserves. According to the information received, many of the Attawapiskat First 
Nation live in unheated shacks or trailers, with no running water, posing severe 
problems in light of the impending harsh winter. Reportedly, the Government of 
Canada has agreed to provide emergency housing in Attawapiskat to address the 
crisis situation. However, this assistance has allegedly been made contingent on third 
party management of funds, which the Attawapiskat First Nation rejects as not being 
responsive to their needs.  The Band also reportedly continue to suffer from the 
effects of a number of disasters, including an oil spill in 1979 that destroyed the 
public schools and a massive sewage flood in 2009, allegedly caused by a DeBeers 
diamond mine located on Attawapiskat traditional lands. First Nations communities 
are reportedly systematically underfunded as compared to non-Aboriginal towns, and 
the federal government allegedly maintains a 2% cap on spending increases for core 
services for Aboriginal peoples and cities.

used to prevent LGBT individuals, as well as those perceived as belonging to any of 
these groups, and those that bring support to them, from associating or assembling 
freely. If brought into law, the Bill could also penalize any human rights defenders 
and activists who would seek to stand up for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual or 
transgender people in Nigeria.

<p>Alleged trial of human rights defender on charges of l&#232;se majest&#233;. According to the 
information received, on 30 April 2011, Mr. Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, human rights 
defender and magazine editor, was arrested at Aranyaprathet district, Sa Kaeo 
Province, and charged with contravening the l&#232;se majest&#233; law. His arrest came only 
five days after he held a press conference in Bangkok launching a campaign to collect 
10,000 signatures to petition for a parliamentary review of the l&#232;se majest&#233; law or 
Section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. He was reportedly detained in Bangkok 
Special Prison and transferred to Sa Kaeo Provincial Court on 12 November 2011. 
On 1 November 2011, his fourth bail request was denied. Different venues in 
different parts of Thailand, and different judges, have been allocated for the 
remainder of the hearing which will allegedly place an undue burden on Mr. 
Prueksakasemsuk. Mr. Prueksakasemsuk was the subject of a previous 
communication (see A/HRC/19/44, case no THA 5/2011).

<p>Alleged negative impacts on human rights of affected communities of proposed 
domestic policy permitting the construction of an open-pit coal mine in the township 
of Phulbari. According to the information received, the open-pit mine in Phulbari, if 
constructed, would have a significant impact on food production and access, by 
destroying close to 12,000 acres of productive agricultural land, and on water access 
by lowering the water table 12 to 25 meters and potentially poisoning water sources. 
The mine would allegedly lead to the displacement of up to 220,000 people over 
time, 50,000 of whom are indigenous people belonging to 23 different tribal groups. 
Current plans reportedly do not provide for adequate compensation or resettlement 
and have not included consultations with affected communities. Finally, allegations 
have been raised regarding continued efforts to stop human rights defenders from 
protesting the Phulbari coal mine.

<p>Allegations of police summoning, arrest and detention of, and charges against, trade

According to the information received, on 29 October and 4 November 2011 
respectively, Mr. Daniel Urai, President of the Fiji Trade Unions Congress, and Mr. 
Felix Anthony, General Secretary of the Trade Union&#8223;s Congress and the General

Anthony was released without charges, and has since been put under travel 
restrictions without any reasons being provided. On 17 November, Mr. Anthony and 
Mr. Ruru, Deputy General Secretary of the Fiji Sugar and General Workers Union, 
were summoned to the Lautoka Police Station for a caution statement to be taken 
over their visit the day before to a company which plans to lay 115 workers off. On 
13 December, an Australian and New Zealander trade union delegation was refused 
entry in Fiji.

<p>Alleged threat of mass criminalization, evictions and incarceration of homeless 
population in Hungary following the adoption of several amendments to national and 
municipal legislation.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, amendment to Act 1997/LXXVII on the 
transformation and protection of urban environment and to Act 1996 XXI on 
territorial development and settlement, adopted in October 2010, defines the various 
functions of public spaces and empowers municipalities to criminalize any use of 
public space which is not in accordance with these functions. Law Act CLIII (adopted 
on 14 November 2011, and entered into force on 1 December 2011), states (Article 
146/A), that a person repeatedly violating municipality regulations regarding the use 
of public spaces for habitual living, or the storage of movable properties on public 
places for the purposes of habitual living, can be punished with imprisonment or up 
to 150,000 Hungarian forints fine. Based on these amendments, during October 2011, 
Budapest police allegedly evicted homeless persons from 13 underpasses in the inner 
city and demolished dozens of homeless self-made shelters in various parts of the 
city. Allegedly, the evicted persons were not provided with alternative shelter options 
and some of the evicted persons were subject to short term arrest.

<p>Alleged negative impact of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland (UK) government proposal to abolish the Overseas Domestic Worker (ODW) 
visa system.  According to the information received, the ODW visa system has been 
hailed as best practice and provides important safeguards to prevent abuse, 
exploitation and trafficking of migrant domestic workers. If the ODW visa system is 
abolished, this will contribute to facilitating contemporary forms of slavery practices, 
including trafficking, by allowing employers to bring migrant workers to the UK with 
no legal protection. Migrant domestic workers would also be tied to their employer 
and if their rights are violated, they may face the dilemma of continuing to suffer or 
fleeing and becoming irregular in the UK. Migrant domestic workers themselves 
would be unable to seek justice through criminal courts or employment tribunals for 
violations of their right to be free from servitude and other human rights violations.

received, in November 2011, groups of peaceful protesters from the &#8220;occupy 
movement&#8221; were subjected to forced removal by law enforcement officials in

<p>different cities within the country, including Portland, Davis, Oakland, New York, 
Seattle and Denver. In the conduct of such operations, law enforcement officials 
allegedly used violence as a means to forcibly remove unwilling protesters from the 
public areas in which they were located. Reportedly, police equipped with riot gear 
and law enforcement officers have made use of heavy crowd control techniques and 
weaponry, including pepper spray, teasers and LRAD &#8222;sound cannons&#8221; to disperse 
protesters. In some instances, police allegedly used force unnecessarily and 
disproportionately; pepper spray and tear gas would have been used deliberately on 
protesters at a very close distance, causing serious injuries to several protesters.

<p>Alleged extension of period of detention, arrest, interrogation and charges. According 
to information received on 27 November 2011,  the detention of human rights 
blogger, Mr. Alaa Abd El-Fattah was extended by 15 days pending the end of an 
investigation on charges of &#8220;vandalism&#8221;, &#8220;unlawful assembly and &#8220;resisting arrest&#8221; 
</p>
<p>.On 30 October 2011, Mr. El-Fattah was arrested by military police along with 
another blogger Mr. Bahaa Saber.  It is alleged that both men were interrogated 
regarding their involvement in a demonstration that was held in front of the Maspero 
building in Cairo on 9 October 2011, which resulted in violence and the death of 27 
people. Mr. Saber was later placed under provisional release. Both men publicly 
opposed the investigation of the violence at the demonstration by the Military 
Prosecution.

results. Law enforcement officials reportedly resorted to excessive use of force to 
disperse the assembly; with the detention of nearly 900 protesters between 5 and 6 
December. More detentions were also reported in other cities, including 
approximately 200 persons in Saint Petersburg. Human rights organizations, 
including the independent election monitoring group &#8220;Golos&#8221; and other human rights 
defenders, were allegedly subjected to threats, harassment and intimidation in the run 
up to the parliamentary elections and its aftermath.

Alleged forced eviction of subsistence farmers in Northern Uganda. According to 
information received, from 17 to 21 August 2001 the Ugandan army (Uganda 
People&#8223;s Defence Force, UPDF), using excessive force, expelled close to 4000 
</p>
<p>inhabitants of the villages of Kitemba, Luwunga, Kijunga and Kiryamakobe in the 
Mubende District from their land in order to lease the land to the Kaweri Coffee 
Plantation Ltd. Allegedly, a total of 2524 hectares of land were unlawfully seized 
from these communities, houses were burnt and demolished, moveable properties 
were looted and crops destroyed. Reportedly, the evictees lived on their respective 
lands for more than 12 years, unchallenged, and used the land productively for 
farming purposes. Allegedly, almost no compensation was provided to the evicted 
inhabitants and no adequate relocation options were provided. Reportedly, in 2002, 
2,041 evictees sought legal redress for the alleged violations and brought the case to 
the Ugandan High Court. Reports received indicate that since the filing in 2002 the 
case has been delayed in Nakawa High Court, Kampala and no substantial decision

<p>Alleged abduction and rape. According to information received, Ms. X, a 28-year-old 
resident of B. Village in Momouk district, Kachin State, was abducted on 28 October 
2011 and subsequently raped by military personnel attached to Light Infantry 
Battalion 321, Mu Bum frontline post in Momouk district, Kachin State.  Reportedly, 
villagers from her village who escaped from the same military post had testified that 
there were four women, including Ms. X, cleaning and cooking for the military 
during the day and gang-raped at night. On 1 November 2011, Ms. X&#8223;s family 
reportedly lodged a complaint at the military post in Loije town and begged for her 
release. A military commander at the post informed them that Ms. X. would be 
released the following day on 2 November 2011. However, she was not released. 
Villagers from Hkai Bang have since reportedly fled to more secure places. Recent 
reports received suggest that there had been other cases of women and girls being 
gang-raped and some killed by the military in Kachin state.

<p>Alleged killing of human rights defender. According to the information received, on 8 
December 2011, Mr. Zarteef Afridi, coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan (HRCP) in Khyber Agency was shot by unknown men while he was on a 
motorcycle on his way to work in a local school where he was headmaster. 
Reportedly, the perpetrators approached him in the area of Ghundai near Jamrod 
Bazaar, Khyber Agency. Before his death he had been working with a number of 
peace groups in campaigning for the release of dozens of prisoners under the 
Frontiers Crimes Regulations and was involved in organizing a congregation of tribal 
elders to campaign against terrorism. He had allegedly received death threats in the 
past from local militants. He is the third member of HRCP to be killed this year, 
following the killing of Mr. Siddique Eido, journalist and HRCP member, in 
Balochistan and Mr Naeem Sabir, HRCP Coordinator in Khudzar district, 
Balochistan ( see A/HRC/18/51 case no . PAK 17/2010).

Alleged violent forced eviction and housing demolitions in an informal settlement in 
the city of S&#227;o Jos&#233; does Campos in the State of S&#227;o Paulo. According to the 
information received, on 22 January 2012 at approximately 06:00 am the residents of 
the Pinheirinho settlement (roughly 6000 people) were evicted from their settlement 
by the Sao Paulo's military police. It is reported that the police used tear gas bombs 
and rubber bullets against the residents, who were resisting the eviction.  During 
these events 20 residents were reportedly injured, one severely, and 30 residents were 
reported arrested. Reportedly, the evictees were not allowed to pack their belongings 
and they were not provided with any alternative housing solution.  Reports indicate 
that the area is currently still under siege, and that the lawyers acting for the residents 
have not been allowed to enter the area.

<p>Alleged widespread use of military and special jurisdictions to try civilians in

</p>
<p>12,000 civilians have been tried before military or special courts in Egypt. In most of 
the cases, the sentence has allegedly been issued following brief investigations and 
hearings, and in violation of the defendants&#8223; right to have access to a lawyer of his or 
</p>
<p>her own choosing, to a court appointed lawyers and in violation of the individuals&#8223; 
</p>
<p>rights to defence. One year following the 2011 mass protests, on 24 January 2012, the 
SCAF announced that the state of emergency would be lifted in all parts of the 
country starting 25 January &#8220;except in fighting acts of thuggery.&#8221;

<p>Alleged violations of the enjoyment of various human rights through large-scale land 
acquisitions in Indonesia. According to the information received, the Meruake 
Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE) project, designed to produce inter alia 
agrofuels for export, is resulting in the non-consensual conversion of indigenous 
peoples&#8223; ancestral lands and forests. Numerous indigenous communities, including 
the Zanegi, Malind, Muyu, Mandobo, Mappi and Auyu, populate this area and rely on 
the forests for hunting and food collection as well as for providing the foundation of 
their identities, unique cultures and spirituality. Information received suggests that the 
local indigenous communities have not been provided with good faith consultations 
regarding the changes in land use of their traditional territories and that no procedures 
were put in place to obtain their free prior informed consent. The MIFEE project has 
also allegedly used coercive practices to obtain the required signatures of individuals 
relinquishing their rights. According to reports, the MIFEE project has reduced food 
availability for local populations. Finally, allegations received suggest that Papua 
provincial police and national military intelligence have employed intimidation 
tactics to dissuade local community members from raising concerns about the MIFEE 
project.

<p>Allegation of increased tension between the Government and the Judiciary, which 
culminated on 16 January 2012 in the arrest and detention of the Chief Judge of the 
Criminal Court. According to the information received, Mr. Abdulla Mohamed was 
arbitrarily arrested in violation of the procedures established by the law and was 
reportedly held incommunicado until 20 January 2012. The Government has publicly 
explained the arrest as a consequence of the inability or unwillingness of the Judicial 
Service Commission (JSC) to take disciplinary action against judge Mohamed and 
therefore guarantee the accountability of judges in general. However legitimate may 
be the concerns over the effective functioning of the JSC, the behaviour of some 
judges and the situation of the judiciary as a whole, this does not authorize in any 
way resorting to unlawful arrest and detention, as in the case of Mr. Mohamed.

26 August 2010, two sisters, 14 and 12 years of age, were arrested with Mr. Ayaz

custody awaiting trial in a detention setting not appropriate for their age and sex.

on 10 January 2012. It is reported that Mr. Bhuvaneswaran was attacked by a man 
armed with a sickle as another assailant kept hold of his daughter. Reports indicate 
that the killing may have been connected with Mr. Bhuvaneswaran&#8223;s campaigning 
against land grabs allegedly carried out by a land mafia group with reported links to 
the Dravidian Progress Federation political party. It is alleged that death threats were 
made against Mr. Bhuvaneswaran in July 2011, but police reportedly failed to take

<p>Alleged excessive use of force during peaceful demonstrations. According to the 
information received, on 22 December 2011, police and internal security forces 
violently dispersed a peaceful demonstration taking place at Khartoum University 
where students gathered in support of Manaseer, an ethnic group that was forcibly 
displaced by the construction of the Merowe dam. On 25 December 2011, a sit-in to 
protest the 22 December violence also met with the excessive use of force by the 
police. Police forces reportedly used teargas and batons and further injured numerous 
demonstrators. 70 students were reportedly arrested during the 25 December sit-in. 
On 30 December 2011, Mr. Taj Alsir Jaafar, a student activist, was arrested by 
security forces in Khartoum, presumably for participating in student protests from 
mid-December 2011 into January 2012. On 25 January 2012, six members of the 
student-led movement Girifna were arrested after taking part in a public forum on 
human rights.

<p>Alleged detention, ill-treatment and ongoing harassment. According to the 
information received, Messrs. Faisal Al Zaidi and Rashed Mohamed Ali Abbad, 
former employees of the Abu Dhabi Airport Company (ADAC) who have spoken out 
against alleged corruption at the company, allegedly lost their jobs in January 2011. 
They were reportedly arrested separately and had personal belongings confiscated in 
August 2011, and were both subjected to ill-treatment in detention at the Criminal 
Investigation Department (CID) headquarters in Abu Dhabi. Since their release, their 
telephones, as well as that of a family member of Mr. Al Zaidi, have been tapped and 
remain under surveillance, and Mr. Al Zaidi and his family have been followed. On 
18 September 2011, Mr. Ali Abbad was reportedly stopped for questioning at Abu 
Dhabi airport by agents of the CID who allegedly confiscated his mobile telephone. 
Although a labour court ruled that Messrs. Al Zaidi and Ali Abbad were unfairly 
dismissed, they have not been allowed to resume their positions with the ADAC.

Allegation that some 3,000 families from 13 informal settlements on the banks of the 
Bagmati River in Kathmandu may face imminent forced eviction and forced 
demolition of their informal settlements by Government authorities. According to the 
information received, these families could not afford formal housing, and the reported 
reason for the threatened forced eviction and demolition of the informal settlements 
of the communities living along the Bagmati River is its rehabilitation. Following 
strong protests and complaints from various quarters of society, including political 
parties and human rights organizations, the forced eviction had been put on hold. 
Allegedly, the process was initiated without prior consultation with the communities 
living along the Bagmati River and no adequate alternative accommodation was 
offered, despite effective court decision(s) to that effect.

<p>Alleged intimidation and attacks targeted at the congregation of the Taman Yasmin 
Indonesian Christian Church (Gereja Kristen Indonesia, GKI) by some Islamist 
groups in Bogor, West Java. According to the information received, on 22 January 
2012, members of the Islamic Reform Movement (Garis) and Muslim 
Communications Forum (Forkami), gathered near the site of the church where the 
congregation of the Taman Yasmin Indonesian Christian Church has its weekly 
services. For safety reasons, the congregation had decided to move its weekly service 
to a member&#8223;s home near the church. Allegedly, Garis and Forkami protesters 
</p>
<p>intimidated and verbally abused some of the congregation as they made their way to 
the service at the house. At least 50 Bogor Municipal Administrative Police (Satpol 
PP) officers arrived at the scene and shortly after, the protestors intimidated the 
congregation and shouted for the members to leave. The congregation refused to 
leave until the Bogor District Police Chief agreed to guarantee protection of the 
congregation. This case was the subject of an earlier communication (see 
A/HRC/19/44, case no. IDN 4/2011).

<p>Alleged judicial and other harassment of activist. According to the information 
received, in the 1990s Mr. Steve Richardson, a member of the Los Angeles 
Community Action Network (LA CAN), a grassroots organization working in 
downtown and south Los Angeles, with a specific focus on the Skid Row community 
was convicted of two felonies. Due to the three-strikes law he faces a risk of a 
sentence of between 25 years and life in prison for any serious felony of which he is 
convicted. On two occasions, in March 2008 and 21 May 2010, LAPD officers 
reportedly used significant force against Mr. Richardson and he was charged with a 
felony of resisting arrest. The filing of charges against him relating to the events of 21 
May 2010 reportedly came just a week after Mr. Richardson testified in front of the 
Los Angeles City Council in August 2010 regarding the Council&#8223;s decision to raise 
rents.

National Judicial Office, and the new provisions on the retirement age of judges. In 
addition, information was received regarding the powers of the Prosecution service

(or Zanyar) Moradi and Loghman (or Loqman) Moradi, both belonging to the 
Kurdish minority, were convicted of charges of &#8220;enmity against God&#8221; (moharebeh) 
and &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; for their alleged involvement in a murder and armed 
</p>
<p>activities, after having been coerced into confession and subjected to torture. They

<p>Alleged threats to the right to food posed by agrofuel project. According to the 
information received, large-scale land acquisition to secure land for the development 
of an agrofuel project, which will extend over 11,000 hectares, is negatively affecting 
the livelihood of local farmers in the municipality of San Mariano in the province of 
Isabela, home to some 44,700 people, including indigenous people communities. 
Reportedly, irregular land leasing practices have been to the disadvantage of small-
scale food producers. Allegedly, there were no genuine consultations with affected 
communities, including the local indigenous people, and the compensation offered to 
farmers for the lease of the land was often well under the value associated with the 
land.

<p>Allegations of excessive use of force against peaceful protestors and undue 
restrictions on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. According 
to the information received, law enforcement authorities have repeatedly used 
excessive force against peaceful demonstrators protesting against the increase of fuel 
prices, the Employees&#8223; Pension Benefits Fund Bill, and alleged attacks against 
</p>
<p>women belonging to minorities by the military. Human rights and political activists 
were also prevented by law enforcement authorities from participating in a peaceful 
protest organized by a platform of civil society organizations working on cases of 
disappearances and abduction. Media organizations staging a peaceful protest which 
called for the authorities to investigate into attacks over the past years on media 
personnel and institutions, were forced to change the venue of their protest, whereas 
counter-protestors (pro-government groups), some armed with clubs, could 
demonstrate at the initial venue.  Reportedly, the military unduly requires advance 
notification prior to any meetings, and attends meetings to which it was not invited 
with a view to intimidating the participants.

<p>Alleged arrest and deportation of a journalist. According to the information received, 
on 9 February 2012, Mr. Hamza Kashgari was arrested at Kuala Lumpur International 
Airport following the issue of an arrest warrant by the Saudi Arabian authorities. Mr. 
Kashgari is a journalist for Al-Belad (The Country), a newspaper owned by the Saudi 
Arabian Government, and a blogger. He was allegedly held in detention in the Travel 
Control Section in the Bukit Aman area of Kuala Lumpur. Prior to his arrest he had 
reportedly fled Saudi Arabia after accusations of apostasy were made against him in 
relation to an online post he had made concerning the Prophet Mohammed. On 12 
February 2012, he was allegedly deported from Malaysia to Saudi Arabia and has 
since remained in detention in Riyadh. Despite publicly repenting and declaring 
himself a Muslim, Mr. Kashgari is reportedly at serious risk of being charged with 
blasphemy and consequently receiving a death sentence as a result of his post on 
Twitter.

Pakistan, left at least 18 Shia Muslims dead when attackers, allegedly in military 
fatigues, separated them from Sunni travellers and shot them at the roadside. This act 
follows an incident on 17 February when, reportedly, more than 30 people were 
killed or wounded when a suicide bomber exploded a bomb close to a mosque in a 
mainly Shia neighbourhood in the Kurram tribal region.

<p>Alleged grave challenges for NGOs to freely conduct their activities within the 
context of the provisions contained in the 2009 Law on Non-Governmental 
Organizations; as well as alleged de facto ban on peaceful assemblies in Baku. 
According to the information received, several provisions contained in the 2009 NGO 
Law may unduly restrict the right to freedom of association, particularly with regard 
to the rules regulating foreign NGOs. There are also allegations indicating that 
several human rights NGOs have recently faced an increasing pressure in an attempt 
to intimidate and silence them. It is also reported that over the past months, several 
requests to hold peaceful assemblies have been denied; and when authorized, they 
had to take place in remote areas outside Baku.

<p>Alleged illegal decision suspending the activities of 29 NGOs in Masvingo. 
According to the information received, on 14 February 2012, the Governor of 
Masvingo ordered the suspension of the activities of 29 NGOs for allegedly failing to 
submit to his office a certificate of registration together with a Memorandum of 
Understanding signed by local authorities. It is alleged that this decision would be 
illegal as the law does not provide the Governor with the authority to register, 
suspend or disrupt the activities of NGOs.

On 12 January 2012, the Ministry of Interior issued a statement prohibiting illegal 
residents to organize any rallies, gatherings, sit-ins or demonstrations regardless of 
their nature, objective and mission. It is reported that the latest developments form 
part of an increasingly hostile environment towards Bidun.

</p>

According to the information received, Boko Haram had engaged in a series of 
attacks and bombings targeted on churches, Christians and the security forces since 
Christmas Day 2011. Boko Haram also allegedly imposed on the Christians and 
southerners a three-day deadline to leave the north on 1 January 2012. After the 
deadline, Boko Haram continued to launch attacks and showed a total disregard for 
human life in different parts of northern Nigeria. At least 185 people died in an attack 
in Kano on 20 January 2012. The latest attack on 26 February 2012, at Jos 
headquarters of the Church of Christ in Nigeria denomination (COCIN) reportedly 
killed three people and injured 37.

apoyado la construcci&#243;n de la carretera. Se ha alegado, sin embargo, que mediante

Fernando Gonz&#225;lez Llort, Gerardo Hern&#225;ndez Nordelo, Ram&#243;n Labanino Salazar and 
Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez Sehwerert. It is alleged that the same judge previously in charge of 
these cases, Ms. Joan A. Lenart of Florida South District, has been assigned to decide 
on the habeas corpus procedures. In addition, only part of the evidence available in 
these cases was allegedly disclosed, potentially affecting the effective right to defence 
of the defendants, including access to all material which could be exculpatory. These 
individuals were the subject of earlier communications (see A/HRC/11/41/Add.1, 
paras. 332 ff.).

<p>Alleged rape of sex worker by police while in detention. According to information 
received Ms. X, a sex worker residing in Plattekloof and Kensington, Cape Town, was 
arbitrarily detained and raped by three police officers at Woodstock Police Station in 
late October 2009. Ms. X was allegedly approached by two police officers who 
violently pushed her into in a South African Police Service van, injuring her forehead in 
the process. She was allegedly then taken to the police station where she was kept in 
crowded quarters without being informed of any of her rights nor being allowed to 
make a phone call. She was then allegedly taken to an isolated cell where she was 
verbally abused by three police-officers who forced her to perform oral sex and 
subjected her to vaginal rape in exchange for her release.  Reportedly, one of the police-
officers who raped her continued to harass her. Ms. X had allegedly not filed any 
formal complaint for fear of suffering. Reportedly, current legislation, which 
criminalizes sex work in South Africa, increases the vulnerability of sex workers to 
violence, as it further enhances their social stigmatization and discrimination.

continue engaging with States in ensuring appropriate follow-up to the joint study. In 
this context, they invited Iraq to provide them with information on measures taken to 
investigate the allegations contained in the joint study and if found true, to rectify the 
situation in compliance with international human rights norms and standards; to 
implement the related recommendations; and to provide any other relevant information.

<p>Alleged arrest and detention of, and legal proceedings launched against, human rights 
defenders, lawyers and academics in the context of anti-terrorism operations in Turkey. 
On 28 October 2011, Mr. Ragip Zarakolu and Ms. Ersanli were arrested together with 
50 other persons in Istanbul and were subsequently charged with &#8220;membership in an 
</p>
<p>illegal organization - &#8222;Koma Ciwaken Kurdistan - Kurdistan Communities 
League/Assembly of Turkey&#8223; (KCK/TM)&#8221;. Concern is expressed at the allegations that 
their detention may be solely linked to their activities as human rights defenders and the 
exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression. The communication also 
includes allegations about the validity of the charges brought against Ms. Filiz Kalayci, 
Messrs. Hasan Anlar, Halil Ibrahim Varg&#252;n and Murat Varg&#252;n in the context of their 
trial before the 11th Heavy Penal Court of Ankara. It is alleged that during the trial 
some witnesses withdrew their initial accusatory statements as these had been obtained 
under pressure. Further concern is expressed about the ongoing trial of Ms. Zeynep 
Ceren Bozpotrak, a lawyer accused of &#8220;propaganda for an illegal organization&#8221;. It is 
</p>
<p>reported that charges brought against Ms. Bozpotrak are based on her proposals of law 
amendments which were prepared in the context of her work for a human rights 
association. Allegedly, the charges further relate to the advice to remain silent that Ms. 
Bozpotrak had given to one of her clients.

<p>Alleged arbitrary arrest and detention and lack of access to food, water and adequate 
housing and other alleged human rights violations of migrant workers in Thailand in the 
context of the flood crisis. According to information received, migrant workers working 
and living in Thailand have been arrested and detained for travelling outside of their 
permitted areas of work or for lack of identification documents as they have escaped 
flooded areas to seek shelter, reunite with relatives, or return to their countries of origin. 
Many of the arrests and detention have allegedly occurred in Mae Sot, Tak Province, at 
the border with Myanmar. Reports of lack of access to food and water for migrants 
whilst in detention or in certain areas due to migrant workers being excluded from 
distribution of food and other essential items according to house registration records 
have also been received. It is further alleged that migrant workers have been denied 
access to emergency shelters as some facilities have allegedly been open to Thai 
citizens only, whilst other shelters have required the holding of a recommendation or 
certificate from the Ministry of Labour. According to information received, migrant 
workers have furthermore had difficulties in accessing assistance due to poor or little 
access to information. Deportation of migrants from Thailand to Myanmar have also 
been reported which could be in violation of the obligation of non-refoulement.

Alleged prolonged solitary confinement used on individuals suspected or convicted of 
terrorism-related offences. According to the information received, Mr. Syed Fahad 
Hashmi, born in 1980, a citizen of the United States of America (USA), was charged 
with providing material support to Al-Qaeda in 2006 by the British police in London. In 
May 2007, he was extradited to the USA. Mr. Hashmi was placed in pre-trial solitary 
confinement under Special Administrative Measures by then Attorney General at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center from October 2007 to August 2010. In March 2011, 
he was transferred to the Administrative Maximum Prison (ADX) in Florence, 
Colorado. Since then, he has been held in solitary confinement. Mr. Zaid Safarini, a 
citizen of Jordan, was sentenced for terrorism-related charges in 2004. He was held in 
solitary confinement at ADX in Florence, Colorado for six years and denied access to 
the Step-Down Programme which allows individuals to be transferred to lower security 
facilities when they meet certain behavioural requirements.

<p>Alleged arbitrary arrest and sentencing of three women human rights defenders and 
members of the Pink Life Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transvestite and Transsexual 
Solidarity Association. According to information received, on 25 October 2011 , Ms. 
Buse Kili&#231;kaya, Ms. Selay Tun&#231; and Ms. Naz Gudumen, were reportedly found guilty 
of &#8220;resisting public officials and preventing them from performing their duty&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;insults&#8221; and were handed down prison sentences by the Ankara 15th Court of First 
</p>
<p>Instance. Ms. Gudumen received a suspended 18-month prison sentence.  Ms. Tunc was 
given a six-month suspended prison sentence.  Ms. Kili&#231;kaya was sentenced to five 
months in prison and remains at liberty pending the hearing of the appeal of this 
sentence. The three women were reportedly arrested by police officers on 19 June 2010 
in Ankara. When they enquired about the legal reason of their arrest, police officers 
reportedly indicated that their crime was &quot;to do transvestism&quot; and forcibly pulled them 
out of their car and insulted them based on their gender identities. The women were 
brought to the police station where they were held for five hours before being released. 
They filed an official complaint against the police with the Public Prosecutor for ill-
treatment and insults who reportedly dismissed the complaint.
