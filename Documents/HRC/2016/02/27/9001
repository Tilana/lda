<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people carried out an official visit to Bolivia, at the invitation of the Government, 
from 25 November to 7 December 2007. 
</p>
<p> Bolivia is a multi-ethnic country with a predominantly indigenous population (62 per cent). 
Since 2005, the Government of Bolivia has been headed by its first-ever indigenous President, 
and the draft new Constitution approved by the Constituent Assembly in December 2007 
contains numerous provisions relating to the collective rights of the indigenous peoples. This has 
given rise to serious political conflicts in the country due to opposition from some sectors of 
society fearful of losing their privileges. 
</p>
<p> The persistent problems of access to land and the recognition of their territories are the 
chief concerns of the indigenous communities. Despite progress made in land regularization and 
titling through agrarian legislation, a great many obstacles still remain. In the highlands, where 
smallholdings (<i>minifundios</i>) predominate, many native communities are demanding 
reconstitution of their ancestral lands. In the eastern part of the country and in the Bolivian 
Amazon, large estates have been formed, in many cases against the law. This situation has led to 
numerous conflicts and violations of the human rights of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p> The situation of servitude in which some Guaran&#237; communities continue to live as a result 
of the historical plundering of their lands deserves particular attention. Another cause for 
concern is the situation of highly vulnerable and at-risk communities, such as the Yuqui and 
Ayoreo peoples, who until recently lived in voluntary isolation. Many indigenous communities 
have been subjected to harmful pollutants from mining activities or hydrocarbon production that 
have had a negative impact on their health and environment. 
</p>
<p> Note should be taken of the deplorable persistence in parts of the mass media of racist and 
discriminatory pronouncements against indigenous people in relation to conflicts over the 
policies of the new Administration. Incidents of violence and attacks against indigenous leaders 
and human rights defenders have also been documented. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur carried out an official visit to Bolivia, at the invitation of the 
Government and at the instance of the country&#8217;s indigenous organizations, from 26 November 
to 4 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>2.  In accordance with the mandate given to the Special Rapporteur in Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/12, the objectives of the visit were to examine ways and means of overcoming 
existing obstacles to the full protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people in Bolivia, gather information from all relevant sources on alleged violations 
of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and formulate recommendations and proposals 
on appropriate measures and activities to prevent and remedy such violations. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere appreciation to the Government of Bolivia 
for its invitation and for the open and cooperative manner in which it received his visit, as well 
as to the many indigenous and civil society organizations that extended him hospitality and 
support. He also expresses particular appreciation to the country office in Bolivia of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and to the United Nations 
country team. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to acknowledge the assistance provided by the 
Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program (IPLP) of the University of Arizona in preparing 
his mission, as well as the generous support provided by the Danish organization IBIS, the 
International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development and the International Work 
Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) for the purpose of holding consultations with the 
Bolivian indigenous organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>5. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited the departments of Beni, Chuquisaca, 
Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, Potos&#237; and Santa Cruz. In the capital, La Paz, the 
Special Rapporteur held meetings with various government officials, including the President of 
the Republic, Evo Morales Ayma; the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Rural Development, 
Farming and the Environment, and Labour; various vice-ministers; and officials responsible for 
the Indigenous Rights Mainstreaming Unit and the Community-Based Policy Department of the 
Ministry of the Presidency. He also met with the president of the Constituent Assembly and 
several of its members, as well as with the Ombudsman. During his visits to the various 
departments, he met with the prefect of Oruro, with representatives of the prefecture of 
Santa Cruz and with various municipal authorities. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with traditional authorities and leaders of the 
various Aymara and Quechua nations, as well as with, inter alia, the Ayoreo, Chiquitano, 
Guaran&#237;, Guarayo, Moje&#241;o, Movima, Tacana, Trinitario, Uru, Yuqui and Yuracar&#233; peoples. He 
also met with the main indigenous organizations of the country, including the Confederation of 
Bolivian Indigenous Peoples (CIDOB), the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu 
(CONAMAQ), the Trade Union Confederation of Original Settlers of Bolivia (CSCB), the 
Single Trade Union Confederation of Tenant Farmers of Bolivia (CSUTCB) and the National 
Federation of Women Tenant Farmers of Bolivia &#8220;Bartolina Sisa&#8221; (FNMCB &#8220;BS&#8221;), as well as </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>with representatives of their federations and member organizations. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur participated in meetings with the NGOs that make up the human rights 
community, as well as with other civil society organizations, academic institutions and private 
companies. 
</p>
<p>7. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur held information sessions with the bodies, funds and 
agencies represented by the United Nations country team, representatives of the diplomatic 
community and bilateral cooperation agencies and with the secretariat of the Fund for the 
Development of the Indigenous Peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>8. As amended in 1995, the Constitution defines Bolivia as a unitary, multi-ethnic and 
multicultural Republic. According to the 2001 population and housing census, 62 per cent of the 
population identifies itself as indigenous. Official recognition is granted to 37 indigenous 
peoples. Of these, the Quechua and Aymara - comprising 30.7 per cent and 25.2 per cent, 
respectively - constitute the majority and reside mainly in the Andean region, in the valleys of 
the western part of the country and in urban areas. In the eastern lowlands - the Chaco and the 
Amazonian region - 17 per cent of the population is indigenous and comprises 32 distinct 
peoples. Of these, the most numerous are the Chiquitano, the Guaran&#237; and the Moje&#241;o, who live 
alongside internal migrants from the highlands. Many Bolivians identify themselves as either 
Andean <i>kolla</i> (indigenous), most of whom are Quechua or Aymara, or <i>camba</i> from the lowlands, 
where the majority of the population defines itself as mestizo and where the indigenous 
population constitutes a demographic minority. 
</p>
<p>9. Bolivia became an independent Republic in 1825. As in other countries in the region, 
independence did not put an end to the colonial pattern of exploiting and marginalizing the 
predominantly indigenous population or the plundering of their lands. The nationalist revolution 
of 1952 paved the way for the development of citizenship among the indigenous population and 
implemented agrarian reform. The revolution encouraged the social and political mobilization of 
the highland indigenous communities and promoted trade unionization in mining and tenant 
farming, with the active participation of indigenous workers. 
</p>
<p>10. Starting in the late 1960s, the indigenous peoples began to emerge as new sources of power 
and as dynamic actors on the national political scene. During the 1990s, marches led by the 
indigenous organizations served as vehicles for conveying their demands to the central 
Government. One product of the indigenous movement was the first recognition of indigenous 
rights in the constitutional reform of 1995, which highlighted the country&#8217;s multicultural and 
multi-ethnic nature and provided for a series of legislative amendments, including the promotion 
of land titling in the indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>11. In December 2005, the first indigenous President of Bolivia, Evo Morales Ayma, was 
elected with the support of the country&#8217;s main indigenous organizations. The new Government 
announced its intention to promote far-reaching changes aimed at benefiting the indigenous 
population. Some of the reforms that were adopted, such as the agrarian property regime and the 
renegotiation of hydrocarbon contracts, as well as the debate surrounding the country&#8217;s proposed 
new Constitution, have given rise to conflicts pitting the central Government against the prefects 
and other political, social and economic sectors in the lowlands. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. The current political and social conflict in Bolivia can be explained by geodemographic 
differences: although political power is wielded from the highlands, economic power in recent 
decades has shifted to the lowlands. The department of Santa Cruz has taken the lead in 
advocating departmental autonomy, which includes a demand for control of the area&#8217;s natural 
resources (land, water, forests, hydrocarbon reserves), management of which is crucial to the 
central Government in pursuing its programme of social reform. In order to further its demand 
for autonomy, the Santa Cruz ruling class has symbolically identified itself as the &#8220;<i>camba</i> 
nation&#8221; by way of challenging the power of the highland <i>Kolla</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF 
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES&#8217; RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Bolivia has ratified the core United Nations human rights treaties and those of the 
Organization of American States (OAS), as well as the ILO Convention concerning Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169). 
</p>
<p>14. On 7 November 2007, Congress adopted Act No. 3760, elevating to the rank of domestic 
law the 46 articles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
adopted by the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. This step demonstrates Bolivia&#8217;s 
commitment to the promotion and protection of indigenous rights, despite the fact that the 
practical implications of the Declaration have not yet been determined, in particular as concerns 
the reform of sectoral legislation and judicial practice. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  New Constitution and programme of legislative reform 
</b></p>
<p>15. Following several years of debate, a new Constituent Assembly was convened in 2006, 
with many indigenous members among the participants. The deliberations of the various 
Assembly committees in the city of Sucre took place in a context of acute social conflict. The 
new constitutional draft was given general approval on 24 November 2007 in the absence of 
most members of the opposition and in the midst of major unrest that required moving the 
Assembly&#8217;s headquarters to the outskirts of Sucre. The text was subsequently given detailed 
approval in Oruro on 10 December 2007. At the time of publication of the present report, some 
sectors of the opposition were still questioning the legitimacy of the Assembly and the new 
constitutional text. 
</p>
<p>16. The draft new Constitution, which will be subject to a referendum, incorporates broad 
recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights as part of a new plurinational and intercultural State 
model that will affect the nature and organization of all State powers and institutions. The draft 
incorporates the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, including &#8220;the right [of indigenous peoples] to self-determination within the context of 
State unity, which consists of their rights to autonomy, self-government, the maintenance of their 
culture, recognition of their institutions and consolidation of their territorial entities&#8221; (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>17. Based on these principles, the draft Constitution includes a section on the rights of the 
&#8220;indigenous, native, peasant nations and peoples&#8221;, including innovative formulas for the 
recognition of their rights to autonomy and jurisdiction; rights in respect of lands, territories and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>natural resources; and rights to cultural identity and to intercultural education. The draft also 
provides for indigenous participation in the operational structure of the State, including the 
Plurinational Legislative Assembly and the Plurinational Constitutional Court, while also 
recognizing that indigenous institutions are &#8220;part of the general State structure&#8221; (art. 30.5). 
</p>
<p>18. Along with the process of constitutional reform, the Government promoted legislative 
reform in various areas of special interest to indigenous peoples. Particularly noteworthy is the 
adoption in November 2006 of the Community-Based Agrarian Reform Renewal Act (No. 3545) 
and, in August 2007, of its Regulations (No. 29215), which gave fresh impetus to the recognition 
and distribution of indigenous lands; the 2007 Regulations on Consultation and Participation in 
Hydrocarbon Activities (Supreme Decree No. 29033); and the Regulations on 
Socio-Environmental Monitoring of Hydrocarbon Activities in the Territory of Native, 
Indigenous Peoples and Peasant Communities (Supreme Decree No. 29103). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  New institutional framework and public policy  
</b></p>
<p>19. One of the first decisions of the new Administration was to abolish the Ministry for 
Indigenous and Native Peoples&#8217; Affairs (MAIPO), which had been established in 2003, as it was 
considered discriminatory in a country with a predominantly indigenous population. MAIPO was 
replaced by an approach designed to mainstream indigenous affairs into the public policy agenda 
at all levels, responsibility for which now lies with such bodies as the Indigenous Rights 
Mainstreaming Unit and the Inter-agency Technical Committee for Indigenous Peoples, which 
are attached to the Ministry of the Presidency. Also established were the Vice-Ministry of 
Community-Based Justice, which is attached to the Ministry of Justice, and the Vice-Ministry of 
Traditional Medicine and Interculturalism, which is attached to the Ministry of Health. 
</p>
<p>20. The dissolution of MAIPO prompted frustration among some indigenous organizations and 
development cooperation agencies, in that MAIPO had served as a focal point for policies 
relating to indigenous peoples. Although it is still too early to evaluate the impact of this change 
in policy, necessary precautions should be taken in order to avoid disrupting channels of 
communication between the organs of the central Government and the indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government has also announced its intention to implement the provisions of the 
Hydrocarbons Act requiring 5 per cent of the income generated by the Direct Tax on 
Hydrocarbons to be earmarked for the establishment of the Fund for the Development of 
Indigenous and Native Peoples and Peasant Communities, which is currently endowed 
with 436,221,212 bolivianos (approximately US$ 57 million). However, according to 
information received, the Fund has so far been underused and still has only a very limited 
portfolio of projects for actual implementation. 
</p><p>22. It is worth noting that the United Nations country team includes an inter-agency working 
group on interculturalism, which brings together the heads of the various agencies and 
organizations whose programmes and activities have particular relevance for the indigenous 
peoples of Bolivia. This working group is part of the National Council for Dialogue among 
Indigenous, Native, Peasant Peoples and the United Nations System - a progressive mechanism 
for consultation and dialogue with the main indigenous organizations in the country. Also worth </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>noting are the activities of the Sectoral Group for Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights as part of the 
Partners for Bolivia Group (GRUS), which is the coordinating body for the donor community in 
Bolivia. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Indigenous participation and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>23. Indigenous political participation, encouraged by indigenous organizations&#8217; efforts at 
mobilization since the beginning of the 1990s, has been a key factor in the gradual recognition of 
these peoples&#8217; political structures in the various organs of the State. One very important legal 
instrument in this process is the 1994 Popular Participation Act (No. 1551), which recognized 
the legal status of &#8220;grassroots organizations&#8221;, including those of the indigenous peoples, and 
distributed powers and budgetary resources to the municipalities. This Act enabled many leaders 
of indigenous organizations and communities to gain access to political office at the local level. 
</p>
<p>24. The election of the first indigenous President in 2005, after a campaign that had the support 
of the main indigenous organizations in the country, has become an important symbol of the 
indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in the country&#8217;s political, economic, social and cultural life. 
The current Government has taken a variety of measures to strengthen indigenous political 
participation at all levels, including the appointment of senior officials of indigenous origin. 
Similarly, innovative forms of indigenous participation in local governance have been 
implemented, as illustrated by the administration of the indigenous district of Kaami in the 
municipality of Camiri or by the decentralization policy of the Oruro prefecture, which takes 
ayllu groups into account as traditional forms of supracommunity organization in the highlands. 
In the departments of the lowlands, indigenous representatives participate (with a voice, but not a 
vote) in departmental council meetings. 
</p>
<p>25. The new constitutional text has once again highlighted the question of indigenous 
autonomy within a broader debate regarding the State model. The draft text recognizes 
indigenous autonomous areas, which include the &#8220;indigenous, native, peasant&#8221; territories, 
municipalities and territorial regions, configured according to the indigenous peoples&#8217; own rules 
and forms of organization (arts. 290-297). Indigenous autonomy is not exclusive and is 
coordinated with other forms of constitutionally recognized autonomy (municipal, regional and 
departmental), which must be regulated by means of secondary legislation. It should be noted, 
however, that these proposals for autonomy do not yet command a consensus among all political 
actors in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Indigenous justice and law 
</b>26. The draft constitutional text strengthens the concept of indigenous community-based 
justice already recognized in the current Constitution (art. 171) and provides for a plurinational 
constitutional court whose composition ensures that judges from the ordinary courts and judges 
from the indigenous justice system are represented equally. A bill on the administration of justice 
of indigenous native peoples and peasant communities was submitted to Congress in 2007. The 
constitutional draft is careful to subordinate traditional community-based justice, which is, in 
fact, practised in many communities, to respect for the right to life and to the other constitutional 
rights and international human rights standards. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. In Bolivia, as in other countries, there have been incidents of lynching and of people taking 
the law into their own hands. Some social sectors and communications media have exploited 
these incidents in an attempt to defame indigenous justice and to deprive it of full recognition; in 
reality, however, one of the chief causes of these incidents appears to be the inability of the 
judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to ensure respect for the rule of law in many parts of 
the national territory. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reconstitution of indigenous territories 
</b></p>
<p>28. The structure of land ownership in Bolivia is highly inequitable: 10 per cent of the land is 
owned by 90 per cent of family farmers, most of them indigenous, while 90 per cent of the land 
is in the hands of large landowners. The 1953 agrarian reform distributed land titles to many 
small indigenous property owners and culminated in the development of the <i>hacienda</i> system in 
the altiplano. However, it also had the detrimental effect of creating the small holdings 
(<i>minifundios</i>) and so-called &#8220;furrow holdings&#8221; (<i>surcofundios</i>) in that region when properties that 
were tiny to begin with were fragmented still further through inheritance. Meanwhile, in the 
lowlands, property was distributed at the discretion of successive de facto governments, creating 
a new form of large-scale landholding (<i>latifundio</i>) in favour of the farming and forestry 
industries and at the expense of traditional indigenous territories.  
</p>
<p>29. The Act concerning the National Service for Agrarian Reform (No. 175), which was 
adopted in 1996, launched a process of agricultural land ownership regularization under the 
authority of the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA). Among the main innovations of the 
Act is the creation of a class of property belonging collectively to an indigenous people and 
referred to as &#8220;tierras comunitarias de Origen&#8221; (TCO) (original community lands). The Act 
recognized indigenous peoples&#8217; right to the sustainable use and development of the renewable 
natural resources of these lands, the right to the self-management of the lands, in conformity with 
indigenous customary law, and the principles of the inalienability and immunity from seizure of 
the lands. However, secondary regulation has done much to undermine the principles of the Act, 
with the regularization process having degenerated into an opportunity to obtain title to lands 
questionably acquired or occupied, thereby exacerbating the situation of legal uncertainty. 
</p>
<p>30. In November 2006, Congress adopted the Community-Based Agrarian Reform Renewal 
Act (No. 3545), which made substantive changes to the previous agrarian system. The Act 
provides for the regrouping of small agricultural holdings and for the distribution of lands to 
indigenous peoples who do not have sufficient land or who need to complement their holding 
with more land. In order to accomplish this, the Act prescribes, as cause for reversion, the failure 
of a property to fulfil its economic and social function and stipulates that all land expropriated in 
the public interest is to be distributed &#8220;exclusively to indigenous and/or native peoples&#8221; who do 
not possess sufficient land (art. 43). The new indigenous land titling policy has borne fruit. 
According to INRA data, since the current Administration came to power, some 3,889,291 
hectares have been titled, as against the 5,516,210 hectares titled during the period from 1996 
to 2006. 
</p>
<p>31. Despite all the efforts made, however, major delays continue to occur in the processing of 
many pending TCO titling claims, owing in part to budgetary constraints. In the altiplano and the 
valleys of the Andean region, where indigenous smallholdings predominate (between 1 
and 1.5 hectares per family), indigenous organizations complain that the regularization process </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>has not genuinely strengthened property rights, and that, in many cases, the surface area 
recognized as belonging to indigenous peoples is insufficient or does not correspond to their 
traditional territories. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the eastern lowlands, the Special Rapporteur received numerous reports and 
documentation concerning irregularities in the land distribution process and the illegal 
appropriation of indigenous lands by farm operators - usually with the connivance of local 
authorities - through speculative practices in the illicit real estate market and through illegal 
logging. For example, the Ministry of Rural Development, Farming and the Environment has 
amply documented the illegal appropriation, by an influential landowner in the region, of 27,000 
hectares of land belonging to the Forest Reserve and the Guarayos TCO in the department of 
Santa Cruz. 
</p>
<p>33. Another threat to indigenous holdings in the lowlands, particularly in the area of 
Santa Cruz, is the pressure created by the encroachment on TCOs of indigenous settlers and 
peasants from other parts of the country. Legal uncertainty surrounding the system of land tenure 
and the illegal appropriation of land by farm operators, together with the unsatisfied demands of 
the indigenous communities and of the landless peasant communities, make for highly 
conflictual situations. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Exploitation of natural resources and its impact on indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>34. Bolivia is a country rich in natural resources, including metals in the Andean region and 
hydrocarbons in the eastern lowlands, the exploitation of which has had a negative impact on the 
indigenous territories and societies. In the past few decades, inadequate socio-environmental 
regulation and lack of oversight of corporate activities, together with the absence of mechanisms 
to regulate consultation with the indigenous communities affected by such activities, have 
created severe environmental crises in the country&#8217;s indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints concerning environmental pollution 
of soils and waters traditionally used by the region&#8217;s indigenous communities as a result of 
mining concessions awarded in the departments of Oruro and Potos&#237;. Many of these involve 
mining companies (sometimes using open-pit methods) that extract heavy metals such as gold, 
silver, lead and zinc by means of high-pollution processes. Environmental deterioration 
translates into a loss of land for cultivation, the contamination of underground aquifers, rivers 
and lakes, and the death of livestock and forest fauna. There have been many complaints about 
the failure of these mining operations to comply with environmental licensing conditions and 
about the absence of any compensation for damage. 
</p>
<p>36.  In the Andean region, one of the most emblematic cases is the pollution of the 
Desaguadero river basin and of the Uru Uru and Poop&#243; lakes in the department of Oruro, which 
is part of the Suyu Suras territory, the traditional homeland of the Jach&#8217;a Carangas, Sura, 
Quillaxas and Asanakes communities of the Quechua and Aymara peoples and the Uru, a native 
people who have traditionally derived their livelihood from fishing and hunting and currently 
find themselves in a highly vulnerable situation. High levels of pollution have been documented 
in the lake area resulting from the discharge of wastewater from active mines in the surrounding 
region. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur visited the Kori Kollo gold mine operated by the Inti Raymi 
company and received information from its management concerning measures taken to reduce 
the effects of pollution. However, organizations consulted by the Special Rapporteur reported 
that the relevant authorities do not effectively oversee or penalize the companies responsible for 
damaging the environment, as required under the mining and environmental legislation. 
</p>
<p>38. The altiplano communities in the southwestern part of Potos&#237; have complained of various 
plans to award concessions for groundwater exploitation to mining companies in northern Chile 
that require large volumes of water for their operations. Act No. 2267 of November 2001 calls 
for priority to be given to studying the region&#8217;s hydro potential, precisely with a view to 
exporting water on the basis of a call for tender from foreign companies. Act No. 2074 of 
May 2004, which was promulgated following the mobilization of the region&#8217;s indigenous 
organizations in favour of the comprehensive development of the southwestern area of Potos&#237;, 
expressly prohibits the export of groundwater and surface water. 
</p>
<p>39. The representatives of the ayllus of Quila Quila, Chuquisaca, have lodged a complaint for 
failure to be informed and consulted in the award to a joint venture company of the concession 
for a limestone deposit. The administrative and legal proceedings filed by indigenous 
representatives have not been effective, and the latter have allegedly been the target of attacks 
and have had their legal personality annulled by the municipality and the prefecture, which 
supported the interests of the company over those of the affected communities. 
</p>
<p>40. The impact of hydrocarbon extraction in various indigenous territories in the Amazonian 
and Chaco regions has been thoroughly documented. Among the specific cases submitted to the 
Special Rapporteur may be noted the construction of the San Miguel-Cuaib&#225; binational gas 
pipeline between Bolivia and Brazil, which has led to the destruction of large swathes of the 
Chiquitano dry forests and has contributed to the encroachment on and appropriation of 
indigenous lands. 
</p>
<p>41. The Assembly of the Guaran&#237; People undertook an independent review of the transnational 
mining industry, including the consortium to exploit Campo Margarita - one of the largest gas 
fields in the country located in the Itika Guasu TCO in Tarija and the Tentayapi TCO in 
Chuquisaca. This review documented the failure of the consortium, and of others, to comply with 
the measures set out in environmental impact studies, the lack of transparency and consultation 
with the indigenous communities and the State&#8217;s failure to provide proper oversight of the 
consortium&#8217;s activities. An ILO tripartite committee found the lack of an appropriate legal 
framework in the case of 27 forestry concessions in the indigenous territories of 
Yaminahua-Machinery, Guarayo and Monte to be in violation of ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>42. The impact of resource extraction in the indigenous territories is not limited solely to large 
hydrocarbon exploration and extraction projects but also includes the contamination of aquifers 
and fauna by artisanal alluvial gold mining and illegal logging in parts of the Amazonian region, 
such as Pando or Beni. In many cases, these are transnational phenomena that involve citizens 
and companies of neighbouring Peru or Brazil and have a highly detrimental environmental 
impact on the indigenous peoples. The State has shown itself incapable of controlling the 
extensive environmental pollution caused by these activities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. The Hydrocarbons Act has been developed through recent specific regulations on 
consultation and socio-environmental oversight, which are recognized in customary law and in 
the internal forms of organization of the communities. Henceforth, environmental impact 
evaluation studies will be required to address a project&#8217;s social, economic and cultural 
implications for the indigenous peoples in the territories, as well as to make specific proposals 
for preventive and remedial environmental action. It remains to be seen how this new legal 
framework will be implemented in practice and what effect it will have on the many existing 
resource exploration and extraction projects. 
</p><p>44. Of particular concern is a project to build a hydroelectric dam complex on the Brazilian 
side of the Madeira River that will impact the river basin as the Madeira passes through Bolivia. 
The project provides for the construction of four dams: two on the Brazilian side, one between 
the two countries and one on the Bolivian side. There are fears that the project will increase 
reservoir sedimentation and, along the binational section of the Madeira, raise its water level and 
that of its tributaries, with highly adverse effects on fish stocks and other resources crucial to the 
subsistence economy of the indigenous communities in the departments of Pando and Beni, and 
flood agricultural lands and pastures, resulting in the forced expulsion of the communities and an 
increase in malaria and other diseases. There are also fears for the survival of the Pacahuara 
communities living in isolated areas near the Brazilian border, and mention has been made of the 
negative impact on the local indigenous population that other similar projects, such as the 
El Bala project on the Beni River, could have. 
45. A number of demonstrations, particularly the one organized in Cochabamba in 2000, have 
resulted in changes to regulations concerning the ownership and distribution of water in Bolivia. 
In the case of Cochabamba, the cancellation of a distribution contract awarded to a transnational 
enterprise prevented a drastic increase in rates and allowed unhampered access to irrigation 
water by the indigenous and peasant communities to be maintained. Bolivian water legislation 
recognizes the right of indigenous communities to traditional use and has become a model for 
other countries in the region. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Highly vulnerable peoples 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Yuqui people are among the most vulnerable indigenous groups. In 1959, contact was 
established with them for the first time, and in 1969, they were transferred to a mission 
encampment by the American evangelical organization, New Tribes Mission. Beginning in 
the 1980s, reports began to mount of Yuqui massacres at the hands of settlers, ill-treatment and 
forced religious conversion by the Evangelical mission and numerous epidemics of tuberculosis, 
pulmonary mycosis and other diseases. Following a number of other sporadic contacts, in 
the 1980s, and with the consent of the Government, members of the Yuqui people were 
gradually transferred to the Bia/Recuat&#233; Community on the Chimor&#233; River, where they were 
awarded a Yuqui TCO. In 2004, the Yuqui joined the Ichilo River Indigenous Council (CIRI) in 
a multi-ethnic territory located in the department of Cochabamba. The Yuqui population, which 
is estimated to total between 200 and 230 persons, is continually subjected to territorial pressure 
from settlements, indigenous communities in the adjacent TCO and logging companies involved 
in the extraction of forest timber. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. There are also other peoples, few in number and vulnerable who are either itinerant or have 
settled in small territorial communities. This is the case of the Ayoreo (in Santa Cruz), Uru, 
Uru Murato, Tsimane and Leco peoples. These groups complain of their lack of title to land or to 
urban plots, as the case may be, and the fact that their survival depends on the tolerance and 
consideration they receive from the permanent residents of the places where they live. 
</p>
<p>48. In April 2007, the Ministry of Rural Development, Farming and the Environment, in 
conjunction with the Confederation of Bolivian Indigenous Peoples (CIDOB), launched a policy 
to protect vulnerable peoples and, to that end, established the Inter-ministerial Commission on 
Highly Vulnerable Indigenous Peoples, which devised an emergency plan for the Yuqui people. 
The Vice-Minister of Land has given priority to addressing the needs of the Yuqui, Araona, 
Ayoreo and Uru Chipaya peoples. 
</p>
<p>49. As part of efforts to protect highly vulnerable indigenous peoples, in 2006, the 
Government approved the declaration of &#8220;an exclusively reserved, inviolable and fully protected 
area&#8221; inside Madidi National Park in the Amazonian highland of Bolivia that coincides with the 
traditional territory of the Toromona, who are a people living in isolation (Administrative 
Decision No. 48/2006 of the National Service for Protected Areas attached to the Ministry of 
Rural Development, Farming and the Environment). Following the example of other countries in 
the region, the declaration of an inviolable area guarantees respect for such peoples&#8217; decisions 
regarding their relations with the rest of society, and includes such measures of protection as the 
prohibition of any settlement other than that of the peoples living inside the inviolable area, any 
unwanted contact with the Toromona people and any activity related to prospecting for or 
exploiting the area&#8217;s natural resources. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Captive communities 
</b></p>
<p>50. In some regions of Bolivia, indigenous communities continue to be subjected to various 
forms of servitude or forced labour, which is understood as unpaid personal service and 
compulsory labour obtained under coercion or fraud, including improper hiring practices 
(<i>enganche</i>) and debt bondage. This is the situation of indigenous workers (mostly of Quechua 
and Guaran&#237; origin) involved in sugar-cane harvesting in the department of Santa Cruz, those 
held in debt bondage in connection with Brazil nut production in the northern Amazonian region 
and the &#8220;captive communities&#8221; of Guaran&#237; living on <i>haciendas</i> in the Chaco region. These 
situations, which were thought to have vanished following the agrarian reform of the 1950s, are 
evidence of the disquieting persistence of semi-feudal production relationships that are held in 
place by vertical power structures at the local level and by the lack of a State presence. 
</p>
<p>51. In the large <i>haciendas</i> of the Bolivian Chaco, the Guaran&#237; indigenous population has been 
subjected to a system of exploitation and slavery-like conditions since the late nineteenth 
century. More than 10 million of the 13 million hectares of land comprising this region - the 
traditional territory of the Guaran&#237; - have been bought up, mostly by livestock breeders. The 
agrarian reform did not affect the system of relations that prevailed in the east, in the Chaco and 
in the north, thus perpetuating relations of servitude through a variety of formulas: <i>pongueaje</i> 
(compulsory unpaid domestic service), <i>enganche </i>(improper hiring practices) and debt bondage. 
Such relations continue to this day in certain medium and large-sized properties that are 
characterized by low levels of technology and productivity, and entire communities remain </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>subjected to a system of servitude that prevails in agricultural and/or stockbreeding <i>haciendas</i> in 
exchange for paltry wages. According to International Labour Office estimates, between 5,100 
and 7,200 Guaran&#237; are subjected to such servile arrangements.<b> </b> 52. As a result of the efforts undertaken by various NGOs and those of the Roman Catholic 
Church, the situation of these Guaran&#237; families began to be denounced in the late 1990s, and 
projects were launched to free families through the purchase of land that they could work for 
their own benefit and through the implementation of community-based development projects. 
Guaran&#237; organizations have also taken the initiative of denouncing this situation. The 
Special Rapporteur visited one of the freed Guaran&#237; communities and was able to learn first-hand 
about their present and past situation, while noting that there were still many instances in which 
this indentured population have yet to be freed. 
</p>
<p>53. In November 2005, following an exhaustive investigation, the Ombudsman found that 
there had been violations of labour rights, the right to land, the right to access to justice and other 
human rights of the captive Guaran&#237;. In response to these cases, in October 2007, the executive 
branch established the Inter-ministerial Council for the Eradication of Servitude, Forced Labour 
and Other Similar Arrangements. The 2007-2008 Transitional Inter-ministerial Plan for the 
Guaran&#237; People is designed to guarantee the rights of the Guaran&#237; held captive in the Bolivian 
Chaco, give impetus to the territorial reconstitution of the Guaran&#237; nation and promote 
development projects. In December 2007, the Government granted the Guaran&#237; people of 
Chiquisaca (the communities of Huacareta, Ingle, Machareti and Muyupampa) 180,000 hectares 
of land under the Community-Based Agrarian Reform Renewal Act, which stipulates that 
evidence of a situation of servitude is cause to proceed to the expropriation of the lands in 
question by the State and, subsequently, to transfer their title to the indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>54. The situation of the rights of the Guaran&#237; held captive in the Bolivian Chaco was the 
subject of a recommendation by the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues that was included in 
the report on its seventh session (21 April-2 May 2008). In it, the Permanent Forum states that it 
&#8220;has learned from indigenous peoples&#8217; communications, which have been corroborated by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people, that in the Chaco region there are Guaran&#237; communities in a practical state of slavery&#8221; 
(E/C.19/2008/13, para. 156). The Permanent Forum also states that it &#8220;strongly supports the 
efforts of the current Government of Bolivia ... to discontinue this enslaving practice and return 
indigenous lands to their lawful owners, the Guaran&#237; themselves&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Social and development policies 
</b></p>
<p>55. In order to promote food security and sovereignty and to replace the existing mode of 
development that is based largely on commercial and industrial agriculture intended for export, 
the Government launched the National Development Plan, a central component of which is the 
&#8220;Rural, farming and forestry revolution&#8221;. One of the aims of this policy is to change the structure 
of land tenure so as to avoid unsustainable uses and inequitable distribution of land. 
</p>
<p>56. It is worth noting that initiatives to promote the local development of the indigenous 
communities have also included efforts made by community enterprises, of which several 
successful examples may be mentioned: the National Quinoa Producers Association 
(ANAPQUI), which is active in the highlands of the departments of Oruro, Potos&#237; and La Paz; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and the El Ceibo Federation of Cooperatives in the upper Beni, which is intercultural in nature 
and exports cacao and certain derivative products. Pioneering initiatives have also been taken in 
relation to the forest industry, such as the BOLFOR II project, which has developed 
community-based, social, forestry organizations (OFCS) in different parts of the country. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The coca issue 
</b></p>
<p>57. As part of its development policies, one of the thrusts of the current Administration has 
been the revaluation and utilization of the coca leaf, including its processing. The production and 
marketing of coca leaves is currently prohibited under article 26 of the 1961 United Nations 
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, article 14, paragraph 2, of the 1988 
United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
recognizes that measures to eliminate illicit crops &#8220;shall respect fundamental human rights and 
shall take due account of traditional licit uses, where there is historic evidence of such use&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. At the end of the 1990s, during the period known as the &#8220;War on Drugs&#8221;, the &#8220;zero coca&#8221; 
policy, whose objective was the eradication of surplus crops, led to social clashes and the 
militarization of some areas of cultivation, notably in the tropical region of Cochabamba. The 
new revaluation policy of the Government now promotes the legal coca market by redefining the 
lawful growing area from 12,000 hectares to 20,000 hectares (reducing surplus cultivation 
by 6,000 hectares) and developing an eradication strategy in cooperation with the coca-grower 
unions. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Education policy 
</b></p>
<p>59. Bolivia has for many years been taking steps to implement a bilingual and intercultural 
education policy in the indigenous communities, which was strengthened beginning in 1994 by 
the Education Reform Act (No. 1565). The draft new Constitution now recognizes the right to 
&#8220;intracultural, intercultural and multilingual&#8221; education (art. 27, para. 12), whose objective is to 
&#8220;eliminate illiteracy through programmes that correspond to the current cultural and linguistic 
situation of the population&#8221; (art. 84). 
</p>
<p>60. The Act proposes the development of the native languages and their official acceptance in 
the highlands and lowlands, accompanied by the development of vocabularies, criteria for the 
official acceptance of Aymara, Quechua and Guaran&#237;, the development of native language 
teaching materials, the compiling of dictionaries, etc. It also proposes new curricula for the 
plurinational education system, general guidelines concerning the use of native languages, the 
development of teaching materials in languages such as Tsimane and Tacana and the recording, 
to date, of the alphabets of 22 native languages. 
</p>
<p>61. There have been a number of successful and positive experiences, such as the Kawsay 
Indigenous Intercultural University (UNIK) in the department of Oruro, whose curriculum is 
tailored to the needs and traditional technologies of the Andean region. In 2001, the Public 
University of El Alto - a city with a predominantly Aymaran population - was established. 
Efforts are also being made in the areas of bilingual intercultural instruction in regular institutes 
of higher learning; the design and development of curricula and teaching materials; and the 
establishment of the Native Peoples&#8217; Education Councils. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Nevertheless, complaints have been received of the failure to adapt the national education 
system to the traditional indigenous cultures and world view, and of the poor results achieved to 
date. According to the World Bank, school performance was 12 per cent lower among 
indigenous children than among non-indigenous children, and the average increase for each year 
of schooling is lower among indigenous than among non-indigenous children. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>63. It is calculated that 80 per cent of the indigenous population does not have access to health 
facilities. Among the causes for the indigenous population&#8217;s limited access to health services is 
social exclusion, including factors of both discrimination and self-exclusion on the basis of 
indigenous origin. 
</p>
<p>64. The new Government has promoted a policy of &#8220;intercultural health&#8221;, whose components 
include the adaptation of public health services to traditional indigenous medicine, including the 
strengthening of traditional medicine and the use of traditional plants. For its part, the 
Vice-Ministry of Traditional Medicine and Interculturalism, which comes under the Ministry of 
Health, has promoted a series of agreements with indigenous organizations aimed at 
incorporating and facilitating access to traditional indigenous medicine and to supporting the 
National Council on Indigenous Health. The Government has also promoted the inclusion of 
practices that respect indigenous women&#8217;s customs relating to childbirth in the context of 
hospital care. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  The persistence of racism 
</b></p>
<p>65. One of the most worrying human rights issues in Bolivia at the present time is the 
persistence of manifestations of racism against indigenous people. The social and political 
situation in the past few years has led to a resurgence of racially discriminatory expressions and 
practices in the country, often having to do with historical and geographical polarization between 
the Andean region and the lowlands of the northern and eastern parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>66. In the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to note the prevalence of 
manifestations of racism against indigenous persons in the public discourse. Racist insults and 
attacks are aimed at indigenous persons at every level, from indigenous members of the 
Government and of the Constituent Assembly to ordinary indigenous peasant women in big 
cities. These racist attacks are also aimed at the most visible symbols of indigenous identity, as 
evidenced by the burning of <i>whipalas</i> (indigenous flags) in demonstrations organized by sectors 
opposed to the current Administration. 
</p>
<p>67. Much of the responsibility for the rise of racist discourse in contemporary Bolivian society 
lies with certain social and political sectors in the eastern departments, including political parties 
and various civil pressure groups. These groups sometimes accompany their demands for 
autonomy and their legitimate claims in a democratic society by a lack of respect for the 
predominantly indigenous population and its equally legitimate aspirations to overcome the 
injustices to which it has historically been subjected. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. Responsibility for the resurgence of racism in public life also lies in part with the 
communication media, almost all of which are controlled by sectors opposed to the current 
Administration. Some indigenous organizations have complained that the real situation of 
indigenous people in Bolivia has been distorted and that veritable media campaigns have been 
mounted against their leaders. There have been episodes of racially-tinged political violence, 
especially in Beni, Santa Cruz and other eastern departments, resulting from current political 
tensions, having to do, inter alia, with processes for the recovery and recognition of indigenous 
territories. The indigenous organizations in the lowlands complain of a campaign to persecute 
indigenous leaders and organizations orchestrated by powerful groups that bring together 
business sectors, local authorities, civic committees and other groups, such as the Santa Cruz 
Youth Union. 
</p>
<p>69. Particularly serious among the many cases compiled by the Special Rapporteur were 
the 2006 attacks against the participants in the Grand Assembly of the Guarayo People, as well 
as a series of attacks against Chiquitano indigenous leaders and other inhabitants of the towns of 
San Juli&#225;n, Guarayos, San Ram&#243;n and San Javier, which involved the destruction of offices, 
vehicles and other equipment belonging to various branch offices of the Chiquitano Indigenous 
Organization. 
</p>
<p>70. Another outbreak of violence occurred towards the end of 2007 during the last stages of 
the debate concerning the new Constitution and its approval, when a series of physical and 
verbal assaults of a racist nature were perpetrated against indigenous and peasant organizations 
in Sucre - headquarters of the Constituent Assembly - and even against indigenous members of 
the Assembly. These attacks included the destruction of the headquarters of the Chuquisaca 
Federation of Native Communities in August 2007 and that of the Chuquisaca indigenous 
women and workers in November of the same year. 
</p>
<p>71. In some of these incidents, there is evidence of the involvement of public officials of the 
respective prefectures or municipalities opposed to the new Constitution. Likewise, there have 
been complaints concerning the participation of students and authorities from the local 
universities in setting up assault groups, in blatant violation of the principles of equality and 
respect for diversity that should underlie university ethics. 
</p>
<p>72. In this connection, both the former and current Special Rapporteurs, 
Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen and Mr. James Anaya, have expressed concern in press releases 
dated 10 April 2008 and 29 May 2008, respectively, over the commission of discriminatory 
and racist acts towards the indigenous peoples of Bolivia. The former Special Rapporteur noted 
with concern and condemned &#8220;the recent attacks suffered by government officials and members 
of the Guaran&#237; people in the Chaco region of Santa Cruz. The attacks have taken place in the 
context of the ongoing process of recognition of the traditional territories of the Guaran&#237; people, 
many of whose members still live under conditions of serfdom&#8221;. In addition, the current Special 
Rapporteur noted with concern and strongly condemned &#8220;the racist and discriminatory acts of 
violence, threats, and humiliations suffered by at least 20 indigenous people at the hands of 
groups intending to prevent the arrival of President Evo Morales to Sucre on May 24&#8221;. In 
addition, he expressed his alarm at &#8220;the violent acts of April 13 in El Chaco, Bolivia, which 
resulted in the injuries of some 40 people, including indigenous Guaran&#237;, members of the 
Asamblea del Pueblo Guaran&#237;, public officials and journalists who were in the community of 
Itacuat&#237;a to carry out the title clearance process of the ancestral territories of the Guaran&#237; people&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. The indigenous peoples&#8217; struggle for equality and participation, following centuries of 
oppression and exploitation, has been interpreted by some sectors of the non-indigenous 
population and by some members of the political and economic elite, who have traditionally held 
the reins of power in the country, as a direct attack on their privileges and identity. There is a 
widespread perception circulating in some of the media that indigenous persons are seeking 
political power in order to establish an exclusivist indigenous State, from which all other 
Bolivians will be excluded. The indigenous organizations have themselves been accused of being 
racist and discriminatory towards the non-indigenous population (including whites, creoles and 
mestizos). While it is true that some radical indigenous groups have, on occasion, demonstrated 
their rejection of various non-indigenous sectors, at no time did the Special Rapporteur 
encounter racist sentiments (although he did encounter anti-racist convictions) among the 
responsible members and legitimate leadership of the many indigenous organizations of Bolivia, 
whether inside or outside the current Administration.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The cultural and social identity of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, which for so long 
was denied and repressed, is rapidly being transformed through processes of social 
mobilization, political participation and economic change, in which the indigenous peoples 
themselves have become key actors. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Since coming to power in 2005, the Government has initiated profound political, legal 
and institutional reforms with the aim of reversing the situation of exclusion and 
marginalization of the predominantly indigenous population in the context of a new State 
model. Some of these reforms have met with opposition from some social, political and 
economic sectors, particularly in the eastern departments, leading to the state of crisis in 
which the country currently finds itself. The confrontation between these sectors and the 
central Government has its roots in historical models of differentiation between the various 
regions and peoples of Bolivia. This has created a very disturbing rise in racism, including 
physical and verbal assaults against indigenous leaders and human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The draft new Constitution approved by the Constituent Assembly in December 2007 
reflects the intention to redefine the relationship between the State and the indigenous 
peoples based on the premise of the multicultural and plurinational nature of Bolivian 
society. The recognition of the rights of the indigenous peoples in the draft text takes full 
account of the provisions of ILO Convention No. 169 and of the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which have already been incorporated into domestic 
law, as well as other international norms on the subject. 
</b>77. <b>The main challenges to the enjoyment of the rights of the indigenous peoples in 
Bolivia are access to land and recognition of their traditional territories, in both the 
Andean region, which is characterized by the scarcity and fragmentation of indigenous 
land ownership, and the low-lying Amazonian, Chaco and eastern regions, where 
indigenous territories are threatened by the powerful interests of the farming and forestry 
industries. The lack of access to land and territory perpetuates low levels of human 
development, social exclusion and other phenomena affecting the majority of indigenous 
communities. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The environmental pollution of many indigenous territories as a consequence of 
mining operations, especially in Oruro and Potos&#237;, and of hydrocarbon production in the 
Chaco and Amazonian regions, has not been subject to effective environmental control by 
the competent authorities, nor has it given rise to the proper consultation procedures to 
which the indigenous peoples are entitled. Instead, it has posed serious problems to the 
health and traditional economic activities of the indigenous communities. Despite the many 
complaints submitted to this effect, there is a reported failure to provide redress and 
compensation by those responsible for the polluting activities. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Urgent attention must be given to eliminating persistent servitude and forced labour 
and the holding captive of some indigenous communities in the country, which are vestiges 
of historic practices of landowner domination, as in the case of the Guaran&#237; people in the 
Chaco. By way of a solution, the Government is proceeding to the reversion of properties 
where such conditions exist and to the restoration of the lands to their legitimate 
indigenous owners. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The gradual encroachment on lowland indigenous territories as a result of the 
extension of agribusiness, the exploitation of natural resources and an influx of settlers 
from other regions of the country has left some indigenous peoples in a particularly 
vulnerable position. The Yuqui and Ayoreo, and other peoples with whom contact has been 
established only recently or who live in isolation, are experiencing a major social and 
cultural upheaval and are frequently the victims of discrimination in their dealings with 
other social sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Bolivia is currently faced with the challenge of building a pluralistic, intercultural, 
participatory, inclusive and democratic society. All sectors of the country - indigenous and 
non-indigenous - now have the opportunity and the responsibility to contribute to this 
historic process without resentment or hatred. If this is achieved in a peaceful and tolerant 
manner and with a spirit of solidarity and mutual comprehension, all Bolivians will gain 
from it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legislation and institutional structure 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the National Congress of Bolivia should 
carry out the legislative reforms needed to regulate the exercise of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights as recognized in the draft new Constitution and in the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which has the status of domestic law. Priority should be 
given to the regulation of indigenous autonomy and administration of justice, as well as to 
the harmonization of sectoral legislation with indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>With regard to the exercise of indigenous self-determination and autonomy, the State 
authorities must take indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional structures of government and 
territorial organization into account when formulating and implementing public policy. 
The State might give consideration to redefining political and administrative divisions at 
the local and regional levels in order to facilitate efforts to reconstitute indigenous 
territories and forms of government. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends, in particular, that departmental and local 
authorities should develop their own public policies relating to the indigenous peoples, in 
consultation with the authorities and organizations representing the peoples concerned and 
in strict adherence to the criteria set forth in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention No. 169. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends expediting training for Bolivian public 
authorities and officials, especially judges, magistrates and other agents of justice, in the 
legal norms relating to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Steps should be taken to strengthen the institutional structure and activities of the 
Indigenous Rights Mainstreaming Unit and the Community-Based Policy Department of 
the Ministry of the Presidency with a view to effectively coordinating public policy in areas 
of direct concern to the indigenous peoples, including the implementation of the 
recommendations included in the present report and the decisions and recommendations of 
other human rights bodies and mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Lands, territories and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that special priority should be accorded to the 
agrarian land regularization process under the new Community-Based Agrarian Reform 
Renewal Act (No. 3545), paying particular attention to the titling of the indigenous TCOs, 
in both the lowlands and the highlands. To that end, the Government should provide the 
relevant institutions with the human and financial resources needed, drawing on 
international cooperation where possible. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Particular attention should be given to implementing the regulations concerning 
consultation and preparation of environmental impact studies in relation to the exploration 
and exploitation of natural resources in indigenous lands and territories. The relevant 
authorities should ensure that new contracts with private companies guarantee respect for 
indigenous rights in accordance with the new legislation in force. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Enterprises operating in Bolivia should draw up and implement clear and precise 
guidelines for their operations to exploit natural resources in indigenous territories, 
including indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participation and consultation, taking into account 
existing legislation and the international norms and standards established by the 
international financial institutions in relation to indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The relevant authorities should, as a matter of urgency, carry out a general study on 
the pollution of the indigenous territories in the country and, in consultation with the 
communities affected, implement such measures of inspection, relief, redress, 
compensation, prevention and punishment as may be necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the competent authorities of Bolivia and 
Brazil should, in a spirit of open cooperation, take all necessary measures to ensure 
consultation with the indigenous communities that will be affected by the hydrology 
projects along the Madeira River on both sides of the border in order to avoid any 
unnecessary infringement of their rights as a result of such projects. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes a special appeal to public authorities at all levels and 
to political parties, indigenous organizations, civic organizations, the media, academic 
institutions and other political and social sectors, to refrain from any manifestation of 
discrimination towards persons and groups on the basis of their indigenous origin and to 
launch a sincere and wide-ranging debate in Bolivian society with the aim of enhancing 
mutual understanding and interaction between the various communities and nations of the 
country. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the authorities should strengthen their 
policies to combat all forms of discrimination. As part of these policies, the Government 
might implement a national plan to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, 
following the principles of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>It is recommended that the Government should promote efforts to define racial 
discrimination as a punishable offence in Bolivia&#8217;s domestic law, as well as adopt specific 
legislation to combat discrimination in all spheres. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur suggests that the Government should encourage reflection on 
the responsibility of the public or private media in combating racism and racial 
discrimination. The various media should adopt a code of conduct prohibiting all forms of 
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur suggests that the Government of Bolivia should consider the 
possibility of inviting the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to carry out an official visit to the 
country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Particularly vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government should, as a matter of 
priority, strengthen measures for the suppression of all forms of servitude and forced 
labour in the country, with the technical assistance of ILO and other relevant agencies and 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government should strengthen 
intersectoral efforts to support the Yuqui people and other peoples in a highly vulnerable 
situation, with a view to the development of coordinated and systematic action to safeguard 
the rights of these peoples, with particular emphasis on the areas of health and territorial 
protection. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  The situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that attacks against leaders of indigenous 
organizations and human rights defenders should continue to be investigated and 
punished, and that the police should afford the necessary protection to such persons in the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>event of threats or attacks against them. In particular, he recommends that an exhaustive 
investigation should be conducted into the possible responsibility of the public authorities 
for such attacks, and that appropriate disciplinary measures should be taken. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes a special appeal for dialogue and cooperation to be 
promoted between the Government, United Nations agencies and bodies, and bilateral and 
multilateral donors working in areas of particular interest to the indigenous peoples, and, 
in consultation with indigenous organizations, for use to be made of existing possibilities 
for international cooperation in this area. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>It is recommended that the Government should give consideration to obtaining 
technical cooperation from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), ILO and other appropriate organizations and agencies in 
formulating and implementing new legislation and public policies of particular relevance to 
the human rights of the indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>It is recommended that OHCHR should place particular emphasis on the promotion 
of efforts to give effect to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples in cooperation with the Bolivian authorities, indigenous organizations and other 
relevant actors. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>It is recommended to the United Nations country team that efforts should be made to 
continue and strengthen the activities of the National Council for Dialogue among 
Indigenous, Native, Peasant Peoples and the United Nations System, with the participation 
of the representatives of the various agencies, funds and organizations comprising the 
United Nations country team. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>It is recommended to the Partners for Bolivia Group (GRUS) that efforts should be 
made to continue and strengthen the activities of the Sectoral Group for Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, in coordination with the indigenous organizations and the relevant 
government institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>G.  Academic centres 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that universities and academic institutions 
should pay particular attention to and bring their curricula into line with the principles of 
multiculturalism and the promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples, together with the 
development of intercultural attitudes, practices and institutions. In no circumstances 
should universities accept or promote expressions of racial discrimination, and academic 
authorities should encourage the adoption of codes of conduct along these lines.
