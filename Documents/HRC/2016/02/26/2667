<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> </b>The situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s<b> 
 Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council,  
</i></p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the 
Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including Council resolution 19/13 of 22 March 
2012 and Assembly resolution 67/181 of 20 December 2012, and urging the 
implementation of those resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing</i> in mind paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statement made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on 14 January 2013 calling for a full-fledged international inquiry into serious 
crimes in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> the reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and taking note of the nine 
patterns of human rights violations identified in his recent report ,1 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the view by the Special Rapporteur, expressed in his report, that there is a 
need for the establishment of an inquiry mechanism with adequate resources to investigate 
and more fully document the grave, systematic and widespread violations of human rights 
in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and stressing the urgent need for the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the fact that, on 28 February 2013, a group of special procedures 
mandate holders jointly expressed their support for an international inquiry into human 
rights abuses in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the persisting deterioration in the human rights situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, at the continuing reports of systematic, widespread 
</p>
<p>and grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and at the unresolved questions of international 
concern relating to abductions of nationals of other States, and urging the Government of 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to respect all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms fully, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, in particular the use of torture and labour camps 
</p>
<p>against political prisoners and repatriated citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, and urging the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to immediately end those 
</p>
<p>practices and to release all political prisoners unconditionally and without delay, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>regretting</i> the refusal of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea to recognize the mandate of the Special Rapporteur or to extend full 
cooperation to him and allow him access to the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its serious concern</i> at the refusal of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to articulate, by the time of the adoption by the Human Rights 
Council of the outcome report of its universal periodic review in March 2010, which 
recommendations enjoyed its support, and regretting the lack of action taken by the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to date to implement the recommendations 
contained in that report, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> by the precarious humanitarian situation in the country, exacerbated by its 
national policy priorities, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms of its entire population, including by ensuring access to adequate 
food, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that particular risk factors affect women, children, persons with 
disabilities and the elderly, and the need to ensure the full enjoyment of all their human 
rights and fundamental freedoms by them against neglect, abuse, exploitation and violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of States&#8217; engaging fully and constructively with the 
universal periodic review process and with other mechanisms of the Human Rights Council 
for the improvement of their human rights situations, 
</p>

<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the ongoing grave, widespread and systematic human 
rights violations in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Commends </i>the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea for the activities undertaken to date and his 
</p>
<p>continued efforts in the conduct of the mandate, despite the limited access to information; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 19/13, for a period of one year; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also decides</i> to establish, for a period of one year, a commission of inquiry 
comprising three members, one of whom should be the Special Rapporteur, with the other 
two members appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Further decides</i> that the commission of inquiry will investigate the 
systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea as outlined in paragraph 31 of the report of the Special Rapporteur,1 
including the violation of the right to food, the violations associated with prison camps, 
torture and inhuman treatment, arbitrary detention, discrimination, violations of freedom of 
expression, violations of the right to life, violations of freedom of movement, and enforced 
disappearances, including in the form of abductions of nationals of other States, with a view 
to ensuring full accountability, in particular where these violations may amount to crimes 
against humanity; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and the commission of inquiry, and to permit 
them and their staff unrestricted access to visit the country and to provide them with all 
information necessary to enable them to fulfil their mandates; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
ensure full, rapid and unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance that is delivered on the 
basis of need, in accordance with humanitarian principles, coupled with adequate 
monitoring; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, regional 
intergovernmental organizations, mandate holders, interested institutions and independent 
experts and non-governmental organizations, to develop regular dialogue and cooperation 
with the Special Rapporteur and the commission of inquiry in the fulfilment of their 
mandates; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur and the 
commission of inquiry with all assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out their 
mandates effectively and to ensure that these mechanisms work with the support of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit regular reports on the 
implementation of his mandate to the Human Rights Council and to the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Requests</i> the commission of inquiry to present an oral update to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth 
session, and a written report to the Council at its twenty-fifth session; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Decides</i> to transmit all reports of the commission of inquiry to all relevant 
bodies of the United Nations and to the Secretary-General for appropriate action.
