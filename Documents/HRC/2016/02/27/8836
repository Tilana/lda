<b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 November to 11 
December 2009.  The review of Ethiopia was held at the 16th meeting, on 9 December 2009.  The 
delegation of Ethiopia was headed by Ambassador Fisseha Yimer, Special Adviser to the Minister, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At its 17th meeting, on 11 December 2009, the Working Group adopted 
the present report on Ethiopia.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs 
(troika) to facilitate the review of Ethiopia: Chile, Kyrgyzstan and Italy. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of  the annex to resolution 5/1, the following documents were 
issued for the review of Ethiopia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/ETH/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia and 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Ethiopia through the 
troika.  These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 16th meeting, the Special Adviser to the Minister for Foreign Affairs introduced the 
national report and indicated that it was prepared in a transparent and participatory manner with the 
participation of all relevant actors and stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that in 2009 Ethiopia&#8217;s State report on CEDAW was reviewed and a report 
submitted in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Also in 2009, 
reports were submitted in relation to ICCPR, ICESCR and CAT to the respective treaty bodies and are 
pending consideration.  
</p>
<p>7. Ethiopia indicated that the Federal Constitution provides that any law, customary practice or any 
decision of a state organ or public official which contravenes the Constitution shall be of no effect. The 
Federal Government and the Regional States have legislative, executive and judicial powers defined by 
the Federal Constitution. Ethiopia has two Federal Houses: the House of Peoples&#8217; Representatives 
comprised of persons elected for a period of five years and the House of Federation composed of 
representatives of the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia. One third of the provisions of the 
Federal Constitution are dedicated to fundamental human and democratic rights. The Constitution 
guarantees the rights of nations, nationalities and peoples to develop and preserve their culture and 
history. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. Ethiopia highlighted that the Federal Constitution guarantees every person&#8217;s inalienable right to 
life. While capital punishment is still permitted under the law and prisoners, the actual reality 
illustrates that capital punishment has been practically abolished. Only three death penalties have been 
carried out during the last 15 years. The Federal Constitution recently enacted criminal and criminal 
procedure codes prohibiting torture, inhumane and degrading treatment. The Federal Constitution also 
guarantees the rights of accused persons which include being brought before a court within 48 hours, 
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and to appeal to a competent court challenging any 
judgment against them. Accused persons also have a right to a public trial, except where their case 
relates to issues such as privacy, public morals and national security.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation indicated that persons of all religions are given equal opportunities for access to 
land to build places of worship. Christian and Muslim holidays are made public holidays by law, with 
the Government media agencies broadcasting the celebrations. Religious texts are circulated in 
increasing numbers and there is a strong tolerance among the various religions with people of different 
religions living in harmony.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation highlighted that with the introduction of press and media laws, and capacity-
building and professional ethics training for journalists, a number of print and electronic media, and 
radio and television broadcasting services, have emerged.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that the respect for the right to privacy has become prevalent with people 
demanding search warrants from police officers. Courts have ruled inadmissible evidence collected 
without a search warrant. Citizens have a constitutional right to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
demonstrations, with a proclamation being issued to establish procedures for peaceful demonstrations 
and public meetings. Freedom of association is also guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, as well as 
the right to vote, to be elected, to participate in elections and take part in the conduct of public affairs. 
Complaints relating to elections are directed to the Election Board with the option of appealing its 
decision to the Federal Court.  
</p>
<p>12. The delegation indicated that legal and policy measures were introduced to rectify the deep 
rooted political, economic and cultural bias against women. A number of laws &#8211; the Family Code, the 
Criminal Code and the Nationality law &#8211; have also been revised and amended. Equal rights for women, 
in marriage, divorce, custody of children, and rights to matrimonial properties are promoted.  
</p>
<p>13. With regard to the rights of the child, Ethiopia indicated that a National Plan of Action for 
Children has been implementing child-focused interventions in basic health-care, education and 
protection services for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, in collaboration with non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and other civil society groups.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that ownership of land, as well as natural resources, are vested in the State 
and the peoples, and thus not for sale. Peasants and pastoralists have a right to free land. Both women 
and men have equal rights to use, administer and bequeath land to their heirs.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation indicated that legislation has been introduced to effectively implement 
constitutional guarantees and lays the basis for protecting the rights of workers.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that with regard to education, Ethiopia has experienced increased primary 
school enrolments, including the promotion of universal and free primary education. Furthermore, a </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
rapid expansion of establishing new universities is undertaken in an endeavour to also ensure an even 
distribution of higher education across the nation.   
</p>
<p>17. The delegation noted that the right to form and join trade unions is constitutionally guaranteed 
for factory and service workers, farm labourers, and other rural workers. The labour law provides the 
procedures for exercising trade union rights. 
</p>
<p>18. On health related matters, Ethiopia indicated that the Health Sector Extension Programme has 
been introduced in recognition of the failure of essential services to reach the people at the grass-roots 
level. The plan involves the accelerated training of 30,000 health workers in order to reach universal 
coverage in all rural <i>kebeles, </i>with 24,571 health workers already trained and deployed.  Though still 
high, Ethiopia has made encouraging progress in reducing child mortality. The maternal mortality ratio 
of Ethiopia has declined. In order to further improve this situation, the health sector has given priority 
to increasing the coverage of maternal health service.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that some parts of the country repeatedly encounter chronic drought. 
Hence the country, to a certain degree, is dependent on international food aid to meet the overall food 
required for its population. Although several programs associated with food production have been 
devised to make Ethiopia food self-sufficient, the country is still unable to prevent seasonal shortage of 
food in certain parts.  
</p>
<p>20. The delegation stated that Ethiopia is hosting refugees from neighbouring countries in 13 refugee 
centres, in cooperation with international organizations such as UNHCR and ICRC. In most of these 
centres, international organizations maintain offices so that refugees have ready access to them. In 
addition to basic needs including water, food and shelter, every refugee centre is equipped with a 
primary school. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation stated that extensive training education on human rights for legislators and law 
enforcement officials have been conducted by the Government, the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commission and the Institution of the Ombudsman at the Federal level.  In a similar undertaking, a 
nationwide human rights training program for law enforcement officials has been undertaken. Various 
government organs have also initiated and organized human rights awareness raising activities for their 
professionals. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation stated that Civics and Ethical Education, which incorporate the ideals of human 
rights, has started at the primary, secondary and tertiary level throughout Ethiopia in public, private, 
secular or religious schools. Human rights courses are also incorporated in the curricula of military and 
police training schools, with emphasis placed on the role of the police and military officers in the 
protection of human rights in peace or during armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that there are numerous human rights challenges Ethiopia is facing, mostly 
due to its economic situation, socio-cultural context, and the persistence of certain traditional practices, 
and other difficulties and constraints.  
</p>
<p>24. The delegation stressed that Ethiopia is committed to continuing its cooperation with the United 
Nations human rights organs and will consider extending further invitations for country visits by 
United Nations special rapporteurs. <b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the inter-active dialogue, statements were made by 53 delegations. A number of 
delegations thanked Ethiopia for its commitment to the universal periodic review process, noted that 
the national report was prepared with the contributions of civil society organisations, and commended 
Ethiopia for being a State party to most core international human right treaties and for submitting its 
reports to a number of treaty bodies. Recommendations made during the interactive dialogue are listed 
in Chapter II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>26. Algeria welcomed the adoption of the Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End 
Poverty and asked whether an evaluation on its impact on the standard of living had been conducted. It 
appreciated the progress in the area of health care. Noting that malnutrition accounted for 54 per cent 
of child mortality, Algeria recognized Ethiopia&#8217;s important progress to ensuring food security and 
stated that water scarcity and drought continued to severely affect certain regions of the country. 
Policies for the realization of the right to education, in particular, basic education, were also noted.  
</p>
<p>27. Belgium highlighted Ethiopia&#8217;s difficulties to ensure food self-sufficiency. Belgium stated the 
reticence of authorities to ensuring access of the international community to the Ogaden region. United 
Nations and NGOs being unable to carry out their work properly undermines the distribution of food 
packages and medication. Belgium asked about programmes for becoming self-sufficient on food 
production, and if these were subject to an independent evaluation.  
</p>
<p>28. Turkey appreciated the establishment of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and 
the Mediator&#8217;s Office. It welcomed that primary and secondary basic education is free of charge. It 
congratulated Ethiopia for legislative amendments to reduce gender inequalities, and modifications in 
family laws that enable women to have equal rights in marriage and custody. It encouraged Ethiopia to 
continue efforts in the application of CEDAW and asked about the application of the National Action 
Plan aimed at the re-adaptation of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>29. Belarus positively valued the efforts in overcoming poverty, hunger and destitution, and noted 
that the lack of food and medicine are key problems. Belarus expressed its support to Ethiopia&#8217;s 
requests to international organizations for development assistance. It commended Ethiopia for the 
measures to improve the situation of women, including the possibilities extended to participate in 
political life, and welcomed the adoption of a National Plan of Action for Children.  
</p>
<p>30. Egypt commended Ethiopia&#8217;s efforts on socio-economic rights, resulting in the increase of 
enrolment rates in primary education and for the comprehensive human rights education programme. It 
noted the number of instruments adopted to enable women to enjoy all rights in equal terms with men, 
such as the National Policy on Women, the National Action Plan on Gender Equality and the 
Women&#8217;s Development Package. It requested information on progress achieved so far.  
</p>
<p>31. The United Kingdom asked how consultations with civil society will continue in the follow-up to 
the review and how Ethiopia will ensure that the new Civil Society Organizations Law does not 
constrain independent human rights organizations. It commended Ethiopia&#8217;s priority given to the 
MDGs, including the progress made in free and universal primary education. It appreciated the 
continuing development of EHRC and urged Ethiopia to move quickly to appoint a new Chief 
Commissioner.  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p><p>32. Djibouti commended Ethiopia for its cooperation with OHCHR in submitting reports to treaty 
bodies. It appreciated the improvement in women&#8217;s participation in political life. It noted the 
provisions of the new criminal code of 2005 criminalizing harmful traditional practices, and that the 
awareness raising campaigns against female genital mutilation had decreased the acceptance rates by 
the communities. Djibouti requested information on the system of data collection to evaluate progress 
and Ethiopia&#8217;s evaluation of the level of cooperation between federal and regional institutions and 
public organs.  
</p>
<p>33. Finland referred to concerns by the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders over police 
brutality, torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and unfair trials. It noted reports of insufficient 
control of police powers to arrest and detain suspects by prosecutors or courts. It asked to what extent 
legal institutions safeguard citizens from maltreatment and about the organization of protection by the 
government at different levels of society. It also asked how the scope of action of human rights 
defenders is safeguarded in Ethiopia.  
</p>
<p>34. Canada welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s commitment to consider extending invitations for country visits to 
United Nations special procedures and encouraged these visits. Canada reiterated that the 2009 
Charities and Societies Proclamation is a source of serious concern. Canada noted that the full and 
unfettered participation of all political parties in the electoral process is critical to successful elections 
and Ethiopia&#8217;s ongoing stability and future prosperity. Canada commended the legislative reform 
undertaken to address female genital mutilation.  
</p>
<p>35. France asked Ethiopia about intentions to create a parliamentary inquiry commission to clarify 
the events in the aftermath of the 2005 elections, and on the establishment of an independent inquiry 
commission on alleged human rights violations in Ogaden in 2005 and in the context of the April 2007 
offensive. It enquired about measures to ensure that laws relating to the press and the fight against 
terrorism do not lead to abusive restrictions, projected law reforms on civil society and measures taken 
in relation to FGM and domestic violence. France welcomed the recent signature of a code of conduct 
with opposition forces and the agreed deployment of a European observation mission of the May 2010 
elections.  
</p>
<p>36. Austria noted that the CRC expressed concern about discrimination against girls, children with 
disabilities, children living in poverty, children affected by HIV/AIDS and refugee and ethnic minority 
children, and requested information on follow-up. It noted that the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women were concerned about 
high numbers of women and girls victims of sexual violence and abuse and about widespread impunity 
for perpetrators of such acts. Austria enquired about the Government&#8217;s plans to address these serious 
concerns.  
</p>
<p>37. Australia commended the efforts to increase primary school enrolments and develop health 
services. It noted indications of concerns relating to the treatment of ethnic minorities during internal 
conflict and the calls for independent investigations of these allegations, and asked whether Ethiopia 
intends to undertake such an investigation. It noted that the United Nations independent expert on 
minority issues stated that Ethiopia should ensure civil society groups are free from interference and 
harassment. It noted concerns about political detainees in Ethiopia, including the case of a detained 
political leader.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38. The Russian Federation, while noting the serious challenges faced, noted with satisfaction the 
progress achieved in providing political stability and national unity, strengthening democratic 
institutions, including the national human rights institutions, and developing education and health. 
</p>
<p>39. Germany expressed concerns at persisting gender disparity on many levels due to differences in 
access to control over resources between men and women, women&#8217;s limited access to education, and 
the still limited political representation and decision-making power. Germany asked about further steps 
envisaged to addressing this issue.  
</p>
<p>40. The Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomed efforts to <i>inter alia</i> reduce maternal and child 
mortality by improving access to medical care and to combat unemployment by more job-oriented 
teaching. It also welcomed the campaign against various prejudices concerning women, and measures 
to combat practices that keep women in the state of inferiority. It requested explanations about notions 
of &#8220;nations&#8221;, &#8220;nationalities&#8221; and &#8220;peoples&#8221; in Ethiopia. It also asked Ethiopia to comment on the 
results for development obtained mid-term regarding the MDGs.  
</p>
<p>41. Mexico noted difficulties Ethiopia faced and appreciated priority given to ensuring food security. 
It stressed efforts to prevent trafficking in persons and to prohibit torture in the new criminal code, to 
eradicate HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and to eliminate harmful traditional practices as female 
genital mutilations and child marriages. Mexico requested information on international technical 
assistance required to reduce poverty.  
</p>
<p>42. The United States was concerned that the recent law classifies NGOs receiving more than ten per 
cent of their budget from foreign sources as &#8220;foreign charities&#8221; and prevents them from working on 
human rights. The United States noted that most senior government institutions are overwhelmingly 
represented by one ethnicity. It was concerned that Ethiopia has not allowed ICRC to operate in the 
Ogaden since 2008 and that other organisations have found access limited. The United States 
welcomed the pre-departure orientation to migrant workers, while expressing concern over the limited 
capacity to prosecute trafficking crimes.  
</p>
<p>43. The Czech Republic asked how the implementation of obligations from human rights treaties is 
ensured in national legislation, including the principle of non-discrimination and the right to privacy.   
</p>
<p>44. The Netherlands noted several outstanding requests for visits of special procedures mandate-
holders. It expressed concerns at the restrictive nature and possible negative consequences for the work 
of NGOs of the Proclamation for the Registration and Regulation of Charities and Societies. It also 
noted that the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, particularly the broad definition of terrorism, placing the 
burden of proof on criminal suspects and high sentences, was a cause of concern.  
</p>
<p>45. Somalia welcomed the form of federalism of Ethiopia which allows minority groups and the 
various ethnic groups to exercise their cultural, social and economic rights. It highlighted remarkable 
achievements in the implementation of social and economic rights through the expansion of health, 
education and other services. Somalia welcomed the delivery of comprehensive human rights 
education programmes.  
</p>
<p>46. Nigeria highlighted the efforts made to broaden the space for freedom of expression by issuing 
licenses to a number of press outlets. It applauded efforts for establishing the comprehensive human </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
rights education programmes delivered through the federal and state civic and ethical education 
programmes.  
</p>
<p>47. Spain noted its interest for Ethiopia&#8217;s policies and strategies, particularly regarding the rights of 
women and combating gender violence. Spain noted efforts to improve the protection of the rights of 
women, in particular the National Policy on Women, the National Action Plan on Gender Equality and 
the Women&#8217;s Development Package.  
</p>
<p>48. Brazil highlighted the free anti-retroviral programme to combat HIV/AIDS and the awareness 
campaign against female genital mutilation. It welcomed Ethiopia&#8217;s continuous hosting of large 
numbers of refugees. Brazil asked how the National Policy on Women addresses domestic and sexual 
violence and about specific institutions to investigate cases of gender violence and ensure redress. It 
expressed concern about women&#8217;s limited access to education and encouraged Ethiopia to continue 
efforts to reduce the maternal mortality ratio. Brazil expressed concern for the deteriorating food 
security situation in some regions of Ethiopia and encouraged the international community to increase 
humanitarian resources, to eliminate trade-distorting subsidies and to enhance technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>49. Ethiopia indicated that detailed responses to all recommendations and questions will be 
addressed in a written submission to the Human Rights Council before the thirteenth session.  
</p>
<p>50.  Ethiopia stated that the recently enacted civil society law is the only legislation where 
stakeholders were consulted at the level of the Prime Minister. The law is in force and Ethiopia 
considers it serves the national interest. The delegation did not consider the need to repeal the law. The 
law needs an opportunity to operate before a review is considered. The registration of existing 
organisations and new organisations is ongoing.   
</p>
<p>51. On the anti-terrorism legislation, Ethiopia had looked at corresponding legislation in other 
countries. It did not consider that a review of this legislation is warranted at this time as it is working 
well. The delegation did not consider that the legislation contravenes the freedom of expression and 
freedom of the media. In enacting it, efforts were made to ensure that the obligations under 
international human rights law are complied with. There is law protecting rights and in the case of 
infractions, victims may go to court to seek appropriate relief.   
</p>
<p>52. Ethiopia is not against visits of special rapporteurs, and has extended invitations in the past. 
However, due consideration must be given to the preparations required for such visits. In principle, 
Ethiopia is supportive of visits by special rapporteurs and will consider the requests for such visits as 
and when received. 
</p>
<p>53. Ethiopia indicated that humanitarian assistance throughout the country, access to regions for 
food distribution and policies and programmes for food production are all in place but their 
implementation is still in progress. The delegation stressed that it will not accept that any region in 
Ethiopia was denied access to food.  
</p>
<p>54. As regards Ethiopia&#8217;s human rights implementation, the delegation indicated that it did not know 
any country that will claim that its human rights implementation is perfect. The delegation stated that 
Ethiopia will try its best to live up to its obligations.  
</p>
<p>55. Ethiopia stated that a national action plan for persons with disabilities is being developed.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. The delegation highlighted that a Ministry for Women&#8217;s Affairs exists at cabinet level. It 
acknowledged that trafficking of women is a problem and is tackled under the penal law, criminal code 
and other legislation.  
</p>
<p>57. The delegation indicated that 65 parties adhere to the code of conduct for political parties, which 
is currently under consideration by Parliament to become law. The delegation expected the code to 
meet wide acceptance and contribute to a smooth election in May 2010.   
</p>
<p>58. With regard to the relationship between the Federal Government and the Regional Governments, 
the delegation emphasised that this cooperation is working well.  
</p>
<p>59. On the issue and scope of action on human rights defenders, the delegation noted that as long as 
human rights defenders operate within the law, there should be no problem. 
</p>
<p>60. As regards Ogaden, the delegation noted that Ethiopia has carried out its own investigation, 
while the outcome thereof may not be to the liking of those who desired a different result. The 
delegation stated that no sovereign state has an obligation to establish an international commission of 
enquiry.  
</p>
<p>61. Ethiopia agreed with the recommendation to cooperate with the United Nations and NGOs. The 
delegation noted that it does not consider there is harassment of civil society organisations in Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>62. The delegation indicated that Ethiopia is proud that it is a party to the major human rights 
instruments. In noting that Ethiopia is not party to any of the Optional Protocols, the delegation 
considered this to be a different matter to be studied on its merits.  
</p>
<p>63. Latvia noted that several requests by special procedures mandate holders to visit Ethiopia have 
not been accepted yet, despite still pending requests by special procedures mandate holders to visit.  
</p>
<p>64. Slovenia commended Ethiopia for the National Plan of Action for Children. It highlighted that 
the Government campaign significantly reduced the acceptance rate of female genital mutilation   by 
the community, which remains the most common form of violence against women and girls in 
Ethiopia. It asked about measures to reinforce efforts in this regard. Slovenia mentioned that a number 
of outstanding requests for visits of several special procedures mandate-holders, including the special 
rapporteurs on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and on the right to food and the working 
group on arbitrary detention.  
</p>
<p>65. The Holy See noted that Ethiopia&#8217;s multiethnic character was not yet reflected in the government 
composition. It asked about the measures intended to achieve a more equitable power-sharing. It noted 
that maternal and child mortality, despite of a recent decline, remains high. The Holy See added that 
despite laws adopted by the Government, women are still suffering from all kinds of discrimination, 
that female genital mutilation is widespread, women have limited access to education, and that their 
right of inheritance is problematic.  
</p>
<p>66. Argentina appreciated the delegation&#8217;s readiness to explain the situation in Ethiopia and in 
particular on what has been done for the most vulnerable sectors of the population. It also appreciated 
Ethiopia&#8217;s readiness to provide primary education free of charge.  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p><p>67. Sweden thanked the delegation for having addressed concerns in relation to the new civil society 
organisations law, which it noted restricts the ability of human rights organizations and defenders to 
operate. It expressed concerns on the Anti-Terror Proclamation, as it provides for inter alia a broad 
definition of terrorism. Sweden noted reports of persons held in custody for up to four months before 
being brought to court. It hoped efforts to improve respect for human rights will extend to political 
prisoners, the continued use of the death penalty, and the situation in the Somali region.  
</p>
<p>68. Nicaragua highlighted the progress made to guarantee most basic rights of its populations such 
as health, education and housing. It noted that extreme poverty is an obstacle. Nicaragua commended 
Ethiopia&#8217;s holistic vision and noted that its national report reflects important challenges that the State 
is willing to face in the area of human rights, in particular in the areas of public health, education and 
culture, environment and State administration.  
</p>
<p>69. Azerbaijan noted with interest the information on the provision of freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion as well as an environment of religious tolerance. Azerbaijan noted concerns 
relating to malnutrition, infections, low levels of access to reproductive health and emergency obstetric 
services, maternal mortality and morbidity rate, and insufficient resources to address them. It 
commended the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs.  
</p>
<p>70. China welcomed the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, the National 
Electoral Board and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs. China mentioned the improved enrolment rate 
for general education and the rapid development of higher education, and noted that essential primary 
health care was provided at household level to combat HIV/AIDS. China requested information on 
new measures for the protection and promotion of the rights of women and on how to combat harmful 
traditional practices.  
</p>
<p>71. Cameroon noted with interest the specific measures and provisions undertaken such as on
