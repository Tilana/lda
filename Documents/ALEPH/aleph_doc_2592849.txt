stock options to any eligible participant.
Stock options give the holder the right to purchase shares of Common Stock 
within a specified time at a specified price. Two types of stock options may be 
granted under the 2016 Plan: ISOs, which are subject to special U.S. tax 
treatment as
described below, and nonstatutory options, or &#147;NSOs.&#148; As specified in 
the applicable award agreement, awards of stock options may be subject to 
vesting conditions, may provide for accelerated exercisability, including in the
event of the
optionee&#146;s death, disability, or retirement or other events, and may 
provide for expiration in the event the optionee ceases to be an employee. The 
exercise price of a stock option shall be the fair market value (as defined in 
the 2016 Plan) of
a share of Common Stock at the time of grant as determined by the Committee 
unless the option is being granted in substitution for an outstanding option as
part of a corporate transaction (such as a merger). Notwithstanding, if an ISO 
is granted to
a person who, at the time of grant, owns Common Stock possessing more than 10% 
of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company&#146;s voting 
stock, such ISO cannot have an exercise price less than 110% of the fair market 
value of a
share of Common Stock at the time of grant and cannot expire more than five 
(5)&nbsp;years after the date of the original grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon 
exercise, the
exercise price of a stock option may be paid in cash or cash equivalents or, at 
the discretion of the Committee, by the surrender of Common Stock already owned 
by the optionee, by delivering an irrevocable instruction directing a securities
broker
to sell all or part of the shares being purchased, by delivering a full recourse
promissory note, or by making payment in any other form consistent with 
applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the 2016 Plan, and except as 
described in an
award agreement for MIP Shares that are granted in the form of stock options 
designated as NSOs, no grant of options can become exercisable sooner than after
one (1) year. The expiration dates of options cannot be more than ten 
(10)&nbsp;years after
the date of the original grant. The Committee may offer to buy out an 
outstanding stock option for cash or cash equivalents or authorize an optionee 
to elect to cash out an outstanding option provided that cash payments shall not
exceed the fair
market value less the exercise price. Prior to the issuance of shares of Common

qualify as &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; for purposes of

(determined without regard to the Restrictions) over the purchase price, if any,
of such
restricted shares. Any appreciation (or depreciation) realized upon a later 
disposition of such shares will be treated as long-term or short-term capital 
gain (or loss) depending upon how long the shares have been held. If a 
Section&nbsp;83(b)
election has not been made, any dividends received with respect to restricted 
shares that are subject to the restrictions generally will be treated as 
compensation that is taxable as ordinary income to the participant. </P>

to tax at ordinary income rates on any cash received and the fair market value 
of any unrestricted shares of Common Stock or other property on the date that 
such amounts are transferred to the participant under the award (reduced by any 
amount paid
by the participant for such stock units). Stock units that are granted in one 
year and payable in a later year generally are subject to Section&nbsp;409A of 
the Code. Awards subject to Section&nbsp;409A may be subject to earlier taxation
and
additional taxes and penalties. The Company intends that any awards of stock 
units under the 2016 Plan will be structured to satisfy the short-term deferral 
exemption under Section&nbsp;409A or otherwise meet the requirements of 
Section&nbsp;409A in
order to avoid early taxation and penalties to the recipient. <I> </I></P> <P

payable in a
later year generally are subject to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. Awards 
subject to Section&nbsp;409A may be subject to earlier taxation and additional

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">To the extent that a participant recognizes ordinary income in the 
circumstances described above, the Company will be entitled to a corresponding 
deduction
provided that, among other things, (i)&nbsp;the income meets the test of 
reasonableness, (ii)&nbsp;is an ordinary and necessary business expense, 
(iii)&nbsp;is not an &#147;excess parachute payment&#148; within the meaning of 
Section&nbsp;280G of
the Code, (iv)&nbsp;is properly reported to the IRS and (v)&nbsp;is not 
disallowed by the $1,000,000 limitation on certain executive compensation under 
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. The Section&nbsp;162(m) deduction limit applies
to compensation
paid to the Company&#146;s chief executive officer and its three other most 
highly compensated officers (other than its chief financial officer) in a given 
year. The limit does not apply to certain types of performance-based 
compensation if certain
conditions are met. These conditions include stockholder approval of the 2016 
Plan under which the compensation is paid and, for awards other than stock 
options and stock appreciation rights, the establishment of performance criteria
that must be
satisfied in order for the award to vest. The 2016 Plan is designed to allow 
awards made under the 2016 Plan to potentially qualify as &#147;qualified 
performance-based compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, 
which will allow the
Committee, in its discretion, to grant awards that may qualify for treatment as 
performance-based compensation not subject to the deduction limit. </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New

Company&#146;s general philosophy is to qualify future compensation for tax 
deductibility under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, wherever appropriate, 
recognizing that, under certain circumstances, the limitations may be exceeded. 
Qualification is
sought to the extent practicable and only to the extent that it is consistent 
with the Company&#146;s overall compensation objectives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

deductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to such law,

employment taxes) required by law to be withheld on any exercise, lapse of 
restriction or other
taxable event arising as a result of the 2016 Plan. The Committee may permit a 
holder of an award to satisfy all or part of such withholding obligations by 
having the Company withhold all or a portion of any shares of Common Stock that

bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 
Plan was
adopted by the Board on August 3, 2016, subject to approval by the 
Company&#146;s stockholders, to be effective immediately upon receipt by the 
Company and the effectiveness of such stockholder approval. The purpose of the 
Plan is to promote the
long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by 
(a)&nbsp;encouraging Employees to focus on long-range objectives, 
(b)&nbsp;encouraging the attraction and retention of Employees with exceptional 
qualifications, and
(c)&nbsp;linking Employees directly to stockholder interests through increased 
stock ownership. The Plan seeks to achieve these purposes by providing for 
Awards in the form of Restricted Shares, Stock Units, Options (which may be ISOs
or NSOs),
Performance Cash Awards and SARs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 
Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the 
State of Delaware
(except its choice-of-law provisions). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-

ADMINISTRATION. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">2.1 <B>Committee Composition</B>. The Committee 
shall administer the Plan. Except as otherwise determined by the Board, the 
Committee shall
consist solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors who are also Outside 
Directors. The Board shall have discretion to determine whether or not it 
intends to comply with the exemption requirements of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Rule&nbsp;16b-3</FONT> of the Exchange Act 
and/or Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. However, if the Board intends to satisfy
such exemption requirements, the Committee shall be a committee of the Board 
that at all
times consists solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors who are also Outside
Directors. Within the scope of such authority, the Board or the Committee may 
(a)&nbsp;delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board who are not
Outside
Directors the authority to grant Awards to eligible persons who are either 
(i)&nbsp;not then Covered Employees and are not expected to be Covered Employees
at the time of recognition of income resulting from such Award or (ii)&nbsp;not 
persons with
respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section&nbsp;162(m) of the 
Code or (b)&nbsp;delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board who
are not Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Awards to eligible persons
who are
not then subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act. Nothing herein shall 
create an inference that an Award is not validly granted under the Plan in the 
event Awards are granted under the Plan by a compensation committee of the Board
that does
not at all times consist solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors who are 
also Outside Directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2.2 <B>Committee
Responsibilities</B>. Subject to the Company&#146;s obligations pursuant to any 
applicable employment agreements, the Committee shall: (a)&nbsp;select the 
Employees who are to receive Awards under the Plan; (b)&nbsp;determine the type,
number,
vesting requirements, and other features and conditions of such Awards; 
(c)&nbsp;interpret and administer the Plan; (d)&nbsp;make all other decisions 
relating to the operation of the Plan and reconcile any inconsistency in, 
correct any defect in
and/or supply any omission in this Plan; and (e)&nbsp;carry out any other duties
delegated to it by the Board under the Plan. The Committee may adopt such rules 
or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan. The 
Committee&#146;s
determinations under the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding on all 
persons. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2.3 <B>Non-Executive Officer 
Grants</B>. The Board
may appoint a single Director, an additional committee of Directors and/or the 
Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer to determine Awards for Employees who are
not Executive Officers of the Company. The single Director, the members of the 
additional
committee, and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer need not satisfy 
the requirements of Section&nbsp;2.1. Such Director, committee, or the 
Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer may grant Awards under the Plan to such 
Employees. However,
the Committee shall nevertheless, subject to the Company&#146;s obligations 
pursuant to any applicable employment agreements, prescribe the terms, features,
and conditions of such Awards and the aggregate number of Company shares subject
to such
Awards. Within the limitations of this Section&nbsp;2.3, any reference in the 
Plan to the Committee shall include any such single Director, additional 
committee, and/or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer to whom the Board 
has delegated the
required authority under this Section&nbsp;2.3. </P>

intended that the Plan shall comply and that Awards shall be designed, granted 
and
administered in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application 
of, or comply with, the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code 
(&#147;Section&nbsp;409A&#148;). Any reference in this Plan to Section&nbsp;409A
will also include
any regulations or any other formal guidance promulgated with respect to such 
Section by the U. S. Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.
If the Committee determines that an Award, payment, distribution, deferral 
election,
transaction, or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions 
of the Plan would, if undertaken or implemented, cause a holder to become 
subject to additional taxes under Section&nbsp;409A, then unless the Committee
specifically
provides otherwise, such Award, payment, distribution, deferral election, 
transaction or other action or arrangement shall not be given effect to the 
extent it causes such result and the related provisions of the Plan and/or Award
Agreement will be
deemed modified or, if necessary, suspended in order to comply with the 
requirements of Section&nbsp;409A to the extent determined appropriate by the 
Committee, in each case without the consent of or notice to the holder. In any 
case, a Participant
will be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and 
penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant&#146;s 
account in connection with this Plan and grants hereunder (including any taxes 
and penalties under
Section&nbsp;409A), and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates will have 
any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or
all of such taxes or penalties. The exercisability of an Option shall not be 
extended to
the extent that such extension would subject the holder to additional taxes 
under Section&nbsp;409A. Each payment subject to Section&nbsp;409A shall be 
considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes 
of
Section&nbsp;409A. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-

Neither a Participant nor any of a Participant&#146;s creditors or beneficiaries
will have the
right to subject any deferred compensation (within the meaning of 
Section&nbsp;409A) payable under this Plan and grants hereunder to any 
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, 
attachment or garnishment. Except as
permitted under Section&nbsp;409A, any deferred compensation (within the meaning
of Section&nbsp;409A) payable to a Participant or for a Participant&#146;s 
benefit under this Plan and grants hereunder may not be reduced by, or offset 
against, any
amount owing by a Participant to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. </P> <P

Participant will be a specified employee (within the meaning of 
Section&nbsp;409A and using the identification methodology selected by the 
Company from time to time) and
(ii)&nbsp;the Company makes a good faith determination that an amount payable 
hereunder constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of 
Section&nbsp;409A) the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to 
the six-month delay rule
set forth in Section&nbsp;409A in order to avoid taxes or penalties under 
Section&nbsp;409A, then the Company will not pay such amount on the otherwise 
scheduled payment date but will instead pay it, without interest, on the earlier
of (A)&nbsp;the

Plan, and subject to the Company&#146;s obligations pursuant to any applicable 
employment agreements, the Committee may grant Awards to eligible persons who 
are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary 
outside the
United States of America or who provide services to the Company under an 
agreement with a foreign nation or agency, on such terms and conditions 
different from those specified in this Plan as may, in the judgment of the
Committee, be necessary or
desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of this Plan and, in
furtherance of such purposes, the Committee may make such modifications, 
amendments, procedures, subplans and the like as may be necessary or advisable 
to comply with
the provisions of laws and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions in 
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, and the Secretary of the Company 
or other appropriate officer may certify any such document as having been 
approved and
adopted in the same manner as this Plan. No such special terms, modifications, 
amendments, procedures or subplans, however, will include any provisions that 
are inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan 
could have
been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the 
shareholders of the Company. </P>
