<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner  
for Human Rights on the situation of human 
rights in Afghanistan and on the achievements of 
technical assistance in the field of human rights 
in 2013 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The human rights situation in Afghanistan continues to face serious challenges, with 
</p>
<p>the 2014 elections and scheduled conclusion of security transition creating an environment 
of uncertainty, including for human rights. Many Afghans, especially women, fear that 
achievements made in the protection and promotion of human rights since 2001 will be 
increasingly at risk. There are signs that hard-won gains may be forfeited for the sake of 
short-term political goals, undermining the fragile stability to which respect for human 
rights and the rule of law has contributed. In this context, I was pleased to pay my first visit 
to Kabul from 15 to 17 September 2013 to meet with the Government and other 
stakeholders. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) continued to provide strong support to the human rights mandate of the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). 
</p>

<p>Protection of civilians in the armed conflict continues to be a serious concern. In the 
first 11 months of 2013, civilian deaths and injuries from conflict-related violence 
increased by 10 per cent compared to the same period in 2012. The rise in civilian 
casualties marks a return to the high numbers of civilian deaths and injuries recorded in 
</p><p>2011. While three quarters of all civilian deaths and injuries were caused by anti-
Government elements, a rise in civilian casualties caused by Afghan Government forces 
was documented, particularly during ground engagements. Child casualties were 36 per 
cent higher than those recorded in 2012. During the first 11 months of 2013, at least nine 
children were killed or injured every two days in Afghanistan. July and August 2013 were 
the worst months on record for children, with 214 injured and 196 killed in the armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>Violence, discrimination and harmful practices against women remain systemic and 
entrenched; landmark protections for women, including the 2009 Law on the Elimination 
of Violence against Women, have been questioned. UNAMA/OHCHR found that, while 
the Afghan authorities registered more reports of violence against women under the Law on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women in 2013, the number of prosecutions and 
convictions remained low, with the majority of cases settled by mediation. 
</p>
<p>As security transition proceeds in 2014 and Afghan National Security Forces take 
full responsibility for civilian protection and command and control of all military 
operations, UNAMA/OHCHR documented Afghan forces&#8217; continued use of torture against 
conflict-related detainees in a number of detention facilities and denial of detainees&#8217; access 
to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>The highly regarded, credible and effective work of the Afghanistan Independent 
Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), a key element of the Karzai Government&#8217;s 12-year 
legacy, including on human rights, was undermined during 2013. The process for 
appointing new Commissioners was not inclusive, transparent or participatory, as required 
by the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights (Paris Principles). This threatened the independence and 
effectiveness of the Commission&#8217;s work. During my visit to Afghanistan in September 
2013, I raised this issue with national and international partners. In November 2013, the 
AIHRC underwent its regular accreditation review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation 
of the International Coordinating Committee for National Human Rights Institutions, which 
recommended a deferral of the decision on accreditation for one year and other measures to 
assist the AIHRC to retain its &#8220;A&#8221; accreditation status. I remain committed to supporting 
and strengthening this critical national institution.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 of 
27 November 2006 and resolution 14/15 of 18 June 2010 and has been prepared in 
cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Since the last 
report (A/HRC/16/67), the human rights situation in Afghanistan has remained deeply 
challenging.  
</p>
<p>2. Between 15 and 17 September, I had the opportunity to make a short visit to Kabul 
where I met President Karzai, senior ministers, members of civil society and our United 
Nations and bilateral partners. I observed that the country is clearly at a critical juncture, 
with the ongoing political, security and economic transition concluding in 2014, all of 
which will have an impact on human rights. There have been some distinct human rights 
achievements during the past 12 years, but they are fragile, and many Afghan counterparts 
have expressed concerns that the overall human rights situation is deteriorating on several 
fronts.  
</p>
<p>3. Deeply concerning is the notable rise in the number of civilian casualties, indicating 
that the impact of the armed conflict on the civilian population has not abated in any 
significant way. In the first 11 months of 2013, civilian deaths and injuries increased by 
10 per cent compared to the same period in 2012. This rise reflects a return to the high 
numbers of civilian deaths and injuries recorded in 2011. The principal causes include the 
increased indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and more ground 
engagements between Afghan forces and anti-Government elements (AGEs), particularly in 
civilian populated areas. After IEDs, ground engagements were the second leading cause of 
civilian deaths and injuries, a new and disturbing trend in 2013. 
</p><p>4. The year also saw an increase in targeted killings of civilians, especially government 
officials, by anti-Government elements. Although AGEs caused 75 per cent of civilian 
casualties, the number of civilian casualties caused by the actions of Afghan National 
Security Forces (ANSF), including the police, has also increased. The increasing pace of 
transition of security responsibilities from international military forces to Afghan forces and 
the closure of international forces&#8217; military bases has been met with increased ground 
engagement between Afghan forces and AGEs, and has been accompanied by rising 
civilian casualties. Children also increasingly became victims of the conflict. The number 
of child casualties reported and verified between 1 January and 30 November 2013 was 
36 per cent higher than that recorded during the same period in 2012.  
</p>
<p>5. Torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of conflict-related detainees 
while in Afghan National Police (ANP) and National Directorate of Security (NDS) 
custody continues to be reported and documented by UNAMA/OHCHR. On 20 January 
2013, UNAMA/OHCHR released its second major report on human rights concerns in 
places of detention, entitled Treatment of Conflict-Related Detainees in Afghan Custody: 
One Year On. Torture was found to be prevalent in several ANP and NDS detention 
facilities and was largely used to obtain a confession or information. 
</p>
<p>6. UNAMA/OHCHR released a report on 8 December 2013 entitled A Way to Go: An 
Update on Implementation of the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women in 
Afghanistan, in which it reported limited results in the implementation of the 2009 Law on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW law). Over the past year, Afghan 
authorities registered 28 per cent more reported incidents of violence against women under 
the EVAW law. However, use of the law by prosecutors and courts as a basis for filing 
indictments and obtaining convictions remained low, with most cases mediated through 
traditional dispute resolution. </p>


<p>7. On 18 September 2013, the Government of the Netherlands published a list of 5,000 
victims who had disappeared or been killed during the communist regime in Afghanistan 
between 1978 and 1979. The publication of these &#8220;death lists&#8221;, compiled by Afghan 
authorities at the time, had some effect on mobilizing victims&#8217; families, civil society and 
the President&#8217;s Office on the issue of transitional justice. The AIHRC conflict mapping 
report, which documents serious international crimes and human rights violations 
committed in Afghanistan between 1977 and 2001, was not formally submitted to the 
President&#8217;s Office in 2013. 
</p>
<p>8. On 16 June 2013, President Karzai appointed five new Commissioners and 
reappointed four serving Commissioners to the AIHRC. Civil society actors, donors and 
UNAMA raised concerns that the selection process for the new Commissioners failed to 
meet the Paris Principles. During my visit to Afghanistan in September 2013, I expressed 
concern at the non-consultative process leading to the appointments and its potential impact 
on the &#8220;A&#8221; status of the AIHRC. A decision on accreditation was deferred for one year 
following a review of the AIHRC on 18 November 2013 by the Sub-Committee on 
Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee for National Human Rights 
Institutions (ICC). This decision outlined concerns for the Government and the AIHRC to 
address, including changes to the selection and appointment process and increased State 
financing of the AIHRC operations budget in line with the Paris Principles, failing which a 
downgrade to &#8220;B&#8221; status would be likely.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>9. Conflict-related violence is increasingly affecting the civilian population. Changes 
in the political and security landscape have impeded the protection of civilians and further 
restricted the full enjoyment of human rights. The heightened pace of transition of security 
responsibilities from international military forces to Afghan forces and the closure of 
international forces&#8217; military bases was met with increased attacks by AGEs (the Taliban 
and other armed opposition groups) on ANSF, mainly at checkpoints, on strategic 
highways, in some areas that had been transitioned and in districts bordering neighbouring 
countries. 
</p>
<p>10. In the first 11 months of 2013, civilian deaths and injuries from conflict-related 
violence increased by 10 per cent compared to the same period in 2012. The rise in civilian 
casualties reverses the downward trend recorded in 2012, and reflects a return to the high 
numbers of civilian deaths and injuries recorded in 2011, the highest figures recorded by 
UNAMA/OHCHR. May 2013 was the deadliest month of the conflict with the highest 
number of civilian deaths, while August was the second. Between 1 January and 
30 November 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 7,899 civilian casualties (2,730 
civilians killed and 5,169 injured). UNAMA attributed 75 per cent of civilian deaths and 
injuries to AGEs, 10 per cent to pro-Government forces (ANSF and international military 
forces) and 11 per cent to ground engagements between pro-Government forces and AGEs 
in which attribution was not possible. The remaining 4 per cent of civilian casualties were 
unattributed and were caused mainly by explosive remnants of war. 
</p>
<p>11. As in previous years, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by AGEs caused the 
most civilian casualties. Ground engagements between Afghan forces and AGEs, 
particularly in civilian populated areas, were the second leading cause of civilian deaths and 
injuries, representing a trend and an increasing threat to civilians in 2013. Security gaps and 
contests between AGEs and pro-Government forces over territory gave rise to increased 
numbers of armed clashes, particularly in the southern and eastern regions, with civilians 
increasingly being killed or injured in the crossfire or by IEDs planted by AGEs. 
UNAMA/OHCHR also documented increased civilian casualties attributed to AGEs, </p>


<p>including targeted killings, attacks against civilian government workers, abductions and 
killings, and high levels of threats and intimidation. 
</p>
<p>12. Between 1 January and 30 November 2013, UNAMA documented 90 civilian deaths 
and 177 injuries (267 civilian casualties) from explosive remnants of war, a 48 per cent 
increase from 2012. Eighty-one per cent of the victims were children. This sharp increase 
coincides with an increase in ground engagements between parties to the conflict, making 
unexploded ammunition and ordnance more likely to be left behind. A second cause is the 
closure of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) bases and firing ranges, many of 
which have not been sufficiently cleared of unexploded ordnance prior to their closure. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Anti-Government elements 
</b></p>
<p>13. Seventy-five per cent of all civilian casualties during 2013 were attributed to AGEs, 
which includes a range of armed opposition groups, compared with 81 per cent for the same 
period in 2012. Between 1 January and 30 November 2013, IEDs and suicide/complex 
attacks by AGEs together accounted for 49 per cent of all civilian deaths and injuries. 
UNAMA/OHCHR documented a 44 per cent reduction in civilian casualties from pressure-
plated IEDs, but also noted an 83 per cent increase in civilian deaths and injuries from the 
use of remote-controlled IEDs.  
</p>
<p>14. Throughout 2013, AGEs continued to target and kill civilians who worked for or 
were perceived to support the Government or Afghan and international military forces. 
Between 1 January and 30 November, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 740 civilian deaths 
and 341 injuries (1,081 civilian casualties) from targeted killings &#8212; on a par with the same 
period in 2012. In many cases, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the killings on their 
website. On 27 November 2013, for example, the Taliban claimed responsibility for 
attacking and killing six non-governmental organization staff members in Faryab province.  
</p>
<p>15. Deliberate targeting of civilian government institutions by AGEs increased in 2013, 
with attacks against civilian government employees, offices, district headquarters and other 
civilian government structures documented throughout Afghanistan. UNAMA/OHCHR 
documented four attacks against court-houses: in Farah on 3 April, in Kabul on 11 June, in 
Marja district in Helmand province on 12 May and in Pashtunkot district of Faryab 
province on 23 April, causing 57 civilian deaths and 145 injuries (202 civilian casualties) 
including judges, prosecutors, legal and clerical staff. The Taliban claimed responsibility 
for the attacks and issued a public statement announcing their intention to target and kill 
judges and prosecutors. 
</p><p>16. UNAMA/OHCHR observed a pattern of threats and attacks by AGEs against 
religious leaders and documented 23 incidents in which religious leaders or places of 
worship were directly threatened or attacked, resulting in 15 civilian deaths and seven 
injuries. The majority of the attacks targeted mullahs performing funeral ceremonies for 
deceased members of Afghan security forces and religious figures who expressed public 
support for the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Pro-Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>17. In the first 11 months of 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 300 civilian deaths 
and 499 injuries (799 civilian casualties) attributed to pro-Government forces, a 43 per cent 
increase from 2012. The rise is attributed to an increase in offensive operations and 
counter-attacks by ANSF against AGEs in contested areas. These operations also damaged 
civilian properties and in some areas displaced civilians on a large scale. For example, 
Afghan forces&#8217; operations in Qaysar district, Faryab province, on 18 to 20 November led to </p>


<p>the displacement of 1,000 families, requiring a humanitarian response which was made 
more urgent by the cold weather and the onset of winter. 
</p>
<p>18. Despite Afghan forces leading almost all military operations countrywide, a 
permanent structure does not yet exist in relevant ANSF bodies to systematically 
investigate allegations of civilian casualties, initiate remedial measures and take follow-up 
action. The Civilian Casualties Tracking Team in the Presidential Information Coordination 
Centre, established in May 2012, only records reports of civilian casualties received from 
security bodies and does not receive complaints from individuals or organizations. 
</p>
<p>19. Human rights violations attributed to Afghan Local Police (ALP), including 
violations leading to civilian casualties, are a growing concern; in the first 11 months of 
2013, UNAMA/OHCHR documented 29 civilian deaths and 78 injuries in 60 separate 
incidents, more than double the number of incidents and casualties compared to the same 
period in 2012. In most cases, the deaths and injuries resulted from ALP members 
committing human rights violations including punishments and revenge killings, carrying 
out illegal searches and alleged accidental shootings in highly questionable circumstances. 
In response to these violations, UNAMA/OHCHR has recommended the creation of a 
national-level accountability mechanism in the ALP Directorate at the Ministry of Interior 
Affairs, such as the appointment of a military prosecutor, to enable timely, independent and 
transparent investigations and prosecution of alleged ALP crimes and human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>20. The escalated pace of ISAF base and firing range closure has led to concerns that 
bases and firing ranges have not been sufficiently cleared of unexploded ordnance prior to 
closure. At the end of November 2013, following intensive advocacy by 
UNAMA/OHCHR, ISAF issued a standard operating procedure on base and firing range 
closure/transfer to ensure clearance of explosive remnants and unexploded ordnance before 
bases and ranges are closed or transitioned in 2014. ISAF also agreed to review 700 bases 
and ranges that have closed since 2001. 
</p>
<p>21. While UNAMA/OHCHR recorded a decrease in civilian casualties from aerial 
operations in the first 11 months of 2013, civilian deaths and injuries from remotely piloted 
aircraft (drones) more than tripled with 36 civilian deaths and 12 injuries. On 7 September, 
a drone strike in Watapur, Kunar province, killed 10 civilians, including four children and 
four women. UNAMA/OHCHR has urged international military forces to review 
thoroughly pre-engagement targeting criteria and required precautionary measures to 
reduce civilian casualties from drone strikes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>22. Children continued to suffer disproportionately from the impact of the armed 
conflict. Child casualties reported and verified between 1 January to 30 November 2013 
were 36 per cent higher than those recorded during the same period in 2012. UNAMA 
verified 705 incidents out of a total of 842 reported incidents in which children were killed 
or maimed. During this period, at least 491 children (318 boys, 110 girls and 63 gender 
unknown) were killed and a further 1,018 children (577 boys, 236 girls and 205 gender 
unknown) were injured. During the first 11 months of 2013, at least nine children were 
killed or injured every two days in Afghanistan.  
</p><p>23. Ground engagements, which include crossfire, shootings, rocket and artillery 
shelling, and hand grenade attacks, caused the highest number of child casualties: 552 
deaths and injuries in total. AGEs were responsible for nearly 40 per cent and international 
and Afghan security forces were responsible for almost 20 per cent of casualties caused 
during ground engagements. Improvised explosive devices were the second leading cause </p>


<p>of child deaths and injuries, amounting to 448 casualties. In 2013, explosive remnants of 
war claimed the lives of 315 children, more than 83 per cent of them boys. Suicide attacks 
by AGEs resulted in 116 child casualties, with the highest numbers in the central region. 
Air strikes by international forces killed 35 children and injured 19 between January and 
November. 
</p>
<p>24. July and August 2013 were the worst months of the armed conflict on record for 
children, with 214 children killed and a further 196 wounded. At least 511 child casualties 
&#8212; one third of the total child casualties during the first 11 months of the year &#8212; were 
reported from the eastern region, a direct result of increased ground engagements between 
the parties to the conflict. In the southern region, 307 child casualties occurred during the 
first 11 months of 2013 and were mainly the result of IEDs. AGEs were responsible for 
more than 53 per cent of the total child casualties, pro-Government forces were responsible 
for 11 per cent, and 36 per cent remained unattributed to any party to the conflict.  
</p>
<p>25. Over 11 months, 91 incidents of attacks against schools and 34 incidents of attacks 
against hospitals were reported. UNAMA/OHCHR, in cooperation with other members of 
the United Nations-led Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting on grave 
violations against children in armed conflict, was able to verify 44 incidents of attacks 
against schools and 25 incidents of attacks against hospitals. Attacks against schools 
included deliberate targeting and incidents that impeded access to education, including 
crossfire incidents, IED detonations near schools and abductions, killing, injuring, 
intimidation and harassment of education personnel. Attacks against schools were mostly 
reported from the eastern, northern and the north-eastern regions. Unverified reports 
suggest that large numbers of schools remained closed in Nuristan, Helmand and Kandahar 
provinces due to insecurity and lack of teachers. Of the total verified reports of such 
attacks, 33 were attributed to AGEs, and three to ANSF, with the remaining eight 
unattributed.  
</p>
<p>26. Of the 38 reports of underage recruitment into armed groups and armed forces in 
2013, UNAMA/OHCHR was able to verify 25 incidents. Of the verified incidents, 43 boys 
between the ages of 11 and 17 were recruited, allegedly to carry out different types of 
military activities, such as planting IEDs, transporting explosives, carrying out suicide 
attacks, conducting policing duties and taking part in armed clashes. Twenty of the 43 
recruited boys allegedly lost their lives while planting or assembling IEDs or carrying out 
suicide attacks. During 2013, Kandahar and Helmand provinces in the south, Farah 
province in the west, and Paktya province in the southeast remained centres for child 
recruitment. Reportedly, AGEs were responsible for recruiting 29 boys, Afghan Local 
Police 13 boys and the Afghan National Police at least 1 boy. AGEs and Afghan security 
forces, namely the Afghan National Police and the Afghan Local Police, remain listed for 
child recruitment in the annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Children and Armed Conflict.  
</p>
<p>27. Grave violations against children also included abductions, with 13 verified 
incidents from the eastern, south-eastern and the southern regions of the country. At least 7 
of the 27 victims were executed following abduction. Children were abducted for reasons 
including recruitment into armed groups, punishment for alleged suspicious activities or the 
activities of their family members, and reprisals. Seven incidents of sexual violence in the 
armed conflict were documented, of which four were verified. Three incidents in which 
four boys were abused were attributed to Afghan National Police and the Afghan Local 
Police, and one incident to the Taliban. AGEs, including the Taliban, denied humanitarian 
access in the areas under their control. UNAMA/OHCHR was able to verify 27 such 
incidents out of 40 reported. Verified incidents included abduction, intimidation, killing and 
injury of humanitarian staff, mostly of de-miners, denying access to vaccinators and 
causing damage to facilities run by humanitarian organizations. </p>


<p>28. Throughout 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR provided technical support to the Government 
in implementing the Action Plan for the Prevention of Underage Recruitment. In June 2013, 
UNAMA/OHCHR, on behalf of the Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting, 
responded to the Government&#8217;s progress report on implementation of the Action Plan. In 
August 2013, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children 
and Armed Conflict and UNICEF undertook a joint mission to Afghanistan focused on 
supporting the Government in developing a &#8220;road map towards compliance&#8221; aimed at 
expediting implementation of the Action Plan. The road map was endorsed in principle at a 
high-level meeting of the Inter-ministerial Steering Committee on Children and Armed 
Conflict on 14 August. Once fully endorsed by the Government, UNAMA/OHCHR will 
focus on supporting the Government in devising a strategy to implement the road map. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Protection from arbitrary detention and respect  
for fair trial rights 
</b></p>
<p>29. Over the last year, Afghanistan&#8217;s prison population increased from 25,003 adult and 
juvenile detainees and prisoners in 2012 to 32,157. Based on October 2013 statistics from 
the Interior Affairs, Justice and Defence Ministries, these figures represent an increase of 
7,154 detainees and prisoners housed in Central Prisons Directorate facilities and the 
juvenile rehabilitations centres across Afghanistan and in the Afghan Detention Facility in 
Parwan. This increase includes 2,440 detainees and prisoners transferred by the United 
States of America to Afghan custody on 25 March 2013 under a March 2012 agreement 
that handed over control of the United States-run Detention Facility in Parwan to the 
Afghan Ministry of Defence. 
</p>
<p>30. Persons detained in connection with the armed conflict (hereinafter &#8220;conflict-related 
detainees&#8221;) held by the Afghan National Police (ANP) or the National Directorate of 
Security (NDS) in pretrial custody, however, are not included in these statistics. In the 
majority of cases, conflict-related detainees are held arbitrarily for extended time periods, 
in violation of legally prescribed time limits and due process guarantees in Afghan law. 
Most of these detainees do not have access to defence counsel, have not been informed of 
the charges against them and have not been brought before a tribunal while in ANP and 
NDS custody.  
</p>
<p>31. Treatment of conflict-related detainees while in ANP and NDS custody remains a 
major human rights concern. On 20 January 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR released its second 
major report on human rights concerns in places of detention, entitled Treatment of 
Conflict-Related Detainees in Afghan Custody: One Year On<i>.</i> Based on interviews with 
635 conflict-related detainees in 89 Afghan facilities covering 30 provinces, torture was 
found to persist in a number of detention facilities, despite efforts by the Government and 
international partners to address it. More than half of conflict-related detainees interviewed 
had experienced torture and ill-treatment as defined and prohibited under Afghan and 
international law. Torture was found to be prevalent in several ANP and NDS detention 
facilities and took the form of coercive interrogation techniques in which Afghan officials 
inflicted severe pain and suffering on detainees during interrogations aimed mainly at 
obtaining a confession or information.  
</p>
<p>32. UNAMA/OHCHR made 64 recommendations to the Government and international 
partners to prevent torture and ill-treatment, ensure accountability and build the capacity of 
State institutions. One key recommendation is the creation of an independent national 
preventive mechanism on torture in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture &#8212; which Afghanistan has not yet ratified &#8212; which could be located within 
the AIHRC with authority and enhanced capacity to inspect all detention facilities, make 
detailed technical recommendations and assist institutions with follow-up implementation. I </p>


<p>also encourage the Government to invite the Special Rapporteur on torture to make a 
country visit and assist in these important reform efforts. 
</p>
<p>33. In response to the UNAMA/OHCHR report, on 22 January 2013, President Karzai 
established a fact-finding presidential delegation to investigate the allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment contained in the report. UNAMA/OHCHR cooperated fully with the 
delegation. In February 2013, the delegation publicly announced that 48 per cent of the 
detainees it interviewed had experienced torture and ill-treatment at the time of arrest and 
during interrogation by ANP and NDS officials. The delegation also noted that two thirds 
of the detainees who were interviewed had not had access to a defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>34. After receiving the delegation&#8217;s report, on 16 February 2013, President Karzai 
endorsed its recommendations and issued Presidential Decree No. 129. This decree ordered 
the NDS, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the Ministry of 
Justice and the Supreme Court to investigate allegations of torture, prosecute alleged 
perpetrators, release detainees and prisoners in arbitrary detention, and increase access of 
defence lawyers and medical personnel to detainees to prevent torture and arbitrary 
detention and ensure accountability.  
</p>
<p>35. During 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR engaged with government officials from relevant 
institutions and ministries, troop contributing nations, international donors, defence 
lawyers, human rights organizations and civil society to advocate and track implementation 
of the Presidential Decree. Visits to detention facilities continued with UNAMA/OHCHR 
assessing both the implementation and effectiveness of the Presidential orders and 
providing technical assistance when requested. UNAMA/OHCHR findings to date have 
indicated that torture and ill-treatment of conflict-related detainees persists in some 
detention facilities and that ANP and NDS personnel continue to use torture to obtain 
confessions. Presidential Decree No. 129 alone is not an effective deterrent to torture; 
greater accountability is needed. 
</p>
<p>36. However, some progress has been made, with basic accountability measures taken in 
several cases: there were torture-related arrests of Afghan Local Police officers in Kunduz 
in May 2013, but no prosecutions yet in this case; the AIHRC made a complaint of torture 
against a prominent ANP Commander in Kandahar to the NDS prosecutor which resulted in 
the Commander receiving a warning letter from the NDS and the police regarding his 
conduct; an ANP officer in Herat province received a similar reprimand. UNAMA/OHCHR 
also received reports that two NDS officials, who were arrested in Uruzgan province in 
June 2013 for allegedly torturing detainees, have been transferred to a Kandahar military 
court to await trial. These cases could set a precedent for addressing torture in the future.  
</p>
<p>37. Access to detention facilities has improved; in April 2013, the Director of the NDS 
ordered its detention facility directors to provide full access to human rights organizations 
and facilitate unannounced visits. Some provincial directors have established internal 
complaints mechanisms to investigate allegations of torture and internal monitoring 
mechanisms. While these complaints procedures are an improvement, they are internal 
measures that lack independence and transparency.  
</p>
<p>38. Defence lawyers have access to provincial NDS detention facilities, but can usually 
access detainees only after the investigation phase has been concluded. The Legal Aid 
Department of the Ministry of Justice lacks capacity and alone cannot address the current 
shortfall of legal aid defence lawyers. The Ministry of Public Health has made some 
progress to ensure that medical personnel working in detention facilities across Afghanistan 
are aware of Presidential Decree No. 129. Most medical personnel, however, lack 
independence as they report directly to the NDS and the Ministry of Interior Affairs and 
fear that they will face reprisals if they endorse findings of physical abuse or torture.  </p>


<p>39. The Supreme Court has taken action to implement Presidential Decree No. 129, 
including issuing instructions to judges reminding them to reject confessions obtained 
through torture and to dismiss cases that rely solely on evidence thus obtained. 
Additionally, the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office and the Ministry of Justice 
conducted joint visits to several provincial prisons to review cases of individuals who had 
been held in arbitrary detention. As a result, more than 400 detainees were released, 
although very few had been held for conflict-related offences.  
</p>
<p>40. In response to the findings of the UNAMA/OHCHR report of 20 January 2013, the 
International Security Assistance Force suspended transfers of detainees it captured to 35 
Afghan detention facilities and redesigned its detainee certification review process to 
include inspections, extended training and capacity-building of all ANP and NDS 
interrogators and detention staff on human rights principles and non-coercive interrogation 
techniques, and mentoring. On 5 May 2013, ISAF certified or permitted transfer of 
detainees to NDS departments 124 and 40 in Kabul, but shortly after suspended this 
certification decision, which has yet to be lifted. ISAF certified six Afghan-run detention 
facilities, NDS provincial headquarters in Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost and Helmand, the 
Helmand provincial prison and the Afghan National Detention Facility in Parwan (ANDF 
Parwan). These certifications are reviewed every three months.  
</p><p>41. UNAMA/OHCHR has conducted three visits to ANDF Parwan since it was handed 
over to the Government of Afghanistan. Approximately 2,330 detainees have been released 
since the handover, following case reviews by the Government. However, 2,440 Afghan 
detainees (including 70 children) remain in custody in the detention facility. In addition, 70 
detainees remain under the control of the United States Government at this location. 
Approximately 1,879 of the 2,440 detainees are still awaiting their initial court hearing and 
many have been detained for periods longer than that prescribed by Afghan law, and are 
arbitrarily detained. UNAMA/OHCHR also found that many detainees&#8217; due process rights 
had not been guaranteed, including the right to be informed of the reason for arrest and the 
right to defence counsel.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>42. Across Afghanistan, harmful practices and incidents of violence against women 
remain pervasive. On 8 December, UNAMA/OHCHR released a report entitled A Way to 
Go: An Update on Implementation of the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women 
in Afghanistan, documenting mixed results in the implementation of the 2009 Law on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW law). The report was based on 
consultations with 203 judicial, police and government officials, and monitoring of nearly 
500 cases of violence against women from 18 of 34 provinces throughout Afghanistan 
between October 2012 and September 2013. 
</p>
<p>43. The UNAMA/OHCHR report noted that authorities registered 28 per cent more 
reported incidents of violence against women under the EVAW law, but the overall use of 
the law by prosecutors and courts as a basis for filing indictments and obtaining convictions 
remained low, with more cases mediated than entering the judicial process. In 16 of the 18 
provinces where detailed information on the application of the EVAW law was available, 
police and prosecutors registered 650 incidents of violence against women. This represents 
an increase in the number of incidents registered by police and prosecutors compared with 
UNAMA&#8217;s findings in December 2012. Of those 650 incidents, prosecutors used the 
EVAW law in 109 (17 per cent) and the courts applied the law in 60 cases, reflecting 
decreases from the previous period. UNAMA/OHCHR notes with concern that, despite the 
rise in reported incidents, the overall number of criminal indictments filed by prosecutors in 
cases of violence against women under all applicable laws decreased in 2013. </p>


<p>44. UNAMA/OHCHR note that police and prosecutors have been mediating more cases 
registered under the EVAW law or referring cases to informal dispute resolution. The 
EVAW law neither refers to mediation nor rules it out, but permits a woman to withdraw 
her complaint at any point, which in practice facilitates mediation and is often culturally 
emphasized. UNAMA/OHCHR found that mediation, whether through informal or formal 
processes, often did not enforce penal sanctions for perpetrators under the EVAW law 
and/or the Afghan Penal Code. Through field monitoring, UNAMA observed that 
mediation of cases of violence against women by police in practical terms meant 
persuading a woman to resolve her case outside the judicial system. Decisions by informal 
mechanisms were often observed to be shaped by powerful men in local areas applying 
different procedures and making decisions based on a mix of tradition, varying 
interpretations of Islamic law and local power relations, sometimes contrary to law or 
religious principles. As a result, women sometimes faced further victimization. 
</p>
<p>45. Prosecutions of women and girls for leaving their homes without the permission of 
male relatives &#8212; often to escape violence &#8212; continued in spite of 2012 directives from the 
Attorney-General and the Supreme Court to end the practice. Although &#8220;running away&#8221; is 
not a crime under Afghan law or sharia law, police and prosecutors often arrest and 
prosecute women and girls for this &#8220;moral crime&#8221; and based on their discretion, charge 
them with &#8220;intention&#8221; to commit <i>zina</i> (premarital or extramarital sexual intercourse). Under 
sharia law, <i>zina</i> is a crime irrespective of a woman&#8217;s marital status or age, but &#8220;attempt to 
commit <i>zina</i>&#8221; is not a distinct codified crime in the Afghan Penal Code, nor is it proscribed 
under sharia law. UNAMA observed through field monitoring that authorities&#8217; 
determination of &#8220;intent&#8221; in such cases is highly subjective, usually based on circumstantial 
evidence and often centred on the views of a specific prosecutor or police officer. The 
Supreme Court recorded 71 convictions for &#8220;running away/attempted <i>zina</i>&#8221; between March 
2012 and March 2013.  
</p>
<p>46. Over the course of 2013, several legislative developments occurred in the form of 
setbacks to the advancement of women&#8217;s rights. The EVAW law was enacted by 
Presidential Decree in 2009 and on 18 May 2013, was brought before the Afghan 
Parliament by the Parliamentary Commission on Women&#8217;s Affairs, Civil Society and 
Human Rights with the stated purpose of obtaining parliamentary endorsement. This 
resulted in heated debates as several parliamentarians stated that the law contradicted 
certain tenets of Islam. The law was sent for consultation by 18 parliamentary committees. 
The debate around the law was highly publicized in the media, which negatively impacted 
on the already weak implementation of the EVAW law. It also highlighted the fragile 
nature of gains made for women&#8217;s rights in Afghanistan. Should the law come back to 
Parliament for a vote, many women&#8217;s advocates are concerned that it will be considerably 
weakened or rejected altogether. 
</p><p>47. In June 2013, the lower house of Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, passed a draft 
criminal procedure code which prohibits witnesses from testifying against their relatives in 
all criminal cases. This provision would make effective prosecution of EVAW law cases 
extremely difficult, as in most instances where violence takes place in the domestic sphere, 
family members are generally the only witnesses to the criminal acts. Support for the new 
provision focused on the need to keep family matters, such as violence against female 
relatives and child abuse, private matters to be addressed within the family or community. 
At the time of writing, the draft is pending before the upper house of Parliament, the 
Meshrano Jirga. 
</p>
<p>48. In August 2013, Parliament passed an election law which reduced the quota of seats 
for women in provincial councils from 25 to 20 per cent and eliminated the quota altogether 
in district councils. These amendments to the election law are concerning as 
parliamentarians tried to remove all quotas for women at the local level and only reinserted </p>


<p>the lower 20 per cent quota for provincial councils after intense advocacy by women&#8217;s 
rights groups. During its July 2013 session, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women &#8212; commenting on the State report of Afghanistan under the 
Convention &#8212; expressed its concern regarding the election law, and the delegation made 
assurances that the women&#8217;s parliamentary quota would be preserved given that it is 
constitutionally mandated. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Peace and reconciliation (including accountability 
and transitional justice)  
</b>49. On 18 September 2013, the Government of the Netherlands published a list of 5,000 
victims who disappeared or were killed during the communist regime in Afghanistan 
between 1978 and 1979. The disclosure of this information, known as the &#8220;death lists&#8221;, 
compiled by Afghan authorities at the time and revealed through a criminal proceeding in 
the Netherlands, mobilized victims&#8217; families, civil society and the President&#8217;s Office on 
transitional justice. Following a meeting with former Jihadi commanders, the Office of the 
President issued a public statement recognizing the pain and suffering of concerned 
families and announced two days of national mourning on 30 September and 1 October to 
commemorate the victims of that period. The families of victims and civil society held 
memorials and public rallies calling on the Government and the international community to 
provide justice for past crimes and to ensure that atrocities do not reoccur, that perpetrators 
are punished and the needs of victims and survivors are addressed. General Abdul Rashid 
Dostum, a former militia commander who joined the current presidential ticket of Ashraf 
Ghani Ahmadzai as his vice-presidential candidate, issued a public apology to victims of 
years of conflict in Afghanistan without accepting any personal responsibility. This episode 
underscores the importance of the Government receiving and accepting the &#8220;conflict 
mapping report&#8221; prepared by the AIHRC and publicizing and acting on the report&#8217;s findings 
and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. During 2013, UNAMA/OHCHR continued to support the Afghan People&#8217;s Dialogue 
on Peace initiative. The project promotes a rights-based approach to peace and 
reconciliation efforts by enabling ordinary Afghans, including women, men, youth and 
minority groups, to express their views on prospects for peace, reconciliation, security, 
economic development, human rights, justice and the rule of law. The project has been 
implemented in two phases; Phase I from October to December 2011, and Phase II from 
June 2013 to mid-2014. By the end of 2013, approximately 6,500 Afghans had been 
consulted across the country. In line with the principle of Afghan leadership and ownership 
of peace-building initiatives, UNAMA/OHCHR has played a facilitation role, supporting 
civil society to lead in promoting this inclusive, rights-centred process that enables the 
voices of ordinary Afghans to be heard and considered by all policymakers. 
</p>
<p>51. Phase II of the People&#8217;s Dialogue anticipates developing local road maps for peace 
by holding around 200 focus group discussions with community and religious leaders, 
women, youth representatives, former armed opposition and beneficiaries of development 
projects. The consultation process is expected to result in the production of 34 local road 
maps for peace &#8212; one for each province. Reports from focus groups so far indicate that 
Afghans are concerned about entrenched impunity, pervasive corruption and abuse of 
authority. Participants identified these factors as the main reasons for the insurgency&#8217;s 
strength, which weakened the legitimate authority of government institutions, the rule of 
law and the protection of human rights.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Support to national institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 16 June 2013, President Karzai appointed five new AIHRC Commissioners and 
reappointed four serving Commissioners, including the Chair, Sima Samar. These 
(re)-appointments were made 18 months after the terms of office of the previous 
Commissioners had expired, in December 2011. Civil society, donors and UNAMA raised 
serious concerns that the selection process for the Commissioners failed to meet the 
international standards enshrined in the Paris Principles. I raised similar issues publicly at 
the end of June, stressing the need for a transparent, participatory and consultative process 
involving civil society to select qualified and independent human rights commissioners. 
None of the five new Commissioners appointed were drawn from the list of 60 potential 
candidates that civil society groups had provided to the President. These groups and 
UNAMA/OHCHR have also expressed concerns over the eligibility, political independence 
and human rights experience and commitment of several newly-appointed Commissioners, 
as required under law. 
</p>
<p>53. During my visit to Afghanistan in September 2013, I expressed concern at the 
non-consultative process leading to these appointments and the potential impact of this on 
the Commission&#8217;s &#8220;A&#8221; status, given its five-year accreditation review in November 2013 by 
the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC). I 
encouraged the Government to address the deficiencies in the selection and appointment 
process, and to further strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the AIHRC.  
</p>
<p>54. On 18 November 2013, the Commission underwent its accreditation review with the 
ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation, which recommended a deferral of the decision on 
accreditation for one year. In its decision, the recommendation to defer was accompanied 
by a statement of concerns regarding the selection and appointment process for 
Commissioners, the dependence of the AIHRC on international donor funding and the 
disparity in the ratio of female to male staff members among Commission staff. The Sub-
Committee warned that these concerns needed to be addressed before the Commission&#8217;s 
next review, failing which the Committee would recommend a downgrade of the AIHRC to 
&#8220;B&#8221; status. Final certification by the ICC Bureau of the Sub-Committee recommendation to 
defer was pending at the time of writing.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Cooperation with United Nations human rights  
mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>55. Afghanistan presented its combined initial and second periodic reports to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in July 2013. The 
Committee expressed satisfaction with the progress made in women&#8217;s rights protection in 
Afghanistan since 2001, including the EVAW law, the National Action Plan for the Women 
of Afghanistan (2008&#8211;2018) and efforts to increase women&#8217;s participation in political and 
public life. The Committee also raised several issues of concern, including proposed 
amendments to the EVAW law and the appointment of the new members of the AIHRC, 
given that one Commissioner was known to have spoken publicly against women&#8217;s rights. 
The Committee recommended that women should be more involved in the peace process to 
ensure its success, and inquired about the Family Code, which is currently being revised.  
</p>
<p>56. The Committee noted the significant efforts made during the last decade to enact and 
implement a legal framework protecting and promoting women&#8217;s rights. However, it 
considered that the climate of persistent and extreme violence, in particular against women, </p>


<p>the ongoing political process and the transition of security responsibilities placed the State 
in a challenging position. It considered implementation of the Convention as the most 
effective safeguard to ensure the full respect and enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights. The 
Committee provided recommendations on the elimination of violence against women and 
harmful practices and other measures as a high priority for national mobilization and 
international support.  
</p>
<p>57. In November 2013, the Government submitted its second report to the universal 
periodic review mechanism of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This report 
addressed the Government&#8217;s progress in implementing the 117 recommendations made by 
the Council following the first review of the human rights situation in Afghanistan in 2009. 
In the second half of 2013, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began a robust process to 
prepare the initial report of Afghanistan to the Committee against Torture, which is due in 
June 2014. Given the serious concerns raised about torture, it is greatly appreciated that 
Afghanistan is paying particular attention to the preparation of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b>58. The human rights agenda in Afghanistan is at a critical crossroads. In April 2014, 
President Karzai&#8217;s two terms in office will expire and presidential elections will be held. 
Over the next year, international military forces will finalize their handover of security 
responsibilities to Afghan forces. At the same time, a large portion of the international 
donor presence is expected to withdraw from Afghanistan, significantly reducing financial 
commitments and direct engagement in project implementation.  
59. As political, security and economic transition accelerate to their conclusion and with 
the persistence of the armed conflict, many Afghans are concerned that instability may 
increase throughout the country, undoing the significant human rights gains of the last 
12 years. There are already signs that the Government and the international community&#8217;s 
commitment and attention to the human rights agenda are weakening and that the overall 
situation of human rights is deteriorating. Indicators include the recent flawed appointment 
process to the AIHRC, rising civilian casualties in the armed conflict, and developments 
that could weaken women&#8217;s rights. The Government should ensure that the transition in 
2014 does not lead to a rollback of the gains made and that human rights are not sacrificed 
for the sake of political expediency. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends the 
following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Government of Afghanistan should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Prioritize efforts to strengthen civilian protection, especially full 
implementation of the Government counter-IED strategy, and ensure development 
and resourcing of sufficient ANSF capacity to command, control and effectively 
conduct counter-IED operations and IED disposal, including exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Strengthen structures in the Government that track, mitigate and 
provide accountability for civilian casualties by pro-Government forces, including 
transparent and timely investigations and accurate tracking of all incidents of civilian 
casualties caused by ANSF, in order to improve civilian protection, compensation and 
accountability; </b></p>


<p>(<b>c) Strengthen the national and provincial commissions on EVAW to enable 
them to coordinate all efforts to address violence against women and fulfil their legally 
prescribed role mandated under the EVAW law, including through oversight and 
political support by the highest level of the Government. Issue clear instructions to all 
government bodies to collaborate and share information with the commissions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Fully implement the Attorney General&#8217;s 2012 directive No. 92/202 
requiring prosecutors to ensure that women are not prosecuted for leaving their 
houses, and review any new cases of women who are imprisoned for &#8220;running away&#8221; 
and/or &#8220;attempted zina&#8221; by a joint delegation comprising the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office, the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Interior Affairs, with a timeline for 
completion and follow-up action including release of women and girls who have been 
wrongly imprisoned; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Develop and implement detailed instructions for police and prosecutors 
outlining the methodology, criteria, minimum requirements and follow-up 
mechanisms regulating mediation of registered incidents of violence against women. 
The instructions should specify responsibilities after mediation settlements to be 
carried out periodically for a minimum of six months with mandatory follow-up 
reports; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Put in place within six months a concrete plan covering the next two-
year period to improve implementation of the EVAW law, including the measures 
recommended to Afghanistan by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women in July 2013; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Build the capacity of government institutions working on 
implementation of the EVAW law to ensure a common understanding of violence 
against women and the provisions of the EVAW law. Training on the EVAW law 
should be a mandatory element of the training curriculum of police and prosecutor&#8217;s 
offices with progress on EVAW law implementation measured biannually against 
defined indicators and publicly reported; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Consider creating an independent inspection mechanism that would help 
to identify problems in detention facility operating procedures and practices and work 
with the institutions to resolve these issues in the long-term; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Invite the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment to visit Afghanistan to assist in providing a 
comprehensive response to preventing ill-treatment in detention facilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Fully implement Presidential Decree No. 129, particularly to ensure that 
perpetrators of torture are held accountable, including through proper independent 
investigation and oversight mechanisms, suspension from or loss of employment, and 
criminal prosecution. Courts and prosecutors must be diligent in throwing out 
evidence obtained through the use of torture and ill-treatment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Prevent any interference or political pressure designed to compromise 
the independence or effectiveness of the AIHRC, ensuring that any measures taken to 
ensure retention of the Commission&#8217;s &#8220;A&#8221; status only strengthen its effectiveness and 
ensure its independence. The selection and appointment process for Commissioners 
should be reformed in order to strengthen the effectiveness and independence of the 
Commission, and sustainable public funding of the Commission&#8217;s operational budget 
should be provided; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Fully support the public release of the Commission&#8217;s conflict-mapping 
report as a way of promoting peace and reconciliation. </b></p>


<p>61. <b>Anti-Government elements should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Cease the deliberate targeting and killing of civilians and withdraw 
orders that authorize attacks on and killing of civilians, particularly religious 
personnel, judicial authorities and civilian government workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Cease using victim-activated IEDs and halt the indiscriminate use of 
IEDs, particularly in all areas frequented by civilians; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Cease practices carried out by parallel judicial structures that impose 
unlawful punishments such as killing, amputation, mutilation and beatings. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The international community should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider increasing support to the Government in implementing the 
EVAW law by channelling development assistance towards commitments made under 
the Tokyo Declaration on gender equality, women&#8217;s empowerment and EVAW law 
implementation, and toward the recommendations the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women made to Afghanistan in July 2013; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Implement a joint monitoring framework that includes specific 
indicators to measure progress and incentives for sustained and increased financial 
support based on demonstrated measurable results by the Government in EVAW law 
enforcement and related measures to end violence against women and girls; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Continue to support the AIHRC, which will struggle to survive without 
continuing donor support. A withdrawal of donor support at this critical juncture 
would result in a rolling back of human rights gains in the face of escalating violations 
across the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Undertake countrywide verification of the 700 international military 
bases and firing ranges that have closed to ensure they are cleared of unexploded and 
abandoned ordnance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Establish a mechanism within ISAF and ANSF that communicates the 
suspected presence of unexploded ordnance from aerial and ground operations to 
appropriate authorities and ensure the marking and clearance of suspect hazardous 
areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Put plans in place to continue engagement on detention issues post-2014, 
especially if international forces, including special forces, will be active in supporting 
any ANSF military or counter-insurgency operations. Detention oversight, 
remediation, training and other torture prevention measures should remain an 
essential aspect of any international support mandate or partnership with Afghan 
forces post-2014.
