<p><b> I. Mandate and strategic priorities 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children was established by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/141 and 
renewed for a further period of three years by the Assembly in its resolution 67/152. 
</p>
<p>2. The present annual report contains a review of major developments towards 
sustaining and scaling up efforts for children&#8217;s protection from violence. It takes into 
account the priorities identified by the Special Representative for the second term of her 
mandate (A/67/230, paras. 100&#8211;110). These include mainstreaming the recommendations 
of the United Nations Study on Violence against Children in the national policy agenda; 
addressing emerging concerns; tackling violence across children&#8217;s life cycles, with priority 
attention to the most vulnerable children; and promoting children&#8217;s protection from 
violence as a priority in the development agenda. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Representative is a high-profile, global independent advocate for the 
prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children. She acts as a bridge-
builder and a catalyst for action across sectors and settings where violence against children 
may occur and promotes the protection of children from violence as a human rights 
imperative. The Special Representative makes use of mutually supportive strategies, 
including advocacy; the promotion of international, regional and national consultations to 
advance progress, identify good practices and promote cross-fertilization of experience; the 
hosting of expert consultations; the development of thematic studies and information 
materials; and the organization of field missions. 
</p>
<p>4. To advance national initiatives and bring the mandate closer to national stakeholders 
and the public at large, since the start of the mandate the Special Representative has 
conducted over 90 missions in more than 50 countries in all regions, most recently to Brazil, 
Costa Rica, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico and Sweden. Country visits provide a valuable 
opportunity to promote the implementation of the Study recommendations and address a wide 
range of concerns through high-level policy discussions with national authorities; awareness-
raising and advocacy initiatives with professional groups, civil society partners and children 
and young people; and media encounters. The visits have helped to promote accelerated 
progress in the universal ratification of human rights treaties; the enactment and enforcement 
of legislation to ban all forms of violence and safeguard the protection of child victims; the 
consolidation of data and research to inform policymaking; and initiatives to prevent 
children&#8217;s exposure to violence in the home, in schools and in care and justice institutions, 
and to address incidents associated with harmful practices and community violence. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Consolidating progress in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the United Nations Study on Violence 
against Children 
</b>5. Capitalizing on the increasing momentum built around the recommendations of the 
Study, over the past year the Special Representative undertook significant initiatives to step 
up progress in children&#8217;s protection from violence. In the present annual report she 
highlights some of these developments, especially those aimed at:  
</p>
<p> (a) Consolidating the human rights foundation of children&#8217;s freedom from 
violence through the ratification and implementation of international standards; 
</p>
<p> (b) Accelerating progress towards a world free from violence, in the light of the 
findings of the global survey on violence against children; </p>


<p> (c) Placing children&#8217;s protection from violence at the centre of the United 
Nations development agenda beyond 2015; 
</p>
<p> (d) Enhancing awareness and consolidating knowledge to strengthen children&#8217;s 
protection from violence, with a special focus on promoting restorative justice for children. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening the human rights foundation of children&#8217;s freedom from 
violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Campaign for the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>6. Children&#8217;s freedom from violence is a fundamental human right recognized by the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols, and addressed by other 
important international legal standards. The ratification and effective implementation of 
these treaties constitutes a crucial step in promoting the prevention and elimination of 
violence and protecting children from all forms of violence. 
</p>
<p>7. The campaign for the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, launched by the Secretary-General in 2010, has 
been a major initiative in this area and has led to consolidated progress over the past year. 
In 2013, the United Nations Treaty Event, held during the high-level segment of the 
General Assembly, marked a critical stage in this process, with its prominent emphasis on 
the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>8. Since the launch of the campaign, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography has 
received 29 additional ratifications and is currently in force in 166 countries. Of the 27 
States not yet party to the Optional Protocol, the majority have made formal commitments 
to its ratification in the framework of the universal periodic review process of the Human 
Rights Council, and before the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other human 
rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>9. For its part, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure was opened for signature in February 2012 and, by December 
2013, had been signed by 44 States and ratified by 9. Its entry into force is fast approaching.1  
</p>
<p>10. To promote the implementation of the Optional Protocol on a communications 
procedure, domestic remedies and child-sensitive procedures and mechanisms need to be in 
place, to ensure respect for the views and the best interests of the child, to protect children&#8217;s 
privacy and to prevent the risk of ill-treatment or intimidation. Wide public information and 
education campaigns and capacity-building for professionals working with and for children 
are crucial steps to make the provisions of the Optional Protocol widely known and to 
facilitate access to relevant information by all those concerned, including children.  
</p>
<p>11. A real difference in implementation will depend on how well children understand 
and make effective use of the provisions of these treaties. For this reason, the Special 
Representative launched in the fall of 2013 two child-friendly publications on these two 
Optional Protocols.2 These user-friendly publications were developed in collaboration with

<p> </p>


<p>partners, including children and young people, from different regions who reviewed and 
refined the text, advised on the design and helped shape these important advocacy tools. It 
is expected that the publications will help to widely disseminate the Optional Protocols, 
raise children&#8217;s awareness about their rights, help to prevent their exposure to sexual 
violence and abuse, and give children confidence to speak up and seek support to prevent 
violations and enjoy effective protection.  Collaboration with Member States and other 
partners will remain crucial to support the translation of these child-friendly materials into 
national languages and promote their consideration in the framework of the school system. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Advancing the implementation of international standards for children&#8217;s protection 
from violence 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Representative pursued close cooperation with United Nations partners, 
regional organizations and other strategic allies in advocacy and policy dialogue for the 
promotion and implementation of international standards to safeguard children&#8217;s right to 
freedom from violence.  
</p>
<p>13. Critical attention was paid to violence in work settings. This is an area where 
significant challenges prevail, with countless children coerced into working in plantations 
or fishing in the deep sea; engaged in hazardous activities; sold into marriage, victims of 
trafficking and sexual exploitation; or recruited by criminal gangs or drug dealers. All these 
situations compromise the protection of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Children engaged in domestic work, most of them girls, are also highly vulnerable to 
violence. According to the most recent figures published by the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), at least 52.6 million people are employed as domestic workers across 
the world, 15.5 million of whom are children.3 Most of them work as housekeepers, nannies 
or caregivers, and many are also migrants who hope to support their families through their 
remittances. Often isolated, with no formal protection structure, child domestic workers are 
highly vulnerable to labour exploitation, working long hours without rest, being denied 
holidays or deprived of wages, and enduring serious manifestations of violence and abuse. 
</p>
<p>15. As highlighted by the Special Representative at the third Global Conference on 
Child Labour, held in October 2013 in Brazil, such forms of violence are not inevitable; 
they can be prevented and effectively addressed. Promoting the ratification and 
implementation of ILO standards, including ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning 
Decent Work for Domestic Workers, remains a crucial step in this regard. Together with 
the promotion of the outcomes of the third Global Conference and the Roadmap for 
Achieving the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour by 2016, these standards 
will remain a core component of the Special Representative&#8217;s global advocacy agenda.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Accelerating progress towards a world free from violence &#8212; the global 
survey on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>16. During 2013, the Special Representative conducted, in collaboration with a wide 
range of partners, a global survey to assess progress since the submission of the United 
Nations Study on Violence against Children. The survey was designed to gain perspective 
on achievements, reflect on good practices and success factors and boost efforts to

<p>overcome persistent challenges and fast track progress in children&#8217;s protection from 
violence. The report on the survey4 was released during the sixty-eighth session of the 
General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>17. As the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child draws closer and discussions on the post-2015 global development agenda 
intensify, the report on the global survey provides strategic insight into how far the 
international community has come towards ensuring children&#8217;s protection from violence 
and, crucially, what still needs to be done to give every girl and boy the opportunity of 
enjoying a childhood free from violence. 
</p><p>18. The global survey confirms that children&#8217;s protection from violence is gaining 
increasing recognition on international, regional and national agendas. The understanding 
of how and why children are exposed to violence has deepened, and strategic actions are 
under way in a number of countries to translate this knowledge into effective protection.  
</p>
<p>19. The findings indicate a promising process of change. There is ever-growing 
ratification of treaties on children&#8217;s protection from violence; significant normative, policy 
and institutional developments have helped to advance national implementation of child 
protection measures; a revitalization of networks and an increase in the number and reach 
of information campaigns have raised awareness of children&#8217;s right to freedom from 
violence; and some promising initiatives have captured the magnitude of this phenomenon 
and its impact on children&#8217;s daily lives. This significant process has helped to address 
attitudes and deeply rooted social norms condoning violence against children and has 
encouraged the mobilization of social support for this cause. 
</p>
<p>20. At the same time, however, progress has been too slow, too uneven and too 
fragmented to make a genuine breakthrough in the protection of children from violence. 
Countless girls and boys of all ages continue to be exposed to the cumulative impact of 
different forms of violence as a result of reactive, ill-coordinated and ill-resourced national 
strategies; dispersed and poorly enforced legislation; and low levels of investment in family 
support and gender- and child-sensitive approaches and mechanisms to support child 
victims and fight impunity. Overall, data and research remain scarce and incipient &#8212; 
insufficient to overcome the invisibility and acceptance of this phenomenon and to 
safeguard children&#8217;s freedom from violence at all times. 
</p>
<p>21. The urgency of this cause has clearly not diminished. Indeed, the magnitude and 
impact of this phenomenon remains high and deeply distressing. For millions of children, 
life is defined by one word: fear. In their early years and throughout adolescence, children 
endure violent disciplinary practices in schools, in care and justice institutions and also 
within the home. Community violence and organized crime undermines their daily life and 
development; millions of children experience violence in work settings, including domestic 
work; child trafficking is on the increase; and in some countries, boys and girls face the risk 
of inhuman sentencing and harmful practices persist, with long-lasting consequences for the 
enjoyment of children&#8217;s rights.  
</p><p>22. The most vulnerable children are at the greatest risk of violence, including girls, 
children with disabilities, children who migrate, children who are confined to institutions, 
and children whose poverty and social exclusion expose them to deprivation, to neglect 
and, at times, to the inherent dangers of life on the streets.

<p>23. With its serious and long-lasting consequences for children&#8217;s development, health 
and education, violence is also associated with serious costs for households, communities 
and national economies.  
</p>
<p>24. Clearly, there is no time for complacency: the situation is dramatic in its scale and 
extent. But there are signs of change. The energy and vision of the children who have 
engaged in the global survey process, together with the commitment of all those who make 
children&#8217;s protection from violence a priority, offer grounds for optimism.  
</p>
<p>25. We must consolidate the gains that have been made, grasp the lessons we have 
learned, and redouble our efforts to shape a dynamic, forward-looking strategy to ensure 
children&#8217;s freedom from violence everywhere and at all times. With this in mind, the global 
survey sets out eight imperatives which should be vigorously pursued: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All Governments should develop and promote a national, child-centered, integrated, 
multidisciplinary and time-bound strategy to prevent and address violence against 
children.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; An explicit legal ban on all forms of violence against children must be enacted as a 
matter of urgency, backed by detailed measures for implementation and effective 
enforcement.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Policy initiatives and legal measures should be accompanied by increased efforts to 
overcome the social acceptance of violence against children.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There must be an ongoing commitment to strengthen children&#8217;s meaningful 
participation.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; All Governments must invest in the social inclusion of girls and boys who are 
particularly vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Governments must recognize the crucial importance of building strong data systems 
and sound evidence to prevent and address violence against children. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A stronger focus is needed on the factors that influence levels of violence and the 
resilience of children, their families and communities. These include poverty, 
deprivation and inequality; weak rule of law, organized crime and political 
instability; mass population movements; and environmental degradation and natural 
disasters.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; As the international community considers the future global development agenda 
beyond 2015, violence against children, including the most vulnerable and 
marginalized girls and boys, should be recognized as a priority and a cross-cutting 
concern.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Placing the protection of children from violence at the centre 
of the global development agenda  
</b></p>
<p>26. Preventing and ending violence against children requires a global effort on an 
unprecedented scale &#8212; an effort that includes political leaders as well as ordinary citizens, 
and children as well as adults.  
</p>
<p>27. One lesson from the past years has been that, despite important progress made in the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, countries affected by violence tend to </p>


<p>lag behind: in these countries, there is a higher risk of poverty and malnourishment, higher 
levels of child mortality, and higher rates of children out of school.5  
</p>
<p>28. Violence compromises social progress. It is often associated with poor rule of law 
and weak enforcement, high levels of organized crime and homicide rates, and a culture of 
impunity.6 For children, violence goes hand in hand with deprivation, high risks of poor 
health, poor school performance and long-term welfare dependency, and hampers the 
enjoyment of their rights. 
</p><p>29. Violence against children remains pervasive and concealed and continues to affect 
millions of children in all stages of development. In early childhood its impact is often 
irreversible, damaging the development of the brain, compromising children&#8217;s physical and 
mental health, and in serious cases leading to disability and death. As children grow up, the 
cumulative exposure to various manifestations of violence often becomes a continuum, 
spilling over from one context to another, spreading across a child&#8217;s life cycle and at times 
persisting across generations.  
</p>
<p>30. Beyond its impact on individual victims and their families, violence diverts 
resources from social spending, slowing economic development and eroding the human and 
social capital of nations. In hours, violence can destroy development gains that took years 
to achieve. The protection of children from violence is a concern the international 
community cannot afford to omit from the post-2015 development agenda: it is a human 
rights imperative, and also a question of good governance and good economics. 
</p>
<p>31. Violence against children is not a new topic in the development agenda. It is a core 
dimension of the right to freedom from fear, proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and emphasized by the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the 
process generated thereafter.  In the Millennium Declaration, Member States reaffirmed the 
right of children to be raised in dignity and free from fear of violence, and expressed 
determination to &#8220;spare no effort in the fight against violence&#8221; (para. 8); moreover, they 
resolved to encourage the ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and its Optional Protocols, which set out the normative foundation for 
children&#8217;s right to freedom from violence. Furthermore, during the Millennium Summit of 
the United Nations, States expressed their commitment to strengthen child protection 
systems, to enhance accountability, and to prevent and combat all forms of violence against 
women and girls. 
</p>
<p>32. Despite their undeniable relevance, these values have remained on the margins of 
the development agenda. One major reason was the fact that no clear goal, target or 
indicator was identified to mobilize action and to monitor progress. This situation can be 
changed this time around and there is a sound foundation to build upon. 
</p>
<p>33. As noted by the United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations 
Development Agenda, &#8220;the prevention and reduction of all forms of violence and abuse &#8212; 
and protection against their specific manifestations &#8230; &#8212; should be at the heart of any 
agenda which fully recognizes the centrality of human security, both as a human rights 
imperative and as integral to development&#8221;.7 According to the Task Team, sustainability

<p>&#8220;implies ensuring inter-generational justice and a future world fit for children. This entails 
safeguarding a sustainable future in which children will be able to grow up healthy, well-
nourished, resilient, well-educated, culturally sensitive and protected from violence and 
neglect.&#8221;8  
</p>
<p>34. In its report, the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 
Development Agenda pays significant attention to the right of freedom from fear and from 
violence, recognizing this as &#8220;the most fundamental human entitlement, and the essential 
foundation for building peaceful and prosperous societies.&#8221;9 It stressed: &#8220;To fulfil our 
vision of promoting sustainable development, we must go beyond the [Millennium 
Development Goals]. They did not focus enough on reaching the very poorest and most 
excluded people. They were silent on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on 
development.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p>35. During the period covered by the present report, important global thematic 
consultations were held to inform the future development agenda. In Helsinki, Monrovia 
and Panama City, the consultations devoted to violence and citizen security gave prominent 
attention to human rights and the elimination of all forms of violence. During the Panama 
consultation, participants specifically called for the inclusion of distinct goals to safeguard 
the protection of boys and girls from violence.  
</p>
<p>36. The protection of children from violence was also voiced as a special concern at<b> </b>the 
many national consultations held around the world<b> </b>to inform the post-2015 development 
agenda. As noted in a report produced by the United Nations Development Group 
Millennium Development Goals Task Force, personal security and life in peace are 
particularly urgent concerns for people around the world, while inequality and lack of 
policies for children and youth are acknowledged as crucial drivers of violence.11 Clearly, 
there is a wide consensus on the urgency of addressing children&#8217;s protection from violence. 
</p>
<p>37. The question at hand is therefore not whether or not children&#8217;s freedom from 
violence should be reflected in the development agenda beyond 2015. The fundamental 
question is how best to address this critical concern and identify practical goals and targets 
to mobilize action and leverage progress in the years to come. To advance this process, 
three important steps are needed.  
</p>
<p>38. Firstly, it is crucial to mobilize the voice and support of leaders in all areas. In this 
spirit, on 20 November 2013, the International Day of the Child, the Special Representative 
together with other United Nations child rights experts issued a call to all Governments to 
include the protection from violence of all girls and boys, including the most vulnerable and 
marginalized, as a priority in the post-2015 agenda, and to back this commitment with firm 
funding.12  
</p>
<p>39. As this joint statement highlights, &#8220;the post-2015 framework is a renewed 
opportunity to ensure that children&#8217;s rights are front and centre in the global development 
agenda to effectively prevent and address violence against children and fight impunity for

<p>crimes committed against them&#8221;.13 The experts further emphasized that without freedom 
from violence, sustainable development could not be fully achieved. 
</p>
<p>40. Political support and sound resources are indispensable to achieve this goal. In the 
same statement, the special procedures also stressed that &#8220;inclusive, sustainable and duly 
funded child protection systems should be established in all countries, supported by sound 
investment in social protection programmes to address the root causes of child rights 
violations, to promote universal access to basic social services that help families care for 
and protect their children, and to safeguard the rights of children in need of assistance and 
alternative care&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. Secondly, it is critical to identify practical goals, targets and indicators to accelerate 
and monitor progress in children&#8217;s protection from violence. It is high time to measure what 
we treasure! Children&#8217;s safety and freedom from violence cannot be neglected, as they are 
indispensable dimensions of social progress and sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>42. In this regard, the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda 
recommended the inclusion in the future agenda of dimensions such as eliminating all 
forms of violence against children and in particular against girls, and ending child 
marriage.14  
</p>
<p>43. This is an area where the international community can capitalize on the important 
efforts promoted within and beyond the United Nations system, including quantitative and 
qualitative monitoring tools developed by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), 
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Health Organization, the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and others that play a role in child protection. There is 
in fact a sound foundation to build upon, including data on child and maternal mortality, on 
homicides, on sexual violence, female genital mutilation and child and forced marriage, on 
birth registration and on violent child disciplinary practices, as well as on attitudes towards 
violence, confidence in justice and security institutions, and on willingness to report 
incidents of violence. 
</p>
<p>44. Thirdly, it is imperative to include in this process those who are most affected. 
Children and young people need to be provided with genuine opportunities and platforms to 
share their views and experience of violence, and to actively influence the shaping of the 
future agenda, as true partners and agents of change.  
</p>
<p>45. Significant work has been promoted in this area by civil society partners. With their 
support, children and young people are participating in consultations on the future 
development agenda. In Costa Rica, for example, young people shared the vision of their 
country as a nation where people can live in safety and without fear; a nation where 
everyone shares a deep commitment to eliminate all forms of violence in the home, in 
education spaces and in the community &#8212; from physical maltreatment to gender-based 
violence, bullying and abuse, including sexual abuse. 
</p>
<p>46. As the international community moves forward in the shaping of the post-2015 
development agenda, it is crucial to promote an agenda that is solidly anchored in human 
rights, that bridges development and children&#8217;s protection concerns, and that is visibly 
guided by the best interests of the child.  
</p>
<p>47. The human dignity of children and their right to protection from violence must be at 
the heart of this global effort, just as they must be at the heart of national strategies. As it 
marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the

<p>Child, 2014 provides a timely occasion to consolidate this process. The Special 
Representative will continue to pursue this core priority. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Enhancing awareness and consolidating knowledge to 
strengthen children&#8217;s protection from violence &#8212; promoting 
restorative justice for children  
</b>48. To advance progress in the follow-up to the Study and identify positive experiences 
and strategic recommendations to assist States in their efforts to prevent and address 
violence against children, the Special Representative has placed a special emphasis on the 
organization of expert consultations and the publication of thematic studies on priority 
areas of concern.  
</p>
<p>49. Protecting children affected by gang and community violence and the opportunities 
and risks associated with the use of information and communication technologies are two 
important topics the Special Representative will pursue in 2014.15  
</p>
<p>50. Preventing and eliminating violence against children in the justice system has been 
another area of concern at the centre of the Special Representative&#8217;s agenda. For this 
reason, in 2012, she joined the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the development of a joint 
report on the prevention of and responses to violence against children within the juvenile 
justice system (A/HRC/21/25). 
</p><p>51. At the time the report was prepared, more than 1 million children were deprived of 
their liberty worldwide, most in pretrial detention or for minor offences, and countless 
children faced violent and degrading treatment throughout the criminal justice process 
(ibid., paras. 8, 39). Many children are exposed to psychological, physical and sexual 
violence during arrest and interrogation, or while being held in police custody; they are 
vulnerable to violence at the hands of staff and adult detainees in detention centres; and 
they also endure violence as a form of punishment or sentencing. Children also suffer deep 
trauma when their parents face inhuman sentencing, such as stoning, amputation, capital 
punishment and life sentencing.  
</p>
<p>52. To reverse this pattern, it is imperative to provide alternatives to detention and 
custodial sentences, including through restorative justice. With this in mind, in 2013 the 
Special Representative launched a thematic report on restorative justice for children.16  
</p><p>53. The report was informed by an international expert consultation, held in June 2013 
in Indonesia, in cooperation with the Governments of Indonesia and Norway. It examines 
the potential of restorative justice programmes to facilitate conflict resolution and provide 
appropriate protection to children involved with the justice system. The sections below 
highlight the key dimensions of that report. 
</p>
<p>54. Restorative justice is aimed at rehabilitating and reintegrating a young offender by 
helping to reconnect him or her with the community. Through a non-adversarial and 
voluntary process, based on dialogue, negotiation and problem solving, it helps the offender 
to understand the harm caused to the victim and the community, acknowledge

</p>
<p>55. In a number of societies restorative justice values, such as healing and 
reconciliation, have long served to resolve conflict and repair harm. In recent decades, 
traditional forms of restorative justice have started to be promoted in both judicial and non-
judicial settings, a process that is resulting in a paradigm shift away from retributive models 
of justice (see the table below).

</i>56. One of the strengths of restorative justice processes is that they can be adapted and 
implemented through various models, such as mediation, conciliation, conferencing and 
sentencing circles. They apply to children who are victims, offenders or witnesses and 
promote healing, respect and strengthened relationships; they can be introduced at all stages 
of the criminal justice process and in a range of other contexts, such as in families, schools, 
residential care and communities.  
</p>
<p>57. In their most developed form, restorative justice programmes are multisectoral and 
go beyond the criminal justice system to include the provision of services, support and 
access to education and health services, vocational training and other activities in order to 
prevent reoffending.  
</p>
<p>58. The importance of restorative justice has become greater still in light of the growing 
perceived threat of juvenile delinquency, often fuelled by inflammatory media reports, 
which has led to the introduction of lower ages of criminal responsibility and longer periods 
of deprivation of liberty. As a result, child populations in detention have been growing 
exponentially.  </p>


<p>59. With a view to reversing this worrying trend, a number of countries have recognized 
the value of promoting restorative justice processes to protect children and safeguard their 
rights in the justice system (see box below).  
</p>
<p>   <b>Indonesia adopts legislation on restorative justicea</b> 
&#8226; The law is framed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and addresses 
</p>
<p>children as offenders, as victims and as witnesses of crimes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Status offences are decriminalized. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The minimum age of criminal responsibility is raised from 8 to 12 and marital status 
no longer constitutes grounds for treating the child as an adult. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Children&#8217;s right to legal counsel and other assistance and to access justice before an 
objective and impartial court and in closed proceedings is recognized, as is the right to 
humane treatment and freedom from torture and other inhuman, cruel and degrading 
treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of privacy and confidentiality of the child&#8217;s identity in public media is 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Arrest, detention or imprisonment can be used only as a last resort and for the shortest 
possible time. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Only specialized personnel can handle cases of children involved with the justice 
system. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Police, prosecutors and judges are required to prioritize diversion and restorative 
justice in cases of an offence punishable with a sentence of imprisonment of up to a 
maximum of seven years and when the child is not a recidivist. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Legislation provides a variety of sentencing options, including admonishment, non-
institutional and institutional treatment, social services, supervision and vocational 
training.

</p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework for restorative justice 
</b>60. The establishment of a restorative justice programme is framed by significant 
international standards on the protection of the rights of children involved with the criminal 
justice system.17 In particular, the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the 
right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law 
to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child&#8217;s sense of dignity and 
worth so as to reinforce the child&#8217;s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of others, taking into account the age of the child and the desirability of promoting his or 
her social reintegration, and his or her assumption of a constructive role in society (art. 40, 
para. 1). The Convention encourages the establishment of a separate justice system 
specifically applicable to children (art. 40, para. 3); anticipates measures to deal with the 
child without resorting to judicial proceedings, provided that human rights and legal 
safeguards are fully respected (art. 40, para. 3 (b)); and makes reference to a variety of

<p>dispositions to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-
being, and proportionate both to their circumstances and to the offence (art. 40, para. 4). 
</p><p>61. These important provisions have been further complemented by significant 
international standards on human rights in the administration of justice.18 Moreover, the 
Economic and Social Council adopted basic principles on the use of restorative justice, 
encouraging the development of mediation, conciliation, conferencing and sentencing 
circles as effective alternatives to formal criminal justice mechanisms.19 Through its general 
comments, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has also promoted restorative justice 
programmes.20 
</p>
<p><b> B. Restorative justice models  
 1. Family group conferencing  
</b></p>
<p>62. Family group conferencing (FGC) is a model derived from traditional means of 
dispute resolution found among the Maori communities in New Zealand. Emphasizing 
collective responsibility and justice, the approach draws on community strengths and 
resources to develop solutions to conflicts, including community consideration of the 
underlying factors contributing to delinquency, such as child abuse and neglect. FGC 
recognizes the interests of the victim, and the importance of the active involvement of the 
victim in the resolution of the harm caused. 
</p>
<p>63. The Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act of New Zealand includes a 
presumption in favour of diversion. Accordingly, offences by children are primarily 
referred to an FGC, with a view to keeping children away from formal court proceedings. 
</p>
<p>64. Typically, FGC participants discuss the offence with a trained facilitator, giving both 
victim and offender the opportunity to describe their experience. This enables the offender 
to build an understanding of the harm caused, and the parties to find an appropriate 
resolution to the conflict through a collective agreement. A proposal for a suitable 
diversionary programme is developed, which is then presented to the court and to which the 
offender must consent freely. The court acts as an oversight mechanism to ensure that the 
agreement is legally sound and has a follow-up function to assess compliance.  
</p>
<p>65. FGCs have been used to address offences against children, including cases of child 
maltreatment, as well as to address offences committed by children, and incidents of 
domestic violence and drug abuse. They have also been implemented in non-judicial 
settings, such as schools and residential care facilities. 
</p>
<p>66. Variations of the model have been implemented in many countries.21 In Thailand, 
for example, family and community group conferencing is an alternative non-prosecution 
measure for child offenders who have committed crimes warranting a sentence of five years 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 These include the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice 
</p>
<p>(the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the 
Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their 
Liberty and the Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System.

<p>of prison or less; it has helped to significantly decrease recidivism.22 In this process, the 
court has an oversight function and may intervene if it considers that the conference and the 
agreement have not been conducted lawfully and in respect of the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Victim-offender mediation</b>23<b> </b></p>
<p>67. Victim-offender mediation is a model often applied in cases involving minor 
offences committed by children, although it is also used for more serious offences. This 
model is most commonly used as an alternative referral by the court after the offender has 
made a formal admission of guilt.The process promotes dialogue in a safe and structured 
setting, which allows the young offender to learn about the impact of his or her offence 
while helping the victim and offender to develop a mutually acceptable plan to address the 
harm that has been caused. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Circle sentencing</b>24<b> </b></p>
<p>68. Circle sentencing derives from traditional conflict resolution mechanisms practiced 
among indigenous people in Canada and the United States of America. Integrating 
traditional justice rituals and formal criminal justice procedures, the circle commonly 
includes the victim and the offender and their respective communities of support, as well as 
the judge and court personnel, prosecutor, defence lawyers, police and any community 
members who have an interest in the case. It is facilitated and presided over by the court 
judge. 
</p><p>69. Participants devise a sentencing plan that meets the needs of all parties and is then 
formally incorporated into a court sentence. The goal is to heal all those affected &#8212; 
including the offender &#8212; and facilitate rehabilitation and prevent recidivism. Circles show 
consistent compliance rates, and an agreement is reached in an overwhelming majority of 
cases that are dealt with through circle conferencing. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Community reparative boards</b>25<b> </b></p>
<p>70. Community reparative boards, which have been long practised in the United States, 
are a form of community sanctioning that are court ordered and made up of a group of 
trained community members. Together with the offender, the board develops a time-bound 
sanction agreement. After the agreed time has passed, the board is responsible for follow-up 
and the subsequent submission of a report to the court concerning the offender&#8217;s 
compliance.  
</p>
<p>71. Recently these reparative boards have also included victims in their meetings. The 
process aims to instil in the offender a sense of ownership of the agreement and the justice 
process, thereby fostering responsible citizenship. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Victim impact panels</b>26<b> </b></p>
<p>72. Victim impact panels are forums where victims of certain offences meet with 
offenders of the same type of offence in order to give their account of the impact the

<p>offence has had on their lives. The victims speaking on the panel are not the victims of the 
offences committed by the offenders present. These panels are commonly used as a form of 
diversion or as part of a probation sentence for children who have been found guilty of 
driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promoting restorative justice for children &#8212; key questions 
 1. When is restorative justice appropriate?  
</b></p>
<p>73. For the justice process to be truly restorative there must first be sufficient evidence 
to support the charge against the child (a prima facie case), and the alleged offence must 
fall within the scope of offences eligible for diversion as defined by the law.27 The child 
offender must admit responsibility for the offence and the entire process must be 
undertaken voluntarily &#8212; this demonstrates the offender&#8217;s willingness to participate in the 
process and make amends. A child&#8217;s admission of responsibility must never be obtained 
through undue pressure or coercion. It is also necessary to obtain the consent of the child&#8217;s 
parent(s), guardian or the responsible adult, as well as the voluntary consent of the victim, 
without coercion or undue pressure, to diversion to a restorative process.  
</p>
<p>74. If a case meets the requirements, restorative justice can be used to replace formal 
justice processes by means of diversion, or to complement them as part of a court 
proceeding, as a sentence or as a dimension of the child&#8217;s reintegration. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. How do restorative justice processes protect children from discrimination and 
promote inclusion? 
</b></p>
<p>75. Restorative justice processes enable stakeholders to engage in dialogue concerning 
negative behaviour and discuss underlying reasons for the behaviour. This in turn helps to 
identify and address inequalities and prejudice in a constructive manner, and to break down 
discrimination and foster empathy and understanding among the parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>76. For children who are marginalized or face discrimination on the basis of gender, 
disability, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status or similar grounds, restorative processes 
offer the possibility of avoiding a formal justice system where they may be at risk of re-
victimization. 
</p>
<p>77. In cases involving family violence or sexual violence, however, restorative 
processes should only be used when appropriate to prevent risks to the physical and 
emotional safety of the victim and to secure children&#8217;s protection. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Assessing underlying factors 
</i>78. The restorative programme must treat children differently from adults and each 
child&#8217;s specific situation must be taken into account. This includes personal risk factors 
associated with offending, including mental health conditions that may be caused by trauma 
and violence experienced in a child&#8217;s early years. 
</p>
<p>79. Other risk factors include poverty and deprivation associated with an unstable family 
environment, homelessness, and exposure to community or gang violence. Individual and 
structural discrimination are also significant, as demonstrated by the continuous 
overrepresentation of ethnic and minority groups in the justice system.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 See for example the Child Justice Act (Act No. 75 of 2008) of South Africa, art. 52 (a&#8211;e). Available 
</p>
<p>from www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=108691. </p>


<p>80. Studies suggest that restorative justice programmes that do not address the 
underlying reasons for offending, or fail to encompass rehabilitative and preventive 
measures, show a lower success rate in preventing recidivism.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Girls and restorative justice 
</i>81. Girls constitute a particularly vulnerable group, and their offending is often closely 
related to various forms of discrimination and deprivation: girls living in poverty may be 
easy targets and manipulated by criminal networks for sexual exploitation and drug dealing. 
Girls are also at risk of being arrested for prostitution or rounded up on the assumption that 
they are sex workers. 
</p>
<p>82. The United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial 
Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules) provide an important reference in this 
regard as they address gender-based discrimination in the criminal justice system and call 
for gender-specific options for diversionary measures and the development of pretrial and 
sentencing alternatives for girls and women (rule 57). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. How are procedural safeguards for children ensured in the restorative justice 
process? 
</b></p>
<p>83. To ensure that the rights of the child are respected and that the process is lawfully 
conducted, a competent authority should have effective judicial overview. This strengthens 
the validity of the outcome and ensures that legal safeguards are respected.   
</p>
<p>84. In order to ensure that restorative justice processes provide the necessary safeguards 
and are conducted in a consistent manner, guidelines and standard operating procedures for 
professionals should be in place.28 
</p>
<p>85. Professionals and community facilitators dealing with children involved with the 
justice system must also receive adequate and continuous training and capacity-building.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. How can diversion and restorative justice programmes be used for serious offenders 
and convicted children?  
</b></p>
<p>86. Many restorative justice programmes have diverted cases of serious offenses from 
the criminal justice system to restorative processes. Studies show that the effectiveness of 
restorative justice in reducing recidivism is particularly great among serious offenders 
accused of violent crimes. Research also suggests that restorative justice can have a deeper 
healing impact on serious offenders than on non-serious offenders.29 
</p>
<p>87. Restorative justice can take place during the time that a child is serving a prison 
sentence, or as a component of a probation programme.30 It can significantly help reduce 
recidivism. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28
 For example, in the Philippines, the Department of Social Welfare and Development issued the 
</p>
<p>Guidelines in the Conduct of Diversion for Children in Conflict with the Law to ensure that diversion 
is appropriately conducted by social workers, law enforcement officers, prosecutors and other 
stakeholders (Administrative Order No. 7, 2008).

 For example, in Oaxaca State, Mexico, the use of restorative justice for juveniles deprived of liberty

health-care services, vocational training and education, recorded no cases of recidivism. The

<p><b> 5. How is restorative justice linked to the formal justice process? 
</b>88. In a number of countries restorative justice has been implemented as a core 
component of the juvenile justice system through a specialized juvenile justice act which 
identifies and integrates restorative justice as a governing principle.31  
89. Many countries first establish pilot projects in order to divert children from the 
formal justice system to restorative programmes. Pilot projects allow States to see evidence 
of the programme&#8217;s effectiveness and, following its satisfactory implementation, practices 
are developed on a larger scale or incorporated into legislation and policy.32  
</p>
<p><b> 6. How is restorative justice for children implemented in informal justice systems? 
</b>90. Informal justice systems33 may be more accessible for children and their families, 
provide greater potential for healing and be less costly for those involved. But it is crucial 
that in addition they uphold and protect the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>91. In this regard, five imperatives are of crucial relevance: there must be a legislative 
basis for customary law that is in line with international human rights standards; a range of 
appropriate alternatives for the child&#8217;s rehabilitation and reintegration must be available; 
there must be proper assessment of the processes and procedures used, including with 
regard to who selects the individuals to sit on the mediation panel; capacity and knowledge 
relating to children&#8217;s rights and national legislation, including juvenile justice laws, must be 
continuously ensured; and the right to appeal must be guaranteed so that there is oversight 
by the formal justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The benefits of restorative justice 
 1. The benefits of restorative justice for children  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Taking responsibility and changing behaviour 
</i>92. Research shows that children involved in restorative programmes show fewer 
tendencies towards violence, both in the community and at home, are more likely to stay 
away from gang involvement and demonstrate significantly lower rates of recidivism. With 
their participatory approach, restorative justice programmes enhance opportunities for 
young offenders to fully grasp the extent of the harm caused and become part of a 
constructive response with a change in attitudes toward offending.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>extensive use of restorative justice programmes in pretrial and post-trial settings meant that in 2010, 
the state&#8217;s only detention facility housed as few as 35 children who had committed serious offences.

<p>in South Africa, through the adoption in 2008 of the Child Justice Act. 
 
</p>
<p>32
 This has been the approach followed in countries such as Montenegro and Peru. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
 The working definition of informal justice used in the present report is: the resolution of disputes and 
</p>
<p>the regulation of conduct by adjudication or the assistance of a neutral third party that is not part of 
the judiciary as established by law and/or whose substantive, procedural or structural foundation is 
not primarily based on statutory law. See United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the 
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, <i>Informal Justice 
Systems: Charting a Course for Human Rights-based Engagement</i> (New York, 2012), p. 29. </p>


<p>93. Similarly, parents who have assisted their child through a restorative justice process 
show less inclination to resort to violence as a form of discipline.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Feeling respected and being heard during the restorative justice process 
</i>94. In contrast with the formal justice system and courtroom setting, which may become 
extremely intimidating for children, restorative justice programmes provide young people 
with an opportunity to express their views in a safe environment and surrounded by a 
supportive network, where they can communicate in their own words and in a non-
threatening manner. 
</p>
<p>95. Restorative justice shows very positive results in terms of victim, offender, family 
and community satisfaction. The parties involved, including child offenders, recognize that 
they have a greater opportunity to be heard, to enhance understanding of the various 
positions and to participate in the outcome of the process, while having a greater sense of 
control over this process. This is an important factor for the effective implementation of 
restorative justice programmes and helps to make the system more responsive to the rights 
of all those involved.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Avoiding the harmful effects of deprivation of liberty 
</i>96. The Study and the thematic report on prevention of and responses to violence 
against children within the juvenile justice system (A/HRC/21/25) highlighted the harmful 
effects of detention on children, and the serious risk of violence to children deprived of 
liberty. As these reports indicate, there is widespread overreliance on the incarceration of 
children, who are often held in pretrial detention or for minor offences.  
</p>
<p>97. Restorative justice provides an alternative for addressing offending and promoting 
accountability for the offence, while shielding children from the harmful effects of their 
involvement with the criminal justice system. It helps to prevent children&#8217;s deprivation of 
liberty while protecting them from violence, abuse and exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Freedom from stigma 
</i>98. In a conventional justice system, children are likely to suffer from the long-term 
consequences of having a criminal record, including difficulty in obtaining employment 
and engaging in community activities, such as sports. Living with social stigma can have a 
profound effect upon their self-esteem and feeling of self-worth. Differently from the 
retributive system, restorative programmes help to prevent such stigma, as they focus on the 
offence itself, rather than on shaming those associated with it.  
</p>
<p>99. In most legislative systems that have integrated restorative justice as diversionary or 
alternative measures,34 the successful completion of a restorative agreement will see the 
closure of the formal case by the court. This means that the child will be burdened neither 
by a criminal record, nor by the shame and humiliation of the offence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The benefits of restorative justice in non-judicial settings  
</b>100. Schools can be an ideal environment in which to promote the development and 
dissemination of values of non-violence and respect for human rights among pupils and 
staff, and in the wider community.35 For this reason, schools in many countries promote

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34
 For example Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines and South Africa.

<p>restorative justice practices to prevent and respond to bullying and violence in the 
playground and address serious offences within the school, including rape. 
</p>
<p>101. Models of restorative justice in school may involve teaching conflict resolution, 
promoting peace studies, training student mediators to resolve conflicts among their peers 
and, in some cases, bringing parents and teachers together to play a supportive role in the 
mediation process. Peer mediation is used to help students to address issues at the root of 
their disputes and build their resolution skills.  
</p>
<p>102. Research also confirms the positive results achieved with restorative justice 
processes in residential care settings. They help to lower incidents of violence against 
children, to prevent the use of violence by children and to promote positive behaviour by 
staff and young people, while contributing to the prevention of the criminalization of 
children.36 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The benefits of restorative justice for the parties involved 
</b>103. Research consistently confirms that results for restorative processes are 
overwhelmingly positive in terms of satisfying the need for fairness and justice among all 
parties involved. Most importantly, these processes promote a greater involvement of the 
victim, and victims systematically indicate that their views are better respected in 
restorative justice processes than in court.37  
104. Victims are also more likely to receive an apology from the offender if they follow a 
restorative process rather than a court-based procedure. Evaluations also indicate that 
victims identify symbolic restitutions as more important than material restitution. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The benefits of restorative justice for society  
</b>105. The Study found that institutionalization creates an unnecessary financial drain on 
budgets and that institutionalization in a closed environment can be as much as 12 times the 
per capita cost of community-based care options.38 
</p>
<p>106. There are high personal costs incurred by children who become involved with the 
justice system, and the costs to society are also high, including the cost of judicial 
proceedings and of keeping children in detention facilities.  
</p>
<p>107. Restorative justice helps reduce costs associated with offending and reoffending.39 
More importantly, children who complete community-based restorative justice programmes 
are more likely to return to school and increase their chances of becoming productive 
members of society.

</p>
<p>37
 For example, in Queensland, Australia, an analysis of data collected by the Department of Justice 
</p>
<p>showed that, of 351 offenders, parents and victims interviewed, 98 per cent said the restorative 
process was fair, and 97 to 99 per cent said they were satisfied with the agreement reached in the 
conference. A study conducted in Western Australia found similar results regarding perceptions of 
fairness and justice among offenders, victims, and families. See Kathleen Daly and Hennessey Hayes,

<p><b> E. Overcoming challenges in developing and implementing restorative 
justice for children 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Addressing negative social perceptions 
</b></p>
<p>108. The social perception that juvenile delinquency is on the rise and that the children 
concerned pose a security threat is often not based on data. Moreover, the negative 
perception and stereotyping of children involved with the criminal justice system represents 
a significant challenge to the development and implementation of appropriate restorative 
justice legislation, policies and programmes. There is therefore an urgent need for effective 
advocacy and awareness-raising to reassure society of the benefits of restorative justice 
programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Ensuring a sound legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>109. Sound legislation is indispensable for safeguarding access to justice and the 
protection of children&#8217;s rights in the juvenile justice system, to prevent children&#8217;s 
criminalization and exposure to violence, and to ensure the use of restorative justice 
whenever appropriate. 
</p>
<p>110. Without a clear framework provided by the law, there may be inconsistent and even 
complete abandonment of the implementation of restorative processes. Firm and clear 
legislation is crucial for instituting and legitimizing viable restorative justice programmes. 
And it becomes indispensable to establish child-sensitive counselling and complaint 
mechanisms that support children&#8217;s access to justice and involvement in restorative 
processes, while avoiding the risk of their manipulation in these processes. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Enhancing capacity-building for all relevant stakeholders  
</b></p>
<p>111. Several case studies have demonstrated that even when diversion to restorative 
justice has been promoted as an alternative to formal judicial proceedings, important risks 
may persist for the protection of children. These include the use of threats to obtain 
compliance with a restorative agreement; testimony of a child or admission of 
responsibility obtained through undue means; referral to a diversion programme without the 
prior consent of the victim or the offender; the use of rushed mediation sessions; referral to 
public mediation sessions, where the right to confidentiality is violated; and the referral of 
cases to restorative justice conferencing without any preliminary inquiry or compelling 
evidence. 
</p>
<p>112. A key to overcoming these challenges is continuous training, supported by standard 
operating procedures and clear guidance to protect the best interest of the child, and to 
facilitate preliminary assessments and evidence gathering. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Promoting coordination among all restorative justice service providers and justice 
actors  
</b></p>
<p>113. Most children who go through a restorative justice process will need services and 
support to fully rehabilitate and reintegrate. Children&#8217;s engagement in formal education, 
vocational training, sports and other leisure activities help to build nurturing relationships 
and coping strategies, and prevent behavioural patterns that may lead to reoffending. 
</p>
<p>114. With this in mind, the effective coordination of all actors and service providers 
across multiple sectors and levels of administration is essential to ensure holistic and 
effective restorative justice programmes for children.  </p>


<p><b> 5. Assigning human and financial resources </b></p>
<p>115. To ensure the effectiveness of restorative justice programmes, it is also essential to 
develop and implement long-term plans for specialized human resources, while building 
upon local human resources and structures. This includes civil society organizations, local 
and traditional leaders and community volunteers. 
</p>
<p>116. Weak or inconsistent funding may compromise restorative justice efforts. Thus, 
securing continuous financial support for State-run projects and for the work of civil society 
partners is fundamental to sustain restorative programmes and services over time.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Consolidating data, research and evaluation  
</b></p>
<p>117. The lack of centralized disaggregated data on children who enter the juvenile justice 
system remains a challenge across regions and compromises the monitoring and evaluation 
of policies and programmes on diversion and restorative justice. 
</p><p>118. Sound evidence, supported by reliable data, is crucial to mobilize support to prevent 
children&#8217;s stigmatization and victimization, and to strengthen investment in child-sensitive 
approaches and restorative justice processes. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Restorative justice represents a paradigm shift in how justice for children and 
young people is perceived in many countries around the world. It is anchored in the 
inalienable rights of the child and promotes the accountability and reintegration of 
children who have committed an offence through a non-adversarial and voluntary 
process, based on dialogue and problem solving.</b> 
</p>
<p>120. <b>The decisive contribution of restorative justice programmes to upholding 
justice and the rule of law, preventing recidivism, avoiding stigma and fostering the 
child&#8217;s sense of dignity and worth is clear. But these programmes also help to 
strengthen social accountability for the protection of children, while avoiding a 
significant financial drain on national resources. These gains can be effectively 
diverted to build strong and cohesive societies where children can develop to their full 
potential, free from fear, violence and discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>Guided by relevant international standards, national experiences and existing 
research, the recommendations below highlight crucial steps to achieve this goal. </b> 
</p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>States should undertake a comprehensive legislative review to align relevant 
domestic legislation, whether in statutory, customary or religious laws, with human 
rights standards; in countries with plural legal systems, the supremacy of legislation 
aligned with international human rights standards should be explicitly recognized in 
the law to avert potential conflicts in legal interpretation and implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>Legislation should decriminalize status offences and survival behaviours and 
include legal safeguards to protect the child&#8217;s best interests, and the child&#8217;s rights to 
freedom from violence and discrimination, to access to justice and to free and safe 
participation in proceedings throughout the restorative justice process, as well as to 
legal and other relevant assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Legislation should provide law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and the 
judiciary with options for diverting children away from the criminal justice system 
and promoting restorative justice processes at all stages of the proceedings; it should </b></p>


<p><b>include alternative and educative measures, such as warnings, probation, judicial 
supervision and community work, to be applied in combination with restorative 
justice processes or when restorative justice is not appropriate. 
</b>125. <b>Children&#8217;s right to recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration should be firmly 
expressed in legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Legislation should recognize that restorative justice and informal justice or 
conflict-resolution mechanisms, while being accessible at the local and community 
levels and playing an important role in the protection and reintegration of children, 
should never jeopardize children&#8217;s rights or preclude children from having access to 
the formal justice system. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Training and guidance 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>Effective training should be assured to all relevant actors, including the police, 
prosecutors, the judiciary, probation officers, lawyers, social workers, facilitators and 
mediators.  
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>Training should provide skills to promote dialogue, manage emotions and 
conflict, and secure the safety of child participants. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>Training initiatives should also address child rights and relevant legislation, as 
well as diversion, restorative justice processes and other alternative non-custodial 
measures.  
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>Guidelines and standard operational procedures, as well as centrally approved 
systems of accreditation, should be developed for professionals. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Coordination, adequate resources, data and research 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>Coordination and close cooperation among all restorative justice service 
providers and other relevant stakeholders should be institutionalized at the national 
and local levels.  
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>The availability of a sufficient number of well-trained professionals in 
restorative justice should be secured.  
</b>133. <b>Adequate financial resources should be made available to support and sustain 
restorative justice programmes, and to secure periodic capacity-building for justice 
actors, community volunteers and peer educators. 
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>Data, research and evaluation should be developed and widely shared to 
promote a paradigm shift from punitive to restorative justice approaches that respect 
and protect the rights of the child.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Awareness-raising and social mobilization 
</b></p>
<p>135. <b>Awareness-raising campaigns should be undertaken at the national and local 
levels with relevant stakeholders, including local authorities, traditional and religious 
leaders and the media, to enhance understanding of restorative justice and promote 
child-friendly attitudes among justice professionals and service providers, and to 
sensitize the general public to the importance of restorative justice processes. 
</b>136. <b>The role of civil society organizations in the implementation of restorative 
justice programmes should be promoted; furthermore, mapping and mobilizing local 
resources and community volunteers should be encouraged for successful 
implementation at the community level. </b></p>


<p><b> VI. Looking ahead 
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>The present report presents an overview of strategic developments promoted 
by the Special Representative in advancing progress in the implementation of the 
Study recommendations. These initiatives have helped to further consolidate 
commitment to children&#8217;s protection from violence and strengthen advocacy, legal 
and policy action for violence prevention and elimination.  
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>In line with the priorities set out for the second term of the mandate, the 
Special Representative enhanced efforts to anchor the Study recommendations in the 
national policy agenda; to tackle concerns associated with violence prevention and 
elimination in the justice system; and to promote the inclusion of children&#8217;s protection 
from violence as a crucial dimension in the post-2015 development agenda.  
</b></p>
<p>139. <b>The Special Representative will continue to mobilize support for these 
important efforts and for the identification of goals and targets to accelerate progress 
in the protection of children from all forms of violence. We need to measure what we 
treasure. And if we are to succeed, it is critical that children and young people enjoy 
genuine participation in this process &#8212; not as accidental partners, but as real agents 
of change.  
</b></p>
<p>140. <b>The Special Representative looks forward to pursuing her collaboration with 
Member States and all other stakeholders in the further strengthening of this crucial 
agenda and the building of a world free from violence.
