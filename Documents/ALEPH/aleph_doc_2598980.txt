Executive Summary 
Introduction
The Oromin Joint Venture Group (OJVG) holds a 15 year renewable mining license in respect of the 
Golouma Gold Concession (the “Project” or “Property”), approximately 212.6 km2 of land in the 
Tambacounda region of south-eastern Senegal. The registered name of the mining concession is the 
Golouma Gold Concession and although it has previously been referred to as OJVG’s Sabodala Project, 
it is currently referred to as the OJVG Gold Project in almost all public disclosure by the OJVG. For the 
purposes of this study, the OJVG Gold Project, OJVG concession, OJVG property, OJVG Golouma Gold 
Project, Golouma Gold Project and Project are synonymous.
Gold exploration on the property has been conducted by Oromin Explorations Ltd. (Oromin) since 2005. 
Oromin has been successful in identifying numerous exploration targets and fourteen gold deposits thus 
far; Masato, Golouma (West, South, and Northwest), Kerekounda, Niakafiri Southeast, Maki Medina, 
Kourouloulou, Niakafiri Southwest, Kobokoto, Mamasato, Koulouqwinde, Sekoto, Kinemba, 
Koutouniokolla, and Kouroundi. Current resource estimates for the fourteen gold deposits have been 
recently compiled and summarized by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) in a technical report titled 
“OJVG Golouma Gold Project Updated Feasibility Study”,  dated March 15, 2013 (2013 FS).
Six of the fourteen deposits form the resource base of this Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) of 
the Project’s heap leach potential.  These include including Niakafiri Southeast, Niakafiri Southwest, Maki 
Medina, Kobokoto, Mamasato, Sekoto and a low grade portion of the tonnage from the Masato deposit.
Four the of the fourteen deposits (Golouma, Kerekounda, Kourouloulou and Masato) were the subject of  
a Feasibility Study (FS) originally completed by SRK in 2010 and recently updated in the 2013 FS.  Both 
the original and updated Feasibility Studies were positive yielding a mineral reserve based on open pit 
and underground mining operation, conventional milling and carbon in leach (CIL) processing.
The OJVG Gold Project lies in a sparsely populated area of Senegal approximately 650 kilometres (km) 
east-southeast of Dakar, a 12-hour journey by road. The property is 185 km east-southeast of 
Tambacounda and 65 km north of Kédougou. The border with Mali lies about 40 km to the east. There is 
a paved airstrip that supports twin engine charter flights from Dakar. OJVG has access to the use of the 
airstrip. Road access to the property is via a paved road to Tambacounda and Kédougou and a 
combination of paved and dirt roads thereafter.
In October 2004, OJVG was awarded an exploration permit for the Project, issued in accordance with the 
Mining Convention. The Project is held by OJVG, of which 43.5% is owned by Sabodala Holding Limited 
(SHL), which is wholly owned by Oromin. Bendon International Ltd. also holds 43.5% of the project, with 
Badr Investment and Finance Company holding 13%.
On January 26, 2010, OJVG was granted a 15 year renewable mining licence for the Project allowing 
mining operations in accordance with recommendations of SRK’s 2010 FS.
OJVG has recently completed the process of establishing an operating company, Somigol, to undertake 
the development of the Project. Somigol is 90% owned by OJVG and 10% by the Government of 
Senegal. The interest owned by the Government of Senegal is fully carried and the Government of 
Senegal is also entitled to a royalty equal to 3% of net smelter returns. Under the terms of the Mining 
Convention, OJVG is obliged to offer to Senegalese nationals the right to purchase up to 25% of Somigol 
at a price determined by an independent valuator.
The OJVG renewable mining license allows for an eight year tax free benefit.

Geology and Exploration
The Project lies within the Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier; part of the highly deformed circa 2.1 billion years 
(Ga) Paleoproterozoic Birimian-Eburnean province of the West African Craton. The Kédougou-Kéniéba 
Inlier is a triangular shaped area composed of felsic gneiss terranes separated by greenstone belts that 
consist of supracrustal metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks; including the Mako Volcanic Group 
thick succession of mafic to ultramafic material, Kakadian Batholith granitic complex, and the Eburnean 
Syn-tectonic Granites comprising discrete granodioritic intrusives and possibly felsic dykes.
The concession straddles the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone, which is a regional-scale north-northeast 
trending ductile fault that accommodated sinistral displacement during the Paleoproterozoic Eburnean 
Orogeny. All the deposits lie within rocks affected by this zone of north-northeast-south-southwest 
oriented shear.
The mineral deposits within the Property fall within the broad classification of orogenic gold. The principal 
mineralized zones within the deposits are hosted by high strain areas within the prevailing shear zones. 
Gold mineralization is associated with zones of metavolcanics affected by intense Fe-carbonate-sericite ± 
quartz ± feldspar ± pyrite alteration, the intensity of which broadly correlates to the intensity of the 
deformation fabric and the presence of thicker quartz-carbonate veins. Multiple parallel zones comprise 
each deposit, with individual zones of anomalous gold values typically ranging 2 m to 15 m in true 
thickness.  The upper portions of all deposits on the Project have been oxidized to varying degrees and 
depths.
There are two primary deposit types at the project; high grade Golouma style and lower grade bulk 
tonnage Masato style. The Golouma style deposits consist of Kerekounda, Kourouloulou, Golouma 
(West, South, and Northwest), Kouroundi, Koutouniokolla, Mamasato and Koulouqwinde. These are 
found in the central to eastern parts of the concession. Masato style deposits consist of Masato, Niakafiri 
Southwest, Niakafiri Southeast, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Kinemba, and Sekoto. All of the deposits being 
considered in this heap leach study are Masato style deposit types and include the Niakafiri Southeast, 
Niakafiri Southwest, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Mamasato, Sekoto and a portion of the low grade tonnage 
from the Masato deposit designated as waste in the 2013 FS.
The Masato deposit has been defined over a 2,100 m strike length of a north-northeast trending, 
moderately west-dipping shear zone. The zone consists of between two and six separate mineralized 
zones over a distance of up to 90 m, which have been drilled to a depth of about 220 m below surface.
The geology of the Niakafiri Southeast deposit is dominated by a north-northeast trending, west dipping 
ductile shear zone, several tens of metres wide. The mineral zone has been traced for approximately 1.2 
km and down to 180 m depth and remains open to expansion.
The Niakafiri Southwest deposit is interpreted to be a 200 m to 300 m wide structural zone consisting of 
north-northeast trending steeply west dipping strongly sheared and altered mafic and ultramafic 
metavolcanic rocks. The mineralization has been traced in drilling for 400 m along strike and to a depth of 
140 m and remains open to expansion.
The Maki Medina deposit is along the same steeply west dipping north-northeast trending structural zone 
that hosts Masato and Niakafiri Southeast to the north and Kobokoto and Kinemba West to the south. 
Drilling has defined a northern zone with a strike length of 700 m and a smaller southern zone defined for 
200 m. The current resource is drilled to a 120 m depth. The main mineralized zone consists of a shallow 
west dipping, variably sheared zone. The current resource is drilled to a depth of 100 m and over a strike 
length of 1 km.

Gold mineralization tested at Sekoto is hosted within multiple sub-parallel zones of replacement-style 
pink carbonate-silica-pyrite alteration that range in thickness from 3 m to 30 m. The zones strike toward 
the north or northeast and dip moderate-steeply toward the west. A relatively continuous body of low-
grade gold mineralization has been defined and traced on strike for approximately 350 m and down-dip 
for approximately 150 m. This zone remains open to the northeast and down-dip.
Gold mineralization at Mamasato consists of three narrow, sub-parallel zones (2 m to 10 m in width) that 
strike to the west and dip moderately to the north. Gold values show good continuity along a 650 m strike 
length and approximately 250 m down-dip within the central and western portions of the shear system.
Resources
The fourteen mineral resource models represent an update to four deposits from the 2011 resource 
evaluation described in the SRK Revised OJVG Golouma Project Updated Mineral Resource Technical 
Report (December, 2011), as well as ten newly defined resources.  The current resource statement 
incorporates drilling completed by OJVG as recently as December 2011 for the majority of the deposits. 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimates are a reasonable representation of the gold 
mineral resources located on the Project at the current level of sampling. Mineral resources estimates for 
the Project were reported in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators 
National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), and have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted 
CIM “Estimation and Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices” guidelines. Mineral 
resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. SRK considers that 
the mineral resource estimates presented herein satisfy “reasonable prospects for economic extraction”, 
implying that the quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral 
resources are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade, taking into account extraction scenarios and 
processing recoveries. SRK considers that large portions of the OJVG deposits are amenable for open pit 
extraction. SRK designed optimized open pit mining shells to constrain and report open pit resources for 
all deposits.
Some portions of the deposits remain below the open pit shells and are considered for underground 
mining. The respective resource tonnages for each of these deposit styles are shown in Table i.

Mineral Reserve Estimate
For the heap leaching deposits, no mineral reserves have been defined since at least a pre-feasibility 
level study is the minimum required to define reserves.  The Preliminary Economic Assessment does not 
meet the reserve definition requirement.
For the proposed CIL operation feasibility studies have been completed and hence reserves have been 
defined based on that aspect of the Project. For completeness purposes, these reserves have been 
presented in this study.  The mineral reserve estimate for the OJVG Gold Project has been subdivided 
into an open pit portion and an underground portion. Table ii presents the open pit reserve and Table iii 
presents the underground reserve, while the total reserve summary is presented in Table iv.

Open Pit Geotechnical and Hydrogeological Characterization
SRK carried out field investigations in 2010 on the CIL deposits designed to further characterize 
geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions that would provide the required information for a feasibility 
level geotechnical evaluation of the proposed OJVG Gold Project open pits and underground operations.
For the purposes of both the initial and this updated PEA, no specific geotechnical or hydrogeological 
investigations have been completed on the heap leach deposits.  However pit slope criteria based on the 
CIL deposit criteria have been used in the heap leach PEA since rock units are somewhat similar across 
the property and the PEA is considered a high-level study at this stage.
For each of the heap leach deposits pit designs, inter-ramp pit slope angles of 30º were used in the oxide 
zone and 45º in the underlying sulphide rock.
Open Pit Mine Plan and Phasing
All of the six heap leach deposits for this PEA update are considered as open pit mines; no underground 
mining is proposed.
Initial pit optimizations were done using the Whittle software and using the same parameters for each of 
the deposits using a gold price of $1,250/oz.  Both indicated and inferred resources were utilized in the 
optimization process.  Separate cost and recovery parameters were applied to oxide and sulphide rock.  
For each of the heap leach deposits, operational pit designs were then completed and used to report the 
production tonnages used in the economic analysis.
The definition of the heap leach production tonnage is determined by the heap leach cut-off grade applied 
to distinguish feed from waste material.  The economic parameters used for this step differ from those 
used in the pit optimization.  In particular a higher gold price and higher operating costs more consistent 
with the CIL feasibility study parameters were used to define the production tonnage.  The cut-off gold 
grades used for oxide feed and sulphide feed are 0.18 g/t and 0.27 g/t respectively.
Table v presents the total tonnage of mineable heap leach resource.

OP and UG MineProduction Schedule
The various deposits in the heap leach project were scheduled in order to provide uniform annual mining 
quantities, maximize grade in the early part of the schedule, reduce pre stripping requirements, while 
providing the required heap leach production per period. The open pit mining sequence, which mines 
higher grade pits early on in the schedule, begins with Niakafiri Southeast, followed by Maki Medina, 
Kobokoto, Mamasato, Niakifiri Southwest and ends with the Sekoto deposit.   The Masato material is 
introduced gradually over the heap leach life to smooth the production tonnages.
The proposed 2.0 Mtpa heap leach processing rate was used. The average mining rate is planned to be 
about 7.5 million tonnes per year (about 21,000 tpd in the first nine years).
In addition to the indicated resource utilized, the production schedule utilizes inferred mineral resources. 
Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations 
applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the inferred 
resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category.
The OJVG heap leach deposits will produce a total of 28.4 million tonnes (“Mt”) of heap leach feed and 
52.5 Mt of waste over a fourteen year mine operating life.  The strip ratio for the operation is expected to 
be 1:1.8.
Waste Management
Waste rock from the various open pits will be deposited in engineered dumps adjacent to each of the 
deposits.
Mineral Processing
The proposed heap leach and Adsorption, Desorption and Refinery (“ADR”) plant will process run of mine 
(“ROM”) ore to produce gold doré bars. The proposed process encompasses crushing, stacking, heap 
leaching, Carbon in Column (“CIC”) gold adsorption, acid wash, Zadra elution and electrowinning, carbon 
regeneration and smelting.
Due to the preliminary nature of the PEA only a small amount of the design criteria were based on test 
work. The key criteria initially selected for the plant design are:
  Treatment of 2.0 Mtpa (5,480 tpd); 
  Crushing and stacking operating 16 hours per day at 90% availability;  
  ADR design availability of 90% after ramp-up (7,884 operating hours per year), with standby
equipment in critical areas;
  Sufficient plant design flexibility for treatment of both ore types (fresh and oxide) at design
throughput;
  Nominal average head grade of 0.5 g/t Au.

Environmental Considerations
OJVG received approval for its 2010 Feasibility Study project plan and ESIA through Attestation of 
Conformance, as issued by the Government of Senegal on May 24th, 2012.
The 2010 Feasibility report and associated ESIA did not include a heap leach facility design and only 
entailed the mining of four deposits (Golouma, Kerekounda, Masato, Kourouloulou); therefore, the ESIA 
approval does not include permission for the heap leach operation.
Under the current Senegalese Environmental legislation, there is no formal mechanism for amending a 
Certificate of Conformance once issued for a particular ESIA for a mine design.  There is, however, a 
“Good Practice Guideline” that requires the proponent to submit in writing a description of the proposed 
changes to DEEC, the Government group responsible for evaluating ESIAs.  DEEC then determines from 
the written submission the course of action they require.  If the changes are significant and fall outside of 
the baseline and assessment in the ESIA, it will likely require further investigation and assessment.
The additional consultation, ground water and surface water investigation, risk assessment and 
management plan work will take at least six to eight months to complete.  The overall process to obtain 
approvals can be expected to take nine to fourteen months.

Conclusions
Industry standard mineral resource estimation, mining, process design, construction methods and 
economic evaluation practices have been used to assess the OJVG heap leach project.
To date, six of the fourteen OJVG deposits represent a potential open pit mining and heap leach 
operation.  According to the assumptions of this PEA study, the six deposits are estimated to be 
economic to exploit via open pit mining methods. Further study is needed to advance the technical 
aspects of the heap leach deposits.  All of these deposits remain open to further expansion.

Introduction and Terms of Reference 
1.1
Overview
The OJVG Golouma Gold Project is located in eastern Senegal.  The Project consists of numerous gold 
deposits, some of which are targeted for carbon-in-leach (“CIL”) processing while other are being 
considered for heap leaching.  This study is an updated preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) for the 
gold deposits identified for heap leaching.  It is an update to a previous heap leaching PEA completed in 
June 18, 2011 by Ausenco and SRK (2011 PEA).  Four of the known deposits on the Project have also 
been evaluated at a feasibility study level by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. for CIL processing, 
summarized in a technical report titled “OJVG Golouma Gold Project Updated Feasibility Study” (2013 
FS).
The heap leaching project defined in this update is consistent with the production criteria used in the 2011 
PEA.  The study maintains a 2.0 Mtpa heap leach operation and carbon adsorption (“ADR”) plant.  The 
main differences in the updated study are that economic parameters have been revised to 2013 levels 
and expanded deposits have been introduced into the production stream.  A total of seven deposits will 
provide potentially mineable heap leach resource compared with five deposits in the prior study.
The basis for the heap leach PEA is that the CIL operation would be in place prior to or concurrently with 
the heap leach operation.  Hence the heap leach operation can use the shared facilities developed by the 
CIL operation and access administrative personnel as needed.  This PEA study does not consider the 
concept of a standalone heap leach operation without the CIL operation in place.

3  Property Description and Location
The OJVG Golouma Gold Project (“Project”) is located approximately 650 km east-southeast of Sénégal’s 
capital city of Dakar (Figure 1).  The centre of the Project is at approximately 13 09’ North latitude and 
12 06’ West longitude.  The project is considered to be an advanced-stage gold exploration property 
transitioning to a mining operation.
OJVG’s current mining lease covers an area of 212.6 km2 (21,260 hectares) (Figure 2).  This area was 
reduced in December 2008 by 18.7 km2 (8%) from OJVG’s original permit area of 231.3 km2.  The 
concession area released was located on the northwest portion of the original property where Teranga 
had located their camp, water and tailings facilities. The condemnation area was subject to soil sampling, 
geophysics, and drilling; none of which identified any mineral potential.
Table 2 shows the UTM coordinates for the Project corners.

In Sénégal there are three major levels of permitting required to undertake mineral exploration and 
development. The first permit, an Exploration Permit (Permis de Recherche), allows exploration to be 
undertaken. The second, an Exploitation Permit (Permis d’exploitation), allows resource estimates, 
feasibility studies, and small-scale mining. The third, a Mining Concession License (Concession Minière), 
allows the company to mine the property with significant tax incentives from the government.
The ministry in charge of mines in Sénégal awarded the exploration concession to the OJVG through an 
international selection process concluded in October 2004.

Oromin Explorations Ltd. (Oromin) entered into agreements with two Saudi Arabian companies; Bendon 
International Ltd. (Bendon) and Badr Investment and Finance (Badr) (43.5% and 13% interest 
respectively), thus forming the OJVG of which Oromin owns 43.5% and is the operator. Oromin’s stake in 
the OJVG is held through Sabodala Holding Limited, a company wholly owned by Oromin. Oromin and 
Bendon are each responsible for 50% of the project funding, as Badr has no obligation to contribute 
capital.
OJVG acquired a 15-year renewable Mining License in January 2010. Under terms of the Mining 
Convention, OJVG must form a Sénégalese company to mine the property. The name of this recently 
formed company is Somigol. The Sénégalese government will be granted a 10% carried interest in 
Somigol and up to 25% of the share capital of Somigol shall be reserved for purchase by the government 
and Sénégalese private sector. The property is also subject to a 3% royalty on net smelter return (NSR) 
payable to the Sénégal government.
The authors have made no attempt to verify the legal status and ownership of the property, nor are they 
qualified to do so. Oromin supplied information regarding property title and ownership and the authors 
saw no evidence to suggest that it is not correct.
The stable democratic political climate and newly enacted Mining Code in Sénégal are considered 
favourable for both the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources. Land use permits were obtained 
from the Direction of Mines and Geology (DMG), as required, prior to carrying out the exploration 
programs outlined in this report. Surface disturbance resulting from the exploration programs consists of 
excavator trenching and reverse circulation and core diamond drilling in various areas. The disturbed 
areas are reclaimed upon completion of the respective work.
Many areas of gold mineralization have been identified within the concession. Historic information about 
the mineralization can be found in previous reports: Awmack (2005), McArthur (2006, 2012), Apex (2008, 
2009), and SRK (2010, 2011). Detailed information is also provided in Section 6, entitled Geological 
Setting and Mineralization.
Evidence of local artisanal mining is found in many of the mineralized areas. Several of the local 
communities now derive a portion of their communal wealth from artisanal mining. This mining may have 
been carried out intermittently for at least the last fifty years since the Bureau de Recherches 
Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) discovery of the Sabodala deposit.
Currently, minimal remedial effort will be required to return the operation areas to the pre-exploration 
state. The main components that would require rehabilitation include:
  Removal of camp buildings (if the local community has no use for them)
  Closure of the camp waste site and the remaining exploration trenches
  Final cleanup of minor hydrocarbon spills around the workshops
  Re-vegetation and contouring of drill sites.
OJVG continues to have an active program of community engagement and support and has built very 
good working relations with the local communities, artisanal miners, and all levels of government. There is 
currently no known compensation outstanding.
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) process with public consultation was initiated at 
site by SRK for the proposed CIL operation.  It was undertaken in compliance with Sénégalese, 
Canadian, IFC, and Equator Principle guidelines.  The ESIA was presented to the Sénégalese

government in March 2011 for its initial review.  The government identified some issues that needed to be 
addressed or clarified and the updated ESIA was resubmitted by Consult 5 Inc. and Synergie in 
September 2011. A technical review committee involving several governmental bodies, including Mines 
and Environment, validated the ESIA document in November 2011.  A subsequent and final public 
hearing approved the ESIA on a plenary session held in Sabodala village in March 2012.  An attestation 
of conformance of the ESIA was issued by the Government of Sénégal to OJVG on May 24, 2012.  This 
will form the basis for an operational mine permit application.

4  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources,
Infrastructure and Physiography
Sénégal is the western-most country on the African continent and is bordered by Mauritania to the north, 
Mali to the east and Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south.  The country of Gambia, which flanks the 
Gambia River estuary for up to 300 km inland, is surrounded by Sénégal (Figure 1).
Sénégal has a population of more than 11 million people; more than half live in or near the capital city of 
Dakar. Ninety-four percent of the population is Muslim and five percent is Christian.  Sénégal is a 
multilingual country with French as its official language.  Wolof is the lingua franca and is understood by 
80% of the population.
Sénégal does not have a well-established mining industry, particularly in the sparsely populated eastern 
region of the country, however, the Project partially encompasses Teranga Gold Corporation’s 
(“Teranga”) Sabodala Mine, the only operating gold mine in the country.  Many of the services and 
support needed for the development of mining operations are not available.  Equipment and consumable 
suppliers are limited and their facilities, in most cases, are inadequate.  Sénégal does not have an 
experienced mining workforce from which to draw labour and the development and operation of mining 
projects will rely upon external expertise and training of Sénégalese nationals.
Transportation to the project is via road or air. Road access is via the regional centre of Kédougou (2-3 
hrs), the town of Tambacounda (5-6 hrs) or the capital city of Dakar (10-12 hrs), each of which supplies 
basic services.  The road from the port of Dakar to the regional centre of Kédougou is paved and in 
excellent condition.  A 1,250 m paved airstrip, located approximately 8 km north of the OJVG camp at the 
north end of Teranga’s Sabodala Mining Concession, is used by twin-engine charter aircraft based in 
Dakar.
Road conditions are not envisioned to be a constraint to the development of the Project.  Teranga was 
able to build their plant using the road prior to recent improvements by the government.  The maximum 
load capacity of the roads from the Project to Dakar is 30 tonnes.  On the Project and nearby vicinity, a 
network of dirt roads and tracks allow easy access in the dry season, but many roads require four-wheel 
drive vehicles during much of the rainy season and some roads become impassible for short periods 
during and immediately after heavy rains.
The regional power grid runs parallel to the paved highway from Tambacounda to Mako and lies 30 km 
south of the Project.  There are no plans to extend the power line to the Project.  The OJVG exploration 
camp generates its’ own power using two diesel generators.  It is proposed the OJVG Project will be 
powered similarly to the adjacent Sabodala Mining Concession.  Teranga uses low-speed heavy fuel oil 
generators (HFO) to supply power to the mine and ancillary operations.
Just beyond the eastern boundary of the concession is the village of Khossanto, a regional centre, which 
has telephone service, a government office, schools and a medical centre.
There are seven small villages within the project area, each housing 100-300 people. The villages survive 
by using the surrounding land for forest harvesting supplemented with subsistence agriculture from 
gardens and a scattering of small fields used to produce amongst other crops, sorghum and cotton. At the 
larger villages of Sabodala, located on the Teranga’s Sabodala Mining Concession and Mamakono, there 
are schools and small shops. The small villages of Bransan, Faloumbo, Dendifa, Mankana, Bambaraya,

Bambarayanding and Maki Medina have no services or facilities, although they do have water wells and 
OJVG has assisted with building of schools, medical clinics and latrines.
Topography on the property is gentle to locally hilly.  The main topographic feature is a long ridge 
extending north-south across the property.  The ridge separates two major river systems. Waters on the 
east of the divide flow into the Falémé River, part of the Sénégal River system which forms the northern 
border with Mali and Mauritania, while waters to the west flow into the Gambia River.  Approximately 
eighty percent of the Project area is covered by flat-lying laterite plateaus.  Outcrops cover less than one 
percent of the property and are generally limited to road cuts, ridge crests and creeks.  Elevations range 
from 150 to 420 masl.  Vegetation is of the tall-grass savannah type with common thickets of bamboo and 
a scattering of trees.  Fauna includes warthogs, baboons, various species of monkeys and birds, and 
local herds of domesticated goats, sheep and cattle.
The subtropical climate belongs to the Sudanic zone and is characterized by a long dry season from 
September to May, followed by a short rainy season from June to August.  Daily temperatures range from 
highs of 30C to 45C during September to May with cooler temperatures of 17C to 26C in December 
and January.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,130 mm.  The annual Harmattan is a dry wind that blows from 
the Sahara desert in the north resulting in dusty hazy skies during December to February.
The OJVG Project has had a weather station in operation for about 2.5 years.

5  History
5.1
Exploration
Although there is an artisanal mining history extending back at least 50 years, the first report of gold in 
the vicinity of the Project was made in 1961 during a regional mapping program by the Bureau de 
Recherches Geologiques et Minières (BRGM), who noted artisanal workings and quartzites with 3 to 6 
g/t Au near the village of Sabodala. Exploration work during the 1960’s by the BRGM, during the 1970’s 
by a Soviet-Sénégalese government consortium, and from 1994 to 1996 by Paget Mining Co. has been 
summarized by Henry J. Awmack (2005).
Most of this historic exploration focused on and near the adjacent Sabodala deposit, which is presently 
being mined by Teranga.  The Niakafiri deposit that straddles the OJVG-Teranga boundary was also the 
subject of past exploration interest.  In 1987 and 1991, exploration programs were carried out by 
BRGM, identifying several mineralized areas in the OJVG Project area including: Golouma, 
Kerekounda, Sabodala South (renamed Niakafiri), Kobokoto and Masato.  All of these gold-in-soil 
geochemical anomalies were trenched and preliminary drilling was conducted at Masato and 
Kerekounda, giving anomalous gold results.  These areas became the initial exploration targets for the 
OJVG in early 2005 (Figure 3).

OJVG Ownership
Oromin, with its OJVG partners, secured rights to the OJVG exploration concession through an open 
tender process completed in 2004. Initial exploration work programs focused on testing prospects 
defined by historic exploration and defining new targets. Work began in early 2005, and by year-end 
2006, US$11 million was spent to methodically explore the property on a district scale and outline 
several high priority gold targets.
Upon completion of the original Exploration License in February 2007, OJVG petitioned the Sénégalese 
government for an extension as allowed within the Mining Act. A twenty-month extension was granted 
until December 22, 2008, during which time OJVG was required to spend US$12 million. These 
expenditures led to the undertaking of a Pre Feasibility Study (PFS) guided by SRK, to provide 
information to help determine the best path forward for the Project. Concurrent with the extension in 
December 2008, OJVG was required to relinquish a portion of the concession, reducing the original 
concession from 231.3 km2 to its current size of 212.6 km2.
In September 2009, OJVG submitted a PFS to the Sénégalese government. Although the study 
concluded negative Project economics, the ongoing resource expansion and exploration drilling 
programs continued to expand the Project resource base beyond the PFS drill data cut-off date of May 
2009. OJVG elected to complete the drill program and produce an updated PFS in 2010.
In December 2009, OJVG submitted a Strategic Environmental Evaluation (SEE) report to the 
Sénégalese government as support for OJVG’s application for a project mining license.
In January 2010, OJVG announced that it would upgrade the scope of the updated study to a full 
Feasibility Study, scheduled for completion at the end of June 2010. Additionally in January 2010, 
OJVG received government approval for the SEE report submitted in 2009. In February 2010, the 
Sénégalese government granted OJVG a mining license for a term of 15 years, at which time the 
license can be renewed.
5.3
2010 Feasibility Study and Subsequent 2010 Milestone 
Activities
In June 2010, OJVG completed a full Feasibility Study (SRK & Ausenco). The 2010 Feasibility Study 
(FS) was based on resource estimates available in early 2010 for Masato, Golouma South, Golouma 
West, Kerekounda and Kourouloulou deposits (Table 3 to Table 5).  The 2010 FS proposed 
development included combined open pit and underground mining and Carbon-In Leach (CIL) gold 
recovery. The 2010 FS is now out of date and has been recently updated by SRK during 2012 with final 
results announced by OJVG in January 2013.

In November 2010, OJVG announced positive results from their engineering optimization studies 
(Ausenco) and the initiation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) of the heap leach potential at 
the Project (Ausenco & SRK).
By the end of 2010, OJVG announced the discovery of several new mineral occurrences including 
Kourouloulou South, Saboraya, Koutouniokolla, Kinemba and newly discovered Mamasato, Kouroundi 
and Torosita.

2011 Milestone Activities
The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was presented to the Sénégalese 
government in March 2011.  The government identified some issues that needed clarification and the 
ESIA was re-submitted in September 2011.  A technical review committee validated the ESIA document 
in November 2011 and a subsequent and final public hearing approved the ESIA in March 2012.
In May 2011, OJVG completed an update to the Project mineral resources.  SRK updated resources for 
Masato, Golouma West and South, Kerekounda and Kourouloulou (Table 7).  DRA updated resources 
at Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Niakafiri Southeast and Niakafiri Southwest. The updated resources include 
drill data to early 2011 (Table 8).

Based on the updated mineral resource estimates in 2011, Ausenco and SRK completed a PEA of the 
heap leach potential of the Project in June 2011.  Mineral deposits assessed for the PEA included 
Masato, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Niakafiri Southeast and Niakafiri Southwest. The heap leach operation 
is viewed as an additional production source to the 2010 FS proposed CIL operation. The preliminary 
results of the PEA were positive and no fatal flaws were apparent but additional testing and studies 
were required to optimize the process.
5.5
2012 Milestone Activities
In March of 2012, the OJVG initiated work to update both the 2010 FS and 2011 PEA.  Updates to 
these studies were based on updated mineral resource estimates for fourteen deposits.  Revised 
resource estimates for Golouma, Kerekounda, Kourouloulou and Masato would be included in the  
Feasibility Study update, while updated resources estimates for Niakafiri Southeast, Niakafiri 
Southwest, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, and new resource estimates for Mamasato, and Sekoto would be 
incorporated in the heap leach PEA update. New and updated resource estimates completed by SRK 
for fourteen of the OJVG deposits were announced in October of 2012 and summarized in Section 14, 
Table 52.
In May 2012, Oromin on behalf of OJVG announced that it had received the final approval from the 
Government of Sénégal for its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA"). The approved 
OJVG ESIA permits future project construction and development to begin. The final approval of OJVG's 
ESIA (Attestation of Conformance) was issued by the Government of Senegal on May 24th, 2012.
5.6
2013 Milestone Activities
In January of 2013, Oromin on behalf of OJVG announced results of an updated FS completed by SRK 
and detailed in a separate technical report (“OJVG Golouma Project Updated Feasibility Study 
Technical Report”, March 2013) as well as the results of the updated PEA detailed in this study.

6  Geological Setting and Mineralization
6.1
Regional Geology
The Project lies within the Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier; part of the highly deformed circa 2.1 Ga 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian-Eburnean province of the West African Craton (Ledru et al. 1991; Hirdes and 
Davis 2002; Figure 4) which underlies much of Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone 
and parts of Guinea, Mali and Senegal. The geology of the province represents a major juvenile crust-
forming event, known as the Eburnean Orogeny. Geochronological studies indicate that rocks associated 
with the Eburnean event formed over a maximum time interval of 2.27-2.05 Ga. Recently, work by Hirdes 
and Davis (2002) has demonstrated that the geology of the west of this province is significantly younger 
(by 50-100 Ma) than that of the east, consistent with the notion of western and eastern sub-provinces.

Africa (Modified From Hirdes & Davis, 2002).

The Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier (“KKI”)
6.1.1 
The Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI; Figure 5 and Figure 6) is a triangular shaped area of Palaeproterozoic 
rocks in the western Birimian-Eburnean subprovince.  The geology of the inlier is composed of felsic 
gneiss terranes separated by greenstone belts that consist of supracrustal metavolcanic and 
metasedimentary rocks that are divided into two supergroups (Figure 5 to Figure 7).  The Mako 
Supergroup comprises a deformed and metamorphosed, tholeiitic and calc-alkaline series volcanic 
succession which occupies the western part of the inlier.  The Dialé-Daléma Supergroup, to the east, 
consists of a pelitic, siliciclastic and volcanogenic sedimentary succession (Dialé Series) and a volcano-
sedimentary succession, containing a high proportion of carbonate sediments (Daléma Series; Hirdes and 
Davis, 2002).
The two supergroups are broadly dissected by a belt of regional-scale shear zones, collectively referred to 
herein as the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone (MTSZ; Figure 5) which, together with sparse exposure, has 
complicated the interpretation of their age relationship. Historically, the Mako volcanics have been 
regarded as being oldest rocks, stratigraphically underlying the sediments. However, due to the apparent 
absence of early structural fabrics from the Mako volcanics, Ledru et al. (1991) argue that the Dialé-
Daléma Supergroup is the older of the two. Most recently, Hirdes and Davis (2002) have argued that the 
transition between the two supergroups is transitional and have provided geochronological evidence to 
support their proposal that they are lateral equivalents.
Granitic plutons dated between 2.16-2.07 Ga intrude the greenstone belts of the KKI. These intrusions 
exhibit a range of deformation states; from entirely undeformed to highly-strained. According to Ledru et al. 
(1991), their emplacement was associated with sinistral transcurrent shearing along north-northeast shear 
zones during the Eburnean orogeny.
Regional Geological Structure
6.1.2 
Two regional-scale fault systems are known to affect the KKI: the broadly north-south trending 
Senegalese-Malian Shear Zone (SMSZ) and the arcuate, northeast trending, MTSZ (Ledru et al. 1991; 
Figure 5). On the basis of the position of tholeiitic lavas, along the axes of these fault zones, Ledru et al 
(1991) infer these structures to be the locus of original volcanic spreading centres. Displacement along 
both of these major fault systems is dominated by sinistral transcurrent movement. The regional fault 
systems are therefore believed to be inherited structures which have been reactivated as zones of 
transcurrent deformation.

A regionally developed ductile foliation trending 030° appears to be related to folding on all scales 
throughout the KKI. This fabric is thought to have formed during the Eburnean Orogeny (Ledru et al. 
1991) and is associated with the development of the MTSZ. Deformation fabrics contained within granitic 
plutonic rocks throughout the inlier, are interpreted to suggest that the regional folding event was 
synchronous to the emplacement of granites (Ledru et al. 1991; Gueye et al. 2008).
The regional shear zones and their subsidiary structures appear key in the emplacement of several 
significant mineral deposits in the KKI. In western Mali and easternmost Senegal, several gold mines 
(producing or under construction) are associated with the Senegal-Malian Shear Zone, including 
IAMGOLD and Anglogold Ashanti’s Yatela and Sadiola mines, Randgold’s Loulo mine, Endeavour Mining 
Corporation’s and Avion Gold Corporation’s Tabakoto mine and also hosts IAMGOLD’s Boto gold 
exploration project. Similarly in eastern Senegal, rocks affected by the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone 
host several of OJVG’s gold deposits and prospects as well as Teranga’s Sabodala Mine and Randgold’s 
Massawa gold exploration project.
6.2
Geology of the OJVG Golouma Concession
Geological Mapping
6.2.1 
In the 1960s, the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (France; BRGM) conducted a 
nationwide 1:200,000-scale mapping program and geological study (Bassot, 1966) that included mapping 
the area of the OJVG concession. Their maps define the area of intrusive rocks in the northwest of the 
property as part of the Kakadian Batholith, the central area of volcanic rocks as belonging to the Mako 
Supergroup and a succession of sedimentary/volcanic rocks towards the east as part of the Dialé Series. 
More detailed mapping has been carried out in the central of the concession area, surrounding Teranga’s 
Sabodala deposit by Husson et al. (1987). However, due to the presence of vegetation, overburden and 
thick, lateritic and saprolitic weathering profiles, detailed maps of the solid geology of Sabodala area are 
highly conjectural.
As part of its mapping campaign, in 2005 OJVG commissioned Encom to produce a concession-scale 
geological and structural interpretation of an airborne magnetic survey acquired by Fugro. OJVG also 
conducted detailed geological mapping of excavation trenches around their prospects and retained SRK 
Consulting to assist with specialist structural geological mapping and evaluation of its most-advanced 
prospects.
Distribution of Major Lithologies
6.2.2 
The distribution of the major lithological units within the OJVG concession has been mapped through a 
combination of OJVG’s outcrop and trench mapping, and Encom’s interpretation of the magnetic 
attributes of the Fugro survey data. Encom defined broad areas of similar lithology based on their 
distinctive magnetic signature summarised as follows below.
Mako Volcanics
Along the centre of the concession is a deformed north-northeast trending belt of strongly magnetic units, 
approximately 2 km wide, which forms the spine of the project area and corresponds to a range of low 
hills in the otherwise flat landscape. Highly magnetic mafic and ultramafic units, some layered, within the 
central-north part of the concession are interpreted to be sub-volcanic intrusives (Hirdes and Davis, 
2002).
These are tectonically interleaved with slivers of mafic to intermediate composition metasedimentary 
material, including tuffaceous units which have a less-pronounced magnetic signature. A significant part 
of the central concession area comprises basaltic and andesitic metavolcanics including lithologies

identifiable as flows and pillows. Metavolcanics are commonly weakly altered to a buff-brown or light 
green colour by carbonate alteration; some are weakly brecciated. All of the rocks are characterised by 
varying degrees of ductile (quasi-plastic) deformation and, to a lesser extent, affected by brittle faulting 
and jointing. Most rocks contain one or more ductile deformation fabrics, usually exhibiting a weak to 
moderate slatey or spaced cleavage. More massive basaltic units and some mafic dykes are less 
deformed, appearing blocky at outcrop.
Kakadian Batholith
The area to the northwest of the Sabodala deposit and Kobokoto is characterised by a high-amplitude 
response in the magnetic survey data.  This corresponds to a large granitic body, interpreted to be part of 
the regional-scale Kakadian Batholith, which stretches 120 km to the north (Figure 5).  The batholith is a 
composite body, consisting of granites, granodiorites, monzongranites and gabbros, some arranged in 
layered complexes, containing a variety of mafic enclaves and dykes (Gueye et al. 2008).
Eburnean Syn-tectonic Granites
In the northeast part of the concession, a number of discrete intrusives are interpreted, such as those at 
Mamakono and Sekoto.  The Mamakono intrusive has been studied by Gueye et al. (2008), who describe 
it as a small, relatively equant pluton of homogeneous biotite-amphibole granodiorite, intruded into 
volcanic and volcanosedimentary rocks.  Partial alteration by chlorite and carbonate has been noted. 
Gueye et al. (2008) consider this pluton, and other weakly deformed or undeformed granites like it, to be 
late kinematic intrusives associated with the Eburnean Orogenic event.
Steeply dipping felsic dykes, up to 5 m wide, occur throughout the OJVG concession area in close 
proximity to areas of gold mineralization in Golouma South, Masato and Kerekounda. Their weak 
deformation characteristics suggest that they were emplaced as late-kinematic intrusives, with respect to 
transcurrent displacements along the MTSZ, and therefore may be of a similar age to the late kinematic 
intrusives of Gueye et al (2008).
Structural Geology
6.2.3 
The Fugro aeromagnetic dataset, processed by Encom (Figure 8), provides good concession-scale 
information on the structural geology of the Project area. The magnetic anomalies on the survey define 
two predominant structural elements, described below.
East-Northeast Shear Zones
Relatively discontinuous magnetic lineaments with straight to sinuous traces are relatively ubiquitous 
throughout the Project area. Linear anomalies of this set have a mutually cross-cutting relationship with 
north-northeast-south-southwest to north-south trending discrete lineaments, described below. However, 
on the balance of their relationships, the former appear to pre-date the latter. The east-northeast-west-
southwest set of magnetic structures are parallel or sub-parallel to several discrete through-going linear 
anomalies of regional extent. These are not obviously affected by the north-northeast trending structures 
and therefore may represent deep-seated structures.
Outcrop and trench exposures within areas with east-west linear anomalies contain greenschist facies, 
fine-grained metavolcanic rocks which are weakly to moderately deformed, containing an east-west or 
west-northwest oriented slaty cleavage or schistosity. Typically, the fabric dips steeply to subvertically 
towards the south.

Page 23
North-Northeast to North-South Shear Zones
The most striking structures on the magnetic survey data of OJVG’s concession are an array of north-
northeast-south-southwest to north-south oriented discrete lineaments. A concentration of these 
lineaments runs along the entire spine of the concession and another concentration occurs along the 
south-western margin of the magnetic survey area. These lineaments commonly cause small offsets or 
deflections of east-northeast-west-southwest trending anomalies, with apparent left-lateral (sinistral) 
displacements and clearly represent shear zones. Collectively they are assigned to the MTSZ of Ledru et 
al. (1991). Several of the shear zones have strong continuous magnetic signatures owing to the presence 
of gabbroic dykes along their axes. Although the most obvious structures consist of concentrations of 
shear zones, away from these clusters, weaker, less continuous shear zones are distributed throughout 
the lower strain areas of the concession.
At outcrop, the north-northeast trending structures are manifest as zones of north-northeast trending 
ductile-deformed rocks, a few metres to several hundreds of metres wide. Outside of the main shear 
zones, the east-west fabric is crenulated by millimetre to centimetre-scale north-northeast trending shear 
zones, indicating that they post-date the formation of the east-west fabric. In higher strain zones, the 
crenulations grade into zones of crenulation cleavage. Where this has been mapped, the crenulation 
planes and north-northeast-cleavage orientation generally dip steeply to subvertically to the east-
southeast.
In addition to these prominent lineations, Encom has interpreted a third northwest-southeast trending set 
which is not easily recognised at outcrop. It is possible that the Kerekounda deposit is hosted by one such 
structure.
Residual Soils
6.2.4 
A thin layer (<0.3 m) of loose overburden containing organic matter is underlain by massive, nodular, red-
brown lateritic residual soils over the majority of the concession. Where observed in excavation trenches 
in Golouma, the laterites grade into brown-grey coloured friable saprolites at depths of approximately 1 m 
to 2 m below the ground surface. In some areas, particularly Masato, the weathering is more intense and 
laterite thickness can be greater than 2 m. Where known from drilling, saprolite thickness varies from 
several metres to several tens of metres, grading in to a zone of discoloured oxidised bedrock at depth.

Masato
6.3.1 
The Masato deposit occurs in the north central portion of the concession, several kilometres to the north 
of Golouma West, within a zone of highly magnetic mafic and ultramafic volcanics (Figure 10). The 
geology of Masato is dominated by a north-northeast-south-southwest (~020º) trending ductile shear 
zone several tens of metres in width. The mineralization is hosted within multiple shear fabric-parallel 
zones with the broader shear zone. This shear zone can be traced to the north and particularly to the 
south, where it appears to host further mineralization at Niakafiri Southeast.
The shear zone fabric dips about 70º west and locally areas of intense metre-scale folding can be 
recognised in trench outcrops, although the mineralization does not appear to be affected (folded) on a 
large scale. Some ultramafic rocks, recognised in drill core, are affected by the shearing and commonly 
appear “greasy”, possibly resulting from alteration by talc and serpentine. Carbonate-dominated alteration 
is relatively widespread. However; at Masato, fuchsite is present in addition to the carbonate-quartz-
sericite assemblage, particularly within ultramafic units. As at Golouma South, pink felsic dykes occur in 
close proximity to the mineralized shear zone at Masato.
In total, ten brittle fault zones and one discrete high strain shear zone have been modelled at the Masato 
deposit. The interpreted faults fall into two orientation trends.  Eight faults are oriented east-northeast-
west-southwest and follow prominent linear magnetic breaks.  With the exception of one subvertical fault, 
these faults dip moderately or steeply towards the northwest.  Two other faults have been modelled 
broadly paralleling the axis of the deposit, striking north-south to north-northeast-south-southwest and 
dipping steeply towards the west. None of the faults can be correlated with resolvable displacements of 
the modelled resource or other modelled geological elements.  However, several corrugations in the 
wireframes do occur and may represent displacements below the scale resolvable by the current drilling.
Golouma West, Golouma South, Golouma Northwest, and Kourouloulou
6.3.2 
The Golouma deposits (Golouma West, Golouma South, and Golouma Northwest) collectively the 
Golouma area, occur in mafic volcanic rocks in the central part of the Project (Figure 11). The geology of 
the area is dominated by moderately deformed massive flows and pillowed basaltic rocks. The rocks are 
moderately chloritised, which in some instances is accompanied by the development of epidote 
replacement. Hydrothermal carbonate-dominated alteration overprints the rocks where deformed by 
ductile shear. In areas of low strain, the alteration yields a wispy appearance, but in more highly deformed 
zones, it imparts a buff or salmon-pink colouration and is associated with anomalous gold concentrations. 
Several felsic dykes, up to 5 m in width, occur throughout the Golouma area and appear to be intimately 
associated with the gold mineralization, particularly in Golouma South. A small number of mafic dykes 
have been recognised in drill core, including one thick gabbroic dyke.
The Golouma area is bound by two north-northeast trending zones of ductile shear which dip steeply to 
sub-vertically towards the west-northwest. The western shear zone is continuous to the north and south 
for several kilometres and hosts part of the Golouma West mineralization (referred to as Golouma 
Northwest), as well as a thick gabbroic dyke. The eastern shear zone appears to converge with the 
western shear zone towards the south and hosts the Golouma South deposit within northeast trending 
anastomosing shear zones. The two northeast trending shear zones are linked by an east-west trending 
belt of intensely sheared and altered mafic volcanic rocks, approximately 1 km in length. This zone dips 
steeply towards the south and hosts the main mineralized bodies of the Golouma West deposit. Outcrops 
and trench exposures indicate that the east-west trending shear fabric is locally overprinted by northeast 
oriented shear fabrics, giving rise to crenulations, crenulation cleavage and differentiated foliations. Fabric 
asymmetries indicate the northeast oriented shear zones accommodated a sinistral-oblique-normal 
movement sense.

Page 27
The Golouma West deposit is affected by a significant fault, referred to as the Golouma West Fault .The 
fault strikes 061-241° and has a subvertical dip, which displaces the east-west trending mineralization by 
approximately 140 m in an apparent dextral sense. Other structures of this orientation are visible on 
magnetic survey maps of the Golouma area, three of which have been modelled using drill hole data. A 
shallow north-northwest dipping thrust fault has also been located in the south of the deposit.
The Kourouloulou deposit is situated directly west of the northern continuation of the Golouma South 
shear zone. The deposit consists of four broadly east-southeast striking mineralized veins arranged 
parallel to each other within a zone that dips steeply towards the south. Three cross-cutting, subvertical 
northwest dipping brittle faults have been modelled for the deposit using drill hole data.
Kerekounda
6.3.3 
The Kerekounda deposit is located approximately 1.5 km to the north of the Golouma South deposit, 
within the same east-northeast-west-southwest structural trend that hosts the mineralization of the 
Golouma area. The deposit is hosted by weakly to moderately deformed mafic volcanics, similar to the 
host rocks at Golouma. The main ductile foliation orientation is 060-240°, consistent with the east-
northeast trending regional structure.
However, mineralization at Kerekounda is localised within three relatively discrete north-northwest 
trending shear zones which have only a very subtle expression on the Encom magnetic survey maps. 
The mineralized bodies are planar and dip moderately to steeply (50°-70°) towards the west-southwest. 
As in the Golouma deposits, the ductile deformation at Kerekounda, correlates with an intensification of 
carbonate-quartz-sericite alteration and carbonate-quartz veining, both of which contain anomalous gold. 
Approximately 100 m to the west of the main mineralization, a unit of tuffaceous sediments occurs 
structurally below the mafic volcanics, and dips sub-parallel to the main mineralized zones.
The deposit is cut by a relatively thick north-northeast trending mafic dyke which is not mineralized and 
several smaller mafic dykes which do not cross-cut the mineralization.  Additionally, felsic dykes occur in 
the hangingwall and along the contact between the mafic volcanics and tuffaceous sediments, within the 
footwall to the mineralization.
Four brittle fault structures have been identified from drill core logs and modelled.  Two features strike 
between east-west and west-southwest, with an intermediate north-northwest dip.  One additional 
structure dips at 67o towards the west-northwest and is described in core with a significant amount of 
breccia.  The final structure strikes northwest with a shallow northeast dip.
Niakafiri Southeast and Southwest
6.3.4 
The Niakafiri Southeast and Southwest deposits occur within a zone of highly magnetic mafic and 
ultramafic metavolcanics. The geology is dominated by a north-northeast trending, west dipping ductile 
shear zone, several tens of metres wide. The structural zone appears to continue from Masato 
southwards through Nakafiri, Maki Medina and Kobokoto to Kinemba. At Niakafiri Southeast, the 
carbonate dominated hydrothermal alteration is relatively widespread and as at Masato fuchsite (Cr-mica) 
is present in addition to the carbonate-silica-sericite alteration assemblage, particularly within ultramafic 
units. As with many of the deposits, fine-grained pink felsic dykes occur in close proximity to the 
mineralized shears. As at Masato, deep oxidation has affected the mineral zones and preliminary testing 
has shown the lower grade oxide material to be amenable to heap leaching.
Niakafiri Southwest is is parallel to and west of Niakafiri Southeast. Niakafiri Southwest is interpreted to 
be a 200 m to 300 m wide structural zone consisting of north-northeast trending, steeply west dipping, 
strongly sheared and altered mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. Alteration is similar to that at

Niakafiri Southeast and dominated by carbonate-silica-sericite and locally fuchsite. As at Niakafiri 
Southeast, fine-grained pink felsic dykes occur in close proximity to the mineralized shears.
Maki Medina
6.3.5 
The Maki Medina deposit is situated along the same steeply west dipping, north-northeast trending 
structural zone that hosts Masato and Niakafiri Southeast to the north, and Kobokoto and Kinemba to the 
south. At Maki Medina, the host mafic metavolcanics and tuffaceous volcanoclastic sediments are 
strongly sheared and carbonate dominated alteration is widespread. The main mineralized zone consists 
of several west dipping, variably sheared zones of quartz-carbonate alteration and quartz-carbonate-
tourmaline veining. Several shear parallel, fine-grained, pink felsic dykes occur in close proximity to the 
mineralized shears. Deep oxidation has affected the mineral zones at Maki Medina and portions may be 
amenable to heap leaching.
Kobokoto
6.3.6 
The Kobokoto deposit is located along the same steeply west dipping north-northeast trending structural 
zone that hosts Masato. At Kobokoto, the host mafic metavolcanics and tuffaceous volcanoclastic 
sediments are strongly sheared and carbonate dominated alteration is widespread. Deep oxidation has 
affected the mineral zone and lower-grade oxide mineralization may be amenable to heap leaching.
Mamasato
6.3.7 
The Mamasato deposit geology consists of mafic metavolcanics that have been strongly deformed and 
sheared by an east-west striking, moderately north dipping, 30 m to 50 m wide shear zone. Several 
prominent, narrow, fine-grained, pink, felsic dykes occur proximal to the gold mineralization, and minor 
intermediate dykes occur in both the hanging wall and footwall of the main shear. Oxidation at Mamasato 
extends to depths of 30 m to 50 m and portions of the mineralization may be amenable to heap leaching.
Koulouqwinde
6.3.8 
The Koulouqwinde deposit is situated within the southwest extension of the main structure that hosts the 
Golouma South deposit.  The principal rock type is massive to sheared mafic metavolcanic, with minor 
felsic and mafic dykes.  The felsic dykes are massive, fine grained, pink/carbonate altered, approximately 
5-10m in width, and are hosted within northeasterly trending shear zones.  The southeastern most felsic 
dyke has been interpreted to be an extension of the main felsic dyke (northeast trending) that is located in 
the hanging wall of the Golouma South deposit.  A narrow mafic dyke- interpreted to be the south 
extension of the Kerekounda mafic dyke- cross-cuts the northeast trending felsic dykes and shear’s near 
the eastern end of the deposit.
Sekoto
6.3.9 
The Sekoto area geology consists of a central granodiorite stock, which has intruded adjacent, deformed 
to highly-strained mafic metavolcanics and sediments.  Late, massive, fine grained, narrow, intermediate-
mafic dykes intrude all of the units. Oxidation at Sekoto commonly extends 30 m to 40 m below surface 
(vertical).  Locally, deeper oxidation is present along structures or where laterite is present.  Deeply 
oxidized mineralization may be amenable to heap leaching.
Kinemba
6.3.10 
The geology of the Kinemba deposit consists of massive to locally strongly sheared mafic metavolcanics 
intruded by a prominent magnetic mafic (gabbro) dyke, and minor intermediate to felsic dykes. The shear 
zones and dykes commonly strike towards the northeast and dip moderately to steeply westward, parallel 
to the regional trend. Oxidation at Kinemba can reach depths of up to 70 m (vertical), making it another 
target which may be amenable to heap leaching.

Koutouniokolla
6.3.11 
The geology at the Koutouniokolla deposit consists of strongly deformed mafic metavolcanics and minor 
volcanoclastic sediments, which are locally intruded by fine-grained pink felsic dykes. The mafic 
metavolcanics have been strongly deformed by two separate shear zones, with shearing oriented either 
west-northwest or north-northeast.
Kouroundi
6.3.12 
The geology of the Kouroundi deposit consists of mafic metavolcanics, which have been locally strongly 
deformed by two major shear zones. The main gold bearing shear zone strikes to the northwest and dips 
approximately 40° to the southwest, and is generally 10 m to 40 m wide. The second major shear zone is 
located at the southern end of the prospect and is perpendicular to the main gold bearing shear zone. 
The second shear zone strikes westerly, dips steeply to the north, is approximately 25 m to 35 m in width 
and appears to interrupt/cut-off gold mineralization where it intersects the main gold bearing shear. 
Prominent and minor intermediate dykes intrude both shear zones, and are oriented generally sub-
parallel to the strike of both shears. The most prominent intermediate dyke is located in the footwall of the 
gold bearing shear and is approximately 10 m in width and strikes towards the north.
Oxidation at Kouroundi is quite variable; with oxidation in the hanging wall commonly extending down 30 
m to 50 m. Oxidation within the footwall is more intermittent with oxidation locally extending to depths of 
over 100 m, especially towards the north, where the mineralized zone extends beneath a very thick 
laterite plateau.

7  Deposit Types
The many mineral deposits within the Project are some of a number of gold deposits hosted by Birimian 
greenstones of the Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier. These deposits include Teranga’s Sabodala deposit, 
Randgold’s Massawa deposit, and Iamgold’s Boto deposit, all within eastern Sénégal as well as 
Anglogold Ashanti’s and Iamgold’s Sadiola and Yatela deposits, Endeavour Mining Corporation’s and 
Avion Gold Corporation’s Tabakoto deposit, and Randgold’s Loulo deposit all located just across the 
border within western Mali. Although these deposits differ in geological detail, such as their host rocks, 
mineralogy, size and grade, their principal characteristics indicate they fall within the broad classification 
of orogenic gold deposits (Grove and Foster, 1991; Groves et al., 1998).
This classification includes a variety of styles of mineralization that have similar temporal and spatial 
associations with orogenesis and tend to have several of the following characteristics. The host rocks are 
commonly mafic to ultramafic composition flows, pillows and pyroclastics rocks that are metamorphosed 
to greenschist and occasionally amphibolite grade. The wall rock alteration haloes are laterally zoned, 
formed by the metasomatic addition of silica, potassium, carbonate and water. Mineralization is deposited 
synkinematically along ductile or brittle-ductile structures subsidiary to the regional, often transcurrent, 
shear zones. They commonly have structurally controlled higher-grade shoots. Gold mineralization is 
deposited by fluid-rock interaction or phase separation of the fluid at approximately 300-350ºC normally 
during retrograde metamorphism.
Orogenic gold deposits account for a significant portion of current global gold production and include a 
number of large gold fields. These large gold provinces are typically hosted by granite-greenstone 
terranes, which comprise significant parts of Archaean and Early Proterozoic cratons, similar to the 
Kédougou-Kéniéba Inlier. Based on their morphology, mineralogy, and alteration characteristics, the 
deposits within the project appear very similar to orogenic gold deposits of the Archaean age Eastern 
Goldfields of Western Australia in particular, whose characteristics are summarised by Hagemann and 
Cassidy (2000).
The OJVG has further classified the mineral deposits on the concession into two types according to their 
relative grade, style of gold mineralization and spatial relationship within a north northeast trending 8 km 
wide structural corridor (MTSZ) that runs the entire length of the concession. The western side of this 
structural corridor hosts lower grade, bulk mining style deposits referred to as “Masato type”, which can 
be deeply weathered, while the eastern side hosts higher grade “Golouma type” deposits.

8  Mineralization
Orogenic gold mineralization found on the OJVG Golouma Gold Concession is generally subdivided into 
two types; high grade “Golouma type” and lower grade bulk tonnage “Masato type”. Golouma type 
deposits including the Kerekounda, Kourouloulou, Golouma (West, South and Northwest), Kouroundi, 
Koutouniokolla, Mamasato, and Koulouqwinde deposits are found in the central to eastern parts of the 
concession. Golouma type deposits are covered by relatively thin, poorly developed laterite and saprolite 
where uplift has caused the commonly thick laterite and saprolite to be locally eroded and occasionally 
exposing the underlying mafic metavolcanic bedrock. Masato type deposits include Masato, Niakafiri 
Southwest, Niakafiri Southeast, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Kinemba, and Sekoto. Masato type deposits are 
generally located within an extensive northeast trending structural zone lying to the west of the Golouma 
deposits. The Masato type deposits are generally comprised of multiple closely-spaced, parallel, 
moderate to steep dipping shear zones and largely covered by variable thickness of laterite. The deposits 
are commonly deeply weathered often in excess of 50 m. The mineralization of each deposit is shown 
along with the geology in Appendix A.
8.1
Masato Type Deposits
Masato
Shearing at Masato has a northeast trending strike and dips moderately (45°-65°,) to the west. Currently, 
OJVG has defined the deposit over a strike length of 2.1 km. Mineralization has been systematically 
drilled to a depth of approximately 250 m below surface. It remains open at depth along most of its strike 
length.
Gold is hosted by a complex, north-northeast oriented shear zone, which trends along the axis of the 
Main Transcurrent Shear Zone. The host rocks consist of strongly ductile-deformed greenschist facies 
(chlorite-epidote-carbonate) metabasalts and meta-ultramafic (talc-serpentine) units. They have been 
hydrothermally altered by an Iron-carbonate-silica-sericite-fuchsite and pyrite mineral assemblage. The 
presence of fuchsite is seen in the mafic to ultramafic units at Masato, where it imparts a bright green 
colouration. The most intensely altered zones are usually carbonate-silica-sericite-pyrite dominated and 
appear pale pink (salmon) to cream in colour and fuchsite is less significant. The most intense alteration 
is often associated with the presence of an intense crenulation cleavage.
Gold values are associated with intensely altered zones dominated by the presence of carbonate, silica 
and pyrite. Some textural evidence suggests that mineralization is associated with a relatively late stage 
of the overall deformation framework. Gold distribution within the shear zones at Masato show systematic 
northwest trending higher-grade shoot control. The Masato deposit hosts multiple generations of mineral 
veins. Early white-grey coloured quartz- feldspar veins are commonly highly deformed and do not contain 
anomalous gold values. Quartz-carbonate veins up to 0.5 m thick are relatively common in the highly 
altered areas of the Masato deposit. The veins dip to the west and strike broadly parallel to the main trace 
of the deposit. Numerous felsic dykes occur in close proximity with mineralization at Masato.
Niakafiri Southeast
The geology is dominated by a north-northeast trending, west dipping ductile shear zone, several tens of 
metres wide. Mineralization is hosted within multiple shear zones within the broader structural zone. The 
structural zone appears to continue from Masato southwards through Nakafiri, Maki Medina and 
Kobokoto to Kinemba. Carbonate dominated hydrothermal alteration is relatively widespread and as at 
Masato fuchsite (Cr-mica) is present in addition to the carbonate-silica-sericite alteration assemblage, 
particularly within ultramafic units. The mineral zone has been traced for approximately 1.2 km and down 
to 180 m depth and remains open to expansion. Locally, the north-northeast trending mineral zone 
appears to be offset by several late, brittle, east-west cross faults.

Page 34
Niakafiri Southwest
Niakafiri Southwest is located 1 km west of, and parallel to, Niakafiri Southeast. The area is interpreted to 
be a 200 m to 300 m wide structural zone consisting of north-northeast trending steeply west dipping 
strongly sheared and altered mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. Alteration is similar to that at 
Niakafiri Southeast and dominated by carbonate-silica-sericite and locally fuchsite. As at Niakafiri 
Southeast, fine-grained pink felsic dykes occur in close proximity to the mineralized shears. The 
mineralization has been traced in drilling for 400 m along strike and to a depth of 140 m and remains 
open to expansion. Locally, as at Niakafiri Southeast, the north-northeast trending mineral zone appears 
to be offset by several, late-stage, brittle, east-west cross faults.
Maki Medina
The Maki Medina deposit is situated along the same steeply west dipping north-northeast trending 
structural zone that hosts Masato and Niakafiri Southeast to the north and Kobokoto and Kinemba to the 
south. At Maki Medina, the host mafic metavolcanics and tuffaceous volcanoclastic sediments are 
strongly sheared and carbonate dominated alteration is widespread. The main mineralized zone consists 
of several west dipping, variably sheared zones of quartz-carbonate alteration and quartz-carbonate-
tourmaline veining. Several shear parallel, fine-grained, pink felsic dykes occur in close proximity to the 
mineralized shears. Drilling has defined a northern zone with a strike length of 700 m and a smaller 
southern zone defined for 200 m. The current resource is drilled to a 120 m depth.
Kobokoto
At Kobokoto, the host mafic metavolcanics and tuffaceous volcanoclastic sediments are strongly sheared 
and carbonate dominated alteration is widespread. The main mineralized zone consists of a shallow west 
dipping, variably sheared zone of quartz-carbonate alteration and quartz-carbonate-tourmaline veining. 
The current resource is drilled to a depth of 100 m and over a strike length of 1 km.
Sekoto
Gold mineralization tested at Sekoto is hosted within and along the margins of a variably altered, massive 
to weakly deformed, medium grained, granodioritic intrusive. It is found within multiple sub-parallel zones 
of replacement-style pink carbonate-silica-pyrite alteration that range in thickness from 3 m to 30 m. The 
zones strike towards the north or northeast and dip moderate-steeply towards the west. Gold values 
within the altered host rocks are commonly low with grades typically ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 g/t Au. 
Locally, higher grades are present (>5 g/t Au) in narrow quartz-tourmaline veins.
A relatively continuous body of low-grade gold mineralization has been defined and traced on strike for 
approximately 350 m and down-dip for approximately 150 m. This zone remains open to the northeast 
and down-dip.
Kinemba
Gold mineralization at Kinemba is found in multiple zones of weak to moderate carbonate-albite-silica-
sericite-pyrite alteration, varying in width from 5 m to 30 m, which are hosted by strongly sheared mafic 
metavolcanic rocks. The mineralization trends approximately north-northeast, dipping steeply westward (-
80°), and has been traced over a strike length of approximately 600 m to a depth of 200 m. A prominent 
north-northeast trending, 20 m to 40 m thick, massive mafic dyke intrudes and subdivides the zones of 
shearing and alteration into East and West parts. Zones of shearing and alteration on the west side of the 
dyke (hanging wall) exhibit stronger gold values and better continuity along strike and down-dip, versus 
the alteration and shearing observed on the east side (footwall) of the dyke. Due to the limited drilling 
completed to date on the footwall side, the continuity of gold mineralization between the East and West 
zones is unknown at this time.

8.2
Golouma Type Deposits
Golouma West
The geometry of the Golouma West deposit consists of two broadly east-west trending shear zone-hosted 
sheet-like bodies which together have a total strike length of approximately 900 m and a north-northeast 
trending appendage, referred to as the West limb. In plan, the east-west trending bodies are offset by 
approximately 140 m in a dextral sense along the east-northeast striking Golouma West Fault and were 
therefore originally emplaced along a single east-west structure. The West limb is approximately 200 m in 
length and dips moderately to steeply towards the west-northwest.
The principal zone of mineralization at Golouma West changes orientation from east-west to north-
northeast where it intersects a strong north-northeast oriented shear zone of the Main Transcurrent Shear 
Zone trend. In section, the main mineralized zone dips 75°-80º south, broadly parallel to the main east-
west ductile cleavage. The West limb dips at -65º west transitioning to about -45º at depths of 200 m.
Gold mineralization is hosted in a highly ductile-deformed shear zone. The shear zone occurs as a broad 
zone (20 m to 50 m wide) of intensely cleaved metavolcanic rocks. In excavator trenches, anomalous 
gold values can be traced along strike of the shear zone. The highest strain zones coincide with 
carbonate-silica-sericite altered rock and sometimes they coincide with the presence of 0.1 m to 1.5 m 
thick quartz-carbonate veins. Veins tend to be steep and vary widely in their strike orientation, and have 
an east to east-northeast trending strike orientation. The thickest veins are generally sub-parallel to the 
deformation fabric. Mineralogically, the alteration is dominated by very fine-grained carbonates (calcite 
and various Fe-Mg-Mn carbonates) usually with lessor amounts of silica intergrowths and fine-grained 
sericitic mica. Feldspar, including both sodium and potassium feldspar, also accompanies the alteration 
assemblage, generally at lower abundances. Pyrite is commonly present as fine-grained clusters and 
disseminated brass coloured grains. Anomalous gold values associated with the alteration assemblage 
define a deposit typically 5 m to 10 m in true width but the thickness may reach a maximum of about 40 m 
in exceptional cases.
Within the principal envelope of the east-west shear zone, gold grades are not uniform. Gold distribution 
exhibits a strong shoot control, with four major shoots evident plunging 60-80º to the west and west-
southwest. Their orientation supports the inference that the ore shoots occupy the linear zone of 
intersection between the east-west shear zone fabric and north-northeast trending shear zones.
Golouma West has been drilled off to a depth of 350 m below surface, with widely distributed deep step-
out drilling intercepting mineralization down to a depth of about 900 m. The west limb is currently open to 
the north and exploration is continuing to extend mineralization toward the Golouma Northwest zone. A 
series of thick northeast oriented quartz-carbonate veins define the trace of the sheet like body, which 
has similar mineralogical and alteration characteristics to Golouma West. Mineralization is open both to 
the east and west of the main east-west body although it appears to weaken to the east. High-grade 
shoot controlled mineralization remains open at depth in several areas of the deposit.
Golouma South
Golouma South occupies a north-northeast oriented ductile shear zone with mineralization in a sheet like 
body, dipping 50°-65º west. Mineralization has been defined by drilling for a strike length of approximately 
640 m and down to 560 m below surface (about 330 m below sea level). Currently, the potential for 
further mineralization along strike is considered to be limited but the down-dip extent of some high-grade 
shoots remains open to depth down plunge.
The deposit consists of one, two or three sub-parallel zones coinciding with higher strain zones within the 
northeast oriented shear zone. Similar to Golouma West, excavator trenches indicate that the gold is 
associated with the highest strain parts of the shear zone, corresponding to areas of intense alteration

and the presence of quartz veins. The veins are predominantly oriented parallel to the shear fabric and 
tend to be localized on the margins between high and low strain domains.
Along the margins of the mineralized bodies, the intensity of the northeast oriented foliation decreases. 
The foliation transition into zones of east-west oriented sub-vertically dipping slatey or schistose foliation, 
often crenulated along a northeast axis. Alteration consists of the same carbonate-silica-sericite-feldspar-
pyrite mineral assemblage as at Golouma West and similarly correlates well with strain intensity in the 
shear zone. High gold values correspond to intensely altered areas particularly where quartz-carbonate 
veining is present. The true thickness of mineralized zones varies from 2 m to 20 m, but is typically 5 m to 
12 m. Gold distribution is generally more uniform than at Golouma West, but higher-grade shoots have 
been noted. These shoots plunge steeply toward the west-southwest and are thought to occur at the 
intersection between the northeast oriented shear zone and zones of intense east-west shear.
Golouma Northwest
The Golouma Northwest main zone is trending west-northwest, sub-parallel to the main Golouma West 
zone. A fairly continuous zone of gold mineralization has been defined and traced for approximately 400 
m on strike and 120 m down-dip.
A barren mafic dyke is located at the eastern edge of the mineralized zone and has been interpreted to 
be the northeastern extension of the mafic dyke that separates the main Golouma West and Golouma 
West-West zones. The dyke is approximately 10 m to 20 m in width, strikes to the north-northeast, dips 
steeply westward and crosscuts the main gold zone in its vicinity. The mafic dyke appears to occupy a 
brittle fault zone, which mimics the strike and dip of the dyke. This fault has been identified by an 
apparent dextral offset of the main gold zone of approximately10 m to 20 m.
A felsic dyke intrudes the central portion of the mineralized zone, and is interpreted to be the same felsic 
dyke that is present in the Kerekounda deposit. This dyke is approximately 5 m to10 m in width, strikes to 
the northeast, dips moderately northwest, and crosscuts the main gold zone. The dyke appears to occupy 
a brittle fault, which appears to mimic the strike and dip of the dyke. This fault has been identified by an 
apparent dextral offset of the main gold zone by approximately 15 m to 20 m.
Gold mineralization at Golouma Northwest is hosted by a relatively narrow (2 m to 10 m), east-southeast 
striking shear zone that dips steeply to the south. Alteration, characterized by moderate to strong 
carbonate-sericite-silica-pyrite mineral assemblage, is accompanied locally by quartz-tourmaline veining. 
Gold values are generally moderate to high grade and generally range from 1.5 to 10 g/t Au, with local 1 
m intervals of up to 40 g/t Au.
Kerekounda
Mineralization at Kerekounda occupies three shear zones that dip 50º - 70º west-southwest and are 
striking north-northwest. The shear zones are relatively discrete zones of high strain where the chloritized 
mafic metavolcanic rocks are partially to pervasively altered by a carbonate-silica-sericite-feldspar-pyrite 
mineral assemblage. Texturally, the mineralized rocks are similar to those at Golouma South and West 
but visible gold occurrences are more abundant.
Three distinct shear zones host the mineralization at Kerekounda. Each zone typically ranges from 1 m to 
10 m width and high-grade shoots plunge steeply toward the west-northwest. The plunging shoots appear 
to be controlled by the intersection of the regional north-northeast trending GS-K shear zone fabric, which 
controls the location of mineralization in the Golouma-Kerekounda area, with the discrete north-northwest 
trending shear zones that host the mineralization. Of the three mineralized shears, it is the eastern most 
which is most prevalent. It comprises a quartz-carbonate vein and multiple veins and/or vein breccias, 
within a broader zone of carbonate dominated alteration. The highest gold grades occur with the quartz

veins especially those containing tourmaline while lower grades are generally found in the adjacent 
altered rock.
Kourouloulou
At the Kourouloulou deposit, gold mineralization is associated with areas of highly ductile deformed mafic 
metavolcanics. Four parallel, east-southeast striking mineralized quartz-carbonate veins occur within a 
zone that dips steeply towards the south. Its proximity, structural setting, similar mineral characteristics 
and abundant high-grade native gold indicate it is part of the Golouma type deposits.
Mamasato
Gold mineralization at Mamasato consists of three narrow, sub-parallel zones (2 m to 10 m) that strike to 
the west and dip moderately to the north. These zones are characterized by weak to moderate intensity, 
carbonate-dolomite-sericite-silica-pyrite alteration, with localized quartz veining, hosted within strongly 
sheared mafic metavolcanics. Barren felsic dykes commonly intrude one of the three main gold zones, 
bisecting it into footwall and hanging wall components. Gold assay values at Mamasato are low to 
medium grade (0.5–3.0 g/t), with locally elevated values between 5.0-14.0 g/t. Gold values show good 
continuity along a 650 m strike length and approximately 250 m down-dip within the central and western 
portions of the shear system.
Koutouniokolla
Gold mineralization at Koutouniokolla is located in two structural / alteration zones and in northwest-
trending brittle veins. The first structural trend strikes to the north-northeast and dips steeply west-
northwest. Two separate, parallel zones of mineralization have been encountered along this trend for 
approximately 230 m along strike and 150 m down-dip. Mineralization is characterized by strong to 
intense carbonate-silica-albite-sericite alteration, with local silicification and carbonate-quartz-tourmaline 
veining hosted in strongly sheared to locally brecciated mafic metavolcanics over widths of 10 m to 30 m. 
The second zone of mineralization is hosted by a west-northwest striking moderately to steeply southwest 
dipping shear zone. Gold mineralization along this structure is more sporadic, except in the vicinity of the 
intersection with the north-northeast structure. Alteration is characterized by locally strong to intense 
carbonate-silica-albite-sericite alteration with local silicification and quartz veining. It is hosted in strongly 
sheared to brecciated mafic metavolcanics over widths of 5 m to 10 m.
Gold values at Koutouniokolla can be highly variable and somewhat unpredictable. In the north-northeast 
structure, gold values are generally continuous down-dip and along strike to the southwest of the 
intersecting west-northwest structure. Gold assay values can span from moderate (2.0 g/t) to high (20 g/t) 
over significant widths. To the north of the intersection, alteration and shearing continues in strength, but 
gold values drop off dramatically, with only anomalous values (150-500 ppb Au) being reported.
Gold values in the west-northwest trending structure are generally insignificant except within 50 m to 75 
m of the structural intersection with the north-northeast trending structure. In this area high-grade gold 
mineralization (5.0 g/t to 100 g/t) over widths of 3 m to 5 m has been encountered in several holes.
The differences in grade between the two zones can be explained by the quantity of quartz-tourmaline 
veining, with higher grades following higher percent veining. In zones where gold is hosted by altered 
shear zones, higher grades typically follow pervasive silicification, with more albite- rich zones being 
barren to anomalous. The exact controls of favourable alteration and veining are poorly understood, but 
are likely related to structural intersections, dilations (high-grade veins) and potential favourable host 
rocks (shear zones) as both structural trends crosscut stratigraphy.

Kouroundi
At Kouroundi, the main gold zone has been traced by trenching and drilling for approximately 100 m 
along strike, and approximately 150 m down-dip. It strikes to the northwest and dips shallowly to 
moderately (approximately 40º) to the southwest.
The main gold bearing shear zone strikes to the northwest and dips approximately 40° to the southwest, 
and is generally 10 m to 40 m wide. The second major shear zone is located at the southern end of the 
prospect and is perpendicular to the main gold bearing shear zone. The second shear zone strikes 
westerly, dips steeply to the north, and is approximately 25 m to 35 m in width. This zone appears to cut-
off gold mineralization where it intersects the main gold bearing shear.
Gold mineralization at Kouroundi is characterized by strong to intense carbonate-sericite-silica-albite-
pyrite alteration with local quartz-tourmaline veining hosted in strongly sheared mafic metavolcanics. The 
main gold zone varies in thickness from 5 m to 10 m and has been traced for 100 m along strike to the 
northwest. Gold values within the zone are generally weak (200-700 ppb Au) at its southern margin, 
where the zone intersects the prominent east-west shear zone. Gold values gradually increase in grade 
towards the northwest (500-2,000 ppb Au) with a few high-grade intervals (1 m @ 5-12 g/t Au) present in 
the northern most drilling.
Koulouqwinde
Low-grade gold mineralization at Koulouqwinde is hosted primarily within several, sub-parallel, northeast 
trending shear zones.  The shears are generally 10-20m in width and dip steeply to the northwest. 
Alteration within the shears is comprised of moderate to locally intense, patchy to pervasive silica-albite-
carbornate-sericite-Fe carbonate with traces of pyrite, and minor quartz-tourmaline veining.
Narrow (~1m), high grade quartz-tourmaline veining has been observed on surface as well as in drill-core 
at Koulouqwinde.  The veining is hosted within massive mafic volcanic units that are intercalated with 
sub-parallel, northeast trending shear zones.  Due to the limited distance between the bounding shear 
zones, the strike length and plunge of the veins is limited to approximately 50-75m.  The veins generally 
strike east-northeasterly and dip steeply towards the southeast.

9  Exploration
The following sections describe the main exploration activities conducted on the OJVG Golouma Gold 
Project since the start of the exploration program in 2005. Much of the description that follows is 
reformatted from previous NI 43-101 Technical Reports (McArthur 2006, Apex 2008-2009, SRK 2008-
2010, McArthur 2012).
9.1
2005-2006 Exploration
During the initial twenty-two month period, February 2005 to December 2006, the OJVG was required to 
spend at least US$ 8 million on exploration. Up to December 31, 2006, the OJVG had met and exceeded 
that commitment by spending at least US$ 11 million.
In 2005, exploration started in March, after Oromin signed the Mining Convention on behalf of the OJVG. 
The OJVG undertook a multifaceted exploration program with several objectives, to outline and define the 
dimensions of the gold mineralization discovered at Golouma, Masato and the Niakafiri / Sabodala trends 
and to evaluate the property as a whole through soil geochemistry, Induced Polarization (IP) geophysics 
and trenching.
Initially Pacific Geomatics Ltd. of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada obtained Quick-bird high-resolution 
satellite imagery of the concession area in October and November 2004. In April and May of 2005, they 
completed a topographic base covering the entire concession.
In early May 2005, Fugro Airborne Surveys (PTY) Ltd. (Fugro) of Perth / Sydney, Australia completed a 
6,242 km ultra-high resolution Midas II helicopter-borne magnetic and radiometric survey. The entire 
exploration concession area was surveyed at 50 m line separations and several of the more interesting 
areas were surveyed at 25 m line spacing. An Australian firm, Encom Technology (PTY) Ltd. (Encom) 
analyzed the Fugro airborne magnetic data to produce a geological and structural interpretation for the 
OJVG concession.
CCIA a Sénégalese company based in Kédougou and Dakar was contracted to provide equipment 
including dozers and trackhoes for mechanical trenching, construction of access roads and drill sites and 
to move the drills.
The field program started in May 2005. It comprised 3,895 soil samples, 139 rock assays and 707.5 m of 
hand trenching in 31 trenches. Excavator trenching completed linear meters of 2,956 m in 32 trenches 
distributed amongst the Golouma West (6 trenches; 571 m), Golouma South (6 trenches; 459m), 
Golouma Northeast (Kourouloulou) (7 trenches; 528 m), Kerekounda (4 trenches; 263 m), Niakafiri 
Southeast (4 trenches; 642 m) and Niakafiri Southwest (5 trenches; 493 m) areas. Sigma Geophysics of 
St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada was contracted to provide geophysical services completing 119 km of IP and 
66 km of ground magnetic surveying.
Exploration continued in 2006 from a newly constructed camp centrally located near the village of Maki 
Medina. Given its success in locating gold mineralization, geochemical soil sampling was expanded to 
cover the entire concession while close-spaced follow-up sampling was used to further define anomalous 
areas. A total of 22,696 soils and 508 rocks were collected. Thirty-four hand trenches, totaling 770 m, 
were completed at a number of new areas prior to excavator trenching or drilling. One hundred-twenty 
excavator trenches totaling 15,657 m were completed, testing seven areas at Golouma and seven 
additional targets. Geophysical surveys included 116 km of additional IP surveying at Masato, Golouma, 
Niakafiri and on the Mineral Deposits Ltd. (Teranga) condemnation area required for their mine operation. 
Core drilling began in 2006 with 70 core holes totaling 11,732 m completed. Drilling focused mainly on

three target areas, Masato (8 holes; 1,302 m), Golouma West (31 holes; 5,467 m) and Golouma South 
(22 holes; 3,514 m). The initial ten reverse circulation holes totaling 1,146 m were all completed at 
Golouma South.
Results from the 2005-2006 exploration programs include initial positive drill assays from Masato, 
Golouma West and Golouma South. Trenching and drilling traced the mineral zone at Golouma West for 
750 m along an east-west strike and 150 m down-dip while at Golouma South gold mineralization was 
traced for 300 m along strike and 150 m down-dip. A 1,500 m long, gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly was 
outlined at Maki Medina and confirmed by excavator trenching (Trx 99-131). Golouma Northwest mineral 
zone was discovered in excavator trenches (Trx 111-113) and drill holes (Sab06-62, 65 and 66). 
Golouma Northeast (Kourouloulou) was discovered in drill holes Sab06-67, 68, and 70. New 
mineralization was discovered in trenches at Sabodala North and Masato North. IP geophysics outlined 
new areas of interest at Sekoto, Maki Medina, Golouma West and Niakafiri.
9.2
2007-2008 Exploration
Upon completion of the original Mining Convention in December 2006, the OJVG petitioned the 
Sénégalese government for an extension. A twenty-two month extension was granted until December 22, 
2008, during which time the OJVG was required to spend at least US$12 million.
During 2007, thirty-seven km of IP geophysics were completed at Sekoto and on the MDL (Teranga) 
condemnation area. Soil sampling was conducted on the condemnation area as well as follow-up 
sampling at Dendifa, Bransan, Kinemba, Korolo, Niakafiri and Maki Medina. A total of 11,700 soils and 53 
rock samples were collected. Excavator trenching continued in 2007 with 111 new trenches (Trx 153-263) 
completed totaling 19,028m. Exploration drilling initially focused on close-spaced (40 m x 40 m) holes to 
delineate mineralization at Golouma West, Golouma South and Masato before testing several other areas 
including Maki Medina. A total of 30,019 m of reverse circulation drilling were completed in 175 holes (RC 
Sab-07 11-185) while 23,311 m of core drilling were completed in 115 holes (Sab07-71-185) plus twelve 
RC extensions (1,287.39 m).
Results from the 2007 exploration program include positive trench, core and RC drilling at Golouma West 
outlining mineralization along a 1,500 m strike length to a depth of 300 m and indicating that Golouma 
West and Golouma Northwest merge. RC and core drilling at Golouma South outlined mineralization 
along a 1 km strike length to a depth of 220 m and identified multiple zones of mineralization. New 
discoveries were made at Golouma Northwest and Golouma Northeast (Kourouloulou). Positive trench 
and drill results were received from Masato with 1.8 km of strike length and down-dip to 150 m 
successfully drill tested. Positive trench results were received from outside targets at Sekoto, Dendifa, 
Maleko, Korolo and Kinemba.
Exploration during 2008 focused initially on close-spaced drilling for an up coming initial Project resource 
estimate by SRK. Soil geochemistry comprised 5,581 samples designed to cover regional targets and to 
further define existing anomalies. Fifteen excavator trenches totaling 1,677 m were completed (Trx 264-
278) on six areas. Reverse circulation drilling was conducted on nine areas with 330 holes (RC Sab-08 
184 to 511) drilled totaling 61,132 m. Core drilling tested 11 areas and comprised 227 holes (Sab-08 186 
to 412) totaling 45,530 m plus 13 RC extensions totaling 2,267 m.
The majority of the drilling was done to provide a sufficient drill density for resource estimation on Masato 
(261 holes; 52,105 m), Kerekounda (32 holes; 5,023 m), Golouma West (75 holes; 14,330 m) and 
Golouma South (67 holes; 11,254 m). The OJVG drill tested several other targets including Niakafiri 
Southeast (50 holes; 10,242 m), Maki Medina (26 holes; 4,667 m), Koulouqwinde (5 holes;/ 1296 m), 
Goumbati (5 holes; 393 m), Korolo (6 holes; 862 m), Sekoto (7 holes; 1555 m) and Sabodala North (9 
holes; 2,404 m).

9.3
2009 Exploration
Upon completion of the required commitments of the Mining Convention extension to December 2008, 
the OJVG applied for another extension, which was granted until December 2009.
Positive results from the 2008 exploration led to the undertaking of a PFS to provide information to help 
determine the best path forward for the Project. Concurrent with the Mining Convention extension, OJVG 
was required to relinquish a small portion of the concession (MDL / Teranga condemnation area) 
reducing the original concession area from 231.3 km2 to 212.6 km2.
Exploration in 2009 focused almost entirely on drilling. Drilling was guided by previous soil and trench 
results, as well as opportunities identified from resources modeled and estimated in 2008. A total of 
11,019 infill soil and 517 rock samples were collected from nine target areas including Kerekounda, 
Dendifa, Koulouqwinde, Masato, Kinemba, Kobokoto and Sekoto. Sixty-seven trenches were completed 
totaling 15,521 m as follows: Kerekounda (11 trenches; 2,295 m), Kourouloulou (Golouma Northeast) (8 
trenches; 1,992 m), Golouma Northwest (10 trenches; 1,739 m), Koulouqwinde (1 trench; 280 m), 
Koutouniokolla (8 trenches; 1,695 m) and Kobokoto (29 trenches; 7,520 m). A total of 41,164 m of core 
drilling in 206 holes, 26,532 m of reverse circulation drilling in 151 holes and 2,205 m of core geotechnical 
drilling in 14 holes were completed on ten different targets.
The majority of reverse circulation and core drilling was focused on the lateral and vertical expansion of 
mineralization at Golouma West (25 holes; 8,105 m) Golouma South (14 holes; 3631 m), Kerekounda 
(136 holes; 30,510 m) and Masato (40 holes; 5,072 m) as well as infill drilling for resource estimation 
updates. New mineralization was intersected at Golouma Northeast, which was initially called Epsilon but 
was later renamed Kourouloulou (84 holes; 10,905 m). Systematic step-out drilling at Kerekounda 
continued to intercept good widths of high-grade mineralization, further indicating the potential for a 
resource having combined open-pit and underground mining possibilities, with a down-dip extent of at 
least 300 m. Drilling at Maki Medina (4 holes; 545 m) returned results indicative of extensive low-
moderate grade gold mineralization with a significant oxide portion, similar to the Masato deposit. At 
Koulouqwinde (20 holes; 3,528 m) the geochemical anomaly was refined with additional infill sampling. 
Excavator trenching and drilling have both indicated the presence of alteration and mineralization. Drilling 
at Niakafiri Southwest (5 holes; 1,131 m) intercepted alteration and mineralization similar to that 
encountered at Masato.
In September 2009, the OJVG submitted a PFS to the Sénégalese government. Although the study 
concluded negative project economics, the ongoing resource expansion and exploration drilling programs 
continued to expand the Project resource base beyond the PFS drill data cut-off date of May 2009. The 
OJVG elected to complete the drill program towards producing an updated PFS in 2010.
In December 2009, the OJVG submitted a Strategic Environmental Evaluation (SEE) report to the 
Sénégalese government in support of OJVG’s application for a project mining license.
9.4
2010 Exploration
In January 2010, OJVG announced that it would upgrade the scope of the PFS study to a full Feasibility 
Study (FS), scheduled for completion at the end of June 2010. Additionally, in January 2010, OJVG 
received government approval for the SEE report submitted in 2009.
In February 2010, the Sénégalese government granted the OJVG a mining license for a term of fifteen 
years, at which time the license can be renewed.

Exploration in 2010 consisted largely of infill and step-out core and reverse circulation drilling. Drilling 
totaled 81,133 m of core drilling in 330 holes, two RC extensions of 342 m, 22,213 m of reverse 
circulation drilling in 184 holes, as well as 3,921 m of RC and 5,470 m of core geotechnical drilling 
completed on twelve different areas. The geochemical anomaly at Kobokoto was refined by 917 soil 
samples.  Later in 2010, deep drilling to test below the 2010 Feasibility Study resource boundaries and for 
underground resources was initiated at Masato, Kerekounda, Golouma South and Golouma West.
Initially drilling focused on the lateral and vertical expansion and infill holes for resource estimation 
purposes at Golouma West (42 holes; 14,663 m), Golouma South (15 holes; 5,770 m), Kerekounda (9 
holes; 3,654 m), Kourouloulou (32 holes; 8,745 m) and Masato (75 holes; 15,231 m). Later drilling tested 
Niakafiri Southeast (51 holes; 9,411 m), Niakafiri Southwest (29 holes; 4,408 m), Maki Medina (86 holes; 
12,056 m), Kobokoto (79 holes; 11,481 m) and Koulouqwinde (74 holes; 13,916 m).
Initial drilling at Kinemba West (4 holes; 884 m) and Koutouniokolla (18 holes; 3,014 m) identified 
alteration and gold mineralization with both areas having locally deep oxidation profiles. Six trenches 
totaling 1,772 m were completed at Kobokoto West and three at Koutouniokolla totaling 257 m.
In addition, 22,435 m of reverse air blast (RAB) drilling was completed in 630 shallow drill holes as 
profiles across laterite covered areas at Mamakono, Maki Medina, Maleko, Kinemba, Kobokoto, 
Koulouqwinde, Golouma West, Bambaraya, and Niakafiri Southwest.
9.5
2011 Exploration
The 2011 exploration program commenced with 3,028 m of geotechnical core drilling required for the 
resource update.  Deep drilling continued at Masato, Kerekounda, Golouma South and Golouma West 
as, infill drilling to update the resources and, to extend the mineralization below the 2010 FS resource 
boundaries. Several areas with deep oxidization and heap leach potential were drilled (Sekoto, Kinemba, 
Kobokoto and Niakafiri).  Thirteen areas were drilled with 146 core holes and one RC extension, totaling 
38,202 m.  Fourteen areas were tested by reverse circulation drilling with 108 holes completed, totaling 
16,131 m.  Three exploration targets (Golouma Northwest, Kourouloulou East and Goumbati West) and 
three new discoveries (Mamasato, Kouroundi and Torosita) were trenched. Fifty-two trenches were 
completed, totaling 8,630 m; 1,627 infill soil samples and 306 rock samples were collected from Goumbati 
West and Torosita.
Masato
9.5.1 
Exploration deep drilling at Masato continued during 2011, with 3,168 m in ten core holes and 547 m in 
four RC holes completed. There were two goals for the drill program at Masato. The first was to continue 
and complete the infill drilling program started in the fall of 2010, which was initiated to delineate higher 
grade, underground resources below the 2010 resource pit. The second goal of the drill program was to 
extend zones of mineralization down plunge and down-dip by drilling step-out holes starting at 100 m 
spacing below the 2010 resource shells.
Results of the infill drill program were positive and the tightened drill spacing assisted with the delineation 
and continuity of higher-grade potential underground resources. Results of the deep drilling program were 
generally positive as well, with the main Masato Zone intersected in these broad step-out drill holes. Gold 
values and widths were typical of Masato style mineralization (1.5-3 g/t Au over 5-10 m) and extended the 
Masato zone 600 m down-dip from surface.

Golouma West
9.5.2 
Deep drilling exploration at Golouma West continued during 2011 (10,248 m of core drilling in thirteen 
core holes). The primary goal of the work program was to test the down plunge portions of the 1300, and 
1200 Zones (Golouma West), as well as the down plunge extension of the 1200 Zone in Golouma West 
to depths of 1,000 m from surface. Diamond core holes were targeted to intersect the down plunge 
portions of each zone, starting at 150 m to 200 m down plunge from the bottom of the existing 2010 
resource shells. Subsequent holes were targeted to intersect the main gold zones 150 m to 200 m down 
plunge.
Overall the drill program was very successful, as most drill-holes intersected zones of gold mineralization 
that appear to correlate well with either the 1200 or 1300 Zones. Only one hole failed to reach the main 
gold zone due to technical problems with the drill rig, and was abandoned at approximately 1100 m. Gold 
values within the latest drilling were very good, with values well in excess of the minimum mining grade 
(4g/t Au) and mining width (2 m) used to define potential underground resources. Golouma West has 
been tested to a depth of 900 m and is open to expansion. New sub-parallel zones of mineralization were 
discovered adjacent to Golouma West during deep drilling and include the 950 Zone and Golouma West 
extension.
Golouma South
9.5.3 
Deep drilling exploration at Golouma South continued during 2011 with 4,415 m of core drilling completed 
in seven holes. The primary goal of the work program was to test the down plunge portions of the main 
Golouma South zones at depth. Initial diamond core holes were designed to intersect the main ore shoots 
starting from 150 m to 200 m down plunge from the current resource shells. Subsequent holes were 
designed to hit the main gold zones 150 m to 200 m down plunge from previous holes.
Results of the deep drilling program were very positive, with all drill-holes intersecting Golouma-style 
mineralization. All of the new intercepts from the deep drilling program correlate well with previously 
defined mineralization, and have extended the gold zones down to a depth of 560 m. Results from the 
deep drilling were generally moderate to high-grade (5-20 g/t Au) to locally very high-grade (>100 g/t Au), 
well in excess of the minimum underground mining grade of 4 g/t Au and minimum mining width of two 
metres.
Golouma Northwest
9.5.4 
At Golouma Northwest zone, located 200 m north of Golouma West, initial drilling targeted a zone that 
was interpreted to be trending northeasterly and dipping steeply westerly. Results from the initial holes 
were sporadic and indicated a zone of discontinuous mineralization. Reinterpretation of the data in 2011 
indicated that the mineral zone could be trending west-northwest, sub-parallel to the main Golouma West 
zone. Drilling in 2011 included, 655 m in eight core holes and 319 m in four RC holes. Drilling has 
confirmed the interpretation and defined a fairly continuous zone of gold mineralization that has been 
traced for approximately 400 m along strike and 120 m down-dip.
Kerekounda
9.5.5 
Deep drilling exploration continued in 2011 at Kerekounda with eight core holes completed in 3,695m of 
drilling. The main goal of the program was to test the continuity of Kerekounda style mineralization to 
depths in excess of 500 m, down-dip, from surface.
Mineralization at Kerekounda has been drill-defined over a strike length of 370 m and down-dip for 
approximately 490 m; it remains open to expansion.

Results of the drill program were largely disappointing, with only one drill hole (DH-956, 2m @ 10 g/t Au)) 
and one Geotech hole (KKGT-01, 14 m @ 8 g/t Au) intersecting Kerekounda-type grades, which has 
extended the main zone approximately 125 m below the current defined resource shell. The remaining 
drill holes failed to intersect Kerekounda-type grades and gold values are generally only anomalous (<500 
ppb Au).
Niakafiri Southeast & Niakafiri Southwest
9.5.6 
Exploration drilling continued in 2011 at Niakafiri Southeast with seven core (1,235 m) and five reverse 
circulation (562 m) drill holes completed. There were two goals for the drill program. The first goal was to 
confirm the existence of an inferred east-west, gold bearing structure that could host significant gold 
resources in the footwall of the main Niakafiri zone. The second goal was to test for the on strike 
extension of the main deposit, adjacent to a strong gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly, located 500m to the 
south of the current resource.
Results for the first goal were generally disappointing, with diamond drilling failing to confirm the 
existence of an east-west trending, gold bearing structure in the footwall of the main Niakafiri gold zone 
as only spotty, anomalous results were reported. An adjacent drill hole DH-1061 did intersect the main 
zone returning 24 m @ 1.4 g/t Au and 10 m @ 1.27 g/t Au.
Drill results from the southern extension of Niakafiri Southeast were generally positive as indicated by 
RC-956 which intersected 1.7 g/t Au over 28 m and extended the area of mineralization.
Niakafiri Southwest, located one kilometre west of and parallel to Niakafiri Southeast, is interpreted to be 
a north-northeast trending, steeply west dipping, 200 to 300 m wide zone of strongly sheared and altered 
mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. The mineralization has been traced in drilling for 400 m along 
strike and to a depth of 140 m and remains open to expansion. Locally, as at Niakafiri Southeast, the 
north-northeast trending mineral zone appears to be offset by several late, brittle, east-west cross-faults.
The southern extent was drill tested by five RC holes totaling 921 m.
Kourouloulou
9.5.7 
Several new geochemical anomalies and the main mineral zone were tested at Kourouloulou in 2011. 
The drill program targeted three areas. The first tested for the extension of the main ore zones at depth 
and along strike. The second tested a new geochemical anomaly, Kourouloulou East, located 
approximately 150 m to the northeast of the main Kourouloulou deposit. The third tested a geochemical 
anomaly located 100 to 150 m south of the main zone near some historic artisanal workings.
Results for the drill holes targeting the main Kourouloulou zone were mixed, with one drill hole 
successfully intersecting the main zone at depth, while the second drill hole failed to extend the zone to 
the east.
The Kourouloulou East geochemical anomaly, located 150 m northeast, was tested by two drill holes and 
four trenches. Drill hole and trench results were disappointing intersecting only weakly anomalous gold 
values. The Kourouloulou South geochemical anomaly located 100 to 150 m south of the main zone was 
tested by five reverse circulation drill holes totaling 754 m. Drilling discovered a new sub-parallel zone of 
shear hosted vein mineralization.

Saboraya
9.5.8 
The Saboraya exploration target, located mid-way between the Kerekounda and Kourouloulou deposits is 
related to dilational shear hosted quartz veining. Drilling has tested the mineralization for 150 m along 
strike and to 100 m below surface. It was tested by three core (485 m) and nine RC (1,308 m) holes.
Kobokoto
9.5.9 
Kobokoto is located 2 km southwest of Maki Medina along the same steeply west dipping north-northeast 
trending structural zone that hosts Niakafiri Southwest. The main mineralized zone consists of a shallow 
west dipping, variably sheared zone of quartz-carbonate alteration and quartz-carbonate-tourmaline 
veining. The current resource is drilled to a depth of 100 m and over a strike length of 1 km. Deep 
oxidation has affected the mineral zone and near-surface, lower-grade mineralization may be amenable 
to heap leach recovery.
During 2011, three reverse circulation holes totaling 366 m were drilled to test the Kobokoto South 
geochemical anomaly.
9.5.10  Mamasato 
The Mamasato deposit, a recent discovery located 2 km southeast of the Masato deposit was identified 
by soil geochemistry and prospecting. The anomaly was tested by eight trenches (1,538 m), eight reverse 
circulation drill holes (1,446 m) and forty-two core holes (7,586 m) along an 800m east-west strike length 
and down dip to 250 m. The gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly is coincident with a series of east-west to 
north-northeast oriented quartz vein systems hosted by sheared and altered mafic metavolcanics and 
minor felsic intrusives. Near surface mineralization is locally deeply oxidized to sixty metres and may 
have soft ore or heap leach potential.
Sekoto
9.5.11 
The Sekoto deposit is located approximately 9 km to the northeast of the Golouma deposit and 4 km east 
of the Masato deposit. To date, ten trenches (3,280 m), fourteen reverse circulation (1,761 m) and nine 
core holes (661.6 m) have been completed at Sekoto.
The geology consists of a central granodiorite intrusive, which has intruded deformed to highly strained 
mafic metavolcanics and sediments. Oxidation at Sekoto commonly extends 30 m to 40 m below surface, 
however, oxidation is found to be deeper along structures or where laterite is present. Deeply oxidized 
mineralization at Sekoto may be amenable to heap leach recovery.
Drilling in 2011, nine core (661 m) and ten RC holes (844 m), focused on mineralization intersected in 
RC-363 (16m @ 1.15 g/t Au) that has been traced on surface by trenching. Drilling has outlined a 
relatively continuous body of low-grade gold mineralization that has been traced along strike for 350 m 
and down-dip 150 m. This zone remains open to the northeast and down-dip. Additional untested zones 
are present mainly to the west and in the hanging wall to the main zone.
Kinemba
9.5.12 
There are three geochemical targets in the Kinemba, Mankana, and Kinemba West area. The Kinemba 
deposit was tested by 20 RC holes (3,456 m) and three core holes (640 m); Mankana by four RC holes 
(623 m); and Kinemba West by five RC holes (685 m). The best results were from the Kinemba deposit 
area. The Kinemba deposit, located 3 km south-southwest of the Maki Medina deposit, is defined by a 1.4 
km by 0.6 km north-northeast trending gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly.

March 25, 2013
Oromin Joint Venture Group 
Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Heap Leach Potential of the OJVG Golouma Gold Project, Sénégal
Page 46
The Kinemba area consists of massive to locally strongly sheared mafic metavolcanics intruded by a 
prominent magnetic mafic dyke and minor intermediate to felsic dykes. The shear zones and dykes 
commonly strike northeast and dip moderate to steeply westward, parallel to the regional trend. Oxidation 
at Kinemba can reach depths of up to 70 m making it a potential target for heap leach processing.
Gold mineralization is hosted by multiple zones of strongly sheared, weakly to moderately carbonate-
albite-silica-sericite-pyrite altered, mafic metavolcanics that are 5 m to 30 m wide. The north-northeast 
trending steep west dipping mineralization has been traced over a strike length of 600 m and to a depth of 
200 m. A prominent north-northeast trending, 20 m to 40 m thick, massive mafic dyke intrudes and 
subdivides the zones of shearing and alteration into east and west parts. Zones of shearing and alteration 
on the west side of the dyke (hanging wall) exhibit stronger gold values and better continuity along strike 
and down-dip. Gold assays at Kinemba are generally low, with individual values ranging from 0.3 g/t Au to 
10 g/t Au and composite grades ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 g/t Au over widths of 2 m to 10 m. The zone 
remains open in all directions.
Koutouniokolla
9.5.13 
The Koutouniokolla deposit is located approximately 3.5 km southwest of the Golouma deposit. To date, 
eleven trenches (1,952 m), twenty-eight core holes (4,423 m) and nine reverse circulations drill-holes 
(1,255 m) have been completed at Koutouniokolla.
Mafic metavolcanics at Koutouniokolla have been strongly deformed by two separate shear zones and 
intruded locally by fine-grained pink felsic dykes. One structure strikes north-northeast and dips steeply 
west-northwest. Two separate, parallel zones of mineralization have been encountered along this trend 
for approximately 230 m of strike length and down-dip for 150 m.
The second zone of mineralization is hosted by a west-northwest striking moderate to steeply dipping 
shear zone. Gold mineralization along this structure is more sporadic, except in the vicinity of the 
intersection with the north-northeast structure.
The differences in grade between the two zones can be explained by the quantity of quartz-tourmaline 
veining, with higher grades following higher percent veining. In zones where gold is hosted by altered 
shear zones, higher grades typically follow pervasive silicification.
Nine reverse circulation holes (1,255 m) and ten core holes (1,409 m) were drilled during 2011.
Kouroundi
9.5.14 
Another recent soil geochemical discovery was made at the Kouroundi deposit located one kilometre 
north of and across the valley from Kerekounda. Initial excavator trench results were positive intercepting 
3.5 g/t gold over nine metres within a broad zone grading 2 g/t Au over 20 m. Mineralization at Kouroundi 
occurs in a broad zone of north-northwest trending shear hosted quartz veining. The mineralization abuts 
a thick laterite plateau that covers any extension to the north. It was tested by two trenches (352 m) and 
fourteen core holes (2,005 m) over a 100 m strike length and 100 m down-dip.
Sabodala North
9.5.15 
The Sabodala North prospect is located approximately 1.7 km to the north of Masato. Exploration 
consists of six trenches spaced 100 m to 200 m apart and 16 core and RC holes drilled on three sections 
spaced 300 m apart, with three to five holes per section.
Gold mineralization is hosted within moderately to steeply west dipping, northeasterly trending, 
carbonate-dolomite-silica-albite-fuchsite altered shear zones, and in local quartz-tourmaline veins. Gold

values are generally low with sporadic one-metre intervals of higher grade. Due to the wide drill spacing 
and sporadic nature of gold values, it is difficult to know how continuous gold mineralization is along strike 
and down-dip. Significant infill and step-out drilling is needed in order to upgrade this zone. Three RC 
holes totaling 366 m tested for a southern extension with poor results.
9.5.16  Goumbati West 
Goumbati West is a low-grade heap leach prospect located approximately 1.2 km to the southwest of the 
Kobokoto deposit and 1.5 km west of the Kinemba deposit. The Goumbati West prospect is defined by a 
1 km by 0.4 km, >50 ppb gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly, that trends towards the northeast. Two 
trenches (164 m) were completed in late 2011 to test an extension to the geochemical anomaly exposing 
sheared mafic metavolcanics intruded by a narrow, pink, felsic dyke.
Torosita
9.5.17 
Torosita is the newest geochemical discovery. It is located 6 km west of Golouma and 1 km to 2 km west 
of the Maki Medina and Kobokoto deposits. Torosita comprises a series of localized gold-in-soil 
geochemical anomalies (TZ 1 to TZ 5) found within an extensive flat area covered by a variable thickness 
of laterite. These geochemical anomalies are coincident with a series of northeast trending altered shear 
zones and have over a kilometre of strike extent. In addition to the regional structural target, there are a 
series of northwest and east-west oriented, higher-grade, dilational shear-hosted quartz veins identified 
by prospecting and trenching.
The Torosita gold-in-soil geochemical anomalies were tested by thirty-one trenches (5245 m), seven 
reverse circulation drill holes (842 m) and eight core holes (798 m). Drill results were encouraging but 
locally spotty.
9.6
2012 Exploration
The exploration program in 2012 consisted of prospecting, mapping, and hand trenching in underexplored 
areas of the mine license.
The prospecting and mapping program generated at least 12 new prospective targets including: 
Goumbati East, Bambaraya East, Bambaraya South, Bransan, Dendifa NW, Maki Medina East, 
Mamakono South, Masato Northeast, Niakafiri South, Sanouwoula Hill, TimTimol, and Sekoto West. A 
total of 938 grab samples were collected from the various prospects of which only 439 of these samples 
were submitted for analysis. Results of these analyses returned gold values ranging from below detection 
limit, to 25 g/t. Of the 439 samples that were analyzed,110 reported anomalous values in excess of 50 
ppb Au, and 39 samples reported values in excess of 500 ppb Au. The highest reported value of 25 g/t Au 
came from a quartz vein showing in Masato NE.
A hand trenching program was initiated on the targets listed above in July 2012, with approximately 2300 
m of trenching completed across 34 trenches. To date, none of these samples have been submitted for 
analysis.

The initial soil geochemical sample results, along with the previous exploration results from BRGM, 
identified sixteen target areas for follow-up exploration (Figure 12). Exploration initially concentrated on 
the Golouma, Masato and Niakafiri areas (Figure 13 and Figure 14).
Exploration uses lithological, alteration and structural data from outcrop, trench, RC chips and drill core to 
characterize the various mineralized areas and integrate the results with geological interpretations of the 
aeromagnetic survey data.
As of January 31, 2013, OJVG had successfully identified a total of fourteen deposits (Golouma, Masato, 
Kerekounda, Kourouloulou, Niakafiri Southeast, Niakafiri Southwest, Maki Medina, Kobokoto, Mamasato,  
Sekoto, Koulouqwinde, Koutouniokolla, Kinemba and Kouroundi) with current mineral resources, four of 
these with mineral reserves (Golouma, Masato, Kerekounda and Kourouloulou). In addition to these 
successes, OJVG has received encouraging results from numerous other targets on the Project.
The Golouma Concession still has a significant number of gold-in-soil geochemical anomalies located 
during the project-wide geochemical survey that remain to be evaluated.

Reverse Circulation Drilling
In late 2006, Drillcorp Sahara provided a reverse circulation drill with an auxiliary boost air compressor 
capable of drilling to 300 m depth.  The reverse circulation drilling and sampling procedures start by 
drilling an open hole, nine metres deep. PVC casing is then inserted into the open hole and then the hole 
is capped with a blow-by valve.  This seals the hole and enables it to be pressurized.  The 152 mm casing 
bit is removed and either a 130 mm or 133 mm face discharge bit is used to drill the hole. Chip samples 
are collected for each metre drilled from the collar to the end of each hole. Each sample for assay is 
collected; in total, approximately 35 kg.  The sample was then either split at the drill site or shipped to the 
on site TSL sample prep lab for splitting.  Figure 17 shows a typical RC drilling set up.
The on-site drill geologist examines the rock chips and records all geological and location information 
from each hole on computer logging forms. Initially in 2006, no down-hole surveys were performed, as 
Sahara Drillcorp was not equipped for down-hole surveys.  In May 2007, Falcon Drilling used a single-
shot Flexit survey tool to survey all unsurveyed holes that were still accessible. Beginning in June 2007, 
each hole was surveyed upon completion. Contractor Lakehead Geological completes final collar x, y and 
z location surveys approximately every other month.

2006 RC Drill Program
10.1.1 
Ten reverse circulation drill holes (RC-Sab-06-01 to 10) totaling 1,146 m were completed in December by 
Sahara Drillcorp. Two northwest trending fences of three drill holes plus scattered infill holes were drilled 
to test the Golouma South gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly. The holes all intersected greenschist 
(chlorite-epidote-carbonate-silica) altered and deformed mafic metavolcanic rocks crosscut by younger 
mafic dykes, pink felsic dykes and gold bearing quartz-carbonate± sericite-albite-fuchite-tourmaline-pyrite 
alteration, veins, and vein stockworks.
2007 RC Drill Program
10.1.2 
The 2007, RC drilling largely comprised close-spaced (40 m x 40 m) drilling to aid resource estimation at 
Masato, Golouma West and Golouma South. One hundred thirty-six RC holes were completed at 
Golouma West and Golouma South to the end of June at which time the Sahara Drillcorp drill contract 
was not renewed. In October, following the rainy season during which RC drilling is curtailed, Forage 
Technic-Eau were contracted to provide a RC drill to the project and completed thirty-one holes at 
Golouma West and Masato. In November, a second RC drill was contracted through Boart-Longyear, 
who completed eight holes at Golouma West. One hundred and seventy-five holes (RC-Sab-07-11 to 
186) were drilled in 2007, totaling 30,019 m and included 35 holes at Golouma South (5,483 m), 107 
holes at Golouma West (20,055 m), 24 holes at Masato (3,427 m) and 8 holes at Kourouloulou (1,054 m).

Reverse circulation drilling conducted during 2010 totaled 22,213 m in 184 holes (RC-Sab-10-663 to 
846), 1,808 m in 30 geotechnical holes, and 2,113 m in 61 engineering and water holes. The majority of 
the drilling was directed at six deposits to aid resource estimation. They include Masato (29 holes; 2,099 
m), Kourouloulou (10 holes; 1,660 m), Kobokoto (52 holes; 7,335 m), Maki Medina (51 holes; 6,047 m), 
Niakafiri Southwest (23 holes; 2,781 m) and Niakafiri Southeast (10 holes; 1,053 m) with the remainder 
testing Koulouqwinde (6 holes; 766 m).
In addition to the RC drilling, Forage Technic Eau completed 22,435 m of Reverse Air Blast (RAB) drilling 
in 630 shallow holes as profiles across a number of laterite covered target areas including Bambaraya, 
Golouma West, Golouma Northwest, Mamakono, Maki Medina, Maleko, Niakafiri, Koulouqwinde,

Diamond Core Drilling
Falcon Drilling of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada was initially contracted to provide two core 
drills to the Project (Figure 18). Through the end of 2011 there were four Falcon core drills on the property 
of which two remain. The Falcon 2000 drill is capable of drilling HQ (63.5 mm) to a depth of 200 m to 300 
m and NQ (47.6 mm) to a 500 m depth.
Figure 18:  A Falcon 2000 drill at Kouroundi.
Core, collected from the surface collar to the end of each hole, was boxed and delivered twice daily by 
the drillers to the logging facility at the OJVG camp. The drill core is then marked in one metre sample 
intervals with the aid of the driller’s footage markers. Subsequently, recovery, rock quality data, 
geological, structural, lithological and geotechnical information are recorded on computer logs. The core 
is then photographed and sample intervals are tagged for splitting and sampling.
Detailed geotechnical and oriented core studies were instituted in the second half of 2007 with guidance 
from SRK. Drill collars are surveyed with a total station theodolite, Leica, Wild Heebrugg TC 1000 EDM 
and all holes are surveyed using a down-hole Flexit single-shot tool. Oriented core is marked using an 
Ace tool. Drill holes, inclined at -45° to –65° were designed to intersect the mineralized structures at a 
right angle so that drill intersections approximate true width. Occasionally, drill holes intersect the 
mineralized structure at shallow angles, in some very rare occasions running down the dip. Such holes 
are usually re-drilled in a more appropriate orientation. Oriented core studies provide a better 
understanding of the structural orientation and permit the calculation of true widths. Beginning in 2008, 
specific gravity and point hardness testing were undertaken by on-site laboratory personnel. Stored half

core, from previous drilling, was also tested. Coarse rejects and half core from previous drill holes are 
stored on site in a secure fenced area.
2006 Core Drilling
10.2.1 
Drilling operations commenced at the OJVG Concession in late January 2006 and ran continuously to 
year-end. Drilling was restricted to one drill and one shift due to water shortages during the dry season. 
Seventy drill holes were completed (Sab-06-01 to 70) totaling 11,732 m.
Drilling during 2006 focused on defining the limits of gold mineralization discovered by prospecting, soil 
geochemistry, IP geophysics and trenching. Eight areas were tested including four at Golouma South (22 
holes; 3514.3 m), Golouma West (28 holes; 4,923.08 m), Golouma Northwest (3 holes; 543.98 m) and 
Golouma East (3 holes; 446.67 m) plus Masato (8 holes; 1,301.71 m), Niakafiri Southeast (2 holes; 312.9 
m) and Maki Medina (1 holes; 158.7 m). Very positive results were obtained, especially from Masato, 
Golouma South and Golouma West where gold mineralization was confirmed and expanded.
2007 Core Drilling
10.2.2 
Core drilling continued in 2007 with 115 holes completed (Sab-07-71 to 185) totaling 23,311.17 m 
including core extensions to 12 reverse circulation holes (1,287.39 m). During 2007, two diamond drills 
operated during the day shift and, for a portion of the year, a night shift operated; thus increasing drill 
production. Water shortages continued to cause occasional drilling delays during the dry season. Core 
drilling in 2007 focused on close-spaced grid drilling at Masato (28 holes; 6,020.56 m), Kourouloulou (13 
holes; 2,465.46 m), Golouma South (15 holes; 2,432.5m) and Golouma West (47 holes; 10,131.07 m) 
and testing several new areas: Maki Medina (7 holes; 1,381.45 m), Kobokoto (3 holes; 421.91 m), and 
Goumbati (2 holes; 458.22 m). Drill results were very positive and continued to expand and define the 
mineralization, especially at both Golouma and Masato.
2008 Core Drilling
10.2.3 
Core drilling continued in 2008 with 227 holes completed (Sab-08-186 to 412) totaling 45,529.93 m plus 
core extensions to 13 RC holes (2,267.03 m). Initially, drilling focused on close-spaced drilling to enable 
resource estimation at several deposits: Golouma South (43 holes; 7,895.89 m), Golouma West (38 
holes; 8,238.1 m), Masato (76 holes; 16,465.21 m), Kerekounda (16 holes; 1,882.84 m), Niakafiri 
Southeast (21 holes; 4,896.73 m) and Maki Medina (8 holes; 1,594.08 m). Later, drilling tested several 
new areas including: Koulouqwinde (5 holes; 1,296.6 m), Sabodala North (3 holes; 807.38 m), Sekoto (3 
holes; 641.4 m) and Goumbati West (5 holes; 393.58 m). Drill results were once again very positive and 
continued to define and expand mineralization at Golouma South, Golouma West, Masato, Kerekounda 
and Kourlouloulou (previously named Epsilon / Golouma Northeast).
2009 Core Drilling
10.2.4 
Diamond drilling continued in 2009, 206 holes were completed (Sab-09-413 to 618) totaling 41,163.87 m. 
The drilling again focused on close-spaced drilling for resource estimation at Golouma South (9 holes; 
2,602.52 m), Golouma West (23 holes; 7,498.73 m), Golouma Northwest (7 holes; 1,028.72 m), Masato 
(29 holes; 3,177.06 m), Kerekounda (49 holes; 15,038.67 m) and Kourouloulou (69 holes; 8,750.64 m). 
Drilling also tested several other areas Kobokoto (14 holes; 1,505.49 m), Niakafiri Southwest (2 holes; 
633.07 m), Sabodala North (3 holes; 731.76 m) and Koulouqwinde (1 hole; 197.21 m). Fourteen 
geotechnical core holes totaling 2,205.46 m were also completed at the five principle deposit areas.
2010 Core Drilling
10.2.5 
Diamond drilling continued in 2010, 330 holes and two core extensions to RC holes (342.3 m) were 
completed (Sab-10-619 to 948) totaling 81,133 m. The drilling focused on resource delineation and

expansion at Golouma South (15 holes; 5,769.82 m), Golouma West (39 holes; 14,198.59 m), Masato (46 
holes; 13,234.98 m), Kerekounda (9 holes; 3,653.78 m) and Kourouloulou (22 holes; 7,085.78 m) for the 
feasibility study and resource update completed by SRK. Drilling was completed at several of the deposits 
to enable a resource calculation at Kobokoto (27 holes; 4,145.9 m), Maki Medina (35 holes; 6,009.35 m), 
Niakafiri Southeast (41 holes; 8,358.65 m) and Niakafiri Southwest (6 holes; 1,627.7 m) by DRA. Later in 
2010 deep drilling was undertaken to evaluate potential economic mineralization below the 2010 FS 
resource boundaries at Golouma West, Golouma South, Masato and Kerekounda. Several new areas 
were drill tested including Koulouqwinde (68 holes; 13,150.29 m), Kinemba (4 holes; 884.2 m) and 
Koutounikolla (18 holes; 3,013.96 m). Thirty-one geotechnical core holes totaling 5,469.75 m were also 
completed.
2011 Core Drilling
10.2.6 
Diamond drilling continued in 2011 with 146 new holes (Sab-11-949 to 1094) and a core extension to one 
RC hole completed totaling 38,202.51 m. Once again drilling focused on resource expansion at Golouma 
South (7 holes; 4,415.04 m), Golouma West (13 holes; 10,247.11 m), Golouma Northwest (8 holes; 655.2 
m), Masato (10 holes; 3,168.32 m), Kerekounda (8 holes; 3,695.66 m) and Kourouloulou (4 holes; 909.22 
m) to enable a resource update. Deep drilling, which started in late 2010, was continued at Golouma 
West, Golouma South, Masato, Kerekounda and Kourouloulou. Positive results from this deep drilling 
indicate mineralization continues at depth and is open to expansion. Several areas were drilled to 
evaluate their heap leach potential including Niakafiri Southeast (7 holes; 1,235.5 m), Kinemba (3 holes; 
639.74 m) and Sekoto (9 holes; 661.61 m). In addition, several new discoveries were drill tested including 
Mamasato (42 holes; 7,586.67 m), Saboraya (3 holes; 484.7 m), Kouroundi (14 holes; 2,005.45 m), 
Koutounikolla (10 holes; 1,409.29 m) and Torosita (8 holes; 798.2 m). Six geotechnical core holes were 
also completed totaling 3,028.32 m.
Core Drill Summary
10.2.7 
In total 240,812.99 m of core have been drilled in 1,094 holes, 28 core extensions to RC drill holes (4,156 
m), and 51 geotechnical holes (10,703 m). A summary of up to date core drilling for each deposit is 
presented in Table 11.

11  Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security
Several of the following sections are abstracted from Apex Geoscience’s NI-43-101 Technical Report 
(January 2009), SRK’s Technical Report (August 2008), SRK’s Preliminary Feasibility Study (August 
2009), SRK’s Feasibility Study (October 2010), SRK’s Updated Mineral Resources (May 2011) and 
SRK’s Updated Feasibility Study (March 2013). All practices documented are current through the end of 
2012.
11.1
Sample Preparation
Core Sampling
11.1.1 
Following core mark-up, logging and photography, one-metre sample interval tags are inserted into each 
box prior to being taken to the designated core cutting area. Core is cut in half using a circular rock saw. 
Water used to lubricate the saw is not re-circulated. Each core piece is halved; one half goes back into 
the core box for storage accompanied by its unique sample tag and the other half is placed in a stainless 
steel tray with a duplicate of the same unique sample tag. As much as possible, the sampled core is 
taken from the same half-split (consistent side).
All samples are one metre in length and until 2008, every metre drilled was sampled. After this date, 
selective sampling of intervals in the more advanced prospects has been conducted, with intervals based 
on the geologist’s visual identification of potentially gold-bearing alteration. However, for new and less 
well-defined prospects, OJVG continues to sample every metre for the entire hole.
Drill core sampling conducted by OJVG is in line with industry standard practices. The samples are 
representative of the intervals drilled and no factors that may have resulted in sample biases were 
observed.
Reverse Circulation Drill Sampling
11.1.2 
During the 2011 site visits, one RC drill rig was drilling and operated by Forage Technic-Eau. Initially, 
Sahara Drill Corp. supplied a RC drill to the Project from December 2006 until the end of June 2007, 
when their contract was not renewed. During October 2007, Forage Technic-Eau supplied the RC drill 
and in November a second RC drill was supplied by Boart-Longyear. Both RC rigs drilled during 2008. 
During 2009, 2010 and 2011, only one RC rig drilled; it was operated by Forage Technic-Eau.
RC drill cuttings are collected individually; each one-metre interval in a separate numbered bag. In 2011, 
all RC cuttings were transported to a designated area, near the on-site sample preparation laboratory, for 
riffle splitting. This also allowed the use of compressed air to clean the riffle splitter between each sample. 
Near surface dry samples were collected in plastic bags. Wet samples were collected below the cyclone 
in porous fabric bags placed inside a five-gallon bucket. Excess water and suspended fine material from 
each sample interval were allowed to overflow until the sample was collected. The entire cuttings from 
each drill hole were sampled and prepared for assaying. All wet samples are dried before riffle splitting 
and re-homogenized so no clots of material are forced through the splitter. Individual assay samples are 
generated by the entire 20 to 30 kg RC sample passing through a riffle splitter twice. The retained split 
represents 12.5% of the total sample interval recovered from the ground. This procedure was a 
modification of the original 2006 practice, which used a 10 to 15 kg half sample split to generate the 
assay sample.
The RC sampling practices used on-site by OJVG are generally in line with industry standard practices 
and the samples are representative of the intervals drilled. However, SRK noted during their 2009 visit, 
the use of the riffle splitter in the field occasionally departed from the ideal protocol. This is unlikely to

Page 63
have resulted in a systematic bias to the samples or a material difference to the resource estimates and 
SRK recommended that OJVG monitor the riffle splitting closely to ensure constant adherence to industry 
best practice.
11.1.3  Onsite Preparation 
Staff from TSL Laboratory (TSL) oversees all stages of onsite sample preparation and their shipment 
from camp.
All split half diamond drill core and RC sample splits are placed in clean stainless steel trays for drying in 
the on-site laboratory. RC samples are sun dried and any excess moisture is removed during oven drying 
for 5-6 hours at 65-70º C.
All rock, trench, RC chips and drill core samples are crushed using a primary jaw crusher to a minimum of 
70% passing through a –10 mesh (2.0mm) screen. A 250-gram sample split is packaged for shipment to 
TSL in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.
At their Saskatoon facility, TSL further processes the rock, trench, RC and core samples by pulverizing to 
95% passing a –150 mesh (106 µm) screen.
11.2
Shipment and Storage of Samples
Analytical samples are shipped from the OJVG camp to Dakar in trucks owned by OJVG. Once in Dakar, 
OJVG personnel arrange customs documentation to transport the samples by commercial airfreight to 
TSL in Saskatoon, Canada for preparation and analysis.
All split drill core is stored in purpose built core racks located in a secure, fenced-off core storage area 
adjacent to the on-site TSL prep lab. RC chip trays are stored in racks within a purpose built lockable 
building. Coarse rejects of both RC and core samples are kept for future reference or reanalysis in locked 
storage containers adjacent to the TSL prep lab in the OJVG camp. All unused materials are also stored 
at the TSL facility in Saskatoon for possible future use.
11.3
Chain of Custody
In 2005, all samples were shipped via truck to Dakar and then by airfreight to TSL in Saskatoon, for 
sample preparation and analysis. During the initial phase of the exploration program, several shipments 
of rock and soil samples were temporarily misplaced and/or delayed in shipment. This was a 
consequence of the remote location of the concession and the lack of a permanent exploration camp. 
During 2005, the sample shipment process gradually improved and few problems were encountered later 
in the year. Since January 2006, TSL was contracted to operate an on-site sample preparation facility. 
Samples are dropped off daily at their facility in the OJVG camp where lab personnel sort, organize and 
dry the samples. After the initial sample preparation is complete on site, the samples are packaged for 
shipment to Saskatoon. The remaining sample material is stored on site in secure containers for potential 
future re-analysis. Samples are shipped via OJVG truck to Dakar, where OJVG personnel arrange 
customs documentation. Then, the samples are shipped via commercial airfreight to TSL in Saskatoon for 
analysis.
Prior to 2008, OJVG were able to track samples using a sample shipment list, created on-site and sent to 
the OJVG office in Vancouver and TSL in Saskatoon who confirmed receipt of all samples. Sample 
shipment arrival times could be tracked via the commercial freight company. No samples have been lost 
in transport.

Page 64
In March 2008, OJVG introduced the use of a sample-tracking (chain-of-custody) sheet, which requires 
the dispatchers and drivers of the samples to sign-off at each stage of the sample transportation. Tamper-
proof security tags, each individually numbered, are now used to tie rice sacks containing the samples; 
ensuring the detection of any unsolicited opening of the sacks. TSL inspects these tags on arrival in 
Saskatoon and no tampering has been reported to date.
11.4
Gold Analysis
OJVG Project sample gold analysis is initially a fire assay with atomic absorption finish (FA/AA) with a 5 
ppb detection limit. Assay results that exceed a specified limit are reanalyzed using fire assay with a 
gravimetric finish (“FA/GRAV”).
Prior to 2008, assay samples were weighed out into 30 gm analytical samples and the switch to 
FA/GRAV method was set to FA/AA results exceeding 1 g/t Au. In early 2008, OJVG instructed TSL to 
weigh out 50 gm analytical samples and use FA/GRAV for samples exceeding 3.0 g/t Au (FA/AA).
OJVG fire assay oven samples are loaded into assay trays holding twenty-four samples. Twenty OJVG 
samples are accompanied by four TSL internal QA/QC samples (two pulp duplicates, one gold Standard 
Reference Material (SRM) and one blank).
TSL Laboratories completed the ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation in 2004 and is Accredited Laboratory 
No.538.
11.5
Bulk Density Data
A comprehensive bulk density data collection program was initiated in January 2008 and continues to be 
conducted by TSL staff at their on-site preparation lab. There are 14,890 bulk density determinations of 
core samples using a weight-in-air versus weight-in-water methodology. In general, samples were taken 
approximately every ten metres to include all rock and alteration types. Data is indexed to lithological 
records by drill hole ID and sample depth. Samples deemed to be porous or absorbent were coated in 
wax after an initial weight-in-air determination. Together with the waxed sample weights in air and water, 
the bulk density was calculated.
TSL laboratory utilizes QC samples (samples for which the density value is accurately determined) with 
every batch of samples. One QC density determination is done before starting the determinations from a 
new drill hole and another at the end of the sequence of samples.
11.6
OJVG Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs
In 2008 and 2009, OJVG utilized Susan Lomas (P.Geo) of Lions Gate Geological Consulting (LGGC) to 
undertake periodic reviews of the OJVG Project’s quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program. 
This included a periodic review of all data and site visits to the Project. On the basis of these reviews, 
LGGC provided commentary and recommendations to the OJVG to ensure optimum best practices. . 
Including this report, four review reports have been issued since March 2008 and are in addition to the 
review conducted by SRK for their NI 43-101 Technical Report of August 31, 2008.
In 2009, for the Preliminary Feasibility Study Technical Report, SRK reviewed all the OJVG QA/QC data 
and updated the LGGC analysis with all drill hole assay data used in the resource estimation.
SRK for the 2010 Feasibility Study Technical Report conducted additional quality assurance on the 2009 
and early 2010 data, such that there was an overlap with the 2009 data previously reviewed.

Page 65
SRK, for the May 2011 Mineral Resource Estimation update, has once again completed quality 
assurance on QA/QC and drill hole assay data for all of 2010 to provide overlap with the previous 
Feasibility Study.
For this Mineral Resource Estimation Report, SRK has completed quality assurance on 2011 drill hole 
assay data. SRK felt that no overlap with the previous QAQC was necessary as SRK had completed the 
previous two reviews with good results.
As a general practice, for each batch of 20 samples, OJVG include one blank, one duplicate and one 
standard reference material.
Blanks
11.6.1 
Throughout the 2006 drill program, no blanks were included in the sample shipments. In 2007, OJVG 
inserted commercially available blank sand material with drill core but not RC samples. However, the fine 
sand material, due to the small size, was unable to check any contamination that could result from the 
crushing process. In 2008, OJVG started using gravel derived from a local diorite intrusive as blank 
material. OJVG uses selective pieces void of fracturing after noticing that fractured or veined material 
returned an occasional high assay value. Eliminating the fine fracture material reduced any anomalous 
result in the blank material and no contamination between samples is apparent in the blank sample 
results.
11.6.2 
OJVG Field Duplicates
Duplicate Samples
OJVG began submitting 250 g field duplicates for analysis in January 2008. From April 2008 through 
2009, sample sizes varied from 500 g to 250 grams. For 2010 and onwards, the duplicate sample size 
was maintained at 500 g. In 2011 there were 2,419 field duplicates from the diamond drill holes and RC 
drill holes submitted for analysis to TSL.
For the diamond drill hole duplicates, the sample preparation facility at the project site in Senegal 
prepared the 500 g sample from crushed coarse reject. The RC field duplicates were taken as a second 
split from the original sample at the drill rig. The duplicate samples were sent within the sample stream to 
TSL in Saskatoon.
OJVG TSL Blind Pulp Re-assay Program
The first 8,326 core samples sent to the TSL lab for analysis in 2006 and 2007 were analyzed without the 
benefit of any Standard Reference Material (SRM). Only 4,662 of these samples returned assay results 
above the detection limit. In March of 2008 LGGC recommended that the OJVG re-submit the pulp for 
about 10% of these samples to TSL for re-analysis with check SRM samples inserted.
OJVG submitted 402 pulp samples to TSL and inserted 46 SRM to the Sample submission. LGGC 
recommended that OJVG use these samples as a blind check on TSL laboratory performance on the 
original assaying by changing the sample numbers of the pulps and inserting SRMs randomly, but 
generally using a rule of one SRM per ten submitted samples. Two different SRMs were included with the 
sample submission, both from CDN Resource Laboratory, Langley, B.C., Canada.
The duplicate results showed good reproducibility of the original results and the submitted SRMs also 
show good performance by the laboratory. The re-assay program confirms the lack of any analytical bias 
of the original assay results.

Standard Reference Material Samples (SRMs)
11.6.3 
Standard reference material samples (SRMs) are used to ensure that the analytical results reported to the 
public are reasonably accurate and reliable for resource estimation purposes. SRMs are pulped rock 
material purchased commercially or custom created from rock material that has been subjected to multi-
laboratory round robin analysis and have a certified expected value and a standard deviation, to allow for 
variance of the SRM material and minor analytical differences between assay laboratories.
When submitted with assay samples, the SRM results are checked against the accepted ranges provided 
on the SRM certificate, usually two or three standard deviations from the average grade assigned to the 
SRM. Typically for gold, if a single SRM result is found to exceed three standard deviations, then the 
results from the batch of samples is considered unreliable and should be re-assayed. If an isolated SRM 
assay result is found to exceed two standard deviations, this can be considered acceptable. However, if 
two consecutive SRM’s exceed two standard deviation results then those batches should be re-analyzed. 
Sample results associated with a failed SRM should not be relied upon and held in quarantine until the 
samples are re-analyzed.
The SRMs used for the Project are purchased from CDN Laboratory in Vancouver and are listed in Table 
12.  Initially, SRMs were inserted by TSL at their laboratory in Canada. However, since May 2008, OJVG 
geologists insert SRM samples into the sample stream as part of their regular logging and sampling 
onsite procedure. OJVG’s protocol is that the geologist selects an SRM with an equivalent grade to that 
anticipated for the interval on either side of the SRM. The SRM size was doubled in mid-2009 from 40 gm 
to 80 gm in response to LGGC’s recommendations. FA/GRAV samples higher than 3.0 g/t Au and any 
samples of expected higher grade require at least 120 gm of the appropriate SRM.
OJVG on occasion has had a repeatability issue with a particular SRM. When this happens, the standard 
is discontinued. Several new standards were introduced during the 2011 exploration program.

Record Keeping for Traceability
During trenching, drilling, logging, sampling and shipping multiple data keeping systems are employed. 
Most data in the field are recorded in written form: in field books, maps, log books, sample sheets, logging 
forms, or shipping forms. The field data is later recorded in the onsite company computers. All hard copy 
forms are stored onsite and / or at the OJVG’s Dakar office.
Geological logging is conducted with the aid of ruggedized laptop computers. All files containing 
geological and summary logs are stored on the OJVG camp computer server and sent by e-mail on a 
daily basis to OJVG management and OJVG’s data management consultant, Nowak and Associates 
(Dave Nowak P Geo.), Vancouver. Data verification is carried out on the data received and any errors in 
labeling or sample sequence identified during this process can usually be traced back to source and 
corrective action taken.
11.8
Data Storage and Security
Paper Data
11.8.1 
Hard copies of all field data are stored and filed on-site. Field maps, sections, trench plans, and field 
sketches are scanned and e-mailed to OJVG management and Nowak in Vancouver where paper copies 
are made and stored. Paper copies of the drill logs and corresponding original TSL assays are generated 
and stored at the Oromin office in Vancouver.

Computer Data
11.8.2 
All computer data including the photographic records of drill core and RC chips is stored on-site in the 
company server and the data is periodically transferred to Vancouver by Lakehead Geological Services 
Inc.; the GIS and survey contractor.
Data from third parties such as laboratories or survey contractors are generally supplied in digital and 
printed form. Nowak and Associates store digital files from surveyors and assay labs in their original 
format, in addition to integrating them into the master database.
All OJVG Project electronic data received and generated by Nowak and Associates is backed up on a 
scheduled basis to an external hard drive. In addition, the latest digital database is distributed to off-site 
contractors, Lakehead Geological Services Inc. and SRK Consulting Inc. for plotting and analysis.
11.9
Conclusion
Based on a review of the practices observed on-site and discussions with OJVG geological staff and 
consultants, the author believes that OJVG’s current sample preparation, analysis and security practices 
generally meet or exceed industry standards. SRK reviewed the QA/QC data for their resource estimate 
in May 2011. Dave Nowak and the author reviewed and updated the 2011 QA/QC data analysis. The 
results indicate that the program is acceptable for the resource estimates conducted and provided 
previously by SRK and DRA. Some possible areas of improvement have been identified by SRK and 
OJVG’s consultants and have been communicated to the company to ensure optimal practices.

12  Data Verification
The following Section has been extracted from SRK’s Updated Feasibility Study (March 2013).
The following sub-sections describe the verification of exploration data pertaining to the mineral resource 
estimation undertaken by SRK. The verification includes checks of assay certificates against the master 
database and the results from the QA/QC program.
12.1
Verification of OJVG Database from Assay Certificates
In July 2012, Tessa Scott, SRK Consultant, verified the 2011 assay results for the Project recorded in 
OJVG’s drill hole database with copies of assay certificates from TSL Laboratories. In total, 33,995 drill 
hole assay results were verified. Of the total assay results, 12,076 are reverse circulation (RC) drill hole 
and 21,919 are diamond drill hole (DDH) assay results. The assay samples were selected from the 
January 2011 to December 2011 and represent over 80% of RC and diamond drill hole samples assayed 
during this period. SRK did not find any inaccuracies in OJVG’s assay database. Data prior to January 
2011 was previously verified by SRK for the May 11, 2011 SRK Technical Report: Revised OJVG 
Golouma Project Updated Mineral Resource.
12.2
Independent Check Assays
During the February 2011 site visit, SRK collected 20 samples of drill core along with three SRM samples 
and one blank sample. Samples collected in 2011 were taken from drilling completed primarily in 2010 
and late 2009. Including the 45 samples collected by SRK in 2008 and 2009, all of the deposits under 
consideration for this mineral resource study have had some check assays conducted. Samples of drill 
core consisted of half-core samples corresponding to the same sample intervals as defined by OJVG. In 
the case of very broken saprolitic and oxidised samples, the sample consisted of all of the broken 
material remaining in the core tray over a particular sampling interval.
Samples collected during the 2011 site visit were sent to ALS Laboratory in Vancouver for Au analysis by 
fire assay with atomic absorption finish using 50 g sample weight. For any samples greater than 10 g/t 
Au, fire assay and gravimetric finish was used. Visible gold was observed by SRK in the core for several 
samples.
Results of the samples collected by SRK in 2008, 2009, and 2011 are shown in Table 13 and Figure 19.

Figure 19:  Parity Plot Comparison of SRK Check Assay Samples from 2008, 2009, and 2011 with
Original Assay Determinations.
The check assay samples confirm the presence of gold broadly in line with amounts reported by OJVG. 
The correspondence of original and check assay values fall about the parity line and do not show 
analytical bias. However, the data are somewhat dispersed relative to the parity line, with higher grade 
samples (>5 g/t) sometimes showing considerable differences between original and duplicate check 
assays. This is attributed to the coarse nugget-like nature of the gold, which is supported by the visible 
gold observed in the core and by the generally better correlation of RC original and check assay results, 
where gold is assumed to be more homogenized due to the milled nature of the full sample prior to 
splitting for sampling.

Verification of Drill Hole Positions
Following the 2011 site visit, the positions of 36 RC and diamond drill holes have been verified from 
Golouma West, Golouma South, Masato, Kerekounda, Maki Medina and Niakafiri deposits, using a hand-
held GPS. A comparison of SRK’s GPS determinations with OJVG’s surveyed collar positions is shown in 
Table 14. The data indicate a good agreement between the two determinations, confirming the accuracy 
of OJVG’s collar surveys.

External Check Assays
Performance of Duplicate Samples
In 2007 and early 2008, OJVG submitted selected pulp samples for analysis at the Acme Laboratory in 
Vancouver to run check assaying on the samples originally analyzed by TSL. OJVG submitted 767 drilling 
samples to Acme, 601 core pulp samples and 166 RC pulp samples.
The results from the check assay program are presented in scatter plots in Figure 21 and Figure 22.  The 
second scatter plot shows a smaller scale and details of samples returning values lower than 20 g/t Au.
A review of the duplicate data shows lack of analytical bias and good reproducibility of the gold values 
from pulp samples processed by the two labs.

Diamond Drill Hole and RC Field Duplicates
OJVG has submitted 2,419 field duplicates in 2011 from the diamond drill holes and RC drill holes for 
analysis to TSL as part of their QA/QC program for the OJVG Gold Project. In the 2011 SRK Technical 
Report 1,816 field duplicates showed that the duplicates were returning close results and that there is no 
bias present in the data. The 2011 data continue to return good results, as presented on a scatter plot in 
Figure 23 and the percentile rank chart in Figure 24.
The percentile rank chart in Figure 24 shows that 80% of the data pairs have a relative deviation of less 
than 10%. This is an acceptable value for field duplicates.

OJVG has submitted 2,708 SRM samples for analysis to TSL in 2011. The results are presented in 
Appendix C of the 2013 FS. These charts show the SRM performance and that typically acceptable assay 
results for the SRMs are realized. Most of the assay results fall within two standard deviations from the 
mean, nearly all are within three standard deviations, and show no evidence of the analytical bias. These 
results and conclusions are similar to the 2010 feasibility study analysis.

13  Metallurgical Testing and Mineral Processing
The following section has been abstracted from the Metallurgical Testing Section #16 of the “Oromin Joint 
Venture Group Golouma Project Heap Leach Preliminary Economic Assessment” (Ausenco, 2011).  No 
additions have been made tp the metallurgical testing program since that study.
13.1
Metallurgical Test work
Heap leaching metallurgical test work was conducted in Q4 2010 by Ammtec.
The PEA test work program consisted of bottle roll leach tests, percolation and agglomeration tests, vat 
leaching tests, and column heap leach tests. RC drill hole core samples were selected from three of the 
PEA Open Pit Target orebodies to represent the major ore lithologies. The composites tested were:
  Masato
  Niakafiri South East Oxide Medium Grade
  Niakafiri South East Oxide High Grade
  Niakafiri South East Fresh Medium Grade
  Niakafiri South East Fresh High Grade
  Niakafiri South West Oxide.
No test work was carried out on the Kobokoto samples. Further test work was identified and risks and 
opportunities for the selected flowsheet were highlighted.
The selection of the processing circuit for the study is derived from test work data in conjunction with 
reasonable assumptions from benchmarking similar operations.
Masato ore heap leaching tests were completed as part of the FS. The results from the FS test work are 
presented here.
13.2
Ore Types and Ore Characteristics
The geology and mineralization at the Property has been well documented by SRK in the 2008 Technical 
Report and the 2009 PFS.  The mineralized zones on the Project fall under the generic category of 
“Orogenic Epithermal Deposits”, these being typically hosted by granite-greenstone terranes. The host 
rock for the Project deposits generally consists of massive mafic to ultra-mafic basalt. Gold mineralization 
within the host rock is caused by alteration due to infiltration of volcanic fluids. The generic form of 
alteration and resulting mineralization is present as carbonate-dolomite+/-FeCarbonate +/- quartz +/- 
carbonate +/-albite veining. Higher degrees of alteration and especially quartz veining generally result in 
higher gold grades. The mineralized ore samples tested typically contain very low iron and sulphur levels 
at around 7% and 1%, respectively. Near surface, the altered rocks are weathered over time to Saprolite. 
Saprolite occurs to a depth of 20-40 m and deeper in areas along fault structures.
13.3
Key Sample Selection Criteria
The key criteria used for sample selection were as follows:
  Selection of the major ore types based on the total amount of gold contained within each ore type;
  Filtering DDH gold assays to remove holes with a gold grade lower than a nominal cut-off grade of
0.21 g/t Au for oxide, and 0.32 g/t Au for fresh;

Page 79
  Selection of drill holes that provide a good spatial representation of the orebody;
  Selection of dilution material to be included on each DDH core interval selected; and
  Selection of major oxide and/or fresh ore type for Masato, Niakafiri Southeast (“NSE”) and Niakafiri
Southwest (“NSW”) specifically for heap leach test work.
13.4
Sample Preparation
The samples were prepared to provide composites for each test at the required size distribution.  Sub-
samples were taken for each phase of the fine grind extraction tests and heap leach testing.
13.5
Testwork Program
Heap leach test work was conducted on three Masato composites, four Niakafiri Southeast composites, 
and one Niakafiri Southwest composite.  The test work program is summarised inTable 16.

Masato
Coarse Leach Tests
Three composites were selected for coarse bottle roll tests to simulate the leaching of coarse material as 
would be experienced during heap leaching.  The composites selected were Composite 11 – Masato 
Oxide OXAL, Composite 12 Masato VOFU, and Composite 13 Masato VOAL.  The composites were 
subject to coarse bottle rolls with intermittent agitation over 5 days.  The crush sizes selected were 
P100 6.3 mm, P100 12 mm and P100 25 mm.  A sub sample of each composite at each crush size was 
screened to determine the particle size distribution (PSD) to ensure the crush sizes were providing 
different PSD’s. Results of the screening and the intermittent bottle rolls (IBR) are shown below in Table 
17.

All composites showed increased gold extraction with decreasing crush size. All composites continued to 
leach for the duration of the leach test and had not reached final recovery at termination after 120 hours 
leaching. Extraction was poor for the VOFU and VOAL ore types with only 44.7% and 36.5% of the 
contained gold recovered at test termination. The oxide composite responded better with 82.1% 
extraction after 120 hours.
The particle size distributions show that the samples do not break down into significant fines when 
crushed and each crush size has a distinct PSD. The PSD’s are shown below in Table 18 to Table 20.  
Masato Oxide OXAL showed a slightly finer crush size as compared to the corresponding VOFU and 
VOAL crush sizes.

Five composites were selected for coarse bottle roll tests to simulate the leaching of coarse material as 
would be experienced during heap leaching. The composites selected were NSE Oxide Medium Grade 
composite, NSE Oxide High Grade composite, NSE Fresh Medium Grade composite, NSE Fresh High 
Grade composite, and NSW Oxide composite. The composites were subject to coarse bottle rolls with 
intermittent agitation of 1 minute per hour over 5 days. The crush size selected was “as received”. Results 
of the intermittent bottle rolls (IBR) are shown below (Table 21).

Percolation Tests
13.6.3 
The aim of the percolation test work was to determine if agglomeration will be required to achieve 
sufficient permeability and leach solution clarity for heap leaching.
Visual inspection indicated that agglomeration would be required for all samples. The samples were 
selected from RC Drill Fragments, which can represent only coarse rock fragments and hence can be 
misleading when evaluating percolation performance.
Masato
A single percolation rate test was conducted on the Masato Oxide OXAL ore at crush size of <12.5 mm. 
Only the Masato Oxide OXAL composite was selected to proceed to column leach tests due to the poor 
gold extraction from the Masato VOFU and VOAL composites achieved with the coarse bottle roll tests.
The percolation test was carried out on the “as crushed” ore without agglomeration with binding agents 
such as cement or lime. Percolation was deemed unsatisfactory and agglomeration testing was required 
prior to committing to column cyanidation test work.
The procedure for percolation test is included in the AMMTEC test work report, and a summary of the 
result is shown in Table 23.

The crush size of P100 16 mm was used as feed for the agglomeration tests.  This crush size was selected 
to reduce capital and operating cost for a plant design by utilising 2 stage crushing only, and to allow for 
high gold leach extraction.  Agglomeration tests were conducted using a range of cement and lime 
combinations.  The crushed sample was agglomerated according to the procedure shown in the 
AMMTEC test work report.  The pellets produced from each combination were tested for percolation rate 
and pellet stability.  Pellet quality was coded from 1 (excellent) to 5 (no pellets, total collapse) (Table 24).

The agglomeration reagent combination selected was 5 kg/t cement and 2.5 kg/t lime as that produced 
the optimum pellet stability and flow rate for reagent consumption.

Natural percolation rate tests were conducted on the NSE and NSW composites (post column leach 
tests) at a crush size of <25 mm. The composites tested were NSE Oxide Medium Grade composite, 
NSE Oxide High Grade composite, NSE Fresh Medium Grade composite, NSE Fresh High Grade 
composite, and the NSW Oxide composite.
The natural percolation tests were carried out on the “post column” ore, which had been agglomerated 
with lime and cement prior to column testing.  The procedure used for percolation test work is included in 
the AMMTEC test work report, and a summary of the result is shown in Table 25.  The pellets held 
together rather poorly with an average final pellet stability code of 3->4 showing the pellet condition was 
poor and the pellets were not particularly stable.

Five percolation rate tests with agglomeration were conducted at a crush size of <25 mm. The 
composites tested were NSE Oxide Medium Grade composite, NSE Oxide High Grade composite, NSE 
Fresh Medium Grade composite, NSE Fresh High Grade composite, and NSW Oxide composite. The 
agglomeration reagent consumption used for all tests was 5 kg/t of cement and 2.5 kg/t of lime. Each 
sample was given a two day curing period.
The crushed samples were agglomerated according to the procedure shown in the AMMTEC test work 
report.  The pellets produced from each combination were tested for percolation rate and pellet stability 
(Table 26). Pellet quality was coded from 1 (excellent) to 5 (no pellets, total collapse).

Column Cyanide Leach Tests
A single column cyanide leach test was completed on Composite 11 Masato Oxide OXAL (Table 27 to 
Table 29).
Thirty kilograms of Composite 11 Masato Oxide OXAL was crushed to 100% <16 mm prior to 
agglomeration using 5.0 kg/t cement, 2.5 kg/t lime and 267 L/t water. The agglomerated ore was placed 
into a 150 mm diameter column with a stacked height of 1.745 m. The column was irrigated with cyanide 
solution for 30 days.  Samples of column discharge were assayed to show the rate of leaching over the 
30 days. The column was then washed for 7 days to remove residual dissolved precious metals prior to 
emptying the column and processing the column tails solids. Solids assays were conducted to allow a 
metal extraction balance.
Extractions of 81.9% gold and 78.9% silver were seen after 30 days of leaching. The leach curve is 
shown in Figure 25 . The back-calculated head grade agreed well with the actual assay head grade for 
the composite.
Final extraction after washing and balance of carbon, solids and solution assays gave gold extraction of 
82.7% and a silver extraction of 80.9%.

The pellets held together well with a final pellet stability code of 2, showing the pellet condition was good 
and the pellets were mostly stable. This is reflected by a final slumpage measure of only 1% change in 
column height over the 38 days.
Cyanide consumption was 0.39 kg/t and total lime consumption was 2.52 kg/t including the 2.50 kg/t used 
for agglomeration. Cement usage was 5.00 kg/t for agglomeration.

The gold extractions ranged from 56.7% to 89.3% after 20 days of leaching. The leach curve is shown in 
Figure 26. The back-calculated head grade agreed well with the actual assay head grade for all of the 
composites, except NSE oxide medium grade and NSE oxide high grade, which varied by ~15-20%.
Final extraction after washing and balance of carbon, solids and solution assays gave gold extractions 
that ranged from 57.6% to 89.9%.
Percolation tests were conducted on the post column leach ore, the results are discussed in Section 
16.6.3 of the 2011 PEA.  The poor pellet condition shown in the post column leach percolation tests is 
reflected by an average final slumpage measure of 10% change in column height over the 27 days.

Size by size gold and silver analyses were conducted on the NSE and NSW composites, post column 
leaching.
The size by size test results are shown in Table 33 to Table 37.  These tests show a high proportion of 
fines <300 µm for all five composites. The gold grade is quite even across the size range for all 
composites, with the exception of NSE Oxide High Grade and NSW Oxide composites which show 
slightly higher gold grades in the finer particle sizes.

14  Mineral Resource Estimates
14.1
Introduction
The following Section has been extracted from SRK’s Updated Feasibility Study (March 2013) since the 
same resource estimate applies to both the CIL feasibility Study (2013) and this heap leach PEA Update 
(2013).
To the best of SRK’s knowledge and as described above, there are currently no title, legal, taxation, 
marketing, permitting, socio-economic or other relevant issues that may materially affect the mineral 
resources described in this Technical Report. Future changes to legislation (mining, taxation, 
environmental, human resources and related issues) and/or government or local attitudes to foreign 
investment cannot be, and have not been evaluated within the scope of this Technical Report.
SRK’s findings are based on reviews of readily available data sources at the time of preparing this report. 
The mineral resources presented herein represent an update to the 2011 resource evaluation described 
in the SRK report “Revised OJVG Golouma Project Updated Mineral Resource Technical Report, 
Senegal” (SRK, 2011), dated December 9, 2011. This updated resource estimate incorporates all drilling 
completed by OJVG by December 6, 2011. In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimates 
reported herein are a reasonable representation of the gold mineral resources located on the OJVG 
Golouma property at the current level of sampling. Mineral Resources within the Project are reported in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101, 
and have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM “Estimation and Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserve Best Practices” guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not 
yet demonstrated economic viability.
The mineral resource update is based on original interpretations prepared on cross-sections and plans by 
OJVG geological staff. The newly developed geologic wireframes are based on these models which were 
provided to SRK from June to August 2012. Data was provided to SRK for all 14 deposits as presented in 
Table 41 and each of these has been separately modelled and evaluated. Data were received from OJVG 
in an Access database format, with separate core and RC databases. Revision of geologic wireframes 
was supervised by Wayne Barnett, Pr.Sci.Nat. and undertaken by Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo., Fred Brown 
CPG, Darrell Farrow, Pr.Sci.Nat., Guy Dishaw, P.Geo., and Lakehead Geological Services. The Mineral 
Resource estimations have been carried out by Fred Brown, Gilles Arseneau, Darrell Farrow, Guy 
Dishaw and validated by Marek Nowak, P.Eng. The design of the geologic wireframes and the resource 
estimates were completed in Gemcom GEMS 6.3, and in Vulcan. Statistical analysis and resource 
validation was carried out in Gemcom GEMS, Sage, and in non-commercial software.
14.2
Resource Database
The individual deposit by deposit databases provided to SRK were imported into a Gemcom GEMS, 
project database and consisted of a total of 2,137 drill holes, for a drilling total of 338,190 meters. An 
update of the database was provided to SRK immediately prior to the initiation of the modelling for each 
deposit.
SRK’s findings are based on reviews of readily available data sources at the time of preparing this report, 
and the geologic models are dependent on the absolute final position of the existing drill holes. The 
coordinates for one drill hole, SAB-10-877, in the Masato deposit area was obtained solely by GPS. The 
drill hole will need to be updated by total station survey method. The change in position for this hole is not 
considered to have a material impact on the resource estimate.

Assay Data
14.2.1 
Sample Assays from both Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond drill (DDH) holes are contained within 
the GEMS database. All drill holes used for the resource estimation for the 14 deposits are summarised in 
Table 41.  Drill holes not used in the resource estimation were predominantly geotechnical, 
hydrogeological, condemnation or exploration holes drilled on other prospects within the project area.
Almost all drill samples contained in the database are 1 m long (98.9%).  The gold assay results that 
reported below the detection limit were assigned half of the detection limit (0.0025 g/t). Non-sampled 
intervals were assigned zero grades for the purpose of statistical analysis and grade estimation.  This is 
based on the assumption that there were no visible signs of mineralization and therefore no reason to 
collect assay samples.

Geological Models and Domains
The 3D geologic models used for resource estimation were modified and updated from those used in the 
2011 Revised Updated Mineral Resource Study (SRK, 2011). The models were based on gold assay 
values and associated lithology, and were guided from hand-drawn cross-sectional, and plan-view 
interpretations of drill hole data provided by OJVG geologists. The geologic models were completed 
under the supervision of Dr. Wayne Barnett, Pr.Sci.Nat., but were specifically constructed by the OJVG 
personnel. All models have been internally reviewed by SRK and are considered to be appropriate for the 
use in the mineral resource estimation described here.
A 3D wireframe representing lower density near-surface material was also created for each deposit in 
order to aid in the assignment of appropriate density values to the block model. The lower-density models 
are created by three-dimensional interpretation based on both the logged information from the drill holes 
(and core photos as needed) and also the bulk density measurements made on core samples. This 
volume of lower density material corresponds loosely to the location of the oxidized and saprolitic material 
near the surface, but probably includes transitional zones of mixed oxidized and fresh rock as well.
Appendix E of the 2013 FS contains the solid names and rock codes used during estimation for each 
deposit.
14.3.1  Masato 
In total, six primary modelled gold zones were defined and updated for the Masato deposit by OJVG 
geologists and Lakehead Geological Services using a 0.2 g/t Au cut-off and by ensuring that the 
geometries of the zones conform to the clearly defined orientation of the shear zone fabric. In addition, 
Lakehead Geological Services also developed three high grade internal sub-domains that were also used 
for mineral resource estimation. The high grade sub-domains were modelled using a 1.0 g/t Au cut-off. 
The six principal gold grade-shells are shown in 3D and labelled with their block model codes (or Zone-
ID) in Figure 27.

Page 99
Some of the modelled zones capture the grade shells tightly, but others are defined to encompass zones 
of higher grade that are less continuous in strike and where connectivity is fairly subjective. A total of nine 
grade domains were therefore used during mineral resource estimation.
Based on the data available at the time of this modelling, the Masato deposit has been defined over a 
strike length of greater than 2,000 m. Individually, the modelled zones range from 3 m to 30 m in width 
and dip steeply to the west. Although the individual mineralized zones are based to a significant degree 
on the gold grade, the interpretation is guided by all structural orientation data and geological information 
available, notably the logged silica-carbonate-sericite alteration. This deposit, unlike the Golouma 
deposits, has a greater lithological variability with the presence of series of felsic dyke units which can be 
either mineralized or barren and at least two compositionally different volcanic packages (mafic and 
ultramafic elements). The extent of mineralization within the shear zone at Masato appears to be more 
strongly and continuously concentrated within higher strain zones, but the boundaries of mineralization 
zones can be gradational and occurrences of smaller non-continuous pockets of mineralization occur 
throughout the sheared system.

(looking east-southeast).
14.3.2  Golouma Deposits 
Golouma West
Golouma West was completely remodelled by OJVG personnel. In total, 13 zones of gold mineralization 
were modelled for the Golouma West deposit. These zones were modelled using 0.2 g/t Au as a cut-off 
guide to define the grade-shell extents. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by the gold 
grade values from drilling while respecting the general geological trends identified for the deposit. Figure 
28 is a plan view and Figure 29 is a 3D view of the gold grade-shell solids.

Page 100
In addition to the thirteen 0.2 g/t gold shells, nine additional higher grade gold grade-shells were produced 
with a 1.0 g/t Au cut-off for the 18000, 18100, 18300, 18400, 18500, 18600, 18700, 18800 and 18900 
zones. The wireframe extents for these higher grade shells are entirely contained within the lower grade 
0.2 g/t Au shells. Both open pit and underground mining scenarios are considered for this deposit, and 
the delineation of the higher grade gold zones helps with the underground design.
Zones 18000 to 18800 and zones 19000 to 19400 are a series of sub-parallel domains of shearing, 
alteration, veining and associated gold mineralization which strike in a roughly west-northwest direction 
and dip steeply to the south. Zone 18900 or the “West Limb”, strikes in the more regionally common 
northerly orientation and dips moderately to steeply towards the west.
SRK modelled three low grade waste volumes around the mineralized domains: Zone 1, Zone 2 and 
Zone 3 represented by 910, 920, and 930 block model codes respectively. These volumes were modeled 
to include thin stringers of mineralizaton surrounding the mineralized domains.
A barren, late mafic dyke striking roughly sub-parallel to zone 18900 has been modelled to cross-cut zone 
18000 (Figure 28 and Figure 29 ). This dark coloured, magnetic, mafic dyke has distinct characteristics 
and has been modelled as a waste domain. Several other mafic and felsic dykes have been intercepted 
by drilling in the Golouma West deposit, but have yet to be modelled. Most of these intervals occur 
outside of the mineralized zone and are not anticipated to cause significant dilution of the resource.

Golouma South
In total, three zones of gold mineralization were updated for the Golouma South deposit: 2100, 2200, and 
2300 (Figure 30). The zones were modelled using 0.2 g/t Au as a cut-off guide to define the grade-shell 
extents. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by the gold grade values from drilling while 
respecting the general geological trends identified for the deposit. Figure 31 is a plan view of the gold 
grade-shell solids, along with their assigned block model codes: wireframe solids 2000, 2100, 2200, and 
2300.
In addition to the four 0.2 g/t Au shells, three higher grade gold grade-shells were produced with a 1.0 g/t 
Au cut-off for the 2100, 2200, and 2300 zones. The wireframe extents for these higher grade shells are 
entirely contained within the lower grade 0.2 g/t Au shells. Both open pit and underground mining 
scenarios are considered for this deposit, and the delineation of the higher grade gold zones helps with 
the underground design.
Zones 2100 (the main zone) to 2300 are a series of sub-parallel zones similar in character to those in 
Golouma West (though generally higher in gold content). These zones have a north-northeast strike and 
dip steeply to the west within zones of shearing, alteration, veining and associated gold mineralization. 
The zone interpretations for Golouma South were significantly tightened up as part of the update for this 
study, and the zones were expanded at depth.
A low grade waste domain (LGWST700) was modelled around the mineralized domains to include thin 
stringers of mineralizaton surrounding the mineralized domains.
Three late felsic dykes have been modelled that cross-cut the modelled gold zones. These distinctive 
dykes have been modelled as waste domains, and are displayed below in Figure 31.

Golouma Northwest
In total, four zones of gold mineralization were modeled for the Golouma Northwest deposit. The zones 
were modelled using 0.2 g/t Au as a cut-off guide to define the grade-shell extents. Modelling of the gold 
zones was controlled primarily by the gold grade values from drilling while respecting the general 
geological trends identified for the deposit. Figure 32 is a plan view of the gold grade-shell solids, along 
with their assigned block model codes.
Zones 7100 to 7400 are a series of sub-parallel zones similar in character to those in Golouma West. 
These zones have a north-northwest strike and dip steeply to the south within zones of shearing, 
alteration, veining and associated gold mineralization.
The barren, late mafic dyke that strikes roughly sub-parallel to zone 18900 in the Golouma West deposit 
extends into the Golouma Northwest deposit and has been modelled to cross-cut the western extent of 
zones 7200 and 7300 (Figure 32).

Shells with Mafic Dyke (Fully projected). Grid spacing is 100 x 100 m.
Kerekounda
14.3.3 
For the Kerekounda deposit, four zones of gold mineralization have been identified and updated. Due to 
the generally higher grades and underground potential for Kerekounda, the mineralized zones were 
modelled as gold grade-shells using 1.0 g/t as a cut-off guide to the grade-shell extents, and with a 
minimum mining width of 2 m. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by the gold grade 
values from drilling while respecting the general geological trends identified for the deposit. Figure 33 is a 
plan view of the gold grade-shell solids, along with their assigned block model codes: wireframe solids 
3100, 3200, 3300, and 3400 (not shown). Figure 34 displays the zones in a 3D view to display the 
structurally deeper zone 3400.

Page 104
In addition to the four 1.0 g/t Au shells, four higher grade gold grade-shells were produced with a 2.0 g/t 
Au cut-off, one for each of the lower grade zones. The wireframe extents for these higher grade shells are 
entirely contained within the lower grade 1.0 g/t Au shells. Both open pit and underground mining 
scenarios are considered for this deposit, and the delineation of the higher grade gold zones helps with 
the underground design.
Gold zones 3100 to 3400 are modelled as four sub-parallel sheets present over a strike length of 
approximately 350 m and a down dip extent approaching 450 m. Zone 3100 sits slightly apart and 
structurally above the lower three zones.
Two mafic dykes and a single felsic dyke have been modelled at Kerekounda; however, only the two 
mafic dykes are observed to cross-cut the modelled gold zones. The two mafic dykes have been 
modelled as waste domains, and are displayed below in Figure 33.

Kourouloulou
14.3.5 
The geology model for the Kourouloulou deposit is identical to the 2011 model. Five zones of gold 
mineralization have been identified and updated. Due to the generally higher grades and underground 
potential for Kourouloulou, the mineralized zones were modelled as gold grade-shells using 1.0 g/t Au 
cut-off, and with a minimum mining width of 2 m. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by 
drill assay values while respecting the general geological trends identified for the deposit. Figure 36 is a 
3D view of the gold grade-shell solids, along with their assigned block model codes.
In addition to the four 1.0 g/t Au shells, one higher grade gold grade-shell was produced with a 2.0 g/t Au 
cut-off within the 6200 zone. The wireframe extents for this higher grade shell are entirely contained 
within the lower grade 1.0 g/t gold shell. Primarily underground mining scenarios are being considered for 
Kourouloulou, and the delineation of the higher grade gold zone helps with the underground design.
The mineralized zones represent a series of sub-parallel domains similar in trend and character to those 
in Golouma West, but the zones are generally narrower with higher gold grade and lower tonnage. These 
zones have a northwest strike and dip at intermediate angles to the south. Zone 6300 is located 
approximately 200 m further north and has a similar strike and steeper dip.

Niakafiri Southwest
14.3.6 
Six mineralization zones were supplied by OJVG geologists. The zones are modelled at a 0.2 g/t Au g/t 
cut-off. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by the gold grade values from drilling while 
respecting the general geological trends identified for the deposit. Niakafiri Southwest is a series of 
subparallel near vertical mineralized zones. The solids strike north to north-north-east and are steeply 
dipping to the west. The individual mineralized zones vary in width (5-30 m) and length (125-330 m). Two 
barren, late mafic dykes have also been modelled, one of which crosscuts one of the mineralized solids 
(Figure 37). SRK examined and validated the wireframes provided by OJVG. There has been no change 
to the wireframes or drilling since the review by SRK in 2011.

14.3.7  Maki Medina 
The 3D geologic solid models used for resource estimation were provided by OJVG. Where required, 
minor modifications were made by SRK to ensure the triangulations were valid. The models were based 
on gold assay values and associated lithology, and were guided by cross-sectional, and plan-view 
interpretations of drill hole data.
Six gold mineralized veins were designed and are presented in Figure 38. These zones were modelled as 
gold grade-shells using 0.2 g/t Au cut-off. In addition, post-mineralization (barren) felsic dyke models were 
used to trim the gold mineralization solids to ensure that the estimation domain volumes represent only 
mineralized material.
Based on the data available at the time of modelling, the Maki Medina deposit has been defined over a 
strike length of greater than 1,000 m. The modelled zones are typically less than 10 m in width and dip 
steeply to the west. In total, the veins comprise a variably mineralized zone up to 80 m wide.
All wireframe models were reviewed by SRK and are considered to be appropriate for the use in the 
mineral resource estimation.

was controlled primarily by the gold grade values from drilling while respecting the general geological 
trends identified for the deposit. SRK examined and validated the modelled wireframes. Figure 39 is a 3D

In total, two modelled gold zones were supplied for the Mamasato deposit by OJVG geologists using a 
0.2 g/t Au cut-off. The zones represent a gold mineralization domain and a sub-parallel cross-cutting 
mineralized dyke (Figure 40). Modelling of the gold domain was controlled primarily by grade while 
respecting local geological trends. SRK examined and validated the wireframes with respect to the 
supplied desurveyed composite and assay data. For estimation purposes the mineralized domain and the 
dyke were estimated separately, and the estimated dyke grades were subsequently used to dilute the 
mineralized domain blocks on a volume basis.

observed continuity of the domain. Modelling of the gold zones was controlled primarily by grade while 
respecting local geological trends. SRK examined and validated the resulting wireframes with respect to 
the supplied desurveyed composite and assay data. The two dykes were treated as non-intersecting un-
mineralized structures for the purposes of mineral resource estimation.

by the gold grade values from drilling while respecting the general geological trends identified for the 
deposit. Figure 43 is a 3D view of the gold grade-shell.
A barren, late mafic dyke striking roughly sub-parallel to mineralized zones has been modelled to cross-
cut the footwall mineralized zones. This dark coloured, magnetic, mafic dyke has distinct characteristics 
and has been modelled as a waste domain.

Evaluation of Extreme Assay Values
Block grade estimates may be unduly affected by very high grade assays. Therefore, assay data were 
evaluated for high grade outliers and capped to values deemed appropriate for the estimation. Note that 
“Lost Au Metal” shown in the tables below was calculated as the relative difference between declustered 
mean gold grades from both capped and original sample data.  Table 43 and Table 44 show the effect of 
capping for Masato and Golouma West. All other deposits have tables in Appendix E of the 2013 FS.
The capping values were established from probability plots, decile analysis, and to a lesser extent from 
indicators of assays in the same drill holes at different thresholds. The inflection points on probability plots 
at high end of grade distributions were interpreted as thresholds to outlier high grade populations and 
candidates for choice of capping.

Statistical Analysis
Basic statistics of declustered and capped assays within the modeled zones were completed for each 
deposit. Masato is presented in Figure 46 and Golouma West is presented in Figure 47 to Figure 49.  
Statistics for all other deposits are located in Appendix F of the 2013 FS.
The statistics for Masato, Golouma West, Golouma South, Kerekounda, and Kourouloulou have some 
domains that were further subdivided into low or high grade domains. All statistical and grade 
interpolation was carried out using these lower and higher grade zones.

Variography
Variography was completed to study the spatial variability and grade continuity of gold within the specific 
zones defined for each of the OJVG deposits. The ordinary kriging used to estimate block grade is 
dependent on the variogram models developed from this study. The resulting variogram models also help 
define the orientation and range parameters for the search ellipsoids used during the block model 
estimation. Variograms for Masato and Golouma West are presented below in Table 45 and Table 46.  All 
other deposits are located in Appendix G of the 2013 FS.
14.6.1  Masato 
At Masato, normal-scores experimental variograms were generated to best-fit along general orientation of 
the mineralized zones. Nugget effects were derived from downhole variograms, and variogram model 
ranges were checked and iteratively refined for each model. Table 45 shows final variogram models for 
each mineralized domain.

The majority of the variogram models at Golouma West were designed from gold assays transformed to 
logarithms. In many instances, the logarithmic values tend to exhibit better, stable variograms primarily 
due to the magnitude of values used in the calculation. The in-structure variogram models were based on 
directional variograms, and across-structure variogram models were designed from downhole 
variograms. Note that the variograms were modelled in the form of exponential correlograms (Table 46).

Note: Exponential models with practical ranges were applied 
Variogram models, in the form of correlograms, are combined from downhole and directional variograms. Downhole 
correlograms were used to model across structure continuities 
1 Assumed identical to 18000 domain 
2 Assumed identical to 18700 domain
14.6.3  Golouma South 
The Golouma South variogram models are identical to those developed in 2011. Experimental and model 
variograms were generated separately for the largest mineralized low grade gold domain and its high 
grade gold sub-domain (2100 and 2100HG). For domains 2200 and 2300, high grade gold domains were 
combined with the low grade domains. The in-structure variogram models were based on directional and 
omni-directional variograms, and across-structure variogram models were designed from downhole 
variograms. Note that the variograms were modelled in the form of exponential correlograms.
14.6.4  Golouma Northwest 
Due to the limited number of samples in each of the mineralized domains in the Golouma Northwest 
deposit, experimental semi-variograms could not be generated for gold from composite grade data for 
these veins.

14.6.5 
Due to paucity of data, variogram models were designed only for combined 3200 and 3200HG domains. 
The in-structure variogram model was based on directional variograms, and across-structure variogram 
model was designed from down hole variograms. For all other domains, the variogram models were 
assumed identical to those modelled in the 3200 domain. Note that the variograms were modelled in the 
form of spherical correlograms.
Niakafiri Southeast
14.6.6 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Niakafiri Southeast domains. Therefore, the inverse 
distance squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.
Niakafiri Southwest
14.6.7 
Due to paucity of data, variogram models were designed only for 17100 and 17600 domains. The in-
structure variogram models were based on directional variograms, and across-structure variogram 
models were designed either from downhole variograms (17100) or directional variograms (17600). For 
all other domains, the variogram models were assumed identical to either 17100 or 17600 domains. Note 
that the variograms were modelled in the form of exponential correlograms.
14.6.8  Maki Medina 
Experimental variograms, aligned with the best-fit orientation of the estimation domains, were calculated 
and modeled using Maptek Vulcan software using composite data from the 16003 domain only. The 
16003 domain contained the most composites (493) of any of the estimation domains and is considered 
by SRK to be representative of all of the mineralized domains in the Maki Medina deposit. The nugget 
effect was derived from the down hole variogram. Note that the variograms were modelled in the form of 
spherical correlograms.
Kourouloulou
14.6.9 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Kourouloulou domains due to paucity of data. Therefore, 
the inverse distance squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.
14.6.10  Kobokoto 
Due to paucity of data, SRK treated all the mineralized wireframes as one domain for variography 
analysis. Variography was modelled using composited data and SAGE2001 geostatistical software. 
Variogram models were then verified with Gemcom GEMs geostatitical module.
The nugget effect was derived from the down hole experimental semi-variogram. Rotation is defined by 
the Gemcom ZYZ convention in the defined block model space. Note that the variograms were modelled 
in the form of exponential correlograms.
14.6.11  Mamasato 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Mamasato domains. Therefore, the inverse distance 
squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.
14.6.12  Koulouqwinde 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Koulouqwinde domains. Therefore, the inverse distance 
squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.

14.6.13  Sekoto 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Sekoto domains. Therefore, the inverse distance 
squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.
14.6.14  Kinemba 
Due to pacity of data and the relatively small size of the Kinemba database, SRK treated all the 
mineralized wireframes as one domain for variography analysis. Variography was modelled using 
composited data and SAGE2001 geostatistical software. Variogram models were then verified with 
Gemcom GEMs geostatistical module.
The nugget effect was derived from the downhole experimental semi-variogram. Rotation is defined by 
the Gemcom ZYZ convention in the defined block model space). Note that the variograms were modelled 
in the form of exponential correlograms.
14.6.15  Koutouniokolla 
Variogram models could not be designed for the Koutouniokolla domains. Therefore, the inverse distance 
squared estimation methodology was applied during estimation.
14.6.16  Kouroundi 
A variogram model for the mineralized domain was designed with SAGE2001 geostatistical software. The 
nugget effect was derived from the downhole variogram. Rotation is defined by the Gemcom ZYZ 
convention in the defined block model space.
14.7
Block Model Setup
With the exclusion of the Maki Medina block model designed in Vulcan, all other block models were 
developed in Gemcom GEMS™. The origin of the block model in GEMS is defined as minimum easting 
and northing and maximum elevation.
The geometrical parameters of the block models in all deposits at the OJVG Gold Project were 
constructed to cover the extent of the mineralized domains; with block size reflecting generally narrow 
widths of the mineralized zones (Table 47). None of the block models for the project were rotated from 
the origin.
With the exception of Maki Medina GEMS percent models were produced for all deposits. For most 
deposits, separate folders were created for each geologic domain, and the portion (percent) of the block 
volume occupied by a specific geologic domain was calculated and assigned to that block (percent 
weighted blocks). At Maki Medina a constant block size was used with a proportion of mineralized rocks 
assigned to each block. This approach is very similar to the percent model utilized in GEMS.

Bulk Density Models
For all deposits a 3D wireframe surface was constructed that separates completely or partially oxidized 
and saprolitic material from underlying, predominantly fresh rock below. This surface was then used to 
assign blocks either to a lower density oxidized rocks above the surface or to a higher density fresh rocks 
below the surface. Blocks were estimated or assigned with a hard boundary applied at the saprolitic 
surface.
For Golouma West, Golouma South, Golouma Northwest, Kerekounda, and Kourouloulou, blocks in the 
lower density oxidized and saprolitic rocks were assigned the average bulk density value.
The bulk densities for mineralized fresh rocks at Golouma West, Golouma South, and Kerekounda were 
estimated using the inverse distance squared method. For each deposit the mineralized domains were 
estimated separately, and, if necessary, a soft boundary condition was applied between the associated 
high and low grade gold domains. A single search orientation was used for the mineralized domains at 
Golouma South and Kerekounda, but separate orientations were applied to mineralized domains for 
Golouma West.
At Kourouloulou and Golouma Northwest insufficient density data is present for the mineralized domains 
within the fresh rocks to be estimated. Therefore, in those domains an average density value was 
assigned. The same procedure was applied at Kouroundi in both oxidized and fresh rocks.
For Masato, Mamasato, Koulouqwinde, Niakafiri Southeast, Koutouniokolla, Sekoto, Kinemba, Kobokoto, 
and Niakafiri Southwest the bulk densities were estimated by the inverse distance squared method. Any 
un-interpolated blocks were set to the average density values in oxidized and fresh rocks.
For Maki Medina average density values were assigned separately to fresh mineralized domains, 
oxidized mineralized domains, fresh waste, and oxidized waste.
Table 48 presents average bulk densities either assigned or estimated in each deposit separately in fresh 
and oxidized rocks within the pit, and Table 49 shows estimation parameters applied to the inverse 
distance squared methodology.

Block Model Resource Estimation
Except for Maki Medina, in all other deposits at the OJVG Gold Project the resources were estimated in 
Gemcom GEMSTM. Maki Medina resources were estimated in Vulcan. Resource estimation was 
commonly carried out in two or three passes. In the first pass, blocks in the core of the deposit were 
estimated with restrictive parameters and in subsequent passes more relaxed parameters were applied 
(e.g., fewer number of holes required). Blocks estimated during each sequential pass were flagged. The 
flags were used in assignment to resource categories.
The estimation approach applied hard boundaries for all geologic domains. Only samples located within a 
particular domain were used to calculate grade for blocks within the associated domain.
The resource estimations for the Project were completed as follows:
  Masato, Mamasato, Koulouqwinde, Niakafiri Southeast, Sekoto and Koutouniokolla were estimated
by Fred Brown, CPG;
  Kinemba, Kobokoto, Kouroundi, and Niakafiri Southwest were estimated by Gilles Arseneau,
P.Geo.;
  Golouma deposits were estimated by Darrell Farrow, Pr. Sci. Nat;
  Kerekounda and Kourouloulou was estimated by Wayne Barnett, Pr. Sci. Nat, and
  Maki Medina was estimated by Guy Dishaw, P.Geo.
  All deposits were validated by Marek Nowak, P. Eng.
14.9.1  Masato 
The Masato mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that hard 
boundaries were applied between high grade and low grade sub-domains, and that the blocks were 
estimated with three successive passes. Prior to estimation composites were capped to an appropriate 
value as determined by analysis of probability plots and histograms. The first and second passes were 
designed to ensure that the better drilled central core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from 
samples well arrayed around each estimated block. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and 
the second and third passes only updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass. In the second and 
third pass less restrictive estimation parameters were applied (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.9.2  Golouma West 
The Golouma West mineralized domains and surrounding, poorly mineralized waste volumes were 
estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that hard boundaries were applied between high 
grade and low grade sub-domains, and that the blocks were estimated with a minimum of two successive 
passes. The first pass was designed to ensure that the better drilled core of the mineralized zones would 
be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated block. The first pass considered a 
relatively small search ellipsoid with the search ellipsoid split into eight octants (Appendix H of the 2013 
FS).
For the poorly mineralized waste volumes, a high grade search restriction was applied. For samples with 
grades greater than 1.0 g/t gold, those samples were only used to estimate grade if they were located 
within 30 m of the block to be estimated. This reduced the impact of a few widely spaced, high grade 
sample values on the greater block model.

14.9.3  Golouma South 
The Golouma South mineralized domains and surrounding, poorly mineralized waste volumes were 
estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation employed hard boundaries that were applied between high 
grade and low grade sub-domains, and the blocks were then estimated with two successive passes. The 
first pass was designed to ensure that the better drilled core of the mineralized zones would be 
interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated block. The first pass considered a 
relatively small search ellipsoid with the search ellipsoid split into eight octants (Appendix H of the 2013 
FS). For the high grade zones 2100HG and 2300HG, a high grade search restriction was applied. For 
samples with grades greater than 50 g/t and 22 g/t gold, respectively, those samples were only used to 
estimate grade if they were located within 20 m of the block to be estimated. This reduced the impact of a 
few spaced, high grade sample values on the greater block model.
14.9.4  Golouma Northwest 
The Golouma Northwest mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared method. 
Search ellipses were set up to parallel the strike and dip of the veins. The estimation employed hard 
boundaries that were applied between domains, and the blocks were then estimated with two successive 
passes. The first pass was designed to ensure that the better drilled core of the mineralized zones would 
be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated block. The first pass considered a 
relatively small search ellipsoid with the search ellipsoid split into eight octants (Appendix H of the 2013 
FS).
Kerekounda
14.9.5 
The Kerekounda mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation employed hard 
boundaries that were applied between high grade and low grade sub-domains, and the blocks were then 
estimated with three successive passes. The first and second pass were designed to ensure that the 
better drilled central core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from samples well arrayed 
around each estimated block. The first two passes considered relatively small search ellipsoids with the 
search ellipsoid split into eight octants. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and the second 
pass only updated blocks not estimated by the first pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
Niakafiri Southeast
14.9.6 
The Niakafiri Southeast mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared weighting 
of between four and twelve capped composite values from two or more drillholes. The estimation 
employed hard boundaries that were applied between three domains as defined by Lakehead Geological 
Services. Blocks were estimated with two successive passes. Blocks estimated by the first pass were 
flagged, and the second pass only updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 
2013 FS).
Niakafiri Southwest
14.9.7 
The Niakafiri Southwest mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured 
that hard boundaries were applied between mineralized and waste domains. Blocks were estimated with 
three successive passes. The first and second passes were designed to ensure that the better drilled 
central core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each 
estimated block. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged; the second and third passes only 
updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
For the second pass solids 17600 and 17610 had a separate search ellipse applied to estimate a 
differently oriented portion of the solids.

14.9.8  Maki Medina 
The Maki Medina mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that 
hard boundaries were applied between mineralized and waste domains. Two estimation steps were used 
in order to populate grade into all blocks in the estimation domains.
The first step was designed with search ellipse rotations and ranges based on the grade continuity 
determined by the variogram model. The second step was expanded slightly to populate blocks where 
crenulations in the interpreted domains occurred. The number of samples required for estimation in the 
second step was reduced (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
Kourouloulou
14.9.9 
The Kourouloulou mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared weighting 
method. The estimation employed hard boundaries that were applied between high grade and low grade 
sub-domains, and the blocks were then estimated with three successive passes. The first and second 
passes were designed to ensure that the better drilled central core of the mineralized zones would be 
interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated block. The first two passes considered 
relatively small search ellipsoids with the search ellipsoid split into eight octants, and the second pass 
doubled the search range used by the first. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and the 
second pass only updated blocks not estimated by the first pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
For the mineralized zones 6100 and 6201, a high grade search restriction was applied. For samples with 
grades greater than 60 g/t and 30 g/t gold, respectively, those samples were only used to estimate grade 
if they were located within 20 meters of the block to be estimated (reduces to 10 m across the plane of 
the gold mineralized zone). This reduced the impact of a few spaced, high grade sample values on the 
greater block model.
14.9.10  Kobokoto 
The Kobokoto mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that hard 
boundaries were applied between mineralized and waste domains. Blocks were estimated with three 
successive passes. The first and second passes were designed to ensure that the better drilled central 
core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated 
block. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and the second and third passes only updated 
blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.9.11  Mamasato 
The Mamasato mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared weighting of 
between four and twelve capped composite values from two or more drillholes. The estimation employed 
hard boundaries that were applied between vein and dyke sub-domains as defined by Lakehead 
Geological Services. Blocks were estimated with two successive passes. Blocks estimated by the first 
pass were flagged, and the second pass only updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass 
(Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.9.12  Koulouqwinde 
The Koulouqwinde mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared weighting of 
between four and twelve capped composite values from two or more drillholes. The estimation employed 
hard boundaries that were applied between six domains as defined by Lakehead Geological Services. 
Blocks were estimated with a single pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).

14.9.13  Sekoto 
The Sekoto mineralized domains were estimated by the inverse distance squared weighting of between 
four and twelve capped composite values from two or more drillholes. The estimation employed hard 
boundaries that were applied between three domains as defined by Lakehead Geological Services. 
Blocks were estimated with two successive passes. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and 
the second pass only updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.9.14  Kinemba 
The Kinemba mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that hard 
boundaries were applied between mineralized and waste domains. Blocks were estimated with four 
successive passes. The first and second passes were designed to ensure that the better drilled central 
core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated 
block. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and the second, third and fourth passes only 
updated blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.9.15  Koutouniokolla 
The Koutouniokolla mineralized domains were estimated by inverse distance squared weighting of 
between four and twelve capped composite values from one or more drillholes. The estimation employed 
hard boundaries that were applied between three mineralized domains and the waste domains. Blocks 
were estimated with a single pass (Appendix H).
14.9.16  Kouroundi 
The Kouroundi mineralized domains were estimated by ordinary kriging. The estimation ensured that hard 
boundaries were applied between mineralized and waste domains. Blocks were estimated with three 
successive passes. The first and second passes were designed to ensure that the better drilled central 
core of the mineralized zones would be interpolated from samples well arrayed around each estimated 
block. Blocks estimated by the first pass were flagged, and the second and third passes only updated 
blocks not estimated by the previous pass (Appendix H of the 2013 FS).
14.10  Block Model Grade Validation
The resource block model grades for the deposits were validated by completing a series of visual 
inspections and by:
  Comparison of local “well-informed” block grades with composites contained within those blocks in
each mineralized domain;
  Comparison of average assay grades with average block estimates along different directions –
swath plots in each mineralized domain. The swath plots were produced separately for each
mineralized domain in all deposits. In this report only the largest domains with best grades are
presented.
Due to a large number of deposits for which the grades have been estimated the following discussion is 
limited to two largest deposits: Golouma and Masato. Validations for other deposits are presented in 
Appendix I.
14.10.1  Golouma  
Figure 50 shows a comparison of estimated gold block grades with borehole assay data contained within 
those blocks within mineralized domains in the Golouma South and West areas.  On average, the

estimated blocks are similar to the assay data, although there is some scatter of points around the x = y 
line. This scatter is typical of smoothed block estimates compared to the more variable assay data used 
to estimate those blocks. This is indicated by a thick white line. The thick white line that runs through the 
middle of the cloud is the result of a piece-wise linear regression smoother. Similar results were produced 
for the Golouma Northwest mineralized domains.
Figure 50:  Comparison of Block Estimates with Borehole Assay Data Contained within the
Blocks in the Mineralized Domains in (a) Golouma South and (b) Golouma West areas.
As a final check, average assay grades and average block estimates were compared along different 
directions. This involved calculating declustered average assay grades and comparison with average 
block estimates along east-west, north-south, and horizontal swaths. Figure 51 shows the swath plots in 
the 2100HG domain at Golouma South, and Figure 52 shows the swath plots in the 18000HG domain at 
Golouma West. Similar results were noted for all other domains. In one domain, 18000HG, a comparison 
was made on not declustered data. This decision has been made after thorough analysis of block 
estimated grades and assay grades.
Locally, the average assays can be quite different from the average estimates. Those differences may be 
explained by quite variable very high grades in the high grade domains. Nevertheless, the charts show 
that block grade estimates in those domains are reasonable reflection of the underlying drill hole assay 
data.

14.10.2  Masato 
Figure 53 shows a comparison of estimated gold block grades with borehole assay data contained within 
those blocks inside a major mineralized domain divided into high grade (5101) and lower grade (5102) 
sub-domains. On average, the estimated blocks are similar to the assays with a reasonable degree of 
correlation between the estimates and the assays.
As in Golouma, the estimates were further validated by comparing average assay grades with average 
block estimates along different directions. This involved calculating declustered average assay grades 
and comparison with average block estimates along east-west, north-south, and horizontal swaths. Figure 
54 shows the swath plots in the 5101 domain. Similar results were noted for all other domains.

14.10.3  Validation Summary 
In summary, SRK considers the estimation of the modelled domains in all deposits to be robust and the 
results have been verified to a reasonable degree of confidence. Whenever some large discrepancies 
occurred between the data and the estimated block grades, adjustments have been made. Overall, the 
average grades in block models in all deposits are relatively similar to that of the declustered input data, 
indicating that no biases have been introduced.
14.11  Mineral Resource Classification
The OJVG Gold Project mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 
“Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices” Guidelines. SRK is not aware of 
any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant 
issues that could potentially affect this estimate of mineral resources. The mineral resources may be 
affected by further infill and exploration drilling which may result in increases or decreases in subsequent 
mineral resource estimates. The mineral resources may also be affected by subsequent assessments of 
mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic and other factors.
Several deposits updated in this report have been previously classified in 2011 by SRK. The current 
resource categories adopt the classification envelopes that were developed by these earlier studies.

Classification envelopes were adjusted to account for newly defined zones or areas upgraded by new 
drilling. The estimated blocks were classified as either indicated or inferred according to:
  Confidence in interpretation of the mineralized zones;
  Continuity of gold grades defined from variogram models;
  Number of samples used to estimate a block; and
  Number of drill holes used to estimate a block.
For the Masato, Southeast, Niakafiri Southwest, Kinemba, Kobokoto, Kouroundi, Maki Medina, and 
Mamasato deposits blocks estimated in the first estimation pass were treated as candidates for indicated 
mineral resources for each deposit. Final broad envelopes, encompassing zones of predominantly 
indicated candidates, were designed to define indicated resources. This approach reclassified small, 
discontinuous clusters of inferred blocks to the indicated category, and thereby ensured consistent 
definition of the indicated category regions. All estimated block grades not assigned to the indicated 
category were given an inferred resource classification.
For the Sekoto, Koulouqwinde, Golouma Northwest, and Koutouniokolla deposits all mineral resources 
were defined as Inferred.
For the Golouma West and Golouma South deposits, the 2011 indicated category envelopes were 
applied, and the final indicated envelopes were adjusted to incorporate new drilling. Where appropriate, 
the indicated category envelopes were extended to included blocks estimated by the first interpolation 
pass. Final broad areas of indicated resources were selected from classification envelopes designed to 
encompass zones predominantly flagged for the indicated category. This approach reclassified small, 
discontinuous clusters of inferred blocks to the indicated category, and thereby ensured consistent 
definition of the indicated category regions. All estimated block grades not assigned to the indicated 
category were given an inferred resource classification.
At Kerekounda and Kourouloulou, the 2010 indicated category envelopes were also applied to the 
updated resource estimate, and the indicated envelope was adjusted to incorporate new drilling for 
Kerekounda. Kourouloulou has not changed since the previous report. Where appropriate, the indicated 
category envelopes were extended to included blocks estimated by the first and second interpolation 
passes. Final broad areas of indicated resources were selected from classification envelopes designed to 
encompass zones predominantly flagged for the indicated category. This approach reclassified small, 
discontinuous clusters of inferred blocks to the indicated category, and thereby ensured consistent 
definition of the indicated category regions. All estimated block grades not assigned to the indicated 
category were given an inferred resource classification.
14.12  Sensitivity of the Block Model to Selection of Cut-off Grade
The mineral resources are sensitive to the selection of cut-off grade. Table 50 and Table 51 show global 
tonnage and grade for Golouma and Masato while Figure 55 and Figure 56 show grade tonnage curves 
for these deposits. Tables and grade tonnage curves for other deposits are presented in Appendix J of 
the 2013 FS. The reader should be cautioned that these figures should not be misconstrued as a mineral 
resource. The reported quantities and grades are only presented as a sensitivity of the resource model to 
the selection of cut-off grade.

14.13  Mineral Resource Statement
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) defines a 
mineral resource as:
“a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized 
organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth’s 
crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral 
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge”.
SRK considers the Mineral Resources completed by SRK and presented here to have “reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction”, implying that the quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic 
thresholds and that the mineral resources are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade taking into account 
extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. SRK considers that large portions of the OJVG deposits 
are amenable for open pit extraction. SRK designed Whittle shells to report open pittable resources for all 
deposits in the Project. Four of the deposits are designated for mill processing in the FS (Golouma, 
Masato, Kerekounda and Kourouloulou) while the rest are designated for heap leach process. Different 
parameters as listed below were used on the two sets in Whittle for designing the shells. Some portions 
of the deposits below the Whittle shells are considered suited for underground mining. SRK have 
reviewed the QA/QC data as supplied, and has undertaken the necessary statistical checks to gain some 
comfort in the quality of the data. SRK is confident that the drill hole databases supplied are of a sufficient 
quality to support the subsequent Mineral Resource estimates. Blocks have been classified as both 
Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral Resources. Classification of the Mineral Resource is 
based on quality control data, geological continuity, borehole spacing and the quality of the geostatistical 
estimate.
In order to determine the quantities of material offering reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
from an open pit, SRK used a Whittle pit optimizer to evaluate the profitability of each resource block 
based on certain optimization parameters selected from comparable projects. The optimization 
parameters include: mining costs of US$1.25 per tonne mined, processing and G&A costs of US$12.75 
per processed tonne for fresh rock and $5.10 for oxide material for the CIL mill scenario and $6.10 per 
processed tonne of fresh rock and $5.10 for oxide material in the Heap Leach scenario , overall pit slope 
angles of forty-five degrees, metallurgical recovery of 95% for fresh rock and 80% for oxide in the CIL mill 
scenario and 60% for fresh rock and 80% for oxide in the heap leach scenario, and appropriate dilution 
and offsite costs and royalties. A gold price of US$1,500 per ounce was considered. The reader is 
cautioned that the results from the conceptual pit optimization work are used solely for the purpose of 
reporting Mineral Resources that have “reasonable prospects” for economic extraction by an open pit and 
do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves.
The resources from the Whittle shells are reported at 0.32 Au g/t cut-off, for fresh rock, 0.15 Au g/t for 
oxide material in the CIL scenario; 0.24 Au g/t cut-off for fresh rock and 0.15 Au g/t cut-off for oxide 
material in the Heap Leach scenario, and the underground portions of the deposits representing material 
outside of the designed Whittle shells are reported at 1.0 Au g/t cut-off grade (Table 52). Note that the 
close proximity and overlapping infrastructure design of the two similar style deposits from the 2010 
Feasibility Study suggests that Golouma West and Golouma South should be considered as one deposit 
and are reported as such in this report and in future disclosures.

15  Mineral Reserve Estimates
According to NI 43-101 guidelines, a preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and can 
include the use of inferred resources. Inferred resources are too speculative geologically to apply 
economic considerations that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves.   Therefore no 
mineral reserves have been defined for the heap leach deposits.
Mineral reserves have been identified for the four of the deposits in the CIL Feasibility Study and these 
are summarized in Section 24.

16  Mining Methods
The heap leach deposits can be developed as conventional open pit mining operations.  Each pit will 
yield varying amounts of both oxide and sulphide mineralization.  This heap leach feed material will be 
trucked to the central heap leach site where crushing, agglomeration, and stacking will occur.  Each pit 
will also have a waste dump located in proximity to the pit.
The mine design process started with a series of pit optimizations to provide the basis for the 
operational pit designs.  The operational pit designs included the haulage ramps and minimum working 
widths and were subsequently used to report the tonnages that were incorporated into the production 
schedule and heap leach economics.
No pits optimizations or pit design was completed for heap leach material derived from the Masato 
deposit since Masato optimization and mine design were completed in the CIL feasibility study.  Based 
on the tonnages contained within that Masato pit, it was assumed that the heap leach operation would 
receive material that was above the heap leach cut-off grade but below the Masato CIL cut-off.  
Essentially this low grade material would be considered as “waste” at Masato and such would be mined 
(and stockpiled) as part of normal operations there.  There would be an incremental cost to haul this 
material to the leach pad site but no heap leach cost to physically mine the material.
16.1
Pit Optimizations
Pit optimizations were done using the Whittle software and using the same parameters for each of the 
deposits.   Pit optimizations were done using a gold price of $1250/oz in order to be conservative and 
consistent with the concurrent CIL feasibility study.  Table 53 presents the parameters used in the heap 
leach pit optimization.  Both indicated and inferred resources were utilized in the optimization analysis.  
Separate parameters were applied to oxide and sulphide rock in order to allow the optimizer to 
determine how deep to push the pit into the sulphide rock.

Pit Designs
For each of the heap leach deposits, operational pit designs were completed and these designs were 
used to report the production tonnages.  Table 54 summarizes the mine design parameters used for this 
step.  Figure 57 illustrates the general site layout and shows the pit designs completed for each pit 
used in the study.

Potentially Mineable Resource
The selection of the heap leach production tonnage is determined by the heap leach cut-off grade 
applied to distinguish feed from waste material within the operational pit.  The economic parameters 
used for this step differ from those used in the pit optimization, in particular a higher gold price and 
higher operating costs more consistent with the CIL feasibility study costs.  Table 55 presents the heap 
leach cut-off grade basis.

For comparison at Masato, the gold cut-off grades used in the CIL feasibility study are 0.51 g/t and 0.88 
g/t for Oxide and Sulphide rock.  For each of the heap leach pits, the tonnage of potentially mineable 
oxide and sulphide heap leach material was determined.  In addition the quantity of waste material 
within the pit was also reported. The potentially mineable resource tonnages are summarized in Table 
56.
When converting from insitu tonnes to production tonnes a mining loss of 3% and dilution of 8% were 
incorporated, with Au diluting grades for oxide and sulphide of 0.09 g/t and 0.14 g/t respectively (half of 
the cut-off grade).

Production Schedule
The various deposits in the heap leach project were scheduled in order to provide uniform annual 
mining quantities, maximize grade in the early part of the schedule, reduce pre stripping requirements, 
while providing the required heap leach production per period. The open pit mining sequence, which 
mines higher grade pits early on in the schedule, begins with Niakafiri Southeast, followed by Maki 
Medina, Kobokoto, Mamasato, Niakafiri Southwest and ends with the Sekoto deposit.  The Masato 
material is introduced gradually over the heap leach life to smooth the production tonnages.  The pit 
tonnages and grade details are summarized in the production schedule in Table 57.
The proposed 2.0 Mtpa heap leach processing rate was used. The average mining rate is planned to be 
about 7.5 million tonnes per year (about 21,000 tpd in the first nine years.)
The production schedule utilizes inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically 
to have the economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there 
is no certainty that the inferred resources will be upgraded to a higher resource category.
The OJVG heap leach deposits will produce a total of 28.4 million tonnes (“Mt”) of heap leach feed and 
52.5 Mt of waste over a fourteen year mine operating life, with a strip ratio of 1:1.8
Figure 58 summarizes annual tonnages of heap leach feed being processed and waste mined each 
year.  In the later part of the schedule only Masato feed is being processed.
Figure 58:  Mining and Processing Tonnages by Year.
Figure 59 summarizes the annual split between oxide and sulphide feed delivered to the heap leach 
pad.  Initially the majority of feed consists of oxide but later transitions into more sulphide type feed as 
the pits deepen.

Mine Operations
The open pit mining activities for the heap leach pits were assumed to be undertaken by a contractor-
operated fleet.
The types of major mining equipment utilized to mine the heap leach deposits will be determined by the 
mining contractor.  However it is assumed the equipment will be similar to that used by the owner-
operated fleet developing the CIL deposits, 90 tonne off-highway trucks.
The work schedule is based on two 12 hour shifts, seven days a week, 365 days per year.
The mining operations will consist of the following activities:
  Drilling and blasting of rock 
  Grade control to define waste limits 
  Loading using hydraulic shovels or excavators 
  Hauling of rock using rigid-frame off-highway trucks 
  Hauling of heap leach feed using highway style trucks from remote deposits 
  Bulldozer support in the pit and on the waste dumps 
  Mine services: Road graders and water trucks for road maintenance and service vehicle to support
equipment maintenance
  Drainage and pit pumping system for wet season rain events.
16.6  Waste Rock Disposal
Waste rock from the various open pit deposits at the heap leach project will be deposited in engineered 
waste rock facilities adjacent to each of the deposits. The dumps will be constructed by placing material 
at its natural angle of repose (approximately 1.5H:1V).  A 30% swell factor is applied in the waste dump 
storage.
All waste rock material types will be deposited in the engineered dumps. It is not anticipated that 
significant amounts of overburden will be encountered in the mining of the Sabodala open pits. However, 
segregation of the various waste material types, if deemed necessary, can be managed given the extent 
of the various dump designs.
Table 58 presents the heights and footprint areas assumed for each of the respective waste dumps.   The 
Masato waste dump design is included as part of the Masato mine design in the CIL feasibility study.

17  Recovery Methods
The following sections have been abstracted from the Mineral Processing Section #20 of the “Oromin 
Joint Venture Group Golouma Project Heap Leach Preliminary Economic Assessment” (Ausenco, 2011).
17.1.1  Mineral Processing 
The proposed heap leach and Adsorption, Desorption and Refinery (“ADR”) plant will process run of mine 
(“ROM”) ore to produce gold doré bars. The proposed process encompasses crushing, stacking, heap 
leaching, Carbon in Column (“CIC”) gold adsorption, acid wash, Zadra elution and electrowinning, carbon 
regeneration and smelting.
Plant Design Basis
17.1.2 
Due to the preliminary nature of the PEA only a small amount of the design criteria were based on test 
work, most were based on data from similar operations. The key criteria initially selected for the plant 
design are:
  Treatment of 2.0 Mtpa (5,480 tpd);
  Crushing and stacking operating 16 hours per day at 90% availability;
  ADR design availability of 90% after ramp-up (7,884 operating hours per year), with standby
equipment in critical areas;
  Sufficient plant design flexibility for treatment of both ore types (fresh and oxide) at design
throughput;
  Nominal average head grade of 0.5 g/t Au.
The selection of these parameters is discussed in detail below.
Throughput and Availability
17.1.3 
A solution and plant availability of 90% (or 7,884 hours per year) was nominated, based on the availability 
of similar operations.
The ore throughput rate of 440 t/h is a product of the annual throughput, operating hours per day and the 
expected plant availability.
Head Grade
17.1.4 
The crushing and stacking circuits are designed to handle a maximum throughput rate of 440 t/h. The 
ADR plant is designed to treat various solution flow rates (a maximum of 792 m3/h) for ore with a nominal 
head grade of 0.5 g/t Au. The head grade was decided on in discussion with the client.
Processing Strategy
17.1.5 
The process design is based on treating different sample types tested individually at the nominated 
design throughput rate. Typically, the range in variability of ore parameters such as hardness and head 
grade during process design are considered. However, due to the preliminary nature of the mining 
schedule and metallurgical test work, estimated ore hardness was used in the design criteria.

Process Description
17.2.2 
Metallurgical performance testing is limited to bottle roll, percolation, agglomeration and column leach test 
work. The process plant design, which includes crushing, stacking, heap leaching and ADR plant, is 
based on a 9 year mine life. The proposed two stage crushing facility can be used to crush and lay 
aggregate for initial pad construction. Gold will be recovered from the pregnant leach solution in the ADR 
facility.
The process description should be read in conjunction with the Process Design Criteria and Block Flow 
Diagram.
Crushing
17.2.3 
There are two stages of crushing. The first crushing stage will be accomplished in a jaw crusher in open 
circuit, while the second stage will be completed by a standard cone crusher in closed circuit with a 
screen.

Page 155
ROM ore is transported from the mine using haul trucks and placed in a stockpile situated close to the 
crusher. A front end loader will dump the feed ore into the ROM bin via a static grizzly screen. Oversize 
removal will be achieved using a mobile rock breaker.
A vibrating feeder transfers ore from the ROM bin to a screen. The screen oversize is fed to the jaw 
crusher. Jaw crusher product and screen undersize are combined and conveyed to a double deck 
secondary screen via a transfer conveyor. The double deck screen oversize is fed to the cone crusher, 
and then recirculated back to the double deck screen. The bottom deck screen undersize is the final 
crushed product, which is conveyed to agglomeration and the leach pad stacking system.
Prior to secondary screening, crushed ore will be passed under a tramp metal detector and then 
discharged into a bifurcated chute assembly, one leg of which feeds the double deck screen feed 
conveyor while the other feeds a bypass chute. The ore flow will be directed according to the position of a 
deflector gate installed inside the bifurcated chute. If any residual tramp metal is detected on the transfer 
conveyor, the plant control system will actuate the deflector gate to bypass the screen deck for a 
predetermined duration. All diverted scats will be sent to the crusher tramp metal stockpile where the ore 
will be separated for removal of all tramp metal. Once all tramp metal has been removed, the ore will be 
re-introduced into the circuit.
In order to minimise dust generated as the crushed ore is discharged from the various conveyor transfer 
points, a dust suppression water system will be used and the transfer points will be enclosed.
Agglomeration
17.2.4 
Preliminary test work indicates an agglomeration stage is necessary. Crushed ore from the secondary 
crushing stage will be conveyed into an inclined drum agglomerator to be mixed with lime and water to 
improve permeability and stability of the ore prior to stacking. Further test work is necessary to determine 
if both lime and cement are required for agglomeration.
Stacking and Heap Leaching
17.2.5 
The leach pad is to be stacked with a radial stacker in a retreat stacking mode starting in the lowest 
corner of the leach pad. Agglomerated ore will be fed onto a fixed overland conveyor. The overland 
conveyor will in turn feed a series of grasshopper conveyors that traverse the leach pad and transport ore 
to the radial stacker. Before ore is placed on the pad for leaching, the leach pad stacking system will be 
utilized to place a protective layer of overliner material on the pad. The covering eliminates the expansion 
and contraction of the synthetic liner and protects the liner from damage that may occur due to the 
movement of equipment and personnel on the leach pad. It also protects the liner from damage that may 
occur due to weather conditions such as sun damage or ripping that can be caused by winds.
Perforated pipe will be placed on the top of the crushed overliner, prior to stacking of ore, to aid the flow 
of pregnant solution to the solution collection ditches. After the entire pad is covered with a crushed 
protective layer and perforated piping, stacking of ore for production will begin. The grasshoppers, or 
portable stacking conveyors, will be placed end to end from the fixed conveyor to the radial stacker. 
Stacking will commence such that the toe of the leach pad is 5 m back from the edges of the initial leach 
pad area.
The barren solution distribution line will run along the lower length of the leach pad (opposite side to the 
overland conveyor). A series of headers with valves will run from the barren line up onto the leach pad. 
The drip emitters will then be connected to the headers and extended across the ore to distribute the 
barren solution for leaching of the precious metals from the ore. As soon as a block of ore is stacked, the 
ore will be placed under leach. Getting ore under leach as quickly as possible is key to maintaining

production in a heap leaching operation. The first block of ore will be stacked to the point where the first 
header comes off the barren line. The second block of ore to be stacked and placed under leach is an 
equal distance from the header in the other direction. The drip emitters are then installed on the header in 
the opposite direction to place the second block of ore under leach.
As the stacking of the ore retreats from the stacking face, back towards the point where the overland 
conveyor reaches the leach pad, the grasshoppers are removed from the conveying system as the 
additional length of conveyors are no longer needed to reach the radial stacker. Once the entire length of 
the pad has been stacked, the grasshopper conveyors are once again extended to the far end of the 
leach pad and a second 'strip' of ore is stacked to the width of the radial stacker. Once again, the headers 
are extended and fresh ore is placed under leach as soon as the block of ore that has been stacked 
reaches the next header.
Once ore has been under leach for the assumed 180 day leach cycle, the irrigation system will be moved 
to a new block of ore for leaching. In this manner, a constant volume of ore will be under leach at one 
time and the optimum solution application rate can be maintained. This stacking and piping sequence is 
continued until the entire leach pad is covered with the first lift of ore. At that time, the grasshopper 
conveyors will again be placed on the pad such that a second lift is started, again in the lower corner of 
the leach pad. Each lift will be 6 m high and be set back from the edges of the previous lifts by 8 m. This 
setback allows a safety berm to catch material that may slough off the lifts placed above this one; it also 
minimizes the risk of spills of cyanide containing solutions, and cyanide soaked ore or spent ore from the 
containment system. A similar stacking and piping sequence will be followed until the entire pad reaches 
its ultimate height.
The leach pad will have a collection ditch along its downgradient toe to convey leachate solution and 
storm runoff flows to the collection ponds. Minimal site grading will be performed at the pad site to 
achieve minimum grades of 1% along the pad width and 0.5% along the pad length.
Solution Application
17.2.6 
The proposed heap leaching circuit is a two stage leach cycle where barren solution is used to irrigate 
both the primary and secondary cells. After leaching, the pregnant solution from the primary cells 
percolates through the ore and is collected in a solution collection pipe. The solution then flows via gravity 
in the pipeline to the pregnant solution pond. Intermediate leach solution from the secondary cell flows via 
gravity back to the barren solution pond where it is reapplied to both the primary and secondary leach 
cells. Cyanide solution to the heap leach area is delivered by a drip irrigation system. Barren solution lost 
to evaporation is replenished with makeup water containing cyanide.
Antiscalant is added to minimize scale formation. If scale formation from evaporation becomes a problem, 
the drip emitters can be buried below the surface of the stacked ore.
Pregnant Solution Pond
17.2.7 
The pregnant solution pond will be constructed near the lowest point of the pad to store leachate solution 
and storm runoff flows from the pad. The pond will have a bottom corner sump and a leak detection 
system between the geomembranes and connected to a corner leak detection sump and well system.
Barren Solution Pond
17.2.8 
The barren solution pond will also be constructed near the lowest point of the pad to store leachate 
solution and storm runoff flows from the pad. The pond will have a bottom corner sump and a leak 
detection system consisting of a geocomposite between the geomembranes and connected to a corner 
leak detection sump and well system.

Page 157
Storm Pond
17.2.9 
The storm pond is sized for a major (24 hour) storm event. The storm pond also increases the capacity of 
the stored solution within the pad area. During storm conditions, all storm water and heap liquor is 
retained in a closed circuit system thus preventing spillage and subsequent solution losses to the 
environment. This pond is provided for emergency containment only; it will not be used under normal 
operating conditions.
The emergency pond is located adjacent to the pregnant solution pond so that it collects excess solution 
from the barren solution pond.
17.2.10  Carbon Adsorption Circuit 
The carbon adsorption circuit is based on a five stage, upflow CIC system. The carbon columns are 
designed for 100% carbon bed expansion. Solution feed to the ADR plant is from the pregnant solution 
pond.
The carbon adsorption circuit consists of a series of five cascading carbon columns. Each column is 
designed to contain four tonnes of activated carbon. Solution enters the circuit at the first carbon column 
and flows counter-current to the flow of carbon. Solution overflows the final column onto the stationary 
carbon safety screen to catch any entrained carbon.
The counter current flow allows the carbon in the first adsorption tank to reach optimum metal loading. 
Design loadings are 3,500 g/t gold, but actual loadings will be a function of the solution grades reporting 
to the ADR circuit. Those grades, in turn, are dependent on the grade of the ore. Two tonnes of loaded 
carbon are advanced per day from the first CIC tank to the acid wash circuit.
The barren solution that discharges from the final carbon column drains to the carbon column surge tank 
via a carbon safety screen. Cyanide, caustic solution and antiscalant are added to the tank as needed. 
From this tank, barren solution is pumped back to the barren solution pond where it will be used to irrigate 
ore on the leach pad.
Loaded carbon is passed over a loaded carbon recovery screen prior to entering the acid wash tank, 
allowing the solution to return to the CIC circuit. To maintain a constant carbon inventory fresh and 
regenerated carbon will be introduced into the CIC circuit via the last carbon column at the same rate the 
loaded carbon is removed.
17.2.11  Carbon Acid Washing 
Loaded carbon screened over the loaded carbon recovery screen gravites into the acid wash tank. A 3% 
w/w hydrochloric acid (“HCl”) solution is circulated through the vessel at a rate of two bed volumes per 
hour for 120 minutes. The solution is circulated through the carbon in the acid wash tank to remove any 
scale (mostly CaCO3) that accumulates on the surface of the carbon. Upon completion of the acid rinse, 
the carbon is allowed to soak in the HCl solution for an additional 60 minutes. After soaking, the spent 
acid and carbon are neutralized with sodium hydroxide (“NaOH”) solution. The spent acid solution is sent 
to the CIC circuit, and the acid washed carbon is pumped to the carbon elution column.
17.2.12  Desorption Circuit 
Zadra elution and electrowinning is used to recover precious metals from the loaded carbon. The 
precious metals are then recovered into a sludge for further processing in the goldroom.
Prior to elution, barren strip solution is heated to approximately 80°C by a single pass through a diesel 
fired indirect solution heater. Once the temperature of 80°C is achieved, enough sodium cyanide and
OJVG Heap Leach PEA Ver 0 24_03_2013.docx

Oromin Joint Venture Group 
Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Heap Leach Potential of the OJVG Golouma Gold Project, Sénégal
Page 158
sodium hydroxide is added to the heated barren solution so that a 1% w/w sodium cyanide and 1% w/w 
sodium hydroxide solution is obtained.
The 80°C barren strip solution is pumped through the solution heater so that the temperature of the 
solution is approximately 115°C prior to entering the elution column. In order to enhance desorption of 
gold from loaded carbon, the loaded carbon is first soaked for 30 minutes in the strip solution. After 
completion of the soak period, the remaining heated barren solution is pumped through the solution 
heater and into the elution column at a flow rate of 2.5 bed volumes per hour. When the discharge 
temperature of the loaded solution leaving the elution column is greater than 80°C, the loaded solution 
passes through a shell and tube heat exchanger so it can preheat the strip solution before it enters the 
solution heater.
Including the pre-soak, a total of 40 bed volumes is passed through the bed of loaded carbon in the 
elution column. During the stripping cycle, the loaded strip solution is continuously circulated from the 
elution column to the electrowinning cell to maximize the recovery of gold. It will take approximately 21 
hours to complete one strip cycle which includes carbon transfers, acid washing, carbon stripping and 
electrowinning. The final stage of elution will include an unheated wash water cycle that will displace the 
last bed volume of loaded strip solution and, in turn, cool off the barren carbon. The loaded strip solution 
is sent to the single electrowinning cell for metal recovery. At the conclusion of the strip cycle, the stripped 
carbon will be pumped to a horizontal rotary kiln for thermal regeneration.
Electrowinning tails solution is returned to the barren strip solution tank via the electrowinning return tank. 
Barren strip solution is periodically bled from the barren strip solution tank to the CIC circuit and replaced 
with fresh solution. This controls impurity levels in the barren strip solution.
17.2.13  Carbon Regeneration 
The carbon regeneration circuit is sized to handle a carbon transfer rate of two tonnes per day, based on 
the assumption that all of the barren carbon is thermally regenerated prior to reuse in the CIC circuit. 
Each batch of barren carbon is transferred to the static sieve bend dewatering screen before entering the 
kiln.
The majority of organic compounds fouling the barren carbon will be removed in this process. Carbon is 
thermally regenerated in the kiln to restore its activity and effectively recover gold from the CIC circuit. At 
the product end of the regeneration kiln, the carbon will be discharged into a carbon quench tank. From 
the quench tank, the regenerated carbon and fresh carbon will be screened and transferred to the carbon 
transfer tank.
Regenerated and fresh carbon is pumped back to the CIC circuit from the carbon transfer tank. All carbon 
is screened prior to reuse in the CIC circuit. The carbon sizing screen is a horizontal vibrating screen 
located on top of the carbon transfer tank. Undersized barren carbon is collected in a barrel and stored for 
possible further use elsewhere or disposed of.
17.2.14  Electrowinning and Refining 
During the elution process, loaded strip solution is pumped continuously to a single electrowinning cell. 
Gold is plated onto the steel wool cathodes in the electrowinning cell.
Each cathode will be moved with an electric hoist to a wash station where the gold bearing sludge will be 
removed using a high pressure hose.

Page 159
Gold bearing sludge produced from the cathodes is washed off and collected in a cathode wash box. It is 
then pumped by an electric sludge diaphragm pump to a plate and frame filter press to remove excess 
water. The filtered cake is collected and sent to an oven for drying.
Dried sludge is mixed with flux and charged into an electric induction furnace for smelting. Gold doré is 
poured out of the tilting furnace and collected in several cascade style moulds. The slag exits the melting 
furnace first and is later displaced by the heavier gold doré. The slag ultimately collects in the slag pot, 
which is placed below the cascading moulds.
17.2.15  Water Services 
Raw water will be pumped from the raw water dam to the raw water tank prior to distribution throughout 
the plant. Raw water will be used for dust suppression in the crusher area, make-up water in the leaching 
circuit, carbon screen wash water, strip solution and acid wash solution make-up, and in the reagent area.
Potable water will be sourced from the reverse osmosis (“RO”) plant included in the FS.
The total raw water consumption will vary depending on whether it is the dry season or wet season.
17.2.16  Reagents 
All applicable safety considerations will be made, including separation of acids and cyanide, provision of 
safety showers and eye wash stations, and designated sump pumps.
Hydrochloric acid will be delivered to site in 200 L drums. The acid will be transferred to the acid wash 
solution tank using an acid resistant pump. Water will be added to the acid wash solution tank in order to 
dilute the acid to a 3% w/w concentration. An acid pump will deliver the dilute acid to the acid wash 
column.
Sodium hydroxide will be delivered to site in 25 kg bags. Sodium hydroxide will be lifted to the sodium 
hydroxide tank, emptied and mixed with raw water. From this tank, it will be pumped to the desorption 
circuit to neutralize the acid wash solution and to make up strip solution. Sodium hydroxide will also be 
added to the barren solution tank, as required, to control the pH in the heap leach solution.
Cyanide will be delivered to site as solid briquettes of sodium cyanide in 1 tonne bulka bags. Cyanide will 
be stored in the dry reagent storage area prior to mixing. Bags will be placed in the cyanide mixing area 
as required and hoisted up to the mixing tank. Raw water will be added to the tank along with cyanide to 
obtain a 20% w/w solution. Cyanide will be pumped from this tank to the carbon column surge tank and 
the elution circuit.
Activated carbon will be delivered in 500 kg bulka bags and will be emptied into the carbon quench tank 
to be mixed with raw water and newly regenerated carbon. The carbon will be fully wetted before it is 
discharged onto the carbon sizing screen and transferred to the fifth CIC tank. The carbon sizing screen 
will remove carbon fines before being transferred to the carbon adsorption circuit.
Hydrated lime will be delivered to site in 20 tonne trucks and transferred to a lime silo for storage. The silo 
will be fitted with a bin vent type dust collector and a lime bin activator to control the particulates 
generated in the system; these will also aid in removing lime from the bin. The lime silo will dispense lime 
onto the screen product conveyor via a screw conveyor for agglomeration of ore and pH control in the 
heap leach circuit.

Recoverability
Total heap leach feed for the 15 years is expected to be approximately  560,000 ounces of gold of which  
390,000 oz are expected to be recoverable at a 70% average blended recovery for oxide (82.5%) and 
fresh material (60.0%).

18  Project Infrastructure
The basis for the heap leach PEA is that the CIL operation would be in operation concurrently with the 
heap leach operation.  Hence the heap leach operation can use the shared facilities as needed and the 
amount of unique infrastructure required for heap leaching is minimized.  A stand-alone heap leach 
operation has not been evaluated.
18.1  Water Distribution
All raw water required for the project, including both CIL and heap leach operations, will be reclaimed 
from a raw water catchment reservoir.
The raw water tank provides capacity for process, gland and firewater requirements.
18.2
Potable Water
Potable water for the heap leach and ADR plant will be sourced from the “RO” plant included in the CIL 
operation. It is assumed that the RO plant can provide potable water for the additional 52 people required 
by the heap leach operation. Potable water will be used around the plant in safety showers and plant 
control rooms.
18.3
Power & Power Distribution
Approximately 4.5 MW installed (or 2.7 MW operating) power is required for the proposed heap leach 
operation. A single 7.45 MW heavy fuel oil (“HFO”) driven generator would be able to supply the heap 
leach and ADR plant.
Electricity is distributed across the complete site via 6.6 kV overhead power lines. Power is not distributed 
to the raw water dam intake pumps due to being 9 km from the power plant. Mobile generators will be 
used for powering this facility.
18.4
Sewage Treatment
Sewage from the heap leach and ADR plant will be trucked to the sewage treatment plant included in the 
Sabodala CIL plant for treatment and disposal. It is assumed that the sewage treatment plant will be sized 
to handle the increased flow.
18.5
Maintenance Facilities
It is assumed that the repair shops and maintenance facilities for the CIL plant included in the project 
Feasibility Study will also be used for the heap leach and ADR plant.
18.6
Laboratory
It was assumed that the CIL plant laboratory included in the CIL operation will be used for the heap leach 
and ADR plant.
18.7
Accommodations & Dining Facilities
The permanent camp facility situated near the CIL process plant site is designed to house 350 personnel, 
with the normal occupancy expected to be 300. For the purpose of the heap leach PEA, it is assumed 
that this camp will house the additional personnel required for the heap leach and ADR plant. This site will 
also serve as the construction camp, complete with housing, cafeteria, and recreation facilities.

A temporary construction camp will be erected to house personnel required for the construction and start-
up period.
18.8
Ancillary Buildings
Ancillary buildings include the reagent storage building and electrical substation buildings.
18.9
Administrative Offices
Administration offices have been included in the CIL operation and are assumed to be capable of 
including the additional 8 administration personnel required.
18.10  Warehouse
It was assumed that the CIL plant warehouse included in the CIL operation will be used for storing the 
heap leach plant spares. Large bulky spares that do not require cover will be stored in the large open air 
storage area.
18.11  Security Fence
The entire heap leach processing plant, including the heap leach pad, will be double fenced with gates 
available for vehicle traffic and maintenance access. The chain link fence, equipped with razor wire is 
intended to keep wild animals and unauthorized personnel out of the plant area.
The gold room within the plant will be fully secured with a screening checkpoint for persons 
entering/exiting the gold room. This location also includes a safe, metal detector, and camera surveillance 
for additional security. The goldroom will contain ablution and kitchen facilities to reduce personnel traffic 
during gold processing.
The perimeter will also have roving security patrols and guard stations to provide an added measure of 
security and loss prevention.
18.12  Communications
A satellite based communications system including telephones and internet will be utilized. Two way 
radios are used for communication within the plant operation.
18.13
In-Plant Roads
The plant roads identified herein are limited to the road surfaces within the boundary limits of the heap 
leach plant operation.
The roads proposed for in-plant access are designed for a maximum travel speed of 25 km/h, and a width 
of 6 metre with a minimum 10 metre  curve centerline. Road base is installed at 0.15 m thick on all in-
plant and main access roads within these limits.
18.14  Site Roads
The Project site roads fall into two categories as summarized in Table 60. All site roads are considered 
private roads and access will be controlled by OJVG.
Haul and operations roads are designed for dual lane traffic. Oversize equipment will however travel on 
the operations roads at times, and under those conditions temporary management protocols will be put in

place allowing the road to be used as single lane traffic. Seasonal access roads are generally considered 
temporary roads and will be constructed as and when required. These roads will only accommodate 
single lane traffic and will only be accessible during the dry season and occasionally during the wet 
season using all-wheel drive vehicles.
Haul roads and operations roads will have safety barriers along any stretch of road where the shoulder 
height is greater than 3 m above the natural ground. The barrier will be half the height of the largest 
vehicle tire that traverses that road. The roads do cross a number of ephemeral stream channels. Large 
diameter metal culverts will be installed at these locations. No permanent bridges are planned.
Roads will, as far as practical, be constructed using cut and fill techniques to achieve design alignment 
and grade. Both haul and operations roads will have a cap of laterite material to facilitate all-season 
trafficability. This material will break down in time, and frequent re-topping will be required. Dust control 
on the roads will be done using water trucks, or possibly chemical suppressants as needed.

19  Market Studies and Contracts
19.1
Marketing Studies
No marketing studies have been completed for the supply and demand of the gold products.
OJVG has not entered into any contracts or agreements with any agency for the sale of gold produced. It 
is expected that OJVG will sell doré directly to a refinery, who will sell the gold to the market after refining.
19.2
Contracts
At present, OJVG does not have any contracts for construction, mining, concentrating, smelting, refining, 
transportation, handling, sales and hedging and forward sales, on the heap leach project.

20  Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or
Community Impact
This section of the report includes information on the following:
  The current environmental permitting and management plan status based on the approved ESIA.
  The proposed heap leach design and additional permitting requirements.
  A summary of the proposed changes and the requirements for permitting of the proposed heap
leach facilities and associated pits and rock stockpiles.
20.1
Current Permitting Status
OJVG received approval for its 2010 Feasibility Study project plan and ESIA through Attestation of 
Conformance, as issued by the Government of Senegal on May 24th, 2012.  The ESIA was prepared to 
be Equator Principle compliant and to meet the requirements of the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC).  The project that was proposed and assessed was first reviewed by the Senegalese Technical 
Review Committee in March 2011, and culminated with blanket approval from all local stakeholders 
during the public audience held at the site in March 2012.  OJVG submitted the final ESIA to the 
government in November 2011 and it passed all three levels of review with only very minor amendments 
being required.  The OJVG ESIA was accepted with no requirement for the relocation of any local 
community housing and with only a minor requirement for relocation of some farmers.  The validity of the 
ESIA will diminish over time as local development occurs and as local communities further develop their 
artisanal mining skills, adapt to the presence of the existing mine operation and as they start the 
conversion to a more cash based economy.
20.2
Existing ESIA Permit
The 2010 Feasibility report and associated ESIA did not include a heap leach facility design and only 
entailed the mining of four deposits (Golouma, Kerekounda, Masato, Kourouloulou); therefore, the ESIA 
approval does not include permission for the heap leach operation.
Under the current Senegalese Environmental legislation, there is no formal mechanism for amending a 
Certificate of Conformance once issued for a particular ESIA for a mine design.  There is, however, a 
“Good Practice Guideline” that requires the proponent to submit in writing a description of the proposed 
changes to DEEC, the Government group responsible for evaluating ESIAs.  DEEC then determines from 
the written submission the course of action they require.  If the changes are significant and fall outside of 
the baseline and assessment in the ESIA, it will likely require further investigation and assessment.
Isolation of OJVG Operations
20.2.1 
The original ESIA for the 2010 Feasibility report was based on locating all OJVG operations in the Falémé 
River catchment, a tributary of the Senegal River, to ensure the environmental effects from the OJVG 
operation would be separate from the effects of the Teranga (formerly MDL) operations.  The Teranga 
operations drain towards the Niokolo Koba National Park and fall into the Gambia River catchment. The 
separation of the two operations was done to ensure the following:
Minimise the potential effects on the National Park by eliminating some of the potential cumulative 
impacts on the physical and biological environment.

Page 166
Allow the effects of mining to be spread across two catchments and to attribute any potential physical 
environmental effects to either of the two mines.  This would reduce the risk to both mining companies if 
there were to be an environmental issue.
Allows water resources to be collected from two different catchments, lowering the potential for effects on 
downstream water users, in an area that is a water deficit area and prone to repeating cycles of drought.
Split the direct loss of agricultural lands across two catchments and the respective villages in each 
catchment.  This meant fewer lands were lost and that each village would be affected only moderately by 
the need for relocation of some agricultural lands.
Extent of Baseline Studies
20.2.2 
Biological and social baseline studies were conducted to include all of the OJVG concession area, the 
Teranga concession area and the immediate surroundings, as the change in land use was likely to have 
effects extending beyond the physical boundaries of the site.  As no physical OJVG infrastructure was to 
be located on the Gambia River side of the catchment divide, only minimal physical environmental data 
was collected on that side of the catchment divide.  This data will need to be acquired to support the 
development of the heap leach pits, overburden stockpiles, heap leach facilities and haul roads.
20.3
The Proposed Heap Leach
20.3.1 
The following elements comprise the proposed heap leach development as shown in Figure 63:
Proposed Pits, Rock Stockpiles and Heap Leach
  Sekoto deposit and associated overburden rock stockpile.
  Mamasato deposit and associated overburden rock stockpile.
  Niakafiri Southwest deposit and associated overburden and rock stockpile, in the area of Maki
Medina Village.
  Niakafiri Southeast deposit and associated overburden and rock stockpile, in the area of Maki
Medina Village.
  Maki Medina deposit and associated overburden and rock stockpile.
  Kobokoto deposit and associated overburden and rock stockpile.
  The heap leach facility and an alternative location for it.
Heap Leach Permitting
20.3.2 
It is anticipated that at least an ESIA Addendum with full public consultation, if not a small separate ESIA, 
will be required for the heap leach facility for the following reasons:
  The proposed heap leach facilities, pits and stockpiles were not included in the original permitted
ESIA and represent a significant addition to the proposed mine development.
  The potential for heap leach system issues due to heavy rainfall in the short rainy season that could
cause loss of containment from the heap leach system and heap slope failures.  During the dry
season, extreme UV exposure and heat may lead to deterioration of the liner systems leading to
potential failure and leakage of the liners.  The risk assessment for the heap leach system will likely
have a significant bearing on the success of permitting.

Page 167
  There is limited surface and ground water data in the proposed areas of development.
  Cultural heritage sites, including archaeology, and sacred or spiritual sites are located beneath some
of the proposed mine footprint areas.
  Farmland is likely to be lost to the proposed heap leach facilities and the associated pits and rock
stockpiles.  This will require compensation and relocation of farmers, on a sustainable basis, to
appropriate nearby land.
  Maki Medina Village is close to the proposed mining areas of the Niakafiri deposits. The local village
will need to be consulted to ensure they agree to the proposed development and to ensure they
have a suitable sustainable future in that area.  In particular rock stockpile alternatives may need to
be developed to test with the local community.  Although the village is near to the proposed pit,
these pits do represent an open water source post mining. The pit water could be used to local
benefit as a source for irrigation, stock watering and aquaculture if the quality is suitable.  This pit
water development opportunity was presented for other pits in the original approved OJVG ESIA.
  There are potential cumulative impacts from operating in the same catchment as the Teranga
operations.

Page 169
Given the extent of the proposed development, the proximity of Maki Medina Village, as well as the 
development of a heap leach facility directly upstream and in close proximity of the Niokolo Koba National 
Park and the important Gambia River, it is anticipated that a moderate amount of work for a small ESIA 
will be required to ensure permitting documentation can be prepared.
Only very limited engineering and site selection analysis has been completed to date for the heap leach 
operation.  The ESIA process will enable the OJVG to review the siting of the heap leach pad, rock 
stockpiles and haul roads in order to examine alternatives and select the optimal locations for each.
20.4
Heap Leach Management Plans
Senegalese Law requires a costed management plan to be prepared as part of the ESIA.  If, as 
anticipated, the heap leach facility will require at least an addendum to the approved OJVG ESIA, then an 
updated risk assessment and management plan will also be required.  The following detailed plans are 
expected to be needed as part of the ESIA addendum or ESIA:
  Heap Leach Risk Assessment that will inform the need for and scope of the following Management
Plans:
–  Spill Contingency Plan.
–  Cyanide Management Plan.
–  Ground Water Management Plan.
–  Surface Water Management Plan.
–  Heap Leach Stability and Operational Management Plan.
–  Cultural Heritage Management Plan.
  Farm Relocation Action Plan.
  Maki Medina Sustainable Development and Safety Plan.
  Resettlement Action Plans for any properties or local structures that may need to be moved for the
proposed heap leach facilities and proposed pits and rock stockpiles.
The following infrastructure developments are likely to be needed if the proposed heap leach facility, 
additional pits and rock stockpiles are developed:
  Rock stockpile and pit sediment control ponds.
  Ground and surface water monitoring stations located at the heap leach pad, pits and rock
stockpiles.
  Heap leach rainfall surge ponds, or other possible control systems, to ensure the intense rainfall
periods can be accommodated.
  Possibly an interception pond further downstream to ensure the Niokolo Koba National Park and the
Gambia River are adequately protected.
  The development of a local meteorological station.

Page 170
20.5
Schedule for Heap Leach Permitting
The process to collect additional baseline data and to prepare the expected reports for government is 
anticipated to take six to eight months.  The Government can be expected to take at least three to six 
months to review, question, and require amendments prior to issuing approvals if they are satisfied with 
the proposed heap leach plans.  The overall process can be expected to take nine to fourteen months.
20.6
Schedule for Sustainable Development and Safety Plan
The consultation for and agreement to the Maki Medina Safety and Sustainable Development Plans can 
be expected to take somewhat longer than the permitting process and should ideally be separated from 
the permitting process by making commitments to appropriate action planning.  The consultation with 
Maki Medina Village and creating a sustainable agricultural future around the village may take several 
years, considering the consultation, agreements, planning, construction and agricultural field development 
that will be required.  By making commitments to do this in accordance with government requirements, 
the permitting process can be facilitated and heap leach activities started based on the operations at pits 
other than the Niakafiri Pits.  If and when ready, the Maki Medina Village can be safeguarded and that pit 
developed along with the development of sustainable outcomes as part of the long-term development 
plan to benefit the community from the anticipated pit water that will be available for use during and post 
mining if the water quality is suitable.
20.7
Summary Conclusions
OJVG has a comprehensive and approved ESIA for the site that was based on extensive baseline work, 
assessment and development of thorough management and monitoring plans, but these do not include 
any of the proposed pits, rock stockpiles or heap leach facilities.  Senegal does not have a formal 
mechanism for amending the Certificate of Conformance issued for the ESIA, but an ESIA addendum or 
a new ESIA for the proposed heap leach operations, pits and rock stockpiles is likely to be required.  A 
written submission to DEEC detailing the proposed changes will be needed to determine what their 
requirements will be.  At a minimum, a document in the form of an ESIA addendum along with updated 
cumulative impact assessment, management and monitoring plans, and risk assessment for the various 
proposed mine components will likely be required.  The formal written notification to DEEC can be 
prepared with ease, based on the thoroughness of the existing ESIA.  The additional consultation, ground 
water and surface water investigation, risk assessment and management plan work will take at least six 
to eight months of work. The overall process to obtain approvals can be expected to take nine to fourteen 
months, if the government accepts commitments to run a separate process for developing a Sustainable 
Development and Safety Plan with local farmers and the Maki Medina Village.
Special attention and action will be required for the sites with cultural heritage value that will be 
encroached upon near to Maki Medina Village and other affected areas that may be revealed through 
further investigation.  An approved approach in the original OJVG ESIA exists for the sites of cultural 
importance and this would likely be the same for the sites affected by the proposed heap leach 
development. In addition, a Sustainable Development and Safety Plan for farmers and the Maki Medina 
Village will be required, and this can be expected to take several years for implementation, if an agreed 
solution can be found.  The good relations that exist with both the communities and the government, as 
well as already having an ESIA where this approach to sustainable development using pit water is 
approved, suggests a solution to mine development in close proximity to Maki Medina is likely to be found 
through consultation. OJVG intends to continue exploration efforts on the property.  Any new deposits 
ultimately brought into production will be required to undergo similar amendments.

21  Capital and Operating Costs
Capital Cost Estimate
21.1.1 
The capital costs estimated for the heap leach project are derived from the engineering work and costs 
developed in the 2011 PEA study.  Since there are no changes in the capacity and design of the heap 
leach processing plant since that initial study, the capital costs are simply escalated from 2011 to 2013.
Capital Cost Summary
21.1.2 
A total life-of-mine capital cost of $ 69 M is anticipated for the Heap Leach Project as summarized in. 
Table 61.  The initial capital is approximately $54 million while on-going capital expenditures are $15.1 
million.  The capital cost estimate includes commissioning and a contingency allowance. These capital 
costs are incremental to the costs for constructing the CIL project and do not represent what a standalone 
heap leach operation would cost.  For example, the water reservoir construction cost is part of the CIL 
project cost but would be required even with a standalone heap leach operation.
The 2011 PEA cost was escalated by 6% per year over 2 years to develop the 2013 capital cost.  This 
escalation rate is comparable to the escalation rates seen after updating the 2013 CIL plant feasibility 
study from the 2010 CIL feasibility study.

Basis of Estimate
21.1.3 
The capital cost estimate covers the design and construction of the heap leach and ADR plant together 
with certain on-site and off-site infrastructure.
The estimate has a base date of first quarter 2013 (“Q1-2013”) and is reported in United States dollars 
(“$”). The capital cost has been estimated to an expected accuracy of ±35%.
A contingency of 25% for the pre-production years and sustaining capital have been included.
No exchange rates were used in developing the CAPEX.

Page 172
Accuracy Provisions
21.1.4 
In the 2011 PEA, each element of the cost estimate was developed at bare cost. A design growth factor 
was then allocated to each discipline of the direct cost to reflect the level of definition. Such accuracy 
provisions are an integral part of the capital cost estimate, and cannot be divorced from it.
The purpose of the accuracy provisions is to make allowance for uncertain elements of costs to cover 
such factors as:
  Limited information on site conditions, especially concerning sub-surface conditions and the
engineering properties of excavated materials;
  Accuracy of quantity take-offs and estimate assembly and consolidation based on the level of
engineering and design undertaken at study level;
  Accuracy of materials and labour rates (excluding extreme variations that would be covered under
contingency);
  Accuracy of productivity expectations;
  Accuracy of equipment pricing.
The sum of the estimated Bare Cost and Accuracy Provisions is the estimated Total Direct Cost for the 
project.  The capital costs in the 2011 PEA were estimated by benchmarking plants in the Ausenco 
database at that time.
Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of the total direct costs.
The estimate includes a 25% contingency applied to the total capital cost.
21.1.5  Mine Capital Cost Estimate 
No capital cost for the open pit mining has been included, as it has been assumed that the cost of the 
mining fleet and minimal site development will be borne by the contractor, including primary production 
equipment, support equipment, spare parts, and access construction.
Pre-stripping requirements and clearing and grubbing of the various pit areas and waste dumps were 
assumed to be undertaken by the mining contractor and have not been included in the open pit CAPEX.
Process Plant Capital Cost Estimate
21.1.6 
The total capital cost for the process plant was estimated as $54M; the costs are summarised in Table 
62.  Indirect costs, including contingency, have been provided in the estimate.

The EPCM Contractor’s site office facilities (including HSE office, site ablutions and temporary security 
gatehouse) are included in the temporary construction facilities costs for 12 months. These building-hire 
costs include furniture hire. An allowance was made for cleaning, general maintenance, first aid supply, 
site construction signs, miscellaneous stores equipment and two shipping containers for initial secure 
storage.
The entire site office area is fenced, with a hardstand area for vehicle parking (including sufficient area for 
contract supplied offices and crib facilities).
The temporary construction facilities costs include the costs of a heavy-lift crane. This will be used for 
mechanical equipment installation and structural steel erection and are additional installation equipment 
costs that are not included in the mechanical installation labour rate.
The temporary construction facilities costs include a miscellaneous scaffolding allowance for the 
Mechanical Installation Contractor, as these are additional installation equipment costs that are not 
included in the mechanical installation gang rate.
First Fills and Spares
In most cases, equipment suppliers will supply required first fill lubricants with the supplied equipment. 
The cost of first fills and spares was estimated as $100,000.

Other Costs
Other Indirect Costs include:
  $5.0M was allowed for on-site infrastructure (power station) to cover the cost for additional
generators;
  An allowance for piping to the sewage treatment plant;
  $100,000 was allowed for a mobile firewater pump on a mobile trailer;
  An allowance of $370,000 for temporary accommodations and facilities was based off the
allowances provided in the benchmark plant capital cost estimates.
21.2
Operating Cost Estimate
The operating costs are based on updated mining costs from the 2013 CIL Feasibility Study and 
escalating the heap leach processing costs from the 2011 Heap Leach PEA.
21.3
Operating Cost Summary
The overall heap leach operating cost averages around $12.72 per tonne processed. A summary of the 
overall operating costs is provided in Table 63.  The import tax will take effect 2 years into production so 
costs have been presented with and without the import tax.  All costs have been developed in US Dollars. 
These operating costs are incremental to the costs for the CIL project and do not represent what a 
standalone heap leach operation would cost.
The mining operating costs were estimating by adding 20% for contracting charges to the CIL Feasibility 
Study open pit mining operating cost. The result was a mining operating cost of $1.78/t and $2.38/t for 
Oxide and Sulphide material respectively.
The process plant operating costs were developed from labour, reagents and consumables, power, 
maintenance supplies, and miscellaneous costs for both oxide and sulphide feeds.

Structure and Basis of Estimate
21.3.1 
All costs are presented in first quarter 2013 US Dollars and have an expected accuracy of ±35%. The 
operating cost estimate (OPEX) was divided into the following cost categories:
  Mine operating cost estimate
  Plant operating cost estimate
  G&A operating cost estimate

Page 177
21.3.2 
The plant and G&A costs were estimated by Ausenco, and the mining cost estimated by SRK.
Estimating Method
The operating costs were developed based on the following criteria:
  National shift labour will assume positions in the crushing plant, heap leach area and ADR plant.
Shift boss, plant superintendent and senior metallurgist will be expatriates.
  The plant and G&A labour rates were estimated from the FS. It is assumed that some personnel
from the CIL plant will be able to work in both the CIL and the heap leach plant. An additional 52
people will be required for the plant: 44 for the heap leach and ADR plant, and 8 G&A staff.
  Reagent unit costs were taken from the FS, or estimated from other projects where necessary.
Reagent consumption rates were developed from available testwork, literature, or from other
Ausenco projects.

  Maintenance supplies for plant equipment are based on 4.5% of installed mechanical equipment
costs. A factor of 4.0% was used to estimate maintenance supplies for piping, electrical, and
instrumentation.
  Miscellaneous costs, such as training and safety equipment, were estimated by benchmarking from
the Ausenco project database. There is a fuel allowance for one light vehicle, one heavy vehicle and
one front end loader.
21.3.3 
The operating cost estimate excludes:
Exclusions
  Escalation;
  Contingency;
  Sustaining capital (included in the capital cost);
  Foreign currency exchange rates;
  Valued Added Tax (“VAT”) or Import Duty are not included in the estimate, the Import duty (included
in the financial model);
  Project financing or interest charges;
  Ongoing exploration costs;
  Rehabilitation costs;
  Land tenure and tenement fees;
  All costs associated with areas beyond the Project battery limits;
  Transportation and treatment costs of doré bars to refinery.

21.3.4  Open Pit Mining Operating Cost Estimate  
The open pit mining activities for the Project were assumed to be undertaken by a mining contractor as 
the basis for this preliminary study.
The unit rates used in the economic analysis are $1.78 per tonne of oxide material mined and $2.38 per 
tonne of sulphide material.
An additional haulage surcharge cost of $0.12/t-km was applied to all heap leach tonnage delivered 
beyond a distance of 2km from the heap leach site.
For material delivered from the Masato deposit, no mining cost are incurred since it is assumed the low 
grade material would be treated like waste rock, mined and stockpiled, at the Masato mine site.  So this 
material only needs to be hauled to the heap leach site, a distance of about 0.7 km away.
Heap Leach Plant Operating Costs Estimate
21.3.5 
The operating costs for the process plant are based on the estimated direct costs for processing a 
nominal annual throughput of 2.0 Mt of ROM ore. The crushing and stacking plant operates for 16 hours 
per day with an expected availability of 90%. Solution application and the ADR plant have an expected 
availability of 90%. The overall plant operating costs were estimated to be $6.18 per tonne for oxide and 
$6.73 per tonne for sulphide.
These process operating costs are estimated by escalating the 2011 PEA operating costs by 11.5% per 
year for two years.
21.3.6  General and Administrative Operating Costs  
The G&A operating costs are those cost centre expenses that are not directly linked to the mining and 
process disciplines; they include G&A labour and overhead costs.
The estimate incremental G&A cost for the heap leach operation is estimates at $0.11/tonne.  This cost 
was escalated from the 2011 PEA.

22  Economic Analysis
The economic analysis for the heap leach project is at a preliminary assessment level.   Operating costs 
are applied as unit rates per tonne mined and processed and a simplified tax calculation is utilized. 
Variable gold prices have been modelled to assess the sensitivity of the economics.
22.1
Assumptions
The following assumptions were used in this report and are based on the Senegalese mining convention.
Rights and Royalties
  A mining royalty of 3% net smelter return to the Government of Senegal.
Tax and Custom Exemptions
  Exemption from export tax throughout exploitation.
  A tax exemption period ending January 2018; Any further extension of the tax exemption period
must be negotiated.
  Duties and Import Tax at 15% after tax exemption period.
Corporate Income Tax
  A corporate tax exemption period ending January 2018.
  The corporate taxation rate is 30%.
Depletion and Depreciation Allowance

In the economic flow model, depreciation has been used for all capital items, and will therefore
include all direct capital, owner’s costs, indirect costs, etc.
  The General Tax Code defines the depreciation rates according to the type of capital equipment as
summarized below. A simplified depreciation rate of 15% was used in the economic and un-used
depreciation is carried forward.
Government Participation
  The Government of Senegal will have a 10% direct ownership interest in the project however for the
purpose of this analysis which examines the economics on a project basis, government participation
is omitted.
22.2
Methodology
Three cash flow analyses were compiled based on three different gold prices. For each of these cases 
the gold price was held fixed throughout the heap leach project life. The gold prices used are:
  $1,350/oz gold
  $1,550/oz gold
  $1,750/oz gold
  Common assumptions to all three cases include:
  The production schedule is based on pits designed using a $1,250/oz gold price.
  5% discount rate for net present value (“NPV”) calculation.
  A tax exemption period ending January 2018.

  100% equity financing.
  15% import duty following the tax free period applied to 80% of operating costs.
  30% corporate income tax following the tax free period.
  A 15% diminishing balance depreciation/depletion rate was applied to all capital expenses, including
process plant, on and off site infrastructure, and sustaining capital.
  Depreciation were accumulated and carried forward until they could be utilized.
  3% royalty on payable gold.
  100% payable gold with a $7.00/oz offsite cost.
  The financial analysis is beginning in 2015, as Year -1 (construction year).
  Commercial plant production begins 2016, as Year +1.
22.3

Teranga Sabodala
The Sabodala Gold Mine is owned 90% by Teranga Gold Corporation (Teranga) through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Sabodala Gold Operations SA (SGO) and 10% by the Government of the Republic of Sénégal 
and operates under Sabodala Gold Operations SA (SGO). The OJVG Project lies adjacent to the 
Teranga property on the east and south and part of the west as well. The Teranga concession is 33 km2 
in size and has a mineral resource estimate of 2.8 million ounces (Moz) of Measured and Indicated gold 
resources plus 1 Moz of inferred gold resources and has a mineral reserve estimate of 1.54 Moz of gold.
The $330 million (estimate) Teranga Sabodala Gold project began commercial production in March 2009. 
Teranga produced 172 thousand ounces (“Koz”) of gold in 2011 and expects to produce 130 Koz of gold 
in 2012. The CIL cyanidation plant has a capacity of greater than 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) and 
underwent an expansion to 4 Mtpa in 2011.
Teranga’s regional ground position comprises a Mining Concession and eleven Exploration Permits in 
various joint ventures, totaling approximately 1,533 km2 (Table 67). Over 75% of the landholdings lie 
within a 35 km radius of Teranga’s Sabodala mining operation.

With its gold plant operating at Sabodala, Teranga is refocusing on its regional and mine lease 
exploration programs and plans to spend $40 million to end of 2012 on major RAB, RC and diamond drill 
campaigns on both the mine lease and regional portfolio. Teranga spent US$43M on exploration in 2011.
Sabodala Mine Lease
Teranga, in 2012, plans to spend US$ 20 million for exploration on the Mine Lease, investigating up to ten 
targets. This work includes additional drilling to further evaluate the Main Flat Extension and the Lower 
Flat Zone; the two main faults controlling mineralization in the mine. They also plan to drill test the 
structural corridor that hosts the Mine along trend to the north, the Sambaya Hill target at the junction of 
the Niakafiri Shear Zone and the Main Flat fault, the extension of the Masato deposit on Teranga ground, 
and the Niakafiri and Soukhoto extension areas.

Regional Exploration
Through 2010, only early stage exploration including soil geochemical sampling, termite mound sampling, 
airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys, mapping, trenching, RAB drilling and some RC and core were 
completed.
Teranga spent US$31 million in 2011 completing 86,000 m RC, 29,000 m core and 151,000 m of RAB 
drilling. Twenty-eight drill targets were tested, fourteen by RC or core and fifteen by RAB and trenching. 
They plan to spend US$20 million on regional exploration in 2012, testing 36 exploration targets.
Bransan 
The property covers an area of 261 km2 and is situated immediately adjacent to the OJVG northeast 
boundary. Bransan is owned by a joint venture between SMC (70%) and private Sénégalese interests 
(30%). They completed 23,000 m of RAB drilling in 2011, following up on the results from the soil 
geochemical sampling program. Several anomalous areas were identified. The Diadiako structure with 
alteration, brecciation and quartz veining was identified and a 1 km long section was drill tested at 200 m 
to 400 m intervals. An inferred mineral resource of 0.12 Moz of gold grading 1.27 g/t Au is estimated at 
Diadiako.
Dembala Berola 
The property covers an area of 244 km2 and is situated to the east of the Bransan concession near the 
Mali border and is 100% owned by SMC. Regional soil sampling and structural interpretation defined 
eight prospective areas within a 2 km wide structural trend on the eastern boundary of the Main 
Transcurrent Shear. The centrally located Dembala Hill mineralization is hosted in felsic porphyry and 
dolerite with widths up to 74 m and grades to 6 g/t Au. The Tourokhoto area, located west of Dembala 
Hills, is a 5 km by 1 km gold anomaly defined in termite sampling. It was tested by 1,006 RAB holes, 
totaling 23,416 m. Preliminary results were positive and additional RC drilling is planned to further 
evaluate the area during 2012. No mineral resource estimate has been stated for this concession.
Massakounda 
The property covers an area of 186 km2 and is situated approximately 5 km to the north of the boundary 
of the Bransan concession and is 100% owned by Teranga. During 2011, a RAB and RC drilling program 
tested the Massakounda structural target and gold anomalies. No mineral resource estimate has been 
stated for the Massakounda concession.
Makana
The Makana project is a joint venture between New African Petroleum Company, SARL (NAFPEC) and 
SMC. The Makana concession is located immediately to the southwest of the OJVG property. It is 125 
km2 in size and covers a 5 km strike length of the structural trend that passes through the OJVG 
concession and hosts the Sabodala gold deposit. The concession hosts the Majiva target; one of several 
prospects defined by soil geochemistry and IP geophysics. A drill program to evaluate several of the 
targets is proposed for 2012. An inferred mineral resource of 0.04 Moz of gold grading 1.5 g/t Au is 
estimated at Majiva
Sounkounkou
AXMIN Inc. (AXMIN) holds 100% interest in the Sounkounkou, Sabodala NW and Heremakono 
exploration concessions. AXMIN entered into a joint venture agreement with Teranga whereby Teranga 
may earn 80% interest in the property. Teranga earned their 80% interest by spending US$ 6 million on 
exploration by May 2011. AXMIN can retain its 20% interest by participating in further expenditures on a 
pro rata basis or be reduced to a 1.5% production royalty.

The Gora deposit is located within the Sounkounkou concession, 22 km northeast of the mine. It was first 
evaluated during early 2010, with a systematic RC drilling. This work delineated two sub-parallel, shallow, 
southeast dipping, gold bearing quartz veins separated by 1 m to 20 m of country-rock sediments. Vein 
one averages 8.8 g/t Au and a width of 2.5 m. Vein two averages 3g/t Au and a width of 2.7 m. An 
extensive gradient array IP geophysical survey was completed in 2011 and it has outlined several 
anomalies including a possible 700 m extension of the Gora vein system and several sub-parallel 
anomalies.
Teranga completed 237 RC and Core holes, totaling 39,878 m. This 2011 follow-up drill program 
commenced in early January and had three main goals. Goal one was the lateral resource extension 
along strike to the north and south; now tested by 40 RC and core holes (6,278 m) and open to 
expansion. Goal two was a resource definition by completing the initial systematic 40 m x 40 m drill grid in 
the central portions of the prospect. Goal three was to explore at depth and test for wider zones of 
mineralization where the vein system is projected to intersect a number of intrusive rocks in the 
southeast. The Gora zone has now been drill tested to a depth of 130 m. The Gora deposit has  
Measured and Indicated gold resources of 0.22 million ounces (Moz) grading 5.22g/t Au and a mineral 
reserve estimate of 0.16 Moz of gold grading 3.64g/t Au.
Termite sampling at the Diegoun area of the Sonkounkou concession, located west of Gora has outlined 
a 7 km by 4 km gold anomaly. Three priority areas were identified in the anomaly for further work. Drilling 
at Diegoun North identified a 4.5 km northeast trending mineralized structure. Follow-up drilling is planned 
for 2012.
Sabodala Northwest
The Sabodala NW concession is located adjacent to the west of the OJVG property. Several north-south 
trending anomalies were identified at Toumboumba by a 1,150-hole RAB drill program totaling 49,000 m. 
Forty-nine RC holes tested fifteen of the eighteen trends. Additional drilling is planned for 2012.
23.2
Randgold Resources Ltd.
Randgold Resources Ltd. (Randgold) holds the exploration rights for the Miko, Tomboronkoto and 
Kanoumba concessions, located southwest and southeast respectively, of the OJVG property. Several 
anomalous gold zones have been discovered by soil sampling, trenching, and drilling programs including 
Sofia, Bambaraya, Delya and the Bakan corridor. These targets were evaluated in 2011. Randgold 
delineated an indicated gold resource of 3.18 Moz gold grading 2.56 g/t Au at the Massawa deposit, 
located in the centre of the newly combined Kanoumba permit, about 10 km due south from the OJVG 
concession boundary. The ore body at Massawa is known to be refractory and may require sulphide 
concentration and pressure oxidation prior to CIL gold recovery. The ore is abnormally hard and will 
require significant power to process, so alternate power sources are being investigated.

The CIL process plant and associated service facilities was designed to process run of mine (“ROM”) ore 
delivered to the primary crusher, to produce doré bars and tailings. The process encompasses crushing 
and grinding of the ROM ore, carbon in leach (CIL) cyanidation and adsorption, carbon stripping, electro-
winning and smelting to produce gold bars that are then shipped to a refinery for further processing. The 
CIL tailings will be thickened before placement in the tailings management facility (TMF) to conserve 
water.
The key criteria selected for the plant design are:
  Treatment of an average 4711 dry metric tonnes per day (t/d) for 365 days per year, after allowance
for availability whilst treating 100% primary hard (un-weathered) ore;
  Treatment of an average 7669 t/d for 365 days per year, after allowance for availability whilst
treating weak weathered ore, or a blend of weak and hard ore containing no more that 43% hard
ore;
  Design availability of 91.3%, being 7,998 operating hours per year, with standby equipment in critical
areas,
  Sufficient plant design flexibility for treatment of all ore types as per test work completed at design
throughput.
Economic analysis was undertaken using standard Discounted Cash Flow modelling using an annual 
period and a discount rate of 5%. Modelling was undertaken in Real Q1 2103 USD. The summary results 
of the modelling are shown in Table 69.

Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Heap Leach Potential of the OJVG Golouma Gold Project, Sénégal
Page 189
To date, four of the fourteen OJVG deposits, encompassing Masato, Golouma (West, South, and 
Northwest), Kerekounda, and Kourouloulou represent a significant open pit and underground reserve. 
According to the assumptions of the 2013 FS, the four deposits are estimated to be economic to exploit 
via a combination of open pit and underground methods. SRK considers the exploration potential at the 
project to be very good with the potential to increase resources through expanding current deposits at 
depth, better defining known exploration targets and drilling new anomalies.

25  Interpretation and Conclusions
Industry standard mining and economic evaluation practices have been used to assess the heap leach 
project. The conclusion is that there is adequate geological and resource potential to justify further study 
of the heap leaching aspect of the OJVG Sabodala project in Senegal.
As with almost all mining ventures, there are a large number of risks and opportunities that can affect the 
outcome of the heap leach project. Most of these risks and opportunities are linked to the limited scientific 
information (test results, drill results, etc.) or the lack of control over external drivers (metal price, 
exchange rates, etc.).
Subsequent higher-level engineering studies will need to further refine these risks and opportunities, 
identify new ones and define mitigation or opportunity implementation plans.
Opportunities
The most significant opportunities that should be investigated are listed below to improve the heap leach 
project’s financial results.
  Conversion of inferred resources to higher classifications.
  Discovering new mineral resources and mineral reserves.
  Expansion of existing deposits both laterally and vertically.
  Examine the economics of increasing the heap leach throughput rate from 2 Mt/y up to a range of 4-
5 Mt/yr.
Risks
As with almost all mining ventures, there are risks and opportunities that can affect the outcome of the 
heap leach project. The major risk areas identified in this study are:
  Lack of control over external drivers such as gold price and exchange rates.
  Metallurgical characteristics of all the deposits yet to be tested.

26  Recommendations
The following recommendations are based on the review of the work done to date.
26.1
Resources
  Continue exploration of the heap leach deposits to increase both Inferred and Indicated resources.
  Undertake some infill drilling to convert inferred resource to measured and indicated.
  Continue exploration on newer discoveries to increase overall heap leach resource.
26.2
Site Selection
Preliminary heap leach pad sites have been identified and need to be screened in detail and ranked to 
identify the optimal site. The aspects of the screening process would include heap leach pad, ADR plant, 
and waste impoundment sites, housing and social structure sites, and finally mine and road access sites. 
Once completed, environmental studies and the feasibility study can be initiated.
26.3
Metallurgical Test Work
Metallurgical test work carried out to date is sufficient to support the conceptual level design and costing 
and indicated whether the heap leach operation has potential viability.   Further test work will be required 
on all of the deposits in order to progress to the Feasibility Study level. For a detailed Feasibility Study, 
crushing and leaching variability test work across the various deposits will be required to allow 
development of detailed models of plant throughput and grade/recovery that take into account variations 
in competency, mineralogy and head grade.
Recommended additional work identified as include the following:
  Bulk materials handling test work to optimise design of the stockpile, ROM bin, agglomeration and
stacking facilities;
  Crush size optimisation test work on the major ore types;
  Agglomeration test work to support the requirement of cement and/or lime addition;
  Additional reagent, leaching and ADR flow sheet testing to reduce costs and improve metallurgy;
  Test work to confirm adsorption rates and adsorption process selection;
  Confirmation of geotechnical conditions for engineering design purposes in the leach pad and plant
locations.
26.4
Environmental Work
Further environmental work required includes:
  An environmental assessment is required for the heap leach operation;
  There will be a need for public consultation;
  There may be a need for compensation for people displaced by the proposed development.

26.5
Conclusions
It is recommended that the heap leach project is advanced to the feasibility level once the necessary 
indicated resources and metallurgical testwork has been completed.
To progress to a full feasibility study mechanical equipment costs will need to be acquired from suppliers. 
The process, and hence mechanical equipment, must first be confirmed by further test work and 
engineering.
The feasibility level work should combine the technical aspects of CIL and heap leach projects to optimize 
the split of ore types between plants to maximize the combined net present value.
The size of the heap leach resource potential is such that a significant increase in the throughput rate 
from the currently assumed 2 Mt up to 4-5 Mt/year is likely warranted.
