<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided by </i>the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided also</i> by article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to 
which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his 
nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>its resolution 7/10 as well as all previous resolutions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights on the issue of human rights and the arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the right of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, renunciation or 
loss of nationality in accordance with international law, and noting that the issue of statelessness 
is already under consideration by the General Assembly within the broad issue of State 
succession, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the provisions of international human rights instruments and international 
instruments on statelessness and nationality prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of nationality,

and Political Rights; articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; articles 1 to 3 
of the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women; article 9 of the Convention on the

<p><i> Recalling </i>that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by international 
human rights and refugee law as well as instruments on statelessness, including, with respect to 
States parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated 
and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal 
manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 63/148 of 18 December 2008, in which, inter alia, 
the Assembly urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to 
continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and reducing 
statelessness and protecting stateless persons, </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the important work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees in seeking to address and prevent the problem of statelessness, as guided by, in 
particular, the conclusion of its Executive Committee on the identification, prevention and 
reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 
3 December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms 
and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations because of nationality, 
ethnicity, race, religion or language, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolutions 55/153 of 12 December 2000 and 59/34 of

accordance with Council resolution 7/10<b>1</b> and the contributions made to it by States and other 
stakeholders,

belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the independent expert on minority 
issues on the subject of the right to nationality,<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern </i>at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of persons of 
their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness and, in this regard, expressing concern at various forms of discrimination against 
stateless persons that violate the obligations of States under international human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose nationality 
may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms </i>that the right to a nationality of every human person is a fundamental 
human right; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes </i>that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on discriminatory 
grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status, is a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their nationality on 
grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and legislation render a person 
stateless; 
</p>
<p>

<p> 3
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Urges </i>all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with fundamental principles of international law, in particular 
by preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>States that have not acceded to the Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons to consider doing so; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Notes </i>that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of an 
individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be affected 
by poverty, social exclusion and legal incapacity;

continue to collect information on the issue of human rights and arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality from all relevant sources and to take account of such information, together with any 
recommendations thereon, in their reports and activities conducted within their respective 
mandates; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the right to nationality, with 
emphasis on the issue of arbitrary deprivation of nationality, including in cases of States 
succession, taking into account the information gathered pursuant to Council resolution 7/10, 
similar studies conducted by the Subcommission for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights and other relevant sources of information, and to present it to the Council at its thirteenth 
session;

same agenda item.
