Description of the nature of operations and main activities
Our products are mainly derived from mineral deposits found in northern Chile. We mine and process caliche ore and brine deposits. The caliche
ore in northern Chile contains the only known nitrate and iodine deposits in the world and is the world’s largest commercially exploited source of
natural nitrates. The brine deposits of the Salar de Atacama, a salt-encrusted depression within the Atacama desert in northern Chile, contain high
concentrations of lithium and potassium as well as significant concentrations of sulfate and boron.

Note 1 – Identification and Activities of the Company and Subsidiaries (continued)
1.4 Description of the nature of operations and main activities, continued
From our caliche ore deposits, we produce a wide range of nitrate-based products used for specialty plant nutrients and industrial applications, as
well as iodine and iodine derivatives. At the Salar de Atacama, we extract brines rich in potassium, lithium, sulfate and boron in order to produce
potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, lithium solutions, boric acid and bischofite (magnesium chloride). We produce lithium carbonate and
lithium hydroxide at our plant near the city of Antofagasta, Chile, from the solutions brought from the Salar de Atacama. We market all of these
products through an established worldwide distribution network.
We sell our products in over 100 countries worldwide through our global distribution network and generate our revenue mainly from abroad.
Our products are divided into six categories: specialty plant nutrition, iodine and its derivatives, lithium and its derivatives, industrial chemicals,
potassium and other products and services, described as follows:
Specialty plant nutrients: This business is characterized by being closely related to its customers for which it has specialized staff who provide
expert advisory in best practices for fertilization according to each type of crop, soil and climate. Within this type of business, potassium
derivative products and specially potassium nitrate have had a leading role given the contribution they make to develop crops insuring an
improvement in post-crop life in addition to improving quality, flavor and fruit color. The potassium nitrate, which is sold in multiple formats and as
a part of other specialty mixtures, is complemented by sodium nitrate, potassium sodium nitrate, and more than 200 fertilizing mixtures.
Iodine: The Company is a major producer of iodine at worldwide level. Iodine is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry, technology and
nutrition. Additionally, iodine is used as X ray contrast media and polarizing film for LCD displays.
Lithium: the Company’s lithium is mainly used for manufacturing rechargeable batteries for cell phones, cameras and notebooks. Through the
manufacturing of lithium-based products, SQM provides significant materials to face great challenges such as the efficient use of energy and raw
materials. Lithium is not only used for rechargeable batteries and in new technologies for vehicles propelled by electricity, but is also used in
industrial applications to lower melting temperature and to help saving costs and energy

Note 1–Identification and Activities of the Company and Subsidiaries (continued)
1.4Description of the nature of operations and main activities, continued
Industrial Chemicals: Industrial chemicals are products used as supplies for a number of production processes. SQM participates in this line of
business during more than 30 years producing sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, boric acid and potassium chloride. Industrial nitrates have
increased their importance over the last few years due to their use as storage means for thermal energy at solar energy plants, which are widely
used in countries as Spain and the United States in their search for decreasing CO2 emissions
Potassium: The potassium is a primary essential macro-nutrient, and even though does not form part of the plant’s structure, has a significant role
for the developing of its basic functions, validating the quality of a crop, increasing post-crop life, improving the crop flavor, its amount in vitamins
and its physical appearance. Within this business line, SQM has also potassium chlorate and potassium sulfate, both extracted from the salt layer
located under the Salar de Atacama (the Atacama Saltpeter Deposit.)
Other products and services: This business line includes revenue from commodities, services, interests, royalties and dividends.

2.5Basis of consolidation
(a)Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all those entities on which Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. has the control to lead the financial and operating policies,
which, in general, is accompanied by participation greater than half the voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date in which control
is transferred to the Company and are excluded from consolidation on the date in which this control ceases to exist. Subsidiaries apply the same
accounting policies that its Parent.
In order to recognize the acquisition of an investment, the Company uses the acquisition method. Under this method, the acquisition cost is the
fair value of assets delivered, of equity instruments issued and of liabilities incurred or assumed at the exchange date plus costs directly
attributable to acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and identifiable liabilities and contingencies assumed in a business combination are
initially stated at their fair value at the acquisition date. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interests in the
acquiree at fair value or as a proportional part of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets.

2.7Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The information contained in these consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of the Company’s management, who expressly indicate
that they have applied all the principles and criteria included in IFRS, issued by the IASB.
In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, judgments and estimates have been made by management to quantify certain assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments recorded and or disclosed therein. Basically, these estimates refer to the following:
- The useful lives of tangible and intangible assets and their residual values.
- Impairment evaluations of certain assets, including trade receivables.
-Assumptions used for the actuarial calculation of commitments for employee pensions and staff severance indemnities.
- Provisions for commitments assumed with third parties and contingent liabilities.
Inventory provisions based on technical studies which cover the different variables affecting products in stock (density. humidity. among others) and
-
allowances on slow-moving spare parts in inventory.
- Future costs for the closure of mining facilities.
-The determination of the fair value of certain financial and non-financial assets and derivative instruments.
- The determination and allocation of fair values in business combinations.
Although these estimates have been made considering information available as of the date of preparation of these consolidated financial
statements, it is possible that events that may occur in the future could make their modification necessary in future years. Changes would be
recorded prospectively, recognizing the effects of the change in estimates in the respective future consolidated financial statements.

Note 3 -Significant accounting policies
3.1Classification of balances as current and non-current
In the attached consolidated statement of financial position, balances are classified in consideration of their remaining recovery (maturity) dates;
i.e., those maturing on a date equal to or lower than twelve months are classified as current and those with maturity dates exceeding the
aforementioned period are classified as non-current.
The exception to the foregoing relates to deferred taxes, which are classified as non-current, regardless of the maturity they have.
3.2Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s interim consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (“U.S. dollars” or “US$”), which is the Company’s
functional and presentation currency and is the currency of the main economic environment in which it operates.
Consequently, the term foreign currency is defined as any currency other than U.S. dollar.
The interim consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of United States dollars without decimals.
3.3Foreign currency translation
(a)Domestic entities:
Assets and liabilities denominated in Chilean pesos and other currencies other than the functional currency (U.S. dollar) as of March 31, 2013 and
December 31, 2012 have been translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at those dates. The corresponding Chilean pesos were
converted at Ch$472.03 per US$1.00 as of March 31, 2013, and Ch$479.96 per US$1.00 as of December 31, 2012.
The values of the UF (a Chilean peso-denominated, inflation-indexed monetary unit) used to convert the UF denominated assets and liabilities as
of March 31, 2013 amounted to Ch$22,869.38 (US$48.45), and as of December 31, 2012 amounted to Ch$22,840.75 (US$47.59).

(c)
Transactions an d balances
Non-monetary transaction balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency (U.S. dollar) are translated using the exchange
rate in force for the functional currency at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at
the exchange rate of the functional currency prevailing at the closing date of the consolidated statement of financial position. All differences are
taken to the statement of income with the exception of all monetary items that provide an effective hedge for a net investment in a foreign
operation. These items are recognized in other comprehensive income upon the disposal of the investment, at which time they are recognized in
the statement of income. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other
comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the
initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the
fair value is determined.
(d)
Group entities
The profit or loss, assets and liabilities of all those entities with a functional currency other than the presentation currency are translated to the
presentation currency as follows:
-Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing date exchange rate as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial position.
- Revenue and expenses in each profit or loss account are translated at average exchange rates.
-All resulting foreign currency exchange differences are recognized as a component separate in the foreign currency translation difference reserve
In consolidation, foreign currency exchange differences which arise from the conversion of a net investment in foreign entities are taken to net
equity (other reserves). At the disposal date, these exchange differences are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as part of the
loss or gain from the sale.

3.4
Subsidiaries
SQM S.A. establishes as basis the control exercised on subsidiaries to determine interest on these in the consolidated financial statements. The
control consists of in the Company’s ability to exercise power over the investee; exposure or rights, to validate returns for the involvement from
involvement with the investee; and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies for the entire Group, the consolidation of a
subsidiary starts when the Company has control over such subsidiary and stops being included in consolidation when such control is lost.
The reporting dates of the subsidiaries and policies are similar for equivalent transactions and events under similar circumstances.
3.5
Consolidated statement of cash flows
Cash equivalents relate to short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are subject to low risk
of change in value, and expire in less than three months from the date of acquisition of the instrument.
For the purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise the balance of cash and cash equivalents as
defined previously.
The statement of cash flows includes cash movements performed during the year, determined using the indirect method.
3.6
Financial assets
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at the time of initial recognition, on the basis of the business model for the
management of financial assets and the characteristics of contractual cash flows from the financial assets. As provided by IFRS 9, the Company
and measure their financial assets initially at fair value plus transaction costs incurred and which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the
underlying financial asset- Subsequently financial assets are measured at amortized cost or fair value.

3.6
Financial assets, continued
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of assets is deemed to be impaired if and only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset or group of assets. For the recognition o fan impairment loss, the loss event
should have an impact on the estimate of future flows of the asset or group of financial assets.
3.7
Financial liabilities
The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at the time of initial recognition. As provided by IFRS 9, the Company and
measure their financial liabilities initially at fair value less transaction costs incurred and which are directly attributable to the issuance of the
financial liability. Subsequently, financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
3.8
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
The management will irrevocably determine at initial recognition, the designation of a financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss if
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an incoherence in the measurement or recognition, which would otherwise arise from the
measurement of assets and liabilities or the recognition of gains and losses from such assets or liabilities on different bases.
3.9
Financial instrument offsetting
The Company offsets an asset and liability if and only if it currently has the legally enforceable right to set off amounts recognized and intends
either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Reclassification of financial instruments
At the time where the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets, it will reclassify the financial assets affected by the new
business model.
For financial liabilities these could not be reclassified.
3.11
Derivative and hedging financial instruments
Derivatives are recognized initially at fair value as of the date in which the derivatives contract is signed and subsequently they are valued at fair
value. The method for recognizing the resulting loss or gain depends on whether the derivative has been designated as an accounting hedge
instrument and if so, it depends on the type of hedging, which may be as follows:
(a)    Fair value hedge of assets and liabilities recognized (fair value hedges);
(b)    Hedging of a single risk associated with an asset or liability recognized or a highly possible foreseen transaction (cash flow hedge);
At the beginning of the transaction, the Company documents the relationship existing between hedging instruments and those items hedged, as
well as their objectives for risk management purposes and the strategy to conduct different hedging operations.
The Company also documents its evaluation both at the beginning and the end of each period of whether derivatives used in hedging
transactions are highly effective to offset changes in the fair value or in cash flows of hedged items.
The fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes is shown in Note 10.3 (hedging assets and liabilities). Changes in the cash flow
hedge reserve are classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining expiration period of the hedged item is higher than 12 months and
as a current asset or liability if the remaining expiration period of the entry is lower than 12 months.
Investing derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability, and the change in their fair value is recognized directly in profit or loss.

3.11Derivative and hedging financial instruments, continued
(a)Fair value hedge
The change in the fair value of a derivative is recognized with a debit or credit to profit or loss, as applicable. The change in the fair value of the
hedged entry attributable to hedged risk is recognized as part of the carrying value of the hedged entry and is also recognized with a debit or
credit to profit or loss.
For fair value hedges related to items recorded at amortized cost, the adjustment of the fair value is amortized against profit or loss during the
period through maturity. Any adjustment to the carrying value of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective rate is used is amortized
with a debit or credit to profit or loss at its fair value attributable to the risk being covered.
If the hedged entry is derecognized, the fair value not amortized is immediately recognized with a debit or credit to profit or loss.
(b)Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of gains or losses from the hedge instrument is initially recognized with a debit or credit to other comprehensive income,
whereas any ineffective portion is immediately recognized with a debit or credit to profit or loss, as applicable.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, as when the hedged interest income or
expense is recognized when a projected sale occurs. When the hedged entry is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, amounts taken to
other reserves are transferred to the initial carrying value of the non-financial asset or liability.
Should the expected firm transaction or commitment no longer be expected to occur, the amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred
to profit or loss. If a hedge instrument expires, is sold, finished, and exercised without any replacement, or if a rollover is performed or if its
designation as hedging is revoked, the amounts previously recognized in other reserves are maintained in equity until the expected firm
transaction or commitment occurs.

3.22Derecognition of financial instruments
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset are transferred; and the control of the financial assets has not been retained.
The Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations or a part of these are discharged, paying to the creditor or the
main liability contained has been legally extinguished.
3.23
Derivative financial instruments
The Company maintains derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure in foreign currency. Derivative financial instruments are
recognized initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognized when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in fair
value of such derivatives are recognized in profit or loss as part of gains and losses.
The Company permanently assesses the existence of embedded derivatives both in its contracts and financial instruments. As of March 31, 2013
and 2012, there are no embedded derivatives.
3.24
Fair value measurements
At the initial recognition, the Company measures its assets and liabilities at fair value plus or minus transaction costs incurred that are directly
attributable to the acquisition of a financial asset or issuance of a financial liability.
3.25
(a)Lease - Finance lease
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases when the Company holds substantially all the risks and rewards derived from the ownership of the asset.
Finance leases are capitalized at the beginning of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of minimum lease
payments.

Note 3 -Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.15Lease, continued
Each lease payment is distributed between the liability and the interest expenses to obtain ongoing interest on the pending balance of the debt.
The respective lease obligations, net of interest expense, are included in other non-current liabilities. The interest element of finance cost is
debited in the consolidated statement of income during the lease period so that a regular ongoing interest rate is obtained on the remaining
balance of the liability for each year. The asset acquired through a finance lease is subject to depreciation over the lower of its useful life or the life
of the agreement.
(b)Lease – Operating lease
Leases in which the lesser maintains a significant part of the risks and rewards derived from the ownership are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments (net of any incentive received from the lesser) are debited to the statement of income or capitalized (as applicable) on a
straight-line basis over the lease period.
3.16
Deferred acquisition costs from insurance contracts
Acquisition costs from insurance contracts are classified as prepayments and correspond to insurance contracts in force, recognized using the
straight-line method and on an accrual basis, and are recognized under Other non-financial assets.
These are expensed considering the proportional period of time they cover, regardless of the related payment dates.
3.17
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables relate to non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments and are not quoted in any active
market. These arise from sales operations involving the products and/or services which the Company commercializes directly to its customers
These assets are initially recognized at their fair value (which is equivalent to their face value, discounting implicit interest for installment sales)
and subsequently at amortized cost according to the effective interest rate method less a provision for impairment loss. An allowance for
impairment loss is established for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all the amounts
which are owed to it according to the original terms of receivables.
Implicit interest in installment sales is recognized as interest income when interest is accrued over the term of the operation.

3.18Inventory measurement
The Company states inventories for the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost price of finished products and products in progress
includes direct costs of materials and; as applicable, labor costs, indirect costs incurred to transform raw materials into finished products and
general expenses incurred in carrying inventories to their current location and conditions. The method used to determine the cost of inventories
is weighted average cost.
The net realizable value represents the estimate of the sales price less all finishing estimated costs and costs which will be incurred in
commercialization, sales and distribution processes.
Commercial discounts, rebates obtained and other similar entries are deducted in the determination of the acquisition price.
The Company conducts an evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories at the end of each year recording an estimate with a charge to
income when these are overstated. When the circumstances, which previously caused the rebate ceased to exist, or when there is clear evidence
of an increase in the net realizable value due to a change in the economic circumstances or prices of main raw materials, the estimate made
previously is modified.
The valuation of obsolete, impaired or slow-moving products relates to their net estimated net realizable value.
Provisions on the Company's inventories have been made based on a technical study which covers the different variables which affect products
in stock (density, humidity, among others.)
Raw materials, supplies and materials are recorded at the lower of acquisition cost or market value. Acquisition cost is calculated according to the
annual average price method.

Note 3 - Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.19Investments in associates and joint ventures
Interests in companies in which control is exercised together with another company (joint ventures) or in which the Company has significant
influence (associated companies) are recorded using the equity method. Significant influence is assumed to exist when the Company has interest
exceeding 20% of the investee's equity.
Under this method, the investment is recognized in the consolidated classified statement of financial position at cost plus changes subsequent to
the acquisition in an amount proportional to the net associated company’s equity using the ownership interest in the associate. The associated
goodwill is included at the carrying value of the investee, and it is not subject to amortization. The debit or credit to profit or loss reflects the
proportional amount in the associated companies’ results for the reporting period.
Unrealized profit on transactions with associates and subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation of the ownership percentage that the Company
has on these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of loss from impairment of the assets
transferred.
Changes in equity of the associates are recognized proportionally with a debit or credit to “Other reserves” and classified according to their
origin.
The associated companies and the Company’s reporting dates and policies are similar for equivalent transactions and events under similar
circumstances.
In the event that significant influence is lost or the investment is sold or is available-for-sale, the equity value method is discontinued, suspending
the recognition of proportional income.
If the resulting amount according to the equity method is negative, the Company’s equity interest is reduced to zero in the consolidated financial
statements, unless the Company has a contractual commitment to resolve the equity position. In this case, the respective provision for risks and
expenses is recorded.
Dividends received in these companies are recorded by reducing the equity value and proportional profit or loss recognized in conformity with
their interest, and are included in the consolidated statement of income under the caption “Equity in income (losses) of associates and joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method”.

3.20Transactions with non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity separate from equity attributable to the
owners of the Parent.
3.21Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are part of the Company’s normal operations within its scope of business activities.
Conditions for such transactions are those normally effective for those types of operations in regard to terms and market prices. Also, these
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Expiration conditions for each case vary by virtue of the originating transaction.
3.22Property, plant and equipment
Tangible property, plant and equipment assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of the related accumulated depreciation, amortization and
impairment losses that they might have experienced.
In addition to the price paid for the acquisition of tangible property, plant and equipment, the Company has considered the following concepts as
part of the acquisition cost, as applicable:
1.      Accrued interest expenses during the construction period which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
qualifying assets, which are those that require a substantial period prior to being ready for use. The interest rate used is that related to the
project’s specific financing or, should this not exist, the average financing rate of the investor company. The amount capitalized for this concept is
ThUS$4,602 as of March 31, 2013 and ThUS$14,156 as of December 31, 2012.

2.     The future costs that the Company will have to experience related to the closure of its facilities at the end of their useful life are included at the
present value of disbursements expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Construction-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment in operation once the assets are available for use and the related
depreciation and amortization begins on that date.
Extension, modernization or improvement costs that represent an increase in productivity, ability or efficiency or an extension of the useful lives
of property, plant and equipment are capitalized as a higher cost of the related assets. All the remaining maintenance, preservation and repair
expenses are charged to expense as incurred.
The replacement of full assets which increase the asset’s useful life or its economic capacity, are recorded as a higher value of property, plant and
equipment with the related derecognition of replaced or renewed elements.
Based on the impairment analysis conducted by the Company’s management it has been considered that the carrying value of assets does not
exceed the net recoverable value of such assets.
Gains or losses which are generated from the sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized as income (or loss) in the period
and calculated as the difference between the asset’s sales value and its net carrying value.
The Company maintains property rights and mining concessions from the Chilean State Government. Property rights are usually obtained without
any initial cost (other than the payment of mining licenses and minor registration expenses) and when rights are obtained on these concessions,
the Company retains them while it pays the related annual license fees. Such license fees, which are paid annually, are recorded as prepaid
expenses and amortized over the following twelve-month period. Amounts attributable to mining concessions acquired from third parties, which
are not from the Chilean State, are recorded at their acquisition cost in property, plant and equipment.
Costs derived from daily maintenance of property, plant and equipment are recognized when incurred.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated through the straight-line distribution of cost over the estimated technical useful life of the asset
which is the period in which the Company expects to use the asset. When components of one item of property, plant and equipment have different
useful lives, they are recorded as separate assets. Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis.

3.24Intangible assets
Intangible assets mainly relate to goodwill acquired, water rights, trademarks, and rights of way related to electric lines, development expenses,
and computer software licenses.
(a)      Goodwill acquired
Goodwill acquired represents the excess in acquisition cost on the fair value of the Company's ownership of the net identifiable assets of the
subsidiary on the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired related to acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in goodwill, which is subject to impairment
tests every time consolidated financial statements are issued and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses related
to the sale of an entity include the carrying value of goodwill related to the entity sold.

3.24Intangible assets, continued
This intangible asset is assigned to cash-generating units with the purpose of testing impairment losses. It is allocated based on cash-generating
units expected to obtain benefits from the business combination from which the aforementioned goodwill acquired arose.
3.25Intangible assets other than goodwill
(a)
Water rights
Water rights acquired by the Company relate to water from natural sources and are recorded at acquisition cost. Given that these assets represent
legal rights granted to the Company for a given period, these are amortized during its useful life.
(b)
Right of way for electric lines
As required for the operation of industrial plants, the Company has paid rights of way in order to install wires for the different electric lines in third
party land. These rights are presented under Intangible assets. Amounts paid are capitalized at the date of the agreement and charged to income
according to the life of the right of way.
(c)
Computer software
Licenses for IT programs acquired are capitalized based on costs that have been incurred to acquire them and prepare them to use the specific
program. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Expenses related to the development or maintenance of IT programs are recognized as an expense as and when incurred. Costs directly related
to the production of unique and identifiable IT programs controlled by the Group and which probably will generate economic benefits that are
higher than costs during more than a year, are recognized as intangible assets. Direct costs include expenses incurred for employees who
develop IT programs and an adequate percentage of general expenses.
The costs of development for IT programs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
No impairment of intangible assets exists as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

3.26Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses are expensed in the period in which the disbursement is made, with the exception of property, plant and
equipment acquired for use in research and development, which are recognized in the accounting under the respective item within property, plant
and equipment.
3.27Prospecting expenses
Those prospecting expenses associated with mineral reserves being exploited are included under Inventory and amortized according to the
estimated mineral content reserves. Prospecting expenses associated with future mineral reserves are presented under other non-financial
assets as and when minerals included in the future reserve have caliche ore-grade, which makes the mining property economically
commercializable.
Those expenses incurred on mining properties in which the product has a low caliche ore-grade that is not economically commercializable, are
directly charged to profit or loss.
3.28Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets subject to depreciation and amortization are subject to impairment testing, provided that an event or change in the circumstances
indicates that the amounts in the accounting records may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the book value
of the asset over its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher between the fair value of an asset or cash generating unit (“CGU”) less costs of sales and its
value in use, and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate any cash inflows that are clearly independent from
other assets or groups of assets.
When the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered an impaired asset and is reduced to its net
recoverable amount.
In evaluating value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate before taxes which reflects current market evaluation
on the time value of money and specific asset risks.
An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less selling costs. These calculations are confirmed by valuation multiples,
quoted share prices for subsidiaries quoted publicly or other available fair value indicators.

3.28Impairment of non-financial assets, continued
Impairment losses from continuing operations are recognized with a debit to profit or loss in the categories of expenses associated with the
impaired asset function, except for properties reevaluated previously where the revaluation was taken to equity. In this case impairment is also
recognized with a debit to equity up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company is unaware of any indication of impairment with regard to its assets.
For assets other than acquired goodwill, an annual evaluation is conducted of whether there is impairment loss indicators recognized previously
that might have already ceased to exist or decreased. The recoverable amount is estimated if such indicators exist. An impairment loss previously
recognized is reversed only if there have been changes in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount from the last time in which
an impairment loss was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. This increased
amount cannot exceed the carrying value that would have been determined net of depreciation if an asset impairment loss would have not been
recognized in prior years. This reversal is recognized with a credit to profit or loss unless an asset is recorded at the revalued amount. Should this
be the case, the reversal is treated as an increase in revaluation
3.29Minimum dividend
As required by the Shareholders’ Corporations Act, unless decided otherwise by the unanimous vote by the shareholders of subscribed and paid
shares, a public company must distribute dividends as agreed by the shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting held each year with a
minimum of 30% of its profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, except when the Company records unabsorbed losses from prior years.
3.30Earnings per share
The net basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary owners of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The Company has not conducted any type of operation of potential dilutive effect that assumes diluted earnings per share other than the basic
earnings per share.

3.31Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are measured at fair value plus all costs associated with the transaction. Subsequently, these are carried at amortized
cost using the effective interest rate method.
3.32Interest-bearing borrowings
At initial recognition interest-bearing borrowings are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest rate method. Amortized cost is calculated considering any premium or discount from the acquisition and includes costs of
transactions which are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
These are recorded as non-current when their expiration period exceeds twelve months and as current when the term is lower than such term.
Interest expense is calculated in the year in which they are accrued following a financial criterion.
3.33Other provisions
Provisions are recognized when:
- The Company has a present obligation as the result of a past event.
-It is more likely than not that certain resources must be used, including benefits, to settle the obligation.
- A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
In the event that the provision or a portion of it is reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset solely if there is certainty of
income.
In the consolidated statement of income, the expense for any provision is presented net of any reimbursement.
Should the effect of the time value of money be significant, provisions are discounted using a discount rate before taxes that reflects the liability’s
specific risks. When a discount rate is used, the increase in the provision over time is recognized as a finance cost.

3.33Other provisions, continued
The Company’s policy is maintaining provisions to cover risks and expenses based on a better estimate to deal with possible or certain and
quantifiable responsibilities from current litigation, compensations or obligations, pending expenses for which the amount has not yet been
determined, collaterals and other similar guarantees for which the Company is responsible. These are recorded at the time the responsibility or
the obligation that determines the compensation or payment is generated.
The Company determines and recognizes the cost related to employee vacation on an accrual basis.
3.11 Obligations related to employee termination benefits and pension commitments
Obligations with the Company’s employees are in accordance with that established in the collective bargaining agreements in force formalized
through collective employment agreements and individual employment contracts, except for the United States that is regulated in accordance
with employment plans in force up to 2002.
These obligations are valued using actuarial calculations, according to the projected unit credit method which considers such assumptions as
the mortality rate, employee turnover, interest rates, retirement dates, effects related to increases in employees’ salaries, as well as the effects on
variations in services derived from variations in the inflation rate.
Actuarial losses and gains that may be generated by variations in previously defined obligations are directly recorded in profit or loss for the year.
Actuarial losses and gains have their origin in departures between the estimate and the actual behavior of actuarial assumptions or in the
reformulation of established actuarial assumptions.
The discount rate used by the Company for calculating the obligation was 6% for the periods ended March 13, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
The Company’s subsidiary SQM North America has established pension plans for its retired employees that are calculated by measuring the
projected obligation using a net salary progressive rate net of adjustments for inflation, mortality and turnover assumptions, deducting the
resulting amounts at present value using a 6.5% interest rate for 2012 and 2011. The net balance of this obligation is presented under the non-
current provisions for employee benefits.

channel and the price at which products are sold and there is no obligation pending compliance that could affect the acceptance of products by
the customer. The delivery does not occur until products have been shipped to the customer or confirmed as received by customers when the
related risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer and the customer has accepted products in accordance with the
conditions established in the sale, the acceptance period has ended or there is objective evidence that those criteria required for acceptance have
been met.
Sales are recognized in consideration of the price set in the sales agreement, net of volume discounts and estimated returns at the date of the

3.38Income tax and deferred taxes
Corporate income tax for the year is determined as the sum of current taxes from the different consolidated companies.
Current taxes are based on the application of the various types of taxes attributable to taxable income for the year.
Differences between the book value of assets and liabilities and their tax basis generate the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are
calculated using the tax rates expected to be applicable when the assets and liabilities are realized.
In conformity with current Chilean tax regulations, the provision for corporate income tax and taxes on mining activity is recognized on an accrual
basis, presenting the net balances of accumulated monthly tax provisional payments for the fiscal period and associated credits. The balances of
these accounts are presented in current income taxes recoverable or current taxes payable, as applicable.
Tax on companies and variations in deferred tax assets or liabilities that are not the result of business combinations are recorded in statement of
income accounts or equity accounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, considering the origin of the gains or losses which have
generated them.
At each reporting period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets has been reviewed and reduced to the extent there will not be sufficient
taxable income to allow the recovery of all or a portion of the deferred tax assets. Likewise, as of the date of the consolidated financial statements,
deferred tax assets that are not recognized were evaluated and not recognized as it was not more likely than not that future taxable income will
allow for recovery of the deferred tax asset.
With respect to deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and interest in joint
ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized solely provided that it is more likely than not that the temporary differences will be reversed in the
near future and that there will be taxable income with which they may be used.
The deferred income tax related to entries directly recognized in equity is recognized with an effect on equity and not with an effect on profit or
loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally receivable right of offsetting tax assets against tax liabilities and the deferred tax is
related to the same tax entity and authority.

3.39Segment reporting
IFRS 8 requires that companies adopt a “management approach” to disclose information on the operations generated by its operating segments.
In general, this is the information that management uses internally for the evaluation of segment performance and making the decision on how to
allocate resources for this purpose.
An operating segment is a group of assets and operations responsible for providing products or services subject to risks and performance
different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is responsible for providing products or services in a given economic
environment subject to risks and performance different from those of other segments that operate in other economic environments.
For assets and liabilities the allocation to each segment is not possible given that these are associated with more than one segment, except for
depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets, which are directly allocated to the applicable segments, in accordance with the criteria
established in the costing process for product inventories.
The following operating segments have been identified by the Company:
-Specialty plant nutrients
-Industrial chemicals
-Iodine and derivatives
-Lithium and derivatives
-Potassium
-Other products and services
3.40Environment
In general, the Company follows the criteria of considering amounts used in environmental protection and improvement as environmental
expenses. However, the cost of facilities, machinery and equipment used for the same purpose are considered property, plant and equipment, as
the case may be.

Note 4 - Financial risk management
4.1Financial risk management policy
The Financial Risk Management Policy of the Company is oriented towards safeguarding the stability and sustainability of Sociedad Química y
Minera de Chile S.A. and Subsidiaries in relation to all such relevant financial uncertainty components.
The operations of the Company are subject to certain financial risk factors that may affect the financial position or results of the same. Among
these risks, the most relevant are market risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, bad debt risk, and interest rate risk
There may be additional risks that are currently unknown to us or other known risks but that we currently believe are not significant, which could
also affect the commercial operations, the business, the financial position or the results of the Company.
The financial risk management structure includes identifying, determining, analyzing, quantifying, measuring and controlling these events. The
Management, in particular the Finance Management, is responsible for constantly assessing the financial risk. The Company uses derivatives to
cover a significant portion of these risks.

Note 4 - Financial risk management (continued)
4.2Risk factors
4.2.1Market risk
Market risks are those uncertainties associated with fluctuations in market variables that affect the assets and liabilities of the Company, such as:
a)
Country risk: The economic position of the countries where the Company has a presence may affect its financial position. For example, the sales carried
out in emerging markets expose SQM to risks related to economic conditions and trends in those countries. On the other hand, inventories may also be
affected by the economic situation of these countries and/ or the global economy, amongst other probable economic impacts.
b)
Price volatility risk: The prices of the products of the Company are affected by the fluctuations of international prices of fertilizers and chemical products and
changes in productive capacities or market demand, all of which might affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operational results.
c)
Commodity Price risk: The Company is exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials and energy which may have an impact on its production costs,
thus giving rise to instability in the results.
Currently, the Company has a direct annual expense close to US$130 million on account of petrol, gas and equivalents and close to US$ 60
million on account of electricity. Variations of 10% in the prices of energy the Company required to operate, may involve in the short-term
movements in costs of approximately US$19 million.
4.2.2Doubtful accounts risk
A contraction of the global economy and the potentially negative effects in the financial position of our clients may extend the receivables
collection time for SQM, increasing the bad debt exposure. While measures have been taken in order to minimize risk, the global economy may
trigger losses that might have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position or the results of the Company’s operations.
To mitigate these risks, SQM actively controls debt collection and uses measures such as, loan insurance, letters of credit, and prepayments with
regard to a portion of receivables.

Note 4 - Financial risk management (continued)
4.2.3Currency risk
As a result of the influence in the price determination, of its relationship with sales costs and since a significant part of the business of the
Company is carried out in that foreign currency, the functional currency of SQM is the United States dollar. However, the global business activities
of the Company expose the same to the foreign exchange fluctuations of several currencies with respect to the US dollar. Therefore, SQM has
hedge contracts to mitigate the exposure generated by its main mismatches (assets net of liabilities) in currencies other than the US dollar against
the foreign exchange fluctuation. Those contracts are periodically up-dated depending upon the mismatch amount to be covered in these
currencies. Occasionally and subject to the Board of Directors’ approval, the Company insures cash flows from certain specific items in currency
other tan U.S. dollar at short-term.
A significant portion of the costs of the Company, particularly payroll, is related to the Chilean peso. Therefore, an increase or decrease in the
exchange rate against the dollar would affect the net income of SQM. Approximately US$ 440 million cost of the Company are related to the
Chilean peso. A significant part of the effect of such obligations in the statement of financial position is covered by operations of derivative
instruments that hedge the mismatch of balance in this currency.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had derivative instruments classified as hedging currency and interest rate associated with all the
obligations denominated bonds both in Chilean pesos and UF, with a fair value of US$ 100.6 million. As of March 2013, this value amounts to US$
65.5 million, both in favor of SQM.
As of March 31, 2013, the Chilean peso to US dollar Exchange rate was Ch$ 472.03 per US$1.00, and as of December 31, 2012 it was Ch$ 479.96
per US$ 1.00.

Note 4 - Financial risk management (continued)
4.2.4Interest rate risk
Interest rate fluctuations, due to the uncertain future behavior of markets, may have a material impact on the financial results of the Company.
The Company has short and long-term debts valued at LIBOR plus a spread. The Company is partially exposed to fluctuations of said rate, as
SQM currently holds hedging derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its liabilities subject to the LIBOR rate fluctuations.
As of March 31, 2013, approximately 21% of the Company’s financial obligations are valued at LIBOR; therefore significant increases in the rate
may impact its financial position. A 100 base point variation in this rate may trigger variations in the financial expenses close to US$ 3.1 million.
Notwithstanding, this effect is significantly counterbalanced by the returns of the Company’s investments that also relate to LIBOR.
In addition, as of March 31, 2013, the Company's financial debt is mainly in the long-term, with 11% with maturities of less than 12 months which
decreases the exposure to changes in the interest rates.

Note 4 - Financial risk management (continued)
4.2.5Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is related to the fund requirements to comply with payment obligations. The object of the Company is to keep financial flexibility by
comfortably balancing the fund requirements and the flows from the regular business conduct, bank loans, public bonds, short term investments,
and negotiable instruments, amongst other.
The company has an important capital expense program which is subject to change over time.
On the other hand, world financial markets go through contraction and expansion periods that are not foreseeable in the long-term and may affect
SQM’s access to financial resources. These factors may have a material adverse impact on the business, financial position, and results of
operations of the Company.
SQM constantly monitors that its obligations and investments match, taking care as part of its financial risk management strategy of the
obligations and investments maturities from a conservative perspective. As of March 31, 2013, the Company had non-committed and available
bank credit lines for working capital for a total of approximately US$ 530 million.
The position in other cash and cash equivalents so generated by the Company is invested in highly liquid mutual funds which have an AAA risk
rating.
4.3Risk measurement
The Company has methods to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of financial risk hedging strategies, both prospectively and
retrospectively. Those methods are consistent with the risk management profile of the Group.

As provided in the Company’s by-laws, no shareholder can concentrate more than 32% of the Company’s voting right shares and therefore there
is no controlling entity.
6.3 Joint arrangements of controlling interest
Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Calichera S.A., Potasios de Chile S.A., and Inversiones Global Mining (Chile) Limitada, collectively the Pampa
Group, are the owners of a number of shares that are equivalent to 31.91% as of March 31, 2013 of the current total amount of shares issued,
subscribed and fully-paid of the Company. In addition, Kowa Company Ltd., Inversiones La Esperanza (Chile) Limitada, Kochi S.A. and La
Esperanza Delaware Corporation, collectively the Kowa Group, are the owners of a number of shares equivalent to 2.08% of the total amount of
issued, subscribed and fully-paid shares of SQM S.A.
The Pampa Group and the Kowa Group have informed SQM S.A., the Chilean SVS and the relevant stock exchanges in Chile and abroad that they
are not and have never been related parties between them. In addition, this is regardless of the fact that both Groups on December 21, 2006 have
entered into a Joint Action Agreement (JAA) related to those shares. Consequently, the Pampa Group, by itself, does not concentrate more than
32% of the voting right capital of SQM S.A., and the Kowa Group does not concentrate by itself more than 32% of the voting right capital of SQM
S.A.
Likewise, the Joint Action Agreement has not transformed the Pampa and Kowa Groups into related parties between them. The Joint Action
Agreement has only transformed the current controller of SQM S.A., composed of the Pampa Group, and the Kowa Group into related parties of
SQM S.A.

Note 9 - Related party disclosures
9.1

trade and other receivables due from related parties or trade and other payables due to related parties. For the period ended March 31, 2013, the
Company has not recorded any impairment in accounts receivable related to amounts owed by related parties. This evaluation is conducted every
year through an examination of the financial position of the related party in the market in which it operates.
9.2
Relationships between the parent and the entity
According to the Company’s by-laws, no shareholder can own more than 32% of the Company’s voting right shares.
Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Calichera S.A., Potasios de Chile S.A., and Global Mining Investments (Chile) S.A., collectively the Pampa Group,
are the owners of a number of shares that are equivalent to 31.91% as of March 31, 2013 of the current total amount of shares issued, subscribed
and fully-paid of the Company. In addition, Kowa Company Ltd., Inversiones La Esperanza (Chile) Limitada, Kochi S.A. and La Esperanza
Delaware Corporation, collectively the Kowa Group, are the owners of a number of shares equivalent to 2.08% of the total amount of shares of
SQM S.A. issued, subscribed and fully-paid.
The Pampa Group and the Kowa Group have informed SQM S.A., the Chilean SVS and the relevant stock exchanges in Chile and abroad that they
are not and have never been related parties between them. In addition, this is regardless of the fact that both Groups on December 21, 2006 have
entered into a Joint Action Agreement (JAA) related to those shares. Consequently, the Pampa Group, by itself, does not concentrate more than
32% of the voting right capital of SQM S.A., and the Kowa Group does not concentrate by itself more than 32% of the voting right capital of SQM
S.A.
Likewise, the Joint Action Agreement has not transformed the Pampa and Kowa Groups into related parties between them. The Joint Action
Agreement has only transformed the current controller of SQM S.A., composed of the Pampa Group, and the Kowa Group into related parties of
SQM S.A.

The Company uses cross currency swap derivative instruments to hedge the possible financial risk associated with the volatility of the exchange
rate associated with Chilean pesos and UF. The objective is to hedge the exchange rate financial risks associated with bonds payable. Hedges are
documented and tested to measure their effectiveness.
Based on a comparison of critical terms, hedging is highly effective, given that the hedged amount is consistent with obligations maintained for
bonds denominated in Chilean pesos and UF. Likewise, hedging contracts are denominated in the same currencies and have the same expiration
dates of bond principal and interest payments.
Hedge Accounting
The Company classifies derivative instruments as hedging that may include derivative or embedded derivatives either as fair value hedge
derivative instruments, cash flow hedge derivative instruments, or hedge derivative instruments for net investment in a business abroad.
a) Fair value hedge
Changes in fair values of derivative instruments classified as fair value hedge derivative instruments are accounted for in gains and losses
immediately along with any change in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the risk being hedged.
The Company documents the relationship between hedge instruments and the hedged item along with the objectives of its risk management and
strategy to carry out different hedging transactions. In addition, upon commencement of the period hedged and then on a quarterly basis the
Company documents whether hedge instruments have been efficient and met the objective of hedging market fluctuations for the purpose of
which we use the effectiveness test. A hedge instrument is deemed effective if the effectiveness test result is between 80 to 120%.
The hedge instruments are classified as effective or not effective on the basis of the effectiveness test results. As of to date, hedges are classified
as effective on the basis of the effectiveness tests. This note includes the detail of fair values of derivatives classified as hedging instruments.

Although inputs represent Management's best estimate, they are subjective and involve significant estimates related to the current economic and
market conditions, as well as risk features.
Methodologies and assumptions used depend on the risk terms and characteristics of instruments and include the following as a summary:
- Cash equivalent approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
- Other current financial liabilities are considered at fair value equal to their carrying values.
For interest-bearing liabilities with original maturity of more than a year, fair values are calculated at discounting contractual cash flows at their original
-
current market with similar terms.
-For forward and swap contracts, fair value is determined using quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.

Note 15 Employee benefits (continued)
15.2Policies on defined benefit plan
This policy is applied to all benefits received for services provided by the Company's employees.
Short-term benefits for active employees are represented by salaries, social welfare benefits, paid time-off, sickness leaves and other leaves, profit
sharing and incentives and non-monetary benefits; e.g., healthcare service, housing, subsidized or free goods or services. These will be paid in a
term which does not exceed twelve months.
The Company only provides compensation and benefits to active employees, with the exemption of SQM North America which applies the
definitions under 15.4 below.
For each incentive bonus delivered to the Company’s employees, there will be a disbursement in the first quarter of the following year and this will
be calculated based on Profit for the period at the end of each period applying a factor obtained subsequent to the employee appraisal process.
Employee benefits include retention bonuses for the Company’s executives, which are linked to the Company’s share price and it is paid in cash.
The short-term portion is presented as provision for current employee benefits and the long-term portion as non-current.
The bonus provided to the Company’s directors is calculated based on Profit for the period at each year-end and will consider the application of a
percentage factor.
The benefit related to vacations (short-term benefits to employees, current), which is provided in the Labor Code which indicates that employees
with more than a year of service will be entitled to annual holidays for a period not lower than fifteen paid business days. The Company provides
the benefit of two additional vacation days.
Staff severance indemnities are agreed and payable based on the last salary for each year of service for the Company or with certain maximum
limits in respect to the number of years to be considered or in respect to monetary terms. In general, this benefit is payable when the employee or
worker ceases to provide his/her services to the Company and the right for its collection can be acquired because of different causes, as
indicated in the respective agreements; e.g., retirement, dismissal, voluntary retirement, incapacity or disability, death, etc.
Law No. 19,728 published on May 14, 2001 which became effective on October 1, 2002 required “Compulsory Unemployment Insurance” in favor
of all depending employees regulated by the Chilean Labor Code. Article 5 of this law provided the financing of this insurance through monthly
contribution payments by both the employee and the employer.

Staff severance indemnities have been calculated under the actuarial assessment method of the Company’s obligations with respect to staff
severance indemnities, which relate to defined benefit plans which consist of days of remuneration per year served at the time of retirement under
conditions agreed in the respective agreements established between the Company and its employees.
Under this benefit plan, the Company retains the obligation for the payment of staff severance indemnities related to retirements without
establishing a separate fund with specific assets, which is referred to as not funded. The discount interest rate of expected flows to be used was
6%.
Benefit payment conditions
The staff severance indemnity benefit relates to remuneration days for year worked for the Company with no limit of salary or years of services for
the Company, when employees cease to work for the Company due to turnover or death. In this case, the maximum age for men is 65 years and 60
years old for women, which are the usual ages for retirement due to achieving the senior citizen age according to the Chilean pensions system
provided in Decree Law 3.500 of 1980.
Methodology
The determination of the obligation for benefits under IAS 19, Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) is described as follows:
To determine the Company's total liability, we used a mathematical simulation model which was programmed using a computer and which
processed the situation of each employee on an individual basis.

Note 15 - Employee benefits (continued)
15.3Other long-term benefits, continued
This model considered months as discrete time; i.e., the Company determined the age of each person and his/her salary on a monthly basis
according to the growth rate. Thus, information on each person was simulated from the beginning of the life of his/her employment contract or
when he/she started earning benefits up to the month in which it reaches the normal retirement age, generating in each period the possible
retirement according to the Company’s turnover rate and the mortality rate according to the age reached. When he/she reaches the retirement
age, the employee finishes his/her service for the Company and receives indemnity related to retirement due to old age.
The methodology followed to determine the accrual for all the employees adhered to agreements has considered turnover rates and the mortality
rate RV-2010 established by the Chilean Superintendence of Securities and Insurance to calculate pension-related life insurance reserves in Chile
according to the Accumulated Benefit Valuation or Accrued Cost of Benefit Method. This methodology is established in IAS 19 on Retirement
Benefit Costs.
15.4Post-employment benefit obligations
Our subsidiary SQM North America, has established with its employees a pension plan until 2002 called “SQM North America Retirement Income
Plan”, which obligation is calculated measuring the expected future forecasted staff severance indemnity obligation using a net salary gradual
rate of restatements for inflation, mortality and turnover assumptions discounting the resulting amounts at present value using the interest rate
defined by the authorities for 2012 and 2011.
Since 2003, SQM North America offers to its employee’s benefits related to pension plans based on the 401-K system, which do not generate
obligations for the Company.

Note 17 - Disclosures on equity
The detail and movements in the funds of equity accounts are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
17.1Capital management
The main object of capital management relative to the administration of the Company’s financial debt and equity is to ensure the regular conduct
of operations and business continuity in the long term, with the constant intention of maintaining an adequate level of liquidity and in compliance
with the financial safeguards established in the debt contracts in force. Within this framework, decisions are made in order to maximize the value
of SQM.
Capital management must comply with, among others, the limits contemplated in the Financing Policy approved Board of Directors, which
establish a maximum consolidated indebtedness level of 1.5 times the debt/equity. This limit can only be exceeded only if the Company’s
management has a written and previously granted authorization issued at the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting.
In addition, capital management must comply with the external capital requirements imposed (or covenants) in its financial obligations, which
regulate the indebtedness level in 1.4 times, in its more strict level.
In conjunction with the level of indebtedness, it is also important for the Company to maintain a comfortable profile of maturities for its financial
obligations, to oversight the relation between its short-term financial obligations and the long-term maturities, and the relation they have with the
Company’s asset distribution. Consequently, the Company has maintained a liquidity level of 3 times during the last periods.
The Company’s management controls capital management based on the following ratios:

19.1Lawsuits and other relevant events, continued
The Company and its subsidiaries have been involved and will probably continue being involved either as plaintiffs or defendants in certain
judicial proceedings that have been and will be heard by the Arbitral or Ordinary Courts of Justice that will make the final decision. Those
proceedings that are regulated by the appropriate legal regulations are intended to exercise or oppose certain actions or exceptions related to
certain mining claims either granted or to be granted and that do not or will not affect in an essential manner the development of the Company and
its subsidiaries.
Soquimich Comercial S.A. has been involved and will probably continue being involved either as plaintiff or defendant in certain judicial
proceedings through which it intends to collect and receive the amounts owed, the total nominal value of which is approximately ThUS$700.
The Company has made efforts and continues making efforts to obtain payment of certain amounts that are still owed it on occasion of their
activities. Such amounts will continue to be required using judicial or non-judicial means by the plaintiffs, and the actions and exercise related to
these are currently in full force and effect.
The Company and its subsidiaries have not received legal notice of any claims other than those mentioned in paragraph I above. The claims
detailed above seek to annul certain mining claims that were purchased by SQM S.A. and Subsidiaries, the proportional purchase value of which,
with respect to the portion affected by the superimposition, exceeds the nominal and approximate amount of ThUS$150. The claims seek payment
of certain amounts allegedly owed by the Company due to its own activities, which exceed the approximate, nominal and individual amount of
ThUS$150.

Note 24 - Environment
24.1Disclosures of disbursements related to the environment
The Company is continuously concerned with protecting the environment both in its production processes and with respect to products
manufactured. This commitment is supported by the principles indicated in the Company’s Sustainable Development Policy. The Company is
currently operating under an Environmental Management System (EMS) that has allowed it to strengthen its environmental performance through
the effective application of the Company’s Sustainable Development Policy.
Operations that use caliche as a raw material are carried out in desert areas with climatic conditions that are favorable for drying solids and
evaporating liquids using solar energy. Operations involving the open-pit extraction of minerals, due to their low waste-to-mineral ratio, generate
remaining deposits that slightly alter the environment. A portion of the ore extracted is crushed, a process in which particle emissions occur.
Currently this operation is conducted only at the Pedro de Valdivia worksite and no ore crushing process is conducted in the Maria Elena sector.
Many of the Company’s products are shipped in bulk at the Port of Tocopilla. In 2007 the city of Tocopilla was declared a zone Saturated with
MP10 Particles mainly due to the emissions from the electric power plants that operate in that city. In October 2010 the Decontamination Plan for
Tocopilla was put in place. Accordingly, the Company has committed to taking several measures to mitigate the effects derived from bulk product
movements in the port. These measures have been successfully implemented since 2007.
The Company carries out environmental follow-up and monitoring plans based on specialized scientific studies. Within this context, the Company
entered into a contract with the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) aimed at researching the activities of flamingo groups that live in the Salar
de Atacama (Atacama Saltpeter Deposit) lagoons. Such research includes a population count of the birds, as well as breeding research.
Environmental monitoring activities carried out by the Company at the Salar de Atacama and other systems in which it operates are supported by
a number of studies that have integrated diverse scientific efforts from prestigious research centers, including Dictuc from the Pontificia
Universidad Católica in Santiago and the School of Agricultural Science of the Universidad de Chile.

24.1Disclosures of disbursements related to the environment, continued
Furthermore, within the framework of the environmental studies which the Company is conducting, the Company performs significant activities in
relation to the recording of Pre-Columbian and historical cultural heritage, as well as the protection of heritage sites, in accordance with current
Chilean laws. These activities have been especially performed in the areas surrounding Maria Elena and the Nueva Victoria plants. This effort is
being accompanied by cultural initiatives within the community and the organization of exhibits in local and regional museums.
As emphasized in its Sustainable Development Policy, the Company strives to maintain positive relationships with the communities surrounding
the locations in which it carries out its operations, as well as to participate in communities’ development by supporting joint projects and activities
which help to improve the quality of life for residents. For this purpose, the Company has focused its efforts on activities involving the rescue of
historical heritage, education and culture, as well as development, and in order to do so, it acts both individually and in conjunction with private
and public entities.
24.2Detail of information on disbursements related to the environment

Note 26 - Operating segments (continued)
26.5Disclosures on geographical areas
As indicated in paragraph 33 of IFRS 8, the entity discloses geographical information on its revenue from operating activities with external
customers and from non-current assets that are not financial instruments, deferred income tax assets, assets related to post-employment benefits
or rights derived from insurance contracts.
26.6Disclosures on main customers
With respect to the degree of dependency of the Company on its customers, in accordance with paragraph N° 34 of IFRS N° 8, the Company has
no external customers who individually represent 10% or more of its revenue. Credit risk concentrations with respect to trade and other accounts
receivable are limited due to the significant number of entities in the Company’s portfolio and its worldwide distribution. The Company’s policy
requires guarantees (such as letters of credit, guarantee clauses and others) and/or to maintain insurance policies for certain accounts as
deemed necessary by the Company's Management.

These credits are available to companies and relate to the corporate tax payment in April of the following year. These credits include, amongst others,
training expense credits (SENCE) and property, plant and equipment acquisition credits that are equivalent to 4% of the property, plant and equipment
purchases made during the year. In addition, some credits relate to the donations the Group has made during 2013 and 2012.
(2)
This concept corresponds to the absorption of non-operating losses (NOL’s) determined by the company at year end, which must be imputed or recorded
in the Retained Taxable Profits Registry (FUT).
In accordance with the laws in force and as provided by article 31, No. 3 of the Income Tax Law, when profits recorded in the FUT that have not
been withdrawn or distributed are totally or partially absorbed by NOL’s, the corporate tax paid on such profits (20%, 17%, 16.5%, 16%, 15%, 10%
depending on the year in which profits were generated) will be considered to be a provisional payment with respect to the portion representing the
absorbed accumulated tax profits.

Taxpayers are entitled to apply for a refund of this monthly provisional income tax payments on the absorbed profits recorded in the FUT registry
via their tax returns (Form 22).
Therefore, the provisional payment for absorbed profits (PPAP) recorded in the FUT is in effect a recoverable tax, and as such the Company
records it as an asset.

Income tax is determined on the basis of the determination of tax result to which the tax rate currently in force in Chile is applied. As established
by Law 20.630, beginning on 2012 and after this tax rate is 20%.
The provision for royalty is determined by applying the tax rate determined for the Net operating income (NOI).
In conclusion, both concepts represent the estimated amount the Company will have to pay for income tax and specific tax on mining.

As of March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Company and its subsidiaries have recorded the following consolidated balances for retained

Note 28 - Income tax and deferred taxes (continued)
28.3
Tax earnings, continued
The Retained Taxable Profits Registry (FUT) is a chronological registry where the profits generated and distributed by the company are recorded.
The object of the FUT is to control the accumulated tax profits of the company that may be distributed, withdrawn or remitted to the owners,
shareholders or partners, and the final taxes that must be imposed, called in Chile Global Aggregate Tax (that levies persons resident or domiciled
in Chile), or Withholding Tax (that levies persons “Not” resident or domiciled in Chile).
The FUT Register contains profits with credit rights and profits without credit rights, which arise out of the inclusion of the net taxable income
determined by the company or the profits received by the company that may be dividends received or withdrawals made during the period.
Profits without credit rights represent the tax payable by the company within the year and filed the following year, therefore they will be deducted
from the FUT Registry the following year.
Profits with credit rights may be used to reduce the final tax burden of owners, shareholders or partners, which upon withdrawal are entitled to use
the credits associated with the relevant profits.
In summary, companies use the FUT Registry to maintain control over the profits they generate that have not been distributed to the owners and
the relevant credits associated with such profits.
28.4
Income tax and deferred taxes
Assets and liabilities recognized in the Statement of financial position are offset if and only if:
1 The Company has legally recognized before the tax authority the right to offset the amounts recognized in these entries; and
2 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are derived from income tax related to the same tax authority on:
(i)
the same entity or tax subject; or
(ii)different entities or tax subjects who intend either to settle current fiscal assets and liabilities for their net amount, or to realize assets and pay liabilities
simultaneously in each of the future periods in which the Company expects to settle or recover significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Income tax and deferred taxes, continued
Deferred income tax assets recognized are those income taxes to be recovered in future periods, related to:
(a) deductible temporary differences;
(b) the offset of losses obtained in prior periods and not yet subject to tax deduction; and
(c) the offset of unused credits from prior periods.
The Company recognizes a deferred tax asset when there is certainty that these can be offset with tax income from subsequent periods, losses or
fiscal credits not yet used, but solely as long as it is more likely than not that there will be tax earnings in the future against which to charge to
these losses or unused fiscal credits.
Deferred tax liabilities recognized refer to the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods related to taxable temporary differences

subsidiaries, branches and associated companies or interest in joint ventures, because as indicated in the standard, the following two conditions
are jointly met
(a) the parent, investor or interest holder is able to control the time for reversal of the temporary difference; and
(b)
It is more likely than not that the temporary difference is not reversed in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the Company does not recognize deferred income tax assets for all deductible temporary differences from investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associated companies or interests in joint ventures because it is not possible to meet for the following requirements:
(a)
Temporary differences are reversed in a foreseeable future; and
(b) The Company has tax earnings, against which temporary differences can be used.

d.10 Explanation of the relationship between expense (income) for tax purposes and accounting income.
In accordance with paragraph No. 81, letter c) of IAS 12, the Company has estimated that the method that discloses more significant information
for the users of its financial statements is the reconciliation of tax expense (income) to the result of multiplying income for accounting purposes
by the tax rate in force in Chile. This option is based on the fact that the Parent and its subsidiaries incorporated in Chile generate almost the total
amount of tax expense (income) and the fact that amounts of subsidiaries incorporated in foreign countries have no relevant significance within
the context of the total amount of tax expense (income.)

Income tax and deferred taxes, continued
Tax periods potentially subject to verification:
The Group’s Companies are potentially subject to income tax audits by tax authorities in each country. These audits are limited to a number of
interim tax periods, which, in general, when they elapse, give rise to the expiration of these inspections.
Tax audits, due to their nature, are often complex and may require several years. Below, we provide a summary of tax periods that are potentially
subject to verification, in accordance with tax regulations in force in the country of origin:
a)
Chile:
According to article 200 of Decree Law No. 830, the tax authority shall review for any deficiencies in its settlement and taxes turn giving rise, by
applying a requirement of 3 years term from the expiration of the legal deadline when payment should have been made. Besides, this requirement
was extended to 6 years term for the revision of taxes subject to declaration, when such declaration was not been filed or has been presented
maliciously false.
b)
United States
In the United States, the tax authority may review tax returns for up to 3 years from the expiration date of the tax return. In the event that an
omission or error is detected in the tax return of sales or cost of sales, the review can be extended for a period of up to 6 years.
c)
Mexico:
In Mexico, the tax authority can review tax returns up to 5 years from the expiration date of the tax return.
d)
Spain:
In Spain, the tax authority can review tax returns up to 4 years from the expiration date of the tax return.
e)
Belgium:
In Belgium, the tax authority may review tax returns for up to 3 years from the expiration date of the tax return if no tax losses exist. In the event of
detecting an omission or error in the tax return, the review can be extended for a period of up to 5 years.
South Africa:
f)
In South Africa, the tax authority may review tax returns for up to 3 years from the expiration date of the tax return. In the event an omission or
error in the tax return is detected, the review can be extended for a period of up to 5 years.
