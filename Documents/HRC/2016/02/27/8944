<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourth 
session from 2 to 13 February 2009. The review of Senegal was held at the 10th meeting on 
6 February 2009. The delegation of Senegal was headed by H.E. Madick&#233; Niang. At its 
meeting held on 10 February 2009, the Working Group adopted the present report on 
Senegal. 
</p>
<p>2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Senegal: Italy, Brazil, and Angola. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Senegal: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Latvia, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and Ireland was 
transmitted to Senegal through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 10th meeting, held on 6 February, H.E. Mr. Madick&#233; Niang, Minister of State 
and Minister of Justice, presented the national report. He said that Senegal remains 
convinced that the proper observance of human rights helps States develop and is a factor in 
the establishment of an international order based on justice, peace and security. As he could 
not describe all the efforts made by Senegal to promote and protect human rights because of 
time constraints, he mentioned only the major initiatives. 
</p><p>6. The fundamental rights and freedoms embodied in the various international legal 
instruments are enshrined in the Senegalese Constitution. Senegal has put in place a number 
of mechanisms to promote and protect human rights, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Senegalese Human Rights Committee, established in 1970, an 
independent and financially autonomous institution, which has had &#8220;A&#8221; accreditation status, 
granted by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions, since 1999; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Promotion 
of Peace, established in 2004, responsible for the promotion and protection of all human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Office of the Ombudsman, established in 1991, mandated primarily to 
mediate between the Administration and citizens, and with the right to act on its own 
initiative. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/24</b>*<b>

<p><b>4</b> GE.09-16280 
</p>
<p>7. As follow-up to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), in 
2006 the National Assembly adopted a bill establishing a new mechanism for the 
prevention of torture: the National Observatory of Places of Detention. 
</p>
<p>8. Senegal is honoured by the choice of its capital to host the West Africa Regional 
Office of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). 
</p><p>9. Senegal has allocated significant financial resources to education in recent years: at 
present, 42 per cent of the State budget is spent on education. These efforts have led to a 
significant improvement in primary education enrolment. They have enabled Senegal to 
move towards universal enrolment and, above all, to reduce the disparities between 
genders, regions and backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to early childhood, in 2004 Senegal set up the national kindergarten 
programme, &#8220;Case des tout petits&#8221;, which was praised by UNESCO and provides for the 
care of children up to the age of 6 years from disadvantaged backgrounds, guaranteeing 
them access to education, health care and food. 
</p>
<p>11. In furtherance of the right to health Senegal has allocated public resources that 
exceed the international standards set by WHO, thus demonstrating its commitment to 
ensuring universal access to health care. Various national programmes have been set up, 
including some addressing the specific problems of certain vulnerable social groups, such 
as street children, the pupils of certain Koranic schools, children affected by HIV/AIDS and 
persons with disabilities. Senegal has also set up a plan called &#8220;Sesame&#8221;, which provides 
destitute older persons with free health care and certain medications. 
</p>
<p>12. To fulfil its international commitments relating to non-discrimination against 
women, Senegal has been undertaking progressive and irreversible reforms with the aim of 
steadily improving its legislation. With regard to the protection of women&#8217;s physical 
integrity, Senegal has not only adopted punitive measures, including the criminalization of 
female genital mutilation, violence against women and human trafficking for the purposes 
of sexual exploitation, but is also making significant ongoing efforts to raise awareness of 
these issues. To this end, the National Observatory of Women&#8217;s Rights was set up on 15 
December 2008. The question of women&#8217;s access to land ownership was resolved in article 
15 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>13. The protection of children remains a high priority in Senegalese policies. In addition 
to the ratification of the main relevant international instruments, Senegal has taken 
significant action to enforce children&#8217;s rights. In that connection, a Children&#8217;s Code is being 
drafted. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to civil and political rights, Senegal recalls that it has a long tradition of 
respect for freedoms. The freedom to demonstrate and freedom of expression and thought 
are thus guaranteed by the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>15. Senegal will continue to work for the promotion and protection of human rights and 
remains open to all forms of cooperation in this regard, in particular with the special 
procedures mandate holders. The Minister of State further recalls that Senegal has 
responded positively to all visit requests to date. </p>

<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 60 delegations. Additional 
statements by 5 delegations which could not be delivered during the dialogue due to time 
constraints are posted on the UPR extranet when available.* 
</p>
<p>17. A number of delegations thanked Senegal for the comprehensive national report and 
its open, candid and self-critical presentation and for the responses provided to advance 
questions. Statements were made welcoming Senegal&#8217;s commitment to the UPR process, its 
constructive participation and the broad-based consultations with stakeholders that took 
place in preparing the national report. 
</p>
<p>18. Nigeria noted that Senegal has continued to strengthen its human rights 
infrastructure. It noted Senegal&#8217;s policies and action plans for children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s 
empowerment, and efforts made regarding juvenile justice. Nigeria noted Senegal&#8217;s 
challenges, including inadequate finances, capacity-building and technical know-how. 
Nigeria called on the international community to support Senegal in the creation of wealth, 
the fight against poverty, and the provision of basic social services to further promote and 
protect human rights. Nigeria encouraged Senegal to continue to improve its policies and 
programmes for strengthening the capacities of its national institutions and public decision-
making authorities and to improve the legislative and judicial environment, as well as the 
overall human rights infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>19. Algeria stressed Senegal&#8217;s commitment to the rights of migrant workers and 
encouraged Senegal to continue with its commitment to promoting awareness among the 
largest number of countries regarding the importance of ratifying the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families (ICRMW). Algeria requested information on the implementation of the GOANA 
plan and recommended that Senegal continue its efforts to guarantee the right to food for 
the Senegalese people and consider requesting technical assistance from OHCHR on the 
right to food. It welcomed Senegal&#8217;s efforts to reaffirm the tolerant and peaceful nature of 
Islam and encouraged the Government to continue with its international commitment to 
promoting a spirit of tolerance and dialogue between religions, civilizations and cultures.  
</p>
<p>20. Morocco noted the reflection of Senegal&#8217;s commitment to human rights in the 
Constitution, which recognizes the pre-eminence of international agreements over national 
law. It noted the ratification of almost all international human rights instruments. Morocco 
noted the legislative and institutional infrastructure and recommended that Senegal 
continue with its efforts to harmonize its reforms and consolidate its mechanisms and 
institutions. Noting that the fight against poverty is a priority, Morocco recommended that 
Senegal continue and strengthen its efforts to combat poverty and asked the international 
community to give Senegal the necessary assistance in that regard.  
</p>
<p>21. Sudan noted the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and 
the African Convention on the Welfare of the Child. It noted the Pre-School Children Fund, 
programmes to combat human trafficking, and laws to protect women&#8217;s rights. Sudan 
recommended that Senegal continue its efforts to eradicate poverty, achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), and coordinate its efforts with other developing countries and 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>22. Tunisia welcomed the ratification of most international human rights instruments, 
their incorporation in the Constitution and the establishment of institutions for the 
promotion of human rights. It noted the creation of mechanisms to tackle poverty through a

</p>
<p>programme of assistance and through microcredit and asked about the coordination and 
regulation of these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. Iran noted the measures taken for the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to development, and for achievement of the MDGs. While 
welcoming the education budget allocation, Iran noted the need for more work to guarantee 
free access to education. Iran asked about measures to promote employment and implement 
protective programmes, achievements in poverty reduction, education and health and the 
extent to which the MDGs will be achieved. Iran recommended that Senegal take all 
appropriate and necessary measures for better and speedy realization of social, economic 
and cultural rights and particularly the right to development. It also recommended Senegal 
foster the human rights culture among society with a view to further promoting and 
protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p>24. Indonesia commended the laws: making education free and compulsory for children 
aged 1&#8211;16; prohibiting the employment of children under 15 years of age, and prohibiting 
all forms of violence against and corruption of minors. Indonesia stressed that Senegal has 
ratified and participated in the codification of many international conventions. It 
recommended that Senegal continue its efforts to diminish the proportion of the urban 
population living in slums, so as to fulfil the rights of families to decent housing conditions. 
It noted the challenge identified by UNESCO of closing the primary-education enrolment 
gap while at the same time addressing issues of quality and recommended that the 
Government of Senegal take steps to address it. 
</p>
<p>25. Turkey, while noting Senegal&#8217;s delay in reporting to treaty bodies, welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s willingness to submit several of its reports. Turkey encouraged Senegal to 
welcome special procedures mandate holders and to provide the best possible conditions in 
order for them to carry out their missions. It commended the priority given to education and 
the importance given to the protection of children&#8217;s rights. Turkey recommended that 
Senegal take into consideration the comments made by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child concerning the adoption of a global strategy in order to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination against vulnerable groups of children. Turkey also encouraged Senegal, 
which has significant experience thanks to its active participation in the 2001 Durban 
World Conference, to continue to contribute positively to the review process. 
</p>
<p>26. Viet Nam commended Senegal&#8217;s National Strategy on Poverty Alleviation, 
education reform measures and HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. It welcomed Senegal&#8217;s 
accession to key international human rights treaties and its cooperation with special 
procedures. Viet Nam recognized that protection of the rights of vulnerable groups is 
among the major challenges and recommended that Senegal continue its efforts and take 
effective measures to overcome it. 
</p>
<p>27. Cuba noted the strategy to fight poverty, promote social services and improve living 
conditions. It congratulated the promotion of the right to food, social protection, health, 
education and the rights of children and women. Cuba welcomed Senegal&#8217;s initiatives in 
strengthening dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions. Cuba recommended that 
Senegal continue its efforts and initiatives to promote dialogue, peace and tolerance 
amongst peoples, cultures, religions and civilizations. 
</p>
<p>28. The Netherlands noted cases of apparent violation of the independence of the courts 
and recommended Senegal safeguard the separation of powers and independence of the 
judiciary. With regard to incidents with journalists and journalism, the Netherlands 
recommended Senegal decriminalize press offences. It noted that the Penal Code 
criminalizes homosexual conduct and recommended that Senegal remove the article in 
question, which is not in compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 
Netherlands welcomed the creation of the National Observatory of Women&#8217;s Rights </p>

<p>(ONDF) but expressed concern about the persistent de jure and de facto inequality between 
men and women. It asked if the ONDF already reported cases and submitted suggestions 
for improvement. 
</p>
<p>29. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted the enshrinement of human rights in the 
Constitution, the number of laws enacted and the ratification of several international 
instruments, including the Convention against Torture (CAT) and the optional protocols to 
the CRC. It asked about the measures taken to launch the campaign for agriculture and the 
right to food and to increase the production of basic food. 
</p>
<p>30. Qatar noted that the Constitution guarantees equality to all and welcomed the efforts 
made to promote human rights, including the rights to education, health and housing. Qatar 
commended the peaceful coexistence and tolerance, particularly between Christians and 
Muslims. It welcomed efforts to eradicate poverty and requested information on the 
methods and resources to address the problem of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>31. Switzerland welcomed Senegal&#8217;s determination to make human rights a priority. It 
recommended that Senegal (a) take specific and effective measures required to ensure 
respect for freedom of expression and freedom of association; (b) contribute towards 
combating impunity internationally, in particular by implementing the mandate given to 
Senegal by the African Union to try the former head of State of Chad, M. Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;; 
(c) ensure the implementation of the provisions of law 99-05 prohibiting female genital 
mutilation (FGM) and organize an effective national campaign to prevent and eradicate this 
practice; and (d) step up its efforts to implement the CRC, particularly in the areas of 
juvenile justice, trafficking of children and child labour. Switzerland expressed concern 
about reports of arbitrary detentions of individuals based on their sexual orientation and 
emphasized the importance of ensuring the full enjoyment of the rights of all persons 
without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>32. Pakistan noted the work of the CSDH for the promotion of human rights and the 
steps taken for the protection of the rights of people with disabilities, including special 
schools for professional training. Pakistan praised the legislation to combat smuggling of 
migrants. Pakistan recommended that this law be made available to countries facing 
problems of smuggling of migrants, in order to help them to develop such laws. Pakistan 
welcomed the measures taken to eliminate poverty despite Senegal&#8217;s vulnerability to 
natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>33. France asked about women&#8217;s rights and the elimination of discrimination, including 
polygamy, succession rules, and FGM. France noted the cooperation with special 
procedures and inquired about a standing invitation to all of them. France recommended the 
abrogation of article 80 of the Criminal Code concerning infringement of State security, 
which restricts the right to freedom of expression and, in the light of recent prohibitions of 
demonstrations and pressures on the organizers of certain political meetings, it further 
recommended that Senegal ensure the effective freedom of demonstration and freedom of 
association. 
</p>
<p>34. Chad indicated that Senegal is a beacon of democracy in Africa and noted the 
institutional structures established for the protection and promotion of human rights. It 
saluted Senegal&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the right to food and asked for the international 
community&#8217;s support for further improvement in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>35. The United Kingdom welcomed the HCDHPP and the CSDH and encouraged

raising campaigns to combat and eradicate FGM and other traditional harmful practices 
against women and girls. It noted concerns regarding the prohibition of some forms of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/24</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.09-16280 
</p>
<p>sexual activity between consenting adults and recommended that Senegal&#8217;s Criminal Code 
be amended to decriminalize homosexual activity between consenting adults. It noted 
concerns expressed over the detention of journalists and freedom of expression in the 
media. The United Kingdom recommended that Senegal take forward plans to 
decriminalize press offences as agreed by the President of the Republic in 2004 and as 
reported to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>36. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted Senegal&#8217;s political will concerning the provision of sanitation in 
areas where this service is lacking and the realization of land and housing rights. It also 
noted Senegal&#8217;s commitment to implement the &#8220;Education for All&#8221; project, which has 
increased access to primary education and improve the quality of teaching. It recommended 
that the international community strengthen its support for Senegal, which remains a model 
for democracy in Africa, particularly with respect to the promotion of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Belgium expressed concern about the criminalization of homosexuality, as well as 
the harassment and discrimination of which homosexuals are victim. In this respect, 
reference was made to the recent arrest of nine persons and their sentencing to eight-year 
prison terms because of their sexual orientation. Belgium recommended that Senegal 
decriminalize homosexuality and free all persons imprisoned on the grounds of their sexual 
orientation. It recommended that Senegal respect and protect the human rights and the 
fundamental freedoms of all persons without any form of discrimination. Further, noting 
that journalists have faced pressure, threats and other acts of intimidation, and occasionally 
imprisonment. it recommended that Senegal revise its legislation on freedom of the press in 
order to bring it into line with international standards. 
</p>
<p>38. While recognizing the freedom of expression and noting Senegal&#8217;s intention to 
further reform the national press law, Sweden expressed concern about reports of 
harassment and intimidations of journalist and mass media outlets. Sweden recommended 
Senegal take further measures, including legislative action, to ensure full respect for the 
freedom of expression and freedom of the press, in accordance with international standards. 
Sweden noted the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
regarding corporal punishment, despite a legal ban, and recommended Senegal continue its 
efforts and take necessary policy measures to ensure that children are protected from 
corporal punishment and other forms of violence or exploitation. 
</p>
<p>39. Luxembourg supported the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child that Senegal continue carrying out awareness-raising campaigns to combat and 
eliminate FGM and other traditional practices that are harmful to health and seek to bring 
about positive trends in traditional behaviour. Luxembourg supported the recommendation 
of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) to better implement 
laws aimed at eliminating all forms of violence against women. It also supports the 
recommendations by the Committee on the Rights of the Child that Senegal ensure that the 
law against sexual exploitation of children be better implemented and take better measures 
to protect girls engaged in domestic work from economic exploitation and sexual abuse. 
Luxembourg noted reports of torture within detention centres, infringement on the 
independence of justice and restrictions on press freedom. Luxembourg noted Senegal&#8217;s 
fight against poverty and welcomed its partnership to reach the MDGs and to contribute to 
good governance. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia commended the cooperation with UN-HABITAT in slum upgrading and 
realization of land and housing rights. It commended the abolishment of the death penalty 
and the ratification of most human rights treaties and encouraged submission of periodic 
reports and answers to special procedures mandate holders&#8217; questionnaires. It expressed 
concern over working children and over arbitrary arrests, harassment and discrimination on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/24</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16280 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. It recommended Senegal review national 
legislation which results in the discrimination, prosecution and punishment of people solely 
for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Slovenia noted reports of restrictions on the 
freedoms of expression, association and assembly and recommended that Senegal protect 
the rights of assembly and freedom of expression. It noted the concern of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child at the lack of juvenile judges, the insufficient number of juvenile 
courts and the detention of girls in adult prisons. 
</p>
<p>41. The Democratic Republic of Congo noted Senegal&#8217;s ratification of many 
international instruments and the legal approach adopted in legal proceedings including 
allowing persons to object to a law which infringes human rights. It highlighted policies in 
favour of people of vulnerable age and the recognition of equality and the role of women. It 
requested information regarding the changes made to institutions, including the National 
Assembly. It encouraged Senegal to pursue its policy regarding persons with HIV and the 
elderly, which makes its commitment to the cause of human rights more concrete. 
</p>
<p>42. The Holy See noted the constitutional provision on free practice of religious beliefs 
and commended Senegal&#8217;s involvement in interreligious dialogue. It noted the apparent 
tendency to limit the freedom of journalists and recommended that the police and armed 
forces receive training on human rights and freedom of the press in order to prevent any 
deterioration in this respect. The Holy See noted the high maternal mortality and 
recommended that Senegal further invest in achieving the MDG on maternal health, 
including access to equipment, drugs and supplies; transportation for medical referrals; and 
partnerships with other medical personnel. Acknowledging the priority given to education, 
the Holy See recommended that Senegal further invest in education and give special 
attention to the education of girls and young women.  
</p>
<p>43. China noted the reduction of poverty as a priority and acknowledged progress in the 
promotion of the right to health, education and culture. China noted progress in the 
elimination of discrimination against women and the protection of children&#8217;s rights. China 
asked about measures planned by Senegal to alleviate the impact of the food crisis and the 
financial crisis on the rights of its people.  
</p>
<p>44. Ghana noted the efforts aimed at ensuring an adequate standard of living, providing 
support to vulnerable groups, and securing the right to health and education. It welcomed 
the enactment of legislation criminalizing sexual harassment and domestic violence against 
women and recommended that Senegal increase its efforts to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination against women, including by adopting effective measures to implement 
relevant existing legislation. It also recommended that Senegal, with the assistance of the 
international community, increase its efforts to speed up the implementation of the next 
phase of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper with a view to promoting the right to an 
adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>45. Germany asked about measures to guarantee equality and to abolish discrimination 
of children born out of wedlock, children with disabilities, children affected by HIV/AIDS, 
girls, street children and <i>talib&#233;s</i>. Germany recommended that Senegal continue its efforts to 
effectively combat human trafficking, to protect child victims of sexual exploitation and to 
prevent the abuse of girls as domestic servants. It also recommended that Senegal expand 
its efforts to ensure universal access to maternal and child health-care services and 
facilities, in particular in rural and remote areas. Germany recommended that Senegal 
continue to take all necessary measures to ensure that teachers are adequately trained, that 
girls and boys from all areas have equal access to education and that enrolment in primary 
and secondary education, including in rural and less developed areas, increases 
significantly. </p>

<p><b>10</b> GE.09-16280 
</p>
<p>46. Yemen noted the ratification of almost all international human rights instruments 
and that these take precedence over the Constitution. Yemen noted Senegal&#8217;s efforts, for 
which the international community&#8217;s support was needed, to promote a culture of respect 
for human rights and to build institutions in that regard. 
</p>
<p>47. Oman noted the number of ratified international instruments and the establishment 
of many institutions, including the regional office of OHCHR. It noted Senegal&#8217;s active 
participation in education and in the realization of civil and political, economic, social and 
cultural rights. It recommended accepting the support of OHCHR in the area of 
dissemination of human rights in order to support national cultural and education 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>48. The head of the delegation thanked all the delegations for their positive remarks on 
the human rights situation in Senegal. With regard to juvenile justice, Senegal is committed 
to strengthening capacities, improving structures and training staff. A significant effort is 
being made because children must be protected.  
</p>
<p>49. Senegal is committed to wider ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as it is 
directly affected by the Convention and shares the ideals underpinning the text. With the 
adoption of the Great Offensive for Agriculture, Food and Abundance (GOANA), Senegal 
considered that the solution, in view of the global crisis, was to utilize its potential, with the 
support of international cooperation, in particular through the provision of agricultural 
equipment and technology. The initial results have been encouraging and Senegal requests 
the international community to continue to provide its support so that Senegal can achieve 
food self-sufficiency. 
</p>
<p>50. Senegal said that it had adopted the participatory approach in relation to the drafting 
of its reports as a matter of principle. When taking any action, the country calls on civil 
society to ensure a certain degree of symbiosis. 
</p>
<p>51. Senegal cooperates with all the organizations working to combat human trafficking 
and the Senegalese police are very active in this area. 
</p>
<p>52. The head of the delegation stressed that freedom of the press is more fully respected 
in Senegal than anywhere else in the world. It is important to understand, however, that 
such freedom must be exercised within the bounds imposed by the freedoms of others. The 
excessive exercise of freedom of expression has led to legal actions in Senegal, as in other 
countries. Those actions have been brought in response to complaints submitted by citizens 
before courts, which act with complete independence. 
</p>
<p>53. In response to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their 
sexual orientation, the head of the delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private 
matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The 
prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public 
and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and 
religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and 
avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives. 
</p><p>54. Senegal has made great efforts to promote gender equality, inter alia through 
positive discrimination. However, it is important to take into consideration the elements 
peculiar to Islam, which account for the existence of polygamy. In that connection, women 
are no longer alienated since they enter freely into polygamous unions. 
</p>
<p>55. The delegation recalled that Senegal is ready to respond positively to any request 
under the special procedures.  </p>

<p>56. With regard to freedom of expression, a commission is currently discussing the 
question of the decriminalization of press offences. It is important for journalists to receive 
proper training in order to ensure that they obey the rules, even though, at present, there is 
only one journalist in prison in Senegal; such convictions can be found in any democracy. 
Freedom of association is fully guaranteed in Senegal except where there is a real risk of 
public order disturbances and it is always possible to appeal any decision before a court. 
This freedom is enshrined in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>57. The independence of the judiciary is also respected. The composition of the Judicial 
Council is under discussion and, at present, only the President and the Minister of Justice 
are not judges. Thus, even when the Minister of Justice wants to have a judge transferred by 
a decision of the Judicial Council, it is the judges who take the decision because they make 
up the majority. 
</p><p>58. The delegation recalled that, with regard to freedom of the press, the State provides 
training grants and assistance with the creation of community radio stations, with total 
funding amounting to 1 million dollars. These funds are allocated through a joint body in 
which the State is a minority stakeholder. A press centre will be set up in 2010. The 
freedom of the press is reflected in the presence of a large majority of opposition media. 
59. With regard to torture in places of detention, the delegation recognized the existence 
of such cases, which are systematically investigated; where appropriate, the investigations 
have led to convictions in addition to disciplinary sanctions. In that connection, in 2001, the 
office of sentence enforcement judge was created and, once the Senate has adopted the 
relevant legislation, the National Observatory of Places of Detention will be set up. Its 
reports will be public. In Senegal, torture is prohibited and, if there is conclusive evidence 
that torture has been committed, an action is brought. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government has embarked on the second phase of the poverty reduction 
programme, which primarily targets women and children. Children receive special 
protection. In addition to ratifying all the relevant conventions, Senegal has provisions in 
place for children in families, schools and public areas, such as the streets. In that regard, 
Senegal is addressing the question of <i>talib&#233;s</i> by helping the Koranic schools. Corporal 
punishment is prohibited; one Koranic teacher has been convicted for that offence. 
</p>
<p>61. The head of the delegation concluded by saying that the statements had enabled him 
to take stock of what had been done in Senegal and to draw lessons on how to continue 
improving the situation. 
</p>
<p>62. The United Arab Emirates noted that the Constitution reflects the rights and 
principles of international conventions. It welcomed the efforts made to establish an 
institutionally-based rule of law. It noted that according to the national report, human rights 
are not necessarily well known by everyone and encouraged Senegal to step up its efforts to 
develop programmes and take action to publicize human rights.  
</p>
<p>63. Canada welcomed the adoption of a law modifying the Constitution, which will 
allow Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; to be tried by the Senegalese justice. Canada was concerned about the 
fact that homosexuality is criminally repressed and recommended that Senegal modify its 
Criminal Code to abolish the criminalization of homosexual acts, in line with the provisions 
of ICCPR, particularly articles 2 and 26. Canada noted that, despite the legislation 
punishing it, violence against women continues. It recommended that Senegal take 
measures to raise awareness among the public and all players involved in the judicial 
system regarding the need to respect and apply this legislation. Canada recommended that 
Senegal respect the commitments concerning the freedom of expression which it undertook 
by ratifying the ICCPR. Canada noted that access to the legal system remains problematic 
and recommended that Senegal put in place means and mechanisms to raise awareness 
among its citizens regarding access to justice.  </p>

<p>harmful. It also recommended that Senegal continue application of measures aimed at the

</p>
<p>72. Mexico noted the ratification of human rights instruments and their primacy over the 
Constitution. It welcomed the efforts to submit outstanding reports to treaty bodies and the 
acceptance of the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of migrants. Mexico 
recommended that Senegal finalize and submit its reports to the Committee on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (CMW), 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and CAT and extend 
invitations to the Special Rapporteurs on torture and the independence of judges and 
lawyers. Noting reports of discrimination against women and girls, it recommended that 
Senegal take immediate measures to deal with the problem of discrimination, to facilitate 
women&#8217;s access to education and health and to fully ensure the protection of women. 
Mexico expressed concern over reports of discrimination against children. Mexico 
recommended that Senegal develop a national comprehensive action plan for children, 
complete ratification of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-
operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption and strengthen legal measures for the 
protection of minors. 
</p>
<p>73. Egypt welcomed the establishment of the CSDH, which conforms to the Paris 
Principle. It noted the law against the smuggling of migrants and the institutional and 
legislative measures in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, including poverty-
reduction strategies. Egypt recommended that Senegal conduct a detailed analysis and 
evaluation of the extent of technical assistance and resources required from OHCHR and 
from other sources to enable it to carry out its efforts aimed at strengthening the promotion 
and protection of human rights. Egypt also recommended that Senegal continue its 
cooperation with international human rights institutions and treaty bodies and that it 
continue its efforts to spread a culture of human rights and publicize the human rights 
instruments to which it is a party and to build, with the support of OHCHR, the necessary 
national capacity for the preparation of its periodic reports to treaty bodies. Lastly, Egypt

privacy, Ireland recommended that Senegal launch a national debate which may lead to the 
decriminalization of homosexuality. Ireland welcomed the action taken to enable Senegal to 
proceed with the trial of Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;, but, noting that more than two years have passed

fulfil that mandate as soon as possible and bring Mr. Habr&#233; to justice. Ireland welcomed the 
progress on women&#8217;s rights but expressed concern that legislation does not always translate

children and persons of minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and ensuring proper 
investigation and punishment of any human rights violations committed by such officials. 
Regarding the protection of the right to privacy and non-discrimination, it recommended

educational programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention.

</p>
<p>92. Senegal provided additional information. With regard to the case of Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;,

<p><b>16</b> GE.09-16280 
</p>
<p>issue that would require time and careful consideration because of the specific social factors 
involved. 
</p>
<p>94. The delegation added that Senegal is improving access to the justice system and that 
the amendments to the map of judicial districts will help in that regard. Similarly, a reform 
is under way to further limit the use of pretrial detention in accordance with the principle 
that freedom is the rule and detention the exception. 
</p>
<p>95. The delegation recalled that education is a priority in Senegal, as evidenced by the 
proportion of the national budget allocated to it, the fact that education is compulsory, and 
the financial assistance provided. Another priority is the eradication of female genital 
mutilation, with severe penalties in place and expanded awareness-raising efforts in 
villages. As a result of efforts to combat AIDS, the prevalence rate has declined among all 
population groups. 
</p>
<p>96. The head of the delegation concluded by thanking all the participants and stressing 
that the rule of law can never be taken for granted and that many lessons had been learned
