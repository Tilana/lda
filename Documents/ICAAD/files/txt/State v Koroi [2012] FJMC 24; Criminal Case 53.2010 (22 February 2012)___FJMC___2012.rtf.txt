 Accused Person: - In Person,

SENTENCE

1.      
You USAIA KOROI were found guilty and convicted by this court for the offence of "Robbery with Violence" which is punishable under Section 293 (1) of the Penal Code Act 17, which entails a punishment up to life imprisonment.

2.      
The summery of facts in this case are that you together with another six accomplices forcibly entered into the house of the Mr. Shiri Chand and assaulted him with a knife and threatened Mrs. Chand with a knife and stole properties and cash worth of $ 3,648

3.      
This is an act of home invasion in night and robbed therein by assaulting and threatening the occupants of the house. You and your other accomplices were armed with offensive weapons and used them to assault and threaten the occupants of the house. The crimes in this nature are becoming a serious problem and warranted a greater judicial intervention in sentencing. You and your accomplices tried to enter into the house of Mr. Shiri Chand by pretending innocent representation by asking if he sell cigarettes. 

4.      
The learned counsel for the prosecution in her sentencing submission she discussed the tariff for the offense of robbery with violence and urged to consider following facts as aggravating circumstance; 

i.      
This case is that of a home invasion of a vulnerable couple, where Shiri Chand was of 48 years of age and his wife, 54 years of age. The offence was carried out at 1 am when couple were the only occupants in their home.

ii.     
The offence was carried out by seven armed assailants of whom the Accused was a party to. The assailants were armed with beer bottles, a cane knife, iron rods and a knife. Their illegal possession of offensive weapons depicts not only their intentions for committing the offence of robbery, but also their intention to inflict serious harm.

iii.    
The assailants appeared at the door of the victims' house with an innocent representation, asking them if they were selling cigarettes. They deceived the victims when they forced the door open whereby their motive of a robbery was revealed.

iv.     
Shiri Chand was struck at with a cane knife and in the instinctive act to defend himself, escaped with minor injuries. His wife was threatened with a knife held at her neck, demanding that her wedding rings be removed or her finger would be cut off.

v.      
At the time of offence, the assailant caused the victims to endure tremendous sense of chaos through actual threat and physical harm, along with being in the highest state of fear, anticipating uncertain forms of immediate life threatening acts.

vi.     
Such an act displays a life threatening situation for the victims and for the community. The victims now endure a lifelong terrorizing memory whereby their sense of liberty, comfort and security in their own home is compromised to one of uncertainty and constant fear of the unknown.

vii.    
Properties that were taken were acquired by the victims' honest means of income and lifestyle as opposed to the heinous and guiltless act display by the offenders which allowed them easily acquired possession of another's property, inflicting fear, pain, loss of items of monetary and sentimental value and, injuries.

viii.   
The Accused, as part of planned home invasion, displayed a clear intention to ignore and defy the law and all sense of morality.

ix.     
The Accused has one previous conviction. 

5.      
The accused merely denied all allegations against him in his written mitigation submission. The accused further stated that he is waiting for his visa to travel USA and to join with his parent and therefore pleased with a non custodial sentence. 

6.      
Having considered the summery of facts, aggravating circumstances of this case, sentencing submission of the prosecution and the mitigation submission of the accused person, I now turn to consider appropriate sentences on you upon considering the general principles of sentencing under Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and objectives of sentencing under section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 

7.      
 Justice Goundar in State vs Mataiasi Bulivou Susu[2010] FJHC 226; HAC054.2010; HAC055.2010; HAC056.2010 (2 July 2010) found that organized gang robberies attract the sentence of 8-14 year imprisonment. Justice Shameem in Seseu v State 2003, FJHC 224, HAM0043J, 2003S, 10 December 2003) found that the tariff for robbery with violence is 4-7 years. Justice Shameem in Sakiusa Basa vs. the State(Criminal Appeal AAU 24/2005), held that "'Sentences for robberies involving firearms should range from six to eight years. A lower range of four to seven years is appropriate where firearms are not used and the premises are banks, or shops, post offices or service stations. However, the sentence may be higher where the victim or victims are particularly vulnerable due to age, infirmity, disability or where children are involved. Similarly where injuries are caused in the course of the robbery, a higher sentence will be justified. The value of the property stolen, evidence of planning or premeditation, multiple offences and previous convictions for similar offences should be considered aggravating features. The sentence may be reduced where the offender has no previous convictions, has pleaded guilty and has expressed remorse. This list of aggravating and mitigating features is by no means exhaustive. Furthermore, the sentence will always be adjusted up or down, depending on the facts of the particular case'

8.      
Justice Goundar inSusu's case(supra), has summarized the guiding principles in sentencing in cases involving robbery. They are:' From these authorities, the following principles emerge. The dominant factor in assessing seriousness for any types of robbery is the degree of force used or threatened. The degree of injury to the victim or the nature of and duration of threats are also relevant in assessing the seriousness of an offence of robbery with violence. If a weapon is involved in the use or threat of force that will always be an important aggravating feature. Group offending will aggravate an offence because the level of intimidation and fear caused to the victim will be greater. It may also indicate planning and gang activity. Being the ringleader in a group is an aggravating factor. If the victims are vulnerable, such as elderly people and persons providing public transport, then that will be an aggravating factor. Other aggravating factors may include the value of items taken and the fact that an offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail.

The seriousness of an offence of robbery is mitigated by factors such as a timely guilty plea, clear evidence of remorse, ready co-operation with the police, response to previous sentences, personal circumstances of the offender, first offence of violence, voluntary return of property taken, playing a minor part, and lack of planning involved.

9.      
In view of above judicial precedents and provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and careful perusal of the evidence presented by the prosecution sufficiently directed me to determine an appropriate starting point for you. This is a home invasion at night by a gang of robbers who were armed with offensive weapons. The victims were badly assaulted and threatened. 

10.     
In view of the aforementioned reasons, I find the purposes of sentencing you in this case are to punish offenders to an extend and in a manner which is just in all the circumstance, to protect the community from offender in this nature, to deter offenders from committing offences of similar nature, and to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of offences in this nature. In line with above sentencing guidelines and principles, I select 8 years imprisonment period as a starting point.

11.     
You committed this offence in a join enterprise together with six other accomplices. I find you and your accomplice carried out this robbery in most scandalous and brutal manner. By virtue of the principle of join enterprise each one of your culpability and degree of responsibility for inflicting of violence and robbing the complainants same as of your other accomplices. 

12.     
The impact of this offence on the victims must be a horrified experience as you and your accomplices invaded into their home at night, assaulted them with offensive weapons, injured them and robbed their belongings. This horrified experience will undoubtedly remain in their memories in rest of their lives. 

13.     
You have demonstrated that you have no respect and regard to the rights of other's freedom. The crimes in this nature are prevalent and which have now gone into extend that the security and safety of the people could not be guaranteed even within their own residence. People are forced to turn their own residence into semi self designed prisons with burglar bars and well protected gates around their residence in order to protect themselves from this kind of brutal home invasions. 

14.     
At this point I refer the decision of Winters J in Uluikadavu v State ( 2004) FJHC 113, HAA0035.2004 (25 June 2004) which is brought into my attention by the learned counsel of the prosecution in her sentencing submission. In the above mentioned case Winters J held that "Home invasions are a particularly traumatic intrusion into the lives of citizens. The most striking features of these episodes are the sheer terror to its victims. They are set upon within the apparent safety of a private dwelling by complete strangers. These unjustified acts of terrorism by intruders within the home invade the family sanctuary and violate the sense of security that lies at the heart of each home. As such these acts not only affect the lives of their immediate victims but also instill fear in the whole community creating a siege like mentality.

Entry into dwelling at night and assault upon occupants must draw stern sentences to reflect society's attitude to such conduct. In sentencing offenders for home invasions the Courts have always recognized the sanctity of the home and have insisted that violence occurring in a person's house is to be treated as an extreme aggravating factor calling for a higher sentence. At the very least the victim and society deserve the small comfort of knowing that while incarcerated these home invaders are not free to ply their miserable trade."

15.     
You are not a first offender wherefore; I do not consider your previous good character in your favor. 

16.     
I now draw my attention to address the mitigatory factors in your favors. 

i.      
You are 27 years of age, 

ii.     
Pleaded non custodial sentence, 

iii.    
Looking after the grandmother,

iv.     
Waiting to travel to USA and join with your parent,

17.     
 In view of aforementioned aggravating factors I increase 2 years, to reach the period of 10 years. I reduce 4 years for your mitigating factors; specially I consider your young age. Your sentence now reaches to 6 years imprisonment period. According to section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, sentence which is above two years could not be suspended by this court. 

18.     
Accordingly, I sentence you for 6 years imprisonment period for the offence of "Robbery with Violence" contrary to section 293 (1) (b) of the Penal Code Act 17. Further you are not eligible for parole for a period of 4 year in pursuant of section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009.

19.     
Since this court is exercising the extended jurisdiction of the High Court in your case, you may appeal against this sentence within 30 days with leave to the Court of Appeal. 

On this 22nd day of February 2012.
