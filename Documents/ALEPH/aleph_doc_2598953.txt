SUMMARY
The MSA Group (Pty) Limited (MSA) has, on behalf of Polo Resources Limited (Polo), completed a
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (MRE)  for  the  Komahun  Gold  Project  (The  Property),  in  the  Kono
District of the Eastern Region of Sierra  Leone.   Polo holds a 90% interest  in the  project  with the
remaining 10% being held by Plinian Guernsey Limited.  Plinian Capital Limited was appointed by
Polo as the Property operator in March, 2012.  The Property comprises a granted Mining Licence
(comprising the entire former Nimini West and Nimini East exploration licences), covering an area
of 100 square kilometres and was issued in accordance with Clause 2M of the Mines and Minerals
Act (2009) of Sierra Leone on 26 November 2012 for an initial period of 25 years.  Polo (AIM and
BSX:  POL)  is  a  globally  focused  natural  resources  and  mine  development  investment  company
that  selects,  acquires  and  manages  investments  in  companies  and  projects  with  value
enhancement potential and  potentially attractive growth prospects.  MSA  were  retained by  Polo
to undertake a MRE on the basis of additional drilling subsequent to the most recent MRE on The
Property (February 2012).
This  Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  to  comply  with  disclosure  and  reporting  requirements
set  forth  in  the  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101  –  “Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Minerals
Projects”, the corresponding Companion Policy 43-101CP, Form 43-101F1 (Form F1), of June 2011
(collectively the Instrument) and the Mineral Resource and Reserve classifications adopted by CIM
Council in August 2000.
The  Property  is  located  in  the  Archaean  Nimini  Hills  greenstone  belt  within  the  West  African
Craton.    The  West  African  Craton  comprises  predominantly  migmatitic  gneisses  and  granitoids,
into  which  metasedimentary  and  metavolcanic  sequences  are  infolded  and  preserved  as
greenstone  belts.    These  greenstone  belts  have  a  general  northwest-southeast  trend  in
concordance  with  the  regional  structural  grain  and  are  considered  to  be  synformal  remnants  of
originally  more  extensive  successions  that  have  been  significantly  eroded.    Stratigraphically,  the
greenstone  belts  belong  to  the  Kambui  Supergroup  and  were  deposited  onto  the  granitic
basement and were accompanied by the emplacement of mafic and ultramafic  intrusions.  All of
the  greenstone  belts  in  Sierra  Leone  comprise  a  basal  volcanic  sequence  comprising  ultramafic
and mafic pillow lavas overlain by a sedimentary sequence comprising tuffs, psammitic and pelitic
schists  and  conglomerates  and  banded  iron  formations  (BIF’s.).    These  greenstone  belts  are  the
predominant gold repositories in Sierra Leone.
The Komahun mineralized zones are located at the contact between an amphibolite/BIF package
and  the  overlying  metasedimentary  package.    The  generalised  local  stratigraphy  at  Komahun  is
recorded relative to the mineralized zones and comprises an amphibolite-dominated hangingwall
with a prominent developed basal talc-schist unit (former ultramafic) immediately overlying a BIF-
rich  package  which  in  turn  overlies  a  mixed  package  dominated  by  amphibolite  with  minor  BIF.
The footwall to mineralization in all instances is a prominent phlogopite schist.  It is evident that
the  stratigraphic  sequence  is  overturned  relative  to  the  mineralized  zones;  the  stratigraphic
sequence  youngs  to  the  northwest  whereas  the  mineralization  hangingwall  is  located  to  the
southeast.

Gold mineralization at the Property is contained in several sub vertical zones within fracture and
vein systems hosted within metamorphosed meta-volcanic and banded iron formation (BIF) rocks
typical  of  greenstone  belt  gold  deposits.  These  deposits  are  typically  characterised  by
comparatively low tonnages but high grades and typically occur within or nearby to BIF horizons
within  the  stratigraphic  package.    Regionally,  most  deposits  are  associated  with  prominent
regional  structures  and/or  stratigraphic  breaks/contacts.    The  formation  of  these  deposits  is
generally  attributed  to  the  reaction  of  gold-  and  sulphur-bearing  hydrothermal  fluids  with  the
iron  oxide  in  the  country  rocks,  causing  precipitation  of  gold  and  sulphides.  The  gold  occurs  in
quartz  veins  or  in  the  immediate  wallrock  where  precipitation  reactions  have  occurred.    As  a
result,  the  deposits  are  broadly  stratiform,  but  mineralization  can  be  locally  discordant.    Shear
zones  and  fault  systems  provide  access  to  the  chemically  favourable  BIF  horizons  and  it  is  likely
that the strong competency contrasts between the BIF and its generally schistose, less competent
country rocks result in strain localisation in or adjacent to the BIF.
Mineralization  on  the  Property,  as  currently  understood,  occurs  in  five  distinct  mineralized
“blocks”.  Block 1, which accounts for the majority of the Property’s drilled gold Mineral Resource,
comprises  three  steeply  dipping  mineralized  zones  that  range
in  true  thickness  from
approximately 1  m to locally more than 15  m.  These  zones are hosted by  dilational quartz vein
systems  at  a  BIF-amphibolite/talc  schist  contact  in  Zone  1  and  within  BIF  and  amphibolites  in
Zones  2  and  3  and  contain  arsenopyrite,  pyrrhotite  and  native  (visible)  gold.    Block  1  has  been
proven  by  diamond  drilling,  to  extend  to  depths  approximately  800  m  below  surface  and  has  a
strike extent of approximately 500 m.
Block 2, on strike to the northeast of Block 1, comprises three mineralized zones: a robust footwall
zone (B2FW) and two variably developed zones within the hangingwall.  The B2FW mineralization
is continuous along strike for approximately 360 m. Mineralized widths in Block 2 are significantly
narrower  than  in  Block  1,  with  maximum  true  mineralized  widths  between  1.5  m  and  8  m.    The
hangingwall zones are located approximately 80 m in the hanging-wall of the footwall zone. The
zones  dip  steeply  (approximately  85  degrees)  to  the  southeast  and  are  subparallel.    The  main
Block  2  mineralization  occurs  in  silicified  planar  BIF,  with  gold  intergrown  with  arsenopyrite  and
pyrrhotite  disseminations,  stringers,  and  minor  breccias  along  fractures  and  concordant  to
foliation planes.
Block 3 is located on-strike and to the northeast of Block 2.  This Block, discovered in the recently
completed drilling program, has been intercepted along approximately 360 m of strike to a depth
of  420  m.    Mineralization  is  hosted  within  four  discrete,  but  highly  variable  zones  and  occurs
mostly  as  free  gold  associated  with  vein  quartz  and  sulphides  (arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite)  in
altered amphibolite.  BIF is absent in Block 3.
Block 4  mineralization  is located in the apparent footwall of Block 1, at its western  edge.  It is  a
structurally  complex  mineralized  zone  and  several  mineralized  intersections  drilled  during  the
current programme have not been included in the modelled wireframe due to uncertainty about
orientation and continuity.  Rock types in Block 4 are similar to those in Block 1, although the BIF
unit  that  characterises  Block  1  is  poorly  developed  and  rarely  intersected  in  drillholes.

Mineralization is associated with quartz veins, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite typical of Block 1 style
and  gold  grade  is  strongly  correlated  to  the  percentage  of  sulphide  minerals  within  the
amphibolitic host rock. Veins vary from 50 cm to 5.5 meters wide.  Quartz plus arsenopyrite veins
are the sole mineralization style in the northern part of the structure.
The  Southern  Structure  (Block  5)  is  not  contiguous  with  Block  1  but  is  located  500  m  to  the
southwest  of  its  western  extent.    Mineralization  is  hosted  in  amphibolites,  with  no  BIF  or  schists
typical  of  Block  1  having  been  noted  during  field  mapping,  trenching  or  drilling.  Within  the
amphibolites, mineralization is associated with vein quartz and strong phlogopite alteration, with
the dominant sulphides being arsenopyrite with subordinate pyrrhotite.  The veins and associated
minerals  have  been  subjected  to  considerable  strain  and  are  parallel  to  the  local  foliation  trend.
Recorded widths are between 0.2 m and 4 m.  Mineralogically, the Southern Structure bears more
resemblance to the Block 3 style of mineralization than the auriferous zones typical of the Block 1
zones.
A significant amount of exploration has been undertaken on the Property.  Approximately 50 per
cent of the Mining Licence is covered by soil geochemical surveys, in excess of 700 pits have been
excavated  and  more  than  6000  m  of  trenching  has  been  completed.    Geophysical  surveys
undertaken  include  airborne  and  ground  magnetics,  Versatile  Time  Domain  Electromagnetics
(VTEM)  and  Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  pole-dipole  surveys.    A  total  of  421  diamond  drill  holes,
totalling in excess of 92,000 m of drilling, has been completed at the Property since 2005.
The authors conducted several site visits to the Project in 2012 in order to inspect the cores and
review the mineralization styles at Komahun.  They consider that the exploration work conducted
by Nimini was carried out using appropriate techniques for the style of mineralization at Komahun
and that the resulting database is suitable for Mineral Resource estimation.  Quality Assurance –
Quality  Control  (QAQC)  procedures  have  been  reviewed  and  the  performance  of  the  QAQC
measures implemented at Komahun is considered acceptable to support the declaration of NI 43-
101 compliant Mineral Resources.
A  total  of  344  diamond  drillholes  were  completed  in  the  area  of  interest  for  Mineral  Resources,
being defined as the areas within or adjacent to Blocks 1 to 4 and the Southern Structure (Block
5).    The  results  of  234  of  these  were  used  to  directly  estimate  the  Mineral  Resource.    The
remaining 110 holes intersected mineralization below the selected threshold of 0.50 g/t Au, were
discarded due to poor recovery in saprolite or intersected  mineralization of significant grade but
which  was  not supported  by sufficient amounts of additional drillholes to form a cohesive zone.
Assay and logging data from trenches, which were included in the June, 2012, Mineral Resource
Estimate (Camus and Cukor, 2012), were excluded from the June 2013 MRE as the steep terrain at
Komahun  likely  resulted  in  significant  creep  of  the  outcrop  down-slope  from  the  underlying
mineralization.
Mineral Resource Estimation was carried out using CAE Mining Studio 3 software.  A 0.50 g/t Au
threshold was used to define the mineralized envelopes.  The drillhole data were examined in plan
and  in  section.    Each  significant  intersection  was  assigned  to  one  of  12  zones  guided  by
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone

lithological  association  with  BIF,  amphibolite  and/or  quartz  veins,  while  considering  continuity
along  the  well-defined  south-west  to  north-east  sub-vertically  dipping  trend.    Wireframes  were
constructed  for  each  of  the  zones  with  the  maximum  extrapolation  distance  being  20  m  along
strike and 40 m down dip from the nearest drillhole intersection.  A block model was constructed
by filling the wireframe solids with parent cells of 10 m in the approximate strike and dip direction
and 2 m across the zones. The parent cells were split into sub-cells of a minimum of 5 m by 5 m
by  1  m.    Rotated  block  models  were  constructed  in  order  to  best  fit  the  mineralized  envelopes
that are orientated oblique to the coordinate system.
Intersections  less  than  one  metre  in  true  thickness  (drilled  length  corrected  on  the  basis  of  the
average dip and strike of the individual  mineralized zones) were diluted, using adjacent samples
that  were  less  than  the  0.5  g/t  Au  modelling  threshold,  to  one  metre  prior  to  their  use  in
estimation.  Assays were composited to one metre lengths.  The composite assays were capped at
thresholds defined separately for each of the mineralized zones depending on the sample grade
distribution of each zone.  The capping thresholds varied from 11.5 g/t to 79 g/t and were applied
immediately prior to interpolation.
Semi-variograms  were  created  for  each  of  the  mineralized  zones.    The  spherical  semi-variogram
models are robust for Zones 1, 2 and 3 in Block 1, where a steep north-easterly plunge within the
plane  of  the  mineralization  was  well  defined.    The  individual  semi-variograms  for  the  Block  2,
Block 3, Block 4 and Southern Structure zones were not based on sufficient numbers of samples
to provide robust semi-variograms.  For these zones, either the semi-variograms from the zones
in Block 1 that exhibited similar styles of mineralization were assigned, or data from a number of
zones in the block were combined to estimate semi-variograms.
Gold grades were estimated into each of the block models using Ordinary Kriging.  The grades of
blocks  in  each  of  the  12  structures  were  estimated  separately,  each  estimate  based  only  on  the
composites contained within the interpreted structure.  The minimum number of composites used
for  estimation  varied  from  12  to  16  for  the  higher  confidence  estimates,  achieved  by  selecting
data within the semi-variogram range of the estimate.  Lower confidence estimates were informed
by  as  few  as  six  composites.  Specific  gravity  was  assigned  based  on  the  mean  density  of  the 
samples for each zone; these varied from 2.85 g/cm3 to 3.01 g/cm3 for fresh rock and a density of 
1.58 g/cm3 was assigned to the saprolite.
The  Mineral  Resource  was  estimated  using  The  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and
Petroleum  (CIM)  Best  Practice  Guidelines  and  was  classified  in  accordance  with  the  2010  CIM
Definition  Standards.    Grades  of  saprolite  were  extrapolated  from  the  fresh  rock  samples  and
these  estimates  were  assigned  an  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  classification.    The  saprolite  zone
comprises approximately 2% of the total Mineral Resource.  Estimates achieved using a minimum
number  of  either  12  or  16  composites  within  the  semi-variogram  range  were  considered  for
Indicated Mineral Resource classification.   Locally, on  the fringes of  the  higher confidence  areas,
this condition was relaxed to one and a half times the semi-variogram range in order to create a
cohesive  zone  of  Indicated  Mineral  Resource.    Indicated  Mineral  Resources  were  declared
predominantly  in  areas  where  the  drillhole  spacing  is  approximately  40  m.    Inferred  Mineral

Page: 4
Resources  were  largely  declared  within  the  sparser  drilled  areas  of  approximately  80  m  drillhole
spacing and extrapolation away from the drillhole grid was limited to 20 m in the strike direction
and 40 m in the down dip direction, approximately in line with the mineralization trend.
The  Project  contains  an  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  of  3.65  million  tonnes  (Mt)  at  a  gold  (Au)
grade of 4.69 g/t and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 2.62 Mt at a gold grade of 4.08 g/t (Table
1).    The  Mineral  Resource  is  reported  above  a  cut-off  grade  of  2.4  g/t  Au  and  areas  have  been
classified  as  Indicated  or  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  of  CIM
(2010).

than 800 m below surface.
The 2012/2013 (“current”)  drill programme has successfully extended  mineralization in all blocks
down-dip,  with  Mineral  Resources  to  a  depth  of  approximately  800  m  below  surface  in  Block  1,
approximately 500 m in Block 2, approximately 420 m in Block 3, an average of 350 m in Block 4
and  200  m  in  the  Southern  Structure  (Block  5).    All  resource  blocks  remain  open  with  depth
although, in Block 1 and the main B2FW unit in Block 2, the grades and mineralized widths appear
to  decrease  with  depth.    The  emerging  recognition  of  a  prominent,  steeply  plunging  trend
(“shoot”)  in  the  majority  of  mineralized  zones  that  is  associated  with  increased  grades  and
thicknesses  indicates  that  any  future  step-out  drilling  should  focus  on  following  these  steeply
plunging zones.
In  addition  to  the  2012/2013  diamond  drilling  programme,  an  additional  diamond  drillhole  and
eight  RC  drillholes  have  been  completed  but  assay  results  have  not  been  received  as  of  the
effective  date  of  this  report.    Several  of  these  holes  returned  visibly  mineralized  intersections
(visible  gold  and/or  arsenopyrite)  that  supports  the  existence  of  potential  mineralized  zones
(“strike  extensions”)  between  Block  1  and  Block  5  (Southern  Structure  1)  and  southwards  from
Southern Structure 1 towards Southern Structure 2.
Further work, in the form of RC drill testing of potential strike extensions and testing of a VTEM
anomaly  is  recommended  and  costed  in  Section  26.    In  the  event  of  positive  results  being
returned  from  this  work,  a  subsequent  phase  of  work,  comprising  diamond  drilling  of  the  strike
extensions with a view to adding to the Mineral Resources at the Property and additional RC drill
testing of VTEM anomalies, is proposed.

INTRODUCTION
2.1
Scope of Work
The MSA Group (Pty) Limited (MSA) has, on behalf of Polo Resources Limited (Polo), completed a
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (MRE)  for  the  Komahun  Gold  Project  (The  Property),  in  the  Kono
District of the Eastern Region of Sierra  Leone.   Polo holds a 90% interest  in the  project  with the
remaining 10% being held by Plinian Guernsey Limited.  Plinian Capital Limited was appointed by
Polo as the Property operator in March, 2012.  The Property comprises a granted Mining Licence
(comprising the entire former Nimini West and Nimini East exploration licences), covering an area
of 100 square kilometres and was issued in accordance with Clause 2M of the Mines and Minerals
Act (2009) of Sierra Leone on 26 November 2012 for an initial period of 25 years.  Polo (AIM and
BSX:  POL)  is  a  globally  focused  natural  resources  and  mine  development  investment  company
that  selects,  acquires  and  manages  investments  in  companies  and  projects  with  value
enhancement potential and  potentially attractive growth prospects.  MSA  were  retained by  Polo
to undertake a MRE on the basis of additional drilling subsequent to the most recent MRE on The
Property (February 2012).
This  Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  to  comply  with  disclosure  and  reporting  requirements
set  forth  in  the  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101  –  “Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Minerals
Projects”, the corresponding Companion Policy 43-101CP, Form 43-101F1 (Form F1), of June 2011
(collectively the Instrument) and the Mineral Resource and Reserve classifications adopted by CIM
Council  in  August  2000.    All  monetary  figures  expressed  in  this  report  are  in  United  States  of
America  dollars  (US$)  unless  otherwise  stated  and  all  co-ordinates  are  in  Universal  Transverse
Mercator (UTM)  Zone 29 Northern Hemisphere, using  the WGS84 datum.  All compass bearings
are recorded as true north.
2.2
Principal Sources of Information
MSA has based its review of the Property on information provided by Polo and Plinian,  together
with  technical  reports  compiled  by  previously  engaged  consulting  firms,  and  other  relevant
published and unpublished data.  In addition, MSA was appointed, in May, 2012, to manage and
execute all exploration and data management activities at Komahun in accordance with NI 43-101
guidelines.  A listing of the principal sources of information is included at the end of this Technical
Report in Section 27.  Site  visits by the authors to the Property, in the Kono  Province of  eastern
Sierra Leone, are listed below:
  Dr B.M. Clarke: 6-13 June 2012, 16-20 September 2012
  Mr J.C. Witley: 9-13 December 2012
MSA  has  endeavoured,  by  making  all  reasonable  enquiries,  to  confirm  the  authenticity  and
completeness of the technical data upon which the Technical Report is based.  A final draft of the
report was also provided to Plinian, along with a written request to identify any material errors or
omissions prior to lodgement.

The  Property  is  considered  an  “Exploration  Project”  which  still  carries  a  significant  degree  of
exploration risk.  The authors’ consider, however, that the historical work programmes executed,
in  addition  to  those  completed  in  2012  and  to  date  in  2013  (and  which  form  the  basis  for  this
Technical  Report)  are  appropriate  for  the  level  of  understanding  of  the  Property.    The  Komahun
Property  is  considered  to  be  sufficiently  prospective,  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  exploration
risk, to warrant further exploration and assessment of its economic potential,  consistent with the
proposed work programme.
The  recommended  exploration  and  evaluation  programme  and  estimated  costs  are  summarised
in  Section  26.    The  Company  will  aim  to  raise  sufficient  working  capital  to  ensure  at  least  two
years of operation.  It is understood by MSA that the funds to be raised by the Company (through
its holding company) will be committed to the exploration and development of the Property.
The Technical Report has been prepared on the basis of information available up to and including
25 June 2013.

RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS
The  Property  consists  of  a  granted  Mining  Licence  (comprising  the  whole  of  the  former  Nimini
West  and  Nimini  East  exploration  licences).    It  covers  an  area  of  100  square  kilometres  and  was
issued  according  to  Clause  2M  of  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Act  (2009)  of  Sierra  Leone  on  26
November 2012 for an initial period of 25 years.
The legal status associated with the tenure of the Property has not been independently verified by
MSA, nor is MSA qualified to verify, the legal status of these concessions although MSA has been
provided  with  copies  of  the  permitting  documents  provided  to  Nimini  by  the  Ministry  of  Mines
and  Mineral  Resources,  Government  of  Sierra  Leone  and  the  proof  of  registration  of  those
documents.    The  present  status  of  tenements  listed  in  this  report  is  based  on  information  and
copies  of  documents  provided  by  Nimini,  and  the  report  has  been  prepared  on  the  assumption
that  the  tenements  will  prove  lawfully  accessible  for  evaluation,  as  has  been  the  case  to  date.
Neither  the  authors,  nor  MSA,  are  qualified  to  comment  on  the  legal  history  of  the  Property
including prior joint venture agreements and the current operator agreement. Comment on these
agreements is for introduction only, and should not be relied on by the reader.
Similarly, neither MSA nor the authors of this report are qualified to provide detailed commentary
on environmental and social issues associated with the Property.
No  warranty  or  guarantee,  be  it  express  or  implied,  is  made  by  MSA  with  respect  to  the
completeness  or  accuracy  of  the  legal  and/or  environmental  aspects  noted  in  this  document.
MSA  does  not  undertake  or  accept  any  responsibility  or  liability  in  any  way  whatsoever  to  any
person or entity in respect of these parts of this document, or any errors in or omissions from it,
whether arising from negligence or any other basis in law whatsoever.
In preparing this document, the Qualified Persons have relied on technical input from Nimini staff,
particularly  with  regard  to  historical  exploration  activities  undertaken  on  the  licence  by  the
previous  operator,  AXMIN.    The  extent  of  this  reliance  is  largely  around  the  timing  of  these
historical  activities  and  the  methodologies  employed  during  the  execution  of  these  historical
activities  (Section  6).    The  summary  provided  by  Camus  and  Cukor  (2012)  has  been  used
extensively  to document these activities, however, the data presented and interpretations drawn
in  Section  6  form  part  of  this  current  Technical  Report  and  are  not  reliant  on  the  accounts  of
Nimini staff or the Camus and Cukor (2012) Technical Report.

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
4.1
Location
The Komahun project is located in the Kono District of the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, which
borders Guinea to the east, the Districts of Tonkolili and Koinadugu to the north and west and the
Districts of Kailahun and Kenema to  the south.  It is located approximately  230  km (as the  crow
flies) due east of the national capital of Freetown and 100 km east-southeast of the regional hub
of Makeni (Figure 4-1).   The project is located  within  the  Nimini Mining Limited  Mining Licence,
which  was  granted  on  8  November  2012  for  an  initial  period  of  25  years.    The  Nimini  Mining
Licence comprises the full extent of the Nimini West (No. 33/2011) and Nimini East (No. 34/2011) 
Exploration  licences  (EL’s)  that  were  granted  to  Nimini  Mining  Limited  on  30th  March  2011  for  a 
total surface extent of 100 km2.  The project exploration camp is located adjacent to the village of
Komahun  on  the  eastern  edge  of  the  Mining  Licence,  approximately  4.5  km  south  of  the  main
Makeni-Koidu road.
4.2
Mineral Tenure, Permitting, rights and Agreements
Nimini Mining Limited was awarded a Large-Scale Mining Licence (No. 01/2012) on 8 November
2012  (effective  9  November  2012),  for  an  initial  period  of  25  years.    The  Mining  Licence  was
granted  under  the  conditions  prescribed  by  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Act  of  2009  and  Nimini’s
obligations under this grant are documented in the award certificate as follows:
  Annual  licence  payments,  commencing  5  November  2012,  of  the  sum  of  $500,000  (or  that
sum  that  may  be  from  time  to  time  prescribed  by  the  regulations).    The  first  payment  was
made by Nimini to the National Revenue Authority (NRA) on 5 November 2012.
  Annual advance surface rent payments to landowners and occupiers of the land described in
the Mining Licence through the appropriate local authority.  The amount of this surface rent is
to  be  determined  by  mutual  consent  pursuant  to  Section  34  of  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Act
(2009) for all land occupied or used by Nimini for the purposes detailed in Section 163 of the
same act.
  Payment to the NRA a minerals royalty for minerals mined as per Section 148 (2) of the Mines
and Minerals Act (2009).
  Provide  the  Government  of  Sierra  Leone  (GoSL)  with  suitable  financial  surety  in  respect  of
rehabilitation costs as part of the Environmental Management Programme (EMP) according to
Section 136 of the Mines and Minerals Act (2009).

Notwithstanding  the  above,  it  is  understood  that  a  key  outcome  of  the  granting  of  a  Mining
Licence  is  the  subsequent  execution  by  the  Government  of  Sierra  Leone  and  Nimini  of  a  Mine
Development  Agreement  (MDA),  in  which,  inter  alia,  specific  fiscal  terms  are  set  out  and
environmental  and  social  obligations  are  documented.    It  is  understood  that  Nimini  is  currently
negotiating the terms of this MDA.
4.3
Environmental Liabilities and Legislation
While MSA is not retained to, nor is it qualified to, provide a comprehensive analysis of possible
Environmental  liabilities,  an  overview  of  the  legislative  parameters  governing  potential  future
mine development are provided below.
In  order  for  a  mine  to  be  developed,  an  updated  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)
compiled in terms of the requirements of Section 24-26 of the Environmental Protection Agency
Act  (EPAA)  of  2008  is  required.    This  EIA  identifies  the  aspects  and  impacts  of  the  operation  as
well as the mitigating measures proposed for each.
Nimini  was  granted  its  EIA  permit  in  August,  2012,  as  a  pre-requisite  to  the  application  for  the
Mining Licence.  It is understood that this licence is in good standing.
Beyond  complying  with  the  EPAA  of  2008,  and  a  general  duty  to  protect  the  environment,  the
Mines and Minerals Act of 2009 also specifies the following requirements:

environmental baseline assessment, including detailed measurements
  details  on  the  operations,  reclamation  and  closure;  including  resource  requirements,
emissions,  impacts,  immitigable  impacts,  mitigation  measures,  timetables,  budgets,  human
resource  capacity,  monitoring  methodology  and  mechanisms,  and  an  overall  environmental
management plan
requirement to consult the public and verify possible impacts
annual environmental report, covering progress against the environmental management plan


NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 11

requiring any water diversion to be approved within an environmental management plan.
Based  upon  engagement  with  regulators  concerning  the  operation’s  performance  and  the
content of the annual environmental reports as submitted to the regulator, the conditions or the
environmental permits for the operation may be revised and updated.
The protection of the soil and water resources that constitute the environment is governed by the
Forestry Act of 1988. Part VI, section 21 of this Act, indicates that no protected forest may be cut,
burned,  uprooted,  damaged  or  destroyed,  except  with  a  written  permission  from  the  Chief
Conservator of the forest.
Removal  of  a  national  or  community  forest  by  whatever  means,  without  legal  permission,  is  an
offence  punishable  with  a  fine  not  exceeding  ten  thousand  Leones  or  a  term  of  two  years
imprisonment or both.
Section  17  of  the  Forestry  Act  also  stipulates  that  any  one  permitted  to  fell  timber  is  liable  to
paying a reforestation fee.  The fee is based on the quantity of timber felled or extracted, and the
rate is to be prescribed by the Minister. The fee, which is to be paid to the Chief Conservator, will
be  paid  into  a  reforestation  fund  established  under  the  Act.  However,  at  the  end  of  any  mining
operation,  if  the  mining  company  embarks  on  reforestation,  and  satisfies  the  Chief  Conservator,
then the fee previously paid for reforestation, will be refunded.
In  terms  of  the  Forestry  regulations  of  1989,  community  forests  are  generally  managed  by  the
Forestry  Division  or  by  agreement  with  the  Division;  it  could  be  managed  by  the  local
government;  or  Community  Forest  Association.  Based  on  this  responsibility  of  the  Division,  no
protected forest shall be tampered with in any way as is stated in section 21, subsection (2) of the
Forestry  Act  -  1988,  without  written  permission  from  the  Chief  Conservator  of  the  forest.    In
section  15  of  the  Forestry  Regulations  1989,  subsection  (1),  it  is  stated  that  a  licence  may  be
issued by an inspector of the Forestry Division authorising the holder of the mining lease, to clear
land  in  a  classified  forest  for  the  purpose  of  mining.    However,  having  acquired  this  licence,
deforestation of, or vegetation removal from the environment, can only be effected by the mining
company under certain conditions. These conditions are found under section 15, subsection 3 and
are highlighted below:

removal of vegetation, can be done for mining operations only within an area licensed for this
purpose

the  specified  land  area,  shall  be  cleared  within  a  stated  time,  but  trees  requested  not  to  be
felled, removed or damaged, are to be left standing

trees to be felled shall be identified, except where total felling is authorised

Page: 13

a  forest  severance  fee  and  a  minor  forest  produce  fee,  shall  be  paid  in  respect  of  all  forest
produce that is merchantable, which may be removed by clearance of vegetation

at the completion of mining, the area shall be replanted with approved crops or trees by the
mining  company,  or  provision  made  for  this  to  be  done  by  payment  of  the  estimated
reforestation cost

required  method  of  cultivation  and  silviculture,  specified  by  the  chief  conservator,  must  be
employed.
As  a  method  of  environmental  protection,  it  is  stated  in  section  38  of  part  XI,  that  no  land
between the high and low water marks, nor those above the high water mark on both sides of the
bank  of  any  waterway,  covering  a  distance  of  one  hundred  feet  (approximately  33  m),  shall  be
cleared of any vegetation except permitted by a clearance licence.
Sacred  bushes  are  protected  by  the  stipulated  regulations  of  section  40,  whereby  clearance  of
vegetation from land designated as sacred bush, is prohibited except by clearance authority from
the Chief Conservator.
The  Wildlife  Conservation  Act,  1972,  sets  out  specific  provisions  dealing  with  the  protection,
management and conservation of these areas and the limitations therein are highlighted in Part II
of the Act and include the following:
  prohibition  of  all  forms  of  hunting,  capture  and  other  activities  leading  to  the  injury  of  wild
animals
  destruction of any plant form by any means including fire


fishing within these protected areas
erection  of  structures,  construction  of  dams,  forestry,  agriculture,  mining  or  prospecting
activities

introduction of species from outside of the boundaries of the reserve.

ACCESSIBILITY,  CLIMATE,  LOCAL  RESOURCES,  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND
PHYSIOGRAPHY
5.1
Accessibility
Air  access  to  Sierra  Leone  is  via  the  Lungi  International  Airport,  located  on  the  opposite  side  of
the Rokel River delta from the country’s capital and largest city, Freetown.  Passage from Lungi to
Freetown is  either by ferry, motorboat or hovercraft (approximately 45 minutes) across the delta
or alternatively can be undertaken by vehicle in approximately 4 hours.  The airport is served by
international carriers from Africa and Europe.
Other major cities in Sierra Leone are Bo, Kenema and Makeni; these are connected to Freetown
via a network of paved roads whereas the bulk of other roads in the country are gravel roads in
various states of repair.
The Nimini project is accessed from Freetown via the Lunsar-Makeni highway or alternatively via
the longer Masiaka-Yonbana highway through Bo and Kenema.  East of Makeni, the road to the
camp that continues on to Koidu (approximately 30 km), deteriorates rapidly in heavy rainfall due
to poor maintenance.  The drive from Freetown to site varies from  approximately 7 hours in the
dry season to more than 9 hours in the rainy season.  Four-wheel drive vehicles are required in the
rainy  season.    It  is  understood  that  a  contract  has  been  awarded  by  the  Government  of  Sierra
Leone  to  an  international  contractor  for  the  upgrading  of  a  section  of  this  road.    It  is  further
understood that future contracts will be awarded to extent the road upgrade to Koidu.
The  most  actively  explored  parts  of  the  Mining  Licence  are  well  served  by  a  network  of  gravel
roads  (Figure  4-2)  that  require  four  wheel  drive  vehicles  in  the  rainy  season  and  vehicles  with
good ground clearance throughout the year.
The  nearest  port  is  Freetown  and  the  nearest  rail  head  is  at  African  Minerals’  Tonkolili  iron  ore
mine,  approximately  75  km  to  the  west,  although  this  is  currently  a  single-user  line.    There  is  a
viable  airstrip  approximately  12  km  east-northeast  of  Komahun  at  Yengema,  which  light  aircraft
are  able  to  use.    In  late  2012,  Nimini  completed  the  construction  of  a  helicopter  landing  pad
(Figure  5-1)  to  support  emergency  medical  evacuations  and  provide  quicker  access  to  site  for
short site visits.
5.2
Climate and Physiography
5.2.1
Climate
Sierra Leone,  and the Komahun project site,  are  characterised by  a tropical  climate with discrete
dry  and  rainy  (monsoon)  seasons.    Average  annual  rainfall  in  the  Kono  district  is  approximately
2800  mm  (Figure  5-2),  with  the  majority  of  this  rain  falling  in  the  wet  season  months  of  June-
October.  Average monthly rainfall in excess of 500 mm per month is common in the rainy season.

Page: 15
Figure 5-1  Aerial view of the Komahun exploration camp.  Note the artisanal alluvial mining activity
in the top-left of the picture.
Temperature ranges  are  narrow, with temperature data from Bo (90 km southwest of  Komahun)
presented in Figure 5-2 showing  mean  monthly  maxima ranging between 34°C  in March (at the
peak  of  the  dry  season)  to  28°C  in  August  during  the  peak  of  the  rainy  season.    Minimum
temperatures  show  even  less  of  a  range,  fluctuating  between  approximately  19°C  and  22°C.
Relative humidity is high, with an average of approximately 86% in the mornings (reaching 93% in
the  rainy  season)  and  an  average  of  64%  in  the  afternoons  (reaching  approximately  80%  in  the
rainy season).
The Harmattan wind, which brings dry and dusty  air  in from the  Sahara desert to the north  and
east, prevails from December to March.
While  the  rainy  season  presents  challenges  to  access  and  vehicular  movement,  it  is  possible  for
exploration activities to continue during this period, as in 2012 when approximately 25,000 m of
core were drilled during the rainy season on the Property.

5.2.2
Physiography
Sierra Leone has a total surface area of 71,740 km2 of which land area comprises 71,620 km2 and 
surface  waters  120  km2.  It  is  divided  into  four  distinct  geographical  regions  namely  the  coastal
Guinean  mangroves, the  wooded hill  country, an upland plateau (in which the  Komahun project
lies), and the eastern mountains. The eastern portions of the country, near the Liberian border and
southeastern  Guinean  border,  comprises  large  plateaus  interspersed  with  high  mountains,  with
the highest peak, Mount Bintumani, rising to 1,948 m above sea level (masl) (Figure 5-3).
The  Property  occupies  elevations  between  approximately  350  masl  and  approximately  750  masl
and the local topography comprises low-relief valley floors, steep hillsides and ridge crests.  The
main  topographic  feature  on  the  Mining  Licence  is  the  broad  north-south  trending  ridge  that
corresponds  to  the  supracrustal,  BIF-containing  sequence  that  is  associated  with  pervasive
silicification.    It  is  likely  that  there  are  sufficient  lowland/low  gradient  areas  to  accommodate
potential  mining-related  infrastructure  including  a  processing  plant  and  tailings  management
facility.  These mine infrastructure issues are currently being investigated as part of a Preliminary
Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Komahun Project.
The Nimini area belongs to the Upper Guinean forest floral kingdom, and comprises a variety of
rainforest vegetation types.  Much of the forested area is secondary regrowth, and large amounts
of  the  licence  area  have  been  partially  cleared  for  shifting  cultivation  in  addition  to  unregulated
logging.  A survey  to the west of the Mining Licence area has shown that approximately 18% of
the
natural
vegetation
has
been
disturbed
(http://apes.eva.mpg.de/apeswiki/index.php/Image:Nimini_human_signs.jpg),  and  it  is  evident
from  site  visits  that  the  degree  of  non-exploration  related  disturbance  in  the  vicinity  of  the
Komahun is substantial due to the agricultural and logging activities noted above.
5.3
Local Resources and Infrastructure
The  Nimini  exploration  camp  is  located  adjacent  to  the  village  of  Komahun  (also  referred  to  as
Komau), from where the project derives its name.  Local labour, including drill helpers, is sourced
from the village.  The area is not connected to the national electric grid and the camp is powered
by  two  diesel  generators.    The  majority  of  foodstuffs  and  drinking  water  to  support  the
approximately  80  man  camp  are  sourced  from  the  nearby  diamond  mining  town  of  Koidu
(approximately  30  km  east  of  Komahun)  although  many  of  these  foodstuffs  are  imported  from
Europe.
Large-scale  earthmoving  equipment  (bulldozers,  backhoes  and  excavators)  are  readily  sourced
from Koidu when required to supplement the onsite bulldozer owned by Nimini.  Routine vehicle
maintenance  is  carried  out  on-site  by  the  Nimini  mechanic  and  fuel  (diesel)  for  vehicles,
earthmoving equipment and drill rigs is stored in 10,000 l bunded fuel tanks.
Water for domestic (non-drinking) use and drilling is sourced from a number of streams and rivers
that drain the licence area.  A water borehole has been sunk and commissioned at the exploration
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 18
camp  to  augment,  and  ultimately  replace,  the  current  domestic  water  supply.    Carpenters  have
been employed from Komahun village to build camp furniture as well as core-boxes.
Cellular  telephone reception is available throughout the camp and on  some parts of the Mining
Licence  and  broadband  internet  access  is  provided  by  a  commercial  VSAT  system.    The  nearest
medical  treatment  facility  is  the  Koidu  diamond  mine’s  clinic  and  there  is  a  Swiss-run  clinic  in
Makeni.  In July, 2012, Nimini contracted the services of two medical service providers to mitigate
the risk of potentially life-threatening injury and illness on site.  A contract was entered into with
the  West  African  Rescue  Association  (WARA)  which  provides  paramedic-assisted  helicopter
evacuations from sites in West Africa.  They have an established base in Freetown which includes
an emergency stabilisation and operating room and have two helicopters on standby for medical
evacuations.  Furthermore, iNhemaco, a private medical services company, has been contracted to
provide  an  onsite  Advanced  Life  Support  (ALS)  paramedic  and  to  develop,  stock  and  manage  a
small on-site clinic equipped to deal with minor injuries and to act as an assessment centre with
regard to initiating an evacuation in more serious cases.

HISTORY
6.1
Summary of historical work and property ownership
The  Nimini  Hills  greenstone  belt  was  first  documented  in  1929,  when  traverses  were  made  over
the  Nimini  Hills  by  the  prospector  Pollet,  who  reported  occurrences  of  schist  similar  to  those
encountered in the Sula Hills. Gold was first discovered in early 1930 near the village of Titimbaia
and  was  subsequently  mined  in  surrounding  streams  and  many  of  the  drainages  on  and  below
the slopes of the hills.
Between  1958  and  1965  E.  M.  Laing,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Sierra  Leone  Geological  Survey
(SLGS)  mapped  much  of  the  Nimini  Hills  area.    He  prospected  for  lode  gold,  focusing  on  the
Tongo River and near Komahun, where the first  occurrence of arsenopyrite-bearing banded iron
formation  (BIF)  was  noted  and  sampled.  Laing  noted  mineralization  consisting  of  arsenopyrite
with some pyrite in banded ironstone (magnetite quartzite and magnetite amphibolite quartzite)
amphibolite and quartz veins. He described at least three bands of ironstone having a maximum
width of ten feet (approximately 3 m) and which varied mineralogically along their strike.
Between  1963  and  1966  R.  Garrett  carried  out  an  extensive  stream  sediment  geochemical
sampling  programme  over  the  Nimini  Hills  as  part  of  his  doctoral  thesis  for  the  Royal  School  of
Mines,  Imperial  College  London.  He  analysed  the  minus  80  mesh  fraction  spectrochemically  for
silver  (Ag),  arsenic  (As),  bismuth  (Bi),  cobalt  (Co),  chromium  (Cr),  copper  (Cu),  gallium  (Ga),
manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) and
zinc (Zn). Several strong As anomalies corresponded with the areas investigated by Laing.
In 1975, H. R. Rollinson carried out geological and structural mapping of the entire Nimini range
with  a  large  area  mapped  on  a  scale  of  1:25,000.  In  the  same  year,  G.  Vallance  carried  out  field
work  and  submitted  an  interim  report  to  the  SLGS  on  the  Komahun  Lode  Gold  prospect  which
defined the Block One area currently being explored by Nimini.
An exploration licence over the Nimini Hills area was awarded to New Jersey Zinc in 1977, which
carried out a reconnaissance visit of the area to assess the prospective potential for volcanogenic
massive sulphide deposits (VMS) in the area. A report by J. F. Ariz indicated an area for follow-up
exploration close to the Komahun Gold Prospect, although it is not known if the company carried
out any follow-up exploration.
Six  drill  holes  were  reportedly  drilled  by  Leo  Temp  Mining  Development  Company  of  Ontario,
Canada,  in  1981  –  1982.  It  is  believed  that  four  of  the  six  holes  intersected  mineralization,
although the exact location of these holes is uncertain.
Between  1989  and  1992,  the  European  Economic  Community  (EEC)  sponsored  structural
geologist,  J.  Dehandshutter  to  perform  a  mapping  programme  over  the  Nimini  Hills.    He
recommended  several  areas  for  further  exploration.  Using  the  Landsat  image  of  the  area  as  a
guide, a lithological and structural map was produced. In conjunction with the mapping, regional
soil  geochemical  sampling  was  conducted  and  several  anomalous  gold-  in-soil  anomalies  were
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 22
identified,  including  the  Komahun  anomaly.    Follow-up  trenching  was  undertaken  by  the  EEC
before the project was abandoned due to political instability in the country.
AFCAN  Mining  Corporation  (now  Eldorado  Gold  Corporation)  under  its  75%  owned  subsidiary
Nimini Mining Limited, was granted the license for Nimini West (EPL 9/02) on 1 October 1996 and
for Nimini East on 15 November 2002. The duration of the Nimini West license was extended by
the  Ministry  of  Mines  without  any  work  being  undertaken  on  the  license  because  of  the  civil
unrest in the area. Ashanti Goldfields entered into a Heads of Agreement with Nimini Hills Mining
Company,  a  company  then  held  by  AFCAN  Mining  Corporation.  The  two  major  surface
geochemical anomalies identified by the EEC were tested by Ashanti Goldfields in 2003 and whilst
confirming the Komahun anomaly, questioned the authenticity of the Nimikoro Grid soil anomaly
and Ashanti subsequently withdrew from the Nimini Heads of Agreement.
Following Ashanti’s withdrawal, AXMIN Inc. entered into a Heads of Agreement with Nimini  Hills
Mining Company on 22 March 2004, to undertake a 6 month due diligence investigation on the
Nimini West and Nimini East licences, which was superseded by a substantive joint venture signed
on  23  September  2004.    In  February  2011,  AXMIN  increased  its  ownership  to  100%  of  the
properties by purchasing the minority interest held by Nimini Mining Limited.
In February 2011, AXMIN announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Fuller Capital Corp.
(FCC),  a  capital  pool  company,  to  complete  a  transaction  that  would  result  in  FCC,  directly  or
indirectly,  acquiring  from  AXMIN  (SL)  Limited,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  AXMIN,  all  of  its
assets  in  Sierra  Leone,  including  the  Nimini  East  and  West  Exploration  Licenses  and  AXMIN’s
Matotoka Exploration License, in exchange for the issuance by FCC of common shares of FCC to
AXMIN.
The  transaction  was  not  completed,  and  in  August  2011,  AXMIN  announced  that  it  had  entered
into  an  agreement  with  Polo  whereby  Polo  would  acquire  a  51%  interest  in  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  AXMIN,  Nimini  Holdings  Limited,  which  owned  AXMIN’s  Sierra  Leone  assets,  with
AXMIN  retaining  a  49%  interest  in  The  Project  for  a  cash  consideration  of  US$7.5  million.  The
Agreement  pertained  to  the  Nimini  East,  Nimini  West  and  Matotoka  exploration  licenses.  The
definitive agreement was signed at the end of September, 2011, and in December, 2011, AXMIN
further  announced  that  it  had  closed  the  sale  of  its  remaining  49%  interest  in  Nimini  Holdings
Limited  (“Nimini”)  to  Polo  for  a  cash  consideration  of  US$9  million,  resulting  in  Polo  holding  a
100%  interest  in  the  Nimini  East,  Nimini  West  and  Matotoka  exploration  licenses,  through  its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Nimini  Holdings  Limited  (for  an  aggregate  cash  consideration  of
US$16.5  million).    By  31  December  2011,  Polo  had  invested  an  additional  US$1.5  million  in
exploration and drilling.
In March, 2012, Polo announced that it had appointed Plinian Capital Limited (“PCL”) as operator
of  the  Nimini  Gold  Project  (the  Nimini  West  and  East  licences  in  addition  to  Matotoka).
Additionally,  Plinian  Guernsey  Limited  (“PGL”),  an  entity  100%  owned  by  the  partners  of  PCL,
subscribed for new shares representing 10 per cent of the issued share capital of Nimini Holdings
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone

Limited, the holding company of the  Nimini Mining Limited and Matotoka Mining Limited, for a
total consideration of US$2.5 million.
For  the  purposes  of  this  Technical  Report,  all  drill  programmes  prior  up  to  the  effective  date  of
the 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate (20 February 2012) are considered as recent drill programmes
and  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimates  attached  to  these  programmes  as  historic  estimates.
Similarly, all other exploration work completed prior to the 2012 MRE is considered historic work
and  is  reported  in  Section  6.2.    Current  exploration  and  drill  programmes  refer  to  those
programmes conducted by the Company as currently constituted.
6.2
Historical Exploration
The historical  exploration activities undertaken by  AXMIN at the Property are described in detail
by Camus and Cukor (2012) and summarised as follows:
  4,100  soil  samples  were  collected  and  assayed  for  gold  and/or  analysed  with  multi-element
ICP; 2,958 were from the Nimini West License (from the Block 1 and surrounding areas) and
1,142 samples were from the northeastern portion of the Nimini East License.  Approximately 
49 km2 of the Mining Licence (i.e. Nimini West and Nimini East licences combined) has been
covered by soil sampling.
  109  stream  sediment  samples  were  collected  -  regionally  and  from  the  Sendekor  Structure
(2.5 km southwest of the Main Zone).
  722 pits were dug and sampled.
  6,725.30  m  of  trenching  were  completed  from  2004  to  2011,  and  comprised  170  individual
trenches.  Trenching results were utilised in the 2012 MRE but have been excluded from  the
current MRE (see Section 14).

In 2005, an airborne magnetic and radiometric survey was completed on 200 m line spacing
that  covered all of the Nimini West licence  and the northern part of the  Nimini  East licence,
for a total of 611 line kilometres.
  A  detailed  follow-up  ground  magnetic  survey  was  undertaken  for  9  line  kilometres,  at  line
spacings of either 50 or 100 m.
  An  area  of  approximately  33  km2,  centred  on  the  Block  1,  was  covered  with  a  LIDAR
topographic and satellite imagery (Ikonos) survey in February, 2011.
Elements  of  these  programmes  pertinent  to  the  current  report  are  discussed  briefly  below.    The
nomenclature  of  prospective  regions  within  the  Nimini  Mining  Licence  has  remained  constant
since  the  inception  of  surface  sampling  activities  in  2004,  and  is  retained  for  the  current  report.
These areas are referred to as “regional” prospects by Nimini staff.  They are shown in Figure 6-1
and  have  emerged  as  potentially  prospective  areas  through  ongoing  exploration  activities  since
2004.

6.2.1
Soil sampling
First-pass  soil  sampling  was  executed  on  a  400  m  x  50  m  grid,  with  samples  taken  from  up  to
50cm below surface where possible. Comprehensive information was collected from each sample
location  including  the  topography,  geology  and  regolith  along  with  details  on  the  soil.  Samples
were taken by digging  a narrow pit  with  the material at the bottom collected  and put into craft
paper sample bags. The samples were originally air dried and processed on site with 100 g of the
>  80  micron  clay  fraction  sent  for  analysis.    After  2008,  whole  samples  were  sent  to  the  lab  for
preparation.  Soil  sample  assays  were  performed  by  OMAC  and  ALS  Tarkwa,  Bamako  and
Johannesburg by both fire assay and BLEG methods.  Infill soil sampling, generally at 200 m x 50
m spacing, was undertaken over areas identified as anomalous from the first-pass sampling.
The distribution of soil samples collected during AXMIN’s tenure on the two exploration licences
is shown in Figure 6-2, with a filtered plot of anomalous (>50 ppb or 0.05 g/t Au) soils following
in Figure 6-3.  The majority of the anomalous soil samples are from Komahun and its immediate
environs, Titimbaia, Sendekor and parts of the Boya area.
6.2.2
Pitting
The  location  of  pits  excavated  on  the  Nimini  licences  during  AXMIN’s  tenure  is  shown  in  Figure
6-4.
Square pits measuring 1.5 m wide were dug up to 3 m deep. Two kilograms samples were taken
from  channels  along  the  side  of  each  pit  bottom  that  was  oriented  across  the  strike  of  foliation
and  placed  in  plastic  sample  bags...  Samples  were  assayed  by  fire  assay  with  atomic  absorption
(AA) finish. Pits were logged as trenches with geology and structure recorded.
Pitting was carried out at Komahun and its immediate surroundings, the eastern part of Titimbaia
Sendekor and Boya.  The highest values returned were from Komahun and Sendekor.

6.2.3
Trenching
Historical trenching on the Nimini Mining Licence was performed over certain areas of anomalous
soils and pitting results.  The majority of  trenches have been excavated over Block 1, with lesser
amounts of trenching conducted over the Southern Structures, Sendekor and the eastern part of
Titimbaia (Figure 6-5).
The  more  recent  historical  trenches  are  still  visible  in  the  field  in  various  states  of  preservation.
Many  of  the  older  trenches,  however,  have  been  partially  or  completely  obliterated  by  drill  pad
and access road construction as well as artisanal mining activity.  A differential GPS (DGPS) survey
of  preserved  trenches  was  undertaken  in  2012  in  order  to  allow  for  their  inclusion  in  the  2012
MRE (Camus and Cukor, 2012).  Generally, trenches were excavated to cut the strike of structures
at  between  70°  and  90°  and  samples  collected  during  channel  sampling  were  considered  by
Camus and Cukor to represent 95-100% of true width.  As discussed in Section 14, MSA does not
consider  the  majority  of  sampled  trench  material  to  be  in-situ,  having  been  transported
downslope by colluvial action and, as a result, these have been excluded from the database used
for estimation of the current Mineral Resource.
Trenches  were  sampled  continuously  along  the  north  wall  and  subjected  to  the  same  shipping,
security, sample preparation and assay methodology as routine drill samples.  An identical QAQC
procedure  was  followed  for  channel  and  drill  samples  and  these  results  of  QAQC  on  the  Nimini
assay  database  (Section  11)  include  both  trench  and  drill  samples  and  their  associated  QAQC
samples.
A total of 37 significant intersections (defined here as >2.4 g/t Au over a minimum width of 2 m –
as per drilling results in Section 10) from 30 trenches are reported from the trenching programme.
The  majority  of  significant  trench  results  were  returned  from  Block  1  at  Komahun  with  other
notable  values  over  Southern  Structure  1  and  Block  2  (Figure  6-6).    Several  significant
intersections are reported from a zone located to the southeast i.e. in the hangingwall, to Block 1.
A summary of significant trench intersections (as defined above) is provided in Table 6-1.

Other historical work
The  aeromagnetic  survey  carried  out  in  2005  is  regularly  used  by  Nimini  staff  for  structural
geological  interpretation  and  work  programme  planning.    The  survey  clearly  delineates  BIF-rich
zones within the stratigraphy in addition to identifying major structural features and trends.
Stream  sediment  sampling  and  geochemistry  was  carried  out  by  Garrett  between  1963  –  1966.
Further to this, in 2003, Ashanti collected 224 regional stream sediment samples from the Mining
Licence  area  and  53  samples  from  the  Wongo  River.  AXMIN  collected  an  additional  41  samples
from the Wongo, its tributaries and from the Bakuya area in 2005.
The  LIDAR  topographic  and  satellite  imagery  survey  is  used  as  the  topographic  model  for  the
MRE  presented  in  Section  14  and  the  imagery  is  extensively  used  for  regional  programme
planning purposes.
6.3
Historical Mineral Resource Estimates
MSA  is  aware  of  two  historical  Mineral  Resource  Estimates  that  have  been  declared  for  the
Komahun  Project.    These  estimates,  described  below,  are  not  being  treated  as  current  Mineral
Resource  Estimates  by  Nimini  and  have  been  superseded  by  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate
presented  in  Section  14  of  this  report.    As  such,  the  Qualified  Persons    for  the  current  estimate
have  not  undertaken  sufficient  work  to  comment  on  the  quality,  veracity  or  categorisation  of
these historical estimates nor is it deemed necessary that they do so.
6.3.1
SRK (2008)
The  SRK  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  (Pittuck,  2008)  was  based  on  a  total  of  22,370  m  of  drilling
through the effective date of 30 September 2008.  The estimate was undertaken by the sectional
construction of wireframes at a nominal 0.8 g/t threshold while maintaining a minimum width of 2
m.  This sectional interpretation resulted in the delineation of six discrete wireframes, four within
the  current  Block  1  area  and  two  further  to  the  east  within  the  current  Block  2  area.    The
wireframes  enclosed  mineralized  envelopes down to  a maximum depth of 350  m below surface.
Assay results were composited to 2 m intervals and a total of 119, 2 m composites were used for
the  Mineral  Resource  Estimate.    No  capping  of  assay  results  was  applied.    An  omnidirectional
semi-variogram was produced for all the mineralized zones and estimation carried out on blocks
of 5, 15 and 5 m in the x, y and z directions, respectively, in Block 1 and 5, 20 and 5 m (x, y, z) in
Block 2.  In all cases, a minimum number of 8 samples and maximum number of 16 samples were
used  for  the  grade  estimation.    The  SRK  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  0.37  million
tonnes (Mt) at 9.1 g/t for 110 thousand ounces (koz) ( all from the Main mineralized zone).  The
Inferred  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  was  3.1  Mt  at  4.3  g/t  for  435  koz  from  the  Main  and
Southwest Zones) stated at a global cutoff grade of 1.8 g/t Au.  This is shown in Table 6-2.

above) of 435 koz but have not endeavoured to determine the reason for the discrepancy
6.3.2
SGS Geostat (2012)
SGS Geostat (SGS) issued a Mineral Resource Estimate and statement for the Komahun Property
in August, 2012, with an effective date of 20 February 2012.  The technical details of this estimate
are documented in Camus and Cukor (2012), a summary of which is reproduced below.
The database used for the MRE comprised 239 drill holes, 170 trenches, 2,595 drillhole orientation
surveys,  13,325  assay
intervals,  9,615
lithologic  descriptions  and  6,735  specific  gravity
measurements. Furthermore, as part of their data validation programme, SGS reassayed a  total of
555 samples (including all 254 which returned a primary assay result in excess of 5 g/t) and found
the results to exhibit no material bias.  Assays were composited to 1.5 m intervals.
SGS capped assay results at 40 g/t Au in order to reduce the risk of the high-grade skewness of
the grade distribution.   This capping resulted in a reduction of contained gold by approximately
5%.
Cross sections were constructed from drill holes and trenches at intervals ranging from 20 m to 40
m.  Mineralized  intervals  were  manually  interpreted  in  each  drill  hole  and  trench  using  a  1  g/t
grade  envelope  and  2  m  downhole  (i.e.  apparent  width)  minimum  length.  Mineralization  was
intercepted at a maximum depth of 400 m below surface and the model extended to a maximum
of 500 m below surface. On most cross sections, however, the model only extended to 300 or 400
m below surface and all mineralized zones were considered to be open at depth. Eight structures
were  modelled  volumetrically, with three falling in the Main Zone area of the SRK estimate (and
corresponding  to  Block  1  of  the  current  report).  The  sections  of  each  structure  were  then
reconciled in three dimensions to form three dimensional shapes. The grades of blocks in each of
the  8  structures  were  estimated  separately,  each  estimate  based  only  on  the  composites
contained within the interpreted structure. Block dimensions were 1 m by 5 m by 10 m and were
rotated to ensure alignment and fit with the orientation of the mineralized structures. The Inverse
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 35
Distance  Squared  method  was  used  for  the  interpolation  of  block  grades  from  neighbouring
composites.
The SGS Mineral Resource statement comprises Indicated Resources of 3.53 Mt at 4.59 g/t for a
total of 521 koz Au and Inferred Resources of 2.25 Mt at 3.64 g/t for 236 koz Au (at 1.8 g/t cutoff)
(Table 6-3).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION
7.1
Regional and Local Geology
The  Property  is  located  in  the  Archaean  Nimini  Hills  greenstone  belt  within  the  West  African
Craton  (WAC),  which  comprises  the  oldest  rocks  in  West  Africa  and  therefore  Sierra  Leone.    The
WAC  comprises  predominantly  migmatitic  gneisses  and  granitoids,  into  which  metasedimentary
and  metavolcanic sequences  are infolded and preserved as greenstone belts.   These greenstone
belts have a general northwest-southeast trend in concordance with the regional structural grain.
In  general,  these  greenstone  belts  are  considered  to  be  synformal  remnants  of  originally  more
extensive  successions  that  have  been  significantly  eroded  (Camus  and  Cukor,  2012).    The  belts
range in length and width from over 130 km long and 6.5 km wide to approximately 40 km long
and 1 km wide.  In general, these supracrustal belts comprise a basal serpentinised and chloritised
ultramafic  portion,  overlain  by  mafic  rocks  (now  amphibolites)  which  are  in  turn  overlain  by  a
sedimentary  sequence  comprising  a  range  of  sedimentary  rocks,  including  BIF.    According  to
Camus  and  Cukor  (2012),  the  BIF  units  tend  to  thicken  towards  the  east  where  they  become  a
significant constituent of the stratigraphy.
The metamorphic grade of the craton tends to increase from greenschist and amphibolite facies
in the west to granulite facies in the east.  The basement cratonic rocks were deformed during the
Leonean orogeny at 2.95 Ga with the development of a pervasive east-west trending fabric.  The
uncomformably  overlying  supracrustal  sequence  was  then  deformed  together  with  the  cratonic
basement during the Liberian orogeny at approximately 2.75 Ga and resulted in widespread fabric
development  in  a  northwest-southeast  direction  under  a  northeast-southwest  directed  stress
field.    This  event  was  associated  with  the  localised  development  of  dextral  mylonitic  zones  and
associated  conjugate,  east-northeast-west-southwest  oriented  sinistral  shear  zones.    Partial  re-
activation  of  earlier  Leonean  structures  is  also  recorded.    The  Liberian  orogeny  was  also
associated with the emplacement of granitoid plutons and dykes.
The bulk of Sierra Leone is underlain by rocks of the WAC, with the exception of a coastal strip of
approximately  50  km  wide  comprising  marine  and  estuarine  sediments  of  Tertiary  and
Quaternary/Recent  age.    The  Precambrian  rocks  occupy  approximately  75  per  cent  of  the  areal
extent  of  Sierra  Leone  and  are  dominated  by  granitic  rocks  and  volumetrically  subordinate
greenstone belts.
The Leonean orogenic event was associated with the formation of a greenstone belt represented
by  the  Loko  Group  which  is  now  deeply  eroded  and  only  locally  preserved  as  outcrops  of
amphibolites, sillimanite-bearing quartzites and BIF’s and appears to have been deposited on the
pre-Leonean granitic basement.   Only the main deformational phase of the Leonean orogenesis
is preserved in the Loko Group.  Minor gold and cassiterite mineralization is associated with parts
of the Loko Group and is likely related to a late-Leonean granitisation event associated with the
formation of major shear zones on the WAC.

Page: 39
Other strongly deformed greenstone belts are known from north and central Sierra Leone.  These
greenstone  belts,  comprising  the  Kambui  Supergroup,  were  deposited  on  a  post-Leonean
basement  and  were  accompanied  by  the  emplacement  of  mafic  and  ultramafic  intrusions.    The
Kambui  Supergroup  includes  the  majority  of  the  schists  exposed  in  the  Sula  Mountains  and
Kangari, Kambui, Nimini and Gori Hills.  The ferruginous Marampa Group and the small Serekolia
and  Sankarama  greenstone  belts  are  also  included  in  the  Kambui  Supergroup.    As  discussed
previously,  all  of  the  greenstone  belts  comprise  a  basal  volcanic  sequence  including  ultramafic
and mafic pillow lavas overlain by a sedimentary sequence  of tuffs, psammitic and pelitic schists
and  conglomerates  and  BIF’s.    These  greenstone  belts  are  the  predominant  gold  repositories  in
Sierra  Leone  and  are  also  locally  prospective  for  molybdenite,  columbite-tantalite  (“coltan”)  and
chromite.  Contact zones with granitoids tend to acts as strain localisers and as such are generally
prospective  for  structurally  hosted  gold  and  molybdenite  mineralization  (see  Sierra  Leone
Supplement, Mining Journal, 2003).

The  Nimini  Hills  greenstone  belt  is  underlain  by  the  Nimini  Group  (the  equivalent  of  the  Sula
Group)  of  the  Kambui  Supergroup
(Figure  7-2)  which  was  deposited,  deformed  and
metamorphosed  during  the  Liberian  orogeny  (Williams,  1978).  Regionally,  the  Sula  Group  is
divided into the Sonfon and Tonkolili Formations (MacFarlane et al., 1974), the former comprising
ultramafics and amphibolites and the latter pelites, greywackes and BIF.
7.2
Property Geology
7.2.1
Geological overview
The  most  detailed  geological  coverage  of  the  Nimini  Mining  Licence  is  that  of  Dehandshutter
(1990),  who  mapped  the  Nimini  Hills  area  as  part  of  an  EEC-sponsored  initiative.    The  mapping,
produced  at  1:25,000  scale,  focussed  on  structural  and  stratigraphic  delineation  of  the
supracrustal  succession  in  the  area,  which  Dehandshutter  (1990)  subdivided  into  an  upper
Komahun Group and a lower Nimini Group (also occasionally referred to as the Grassfield Group).
A  detailed  geological  map  was  produced  that  is  shown  in  Figure  7-3.    The  Komahun  Project
mineralization  is  located  at  the  contact  between  an  amphibolite/BIF  package  and  the  overlying
metasedimentary package; this correlates with deposit type descriptions (Section  8) that describe
strong  geological  contact  control  on  mineralization  and  emphasise  the  importance  of  regional
contact zones, particularly between BIF zones and less competent sedimentary packages.
The  generalised  local  stratigraphy  at  Komahun  is  recorded  relative  to  the  mineralized  zone  and
comprises  an  amphibolite-dominated  hangingwall  with  a  prominent  developed  basal  talc-schist
unit  (former  ultramafic)  immediately  overlying  the  Zone  1  mineralization  that  occurs  at  the
contact  between  an  amphibolite  talc-schist  unit  and  a  BIF-rich  package,  with  Zone  2  hosted
largely within the BIF and the basal Zone 3  mineralization within a mixed package dominated by
amphibolite  with  minor  BIF.    The  footwall  to  mineralization  in  all  instances  is  a  prominent
phlogopite  schist.    It  is  evident,  when  compared  to  the  broader  stratigraphy  mapped  by
Dehandshutter, that the stratigraphy adopted for the  mineralized zones is overturned relative to
the actual stratigraphy, where the metasedimentary rocks i.e. phlogopite schists, overlie the mixed
amphibolite-BIF  and  mafic/ultramafic  packages.    This  is  also  consistent  with  the  regional
stratigraphy  of  greenstone  belts
in  Sierra  Leone,  which  are  characterised  by  a  basal
mafic/ultramafic sequence overlain by metasedimentary rocks.
7.2.2  Metamorphism and structure
The  metamorphic  assemblages  at  Komahun  are  characterised  by  chlorite,  phlogopite  (biotite),
magnetite,  garnet,  epidote  and  tourmaline  suggesting  a  lower  amphibolite/high  greenschist
facies metamorphism.
The Komahun deposit is hosted in a complex shear zone that is broadly concordant to the local
strike  and  is  associated  with  a  change  in  strike  in  the  local  stratigraphy.    The  timing  of
mineralization  is  speculative  and  both  primary/syngenetic  and  secondary,  syndeformational
replacement scenarios (see Section 8) have been put forward by Nimini geologists.  The authors
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone

more  readily  accept  the  latter  mineralization  model,  noting  the  strong  association  with  BIF  (see
Section 10).

7.3
Mineralization
The  current  drilling  programme  has  resulted  in  a  substantively  revised  nomenclature  for  the
various  mineralized  zones  as  well  as  the  delineation  of  geological  discrete  domains  that  are
referred  to  as  mineralization  “blocks”.    The  revised  zonal  as  well  as  block  nomenclatures  are
shown  in  plan  view  in  Figure  7-4,  in  relation  to  the  surface  extents  of  the  2012  MRE  wireframes
(Camus and Cukor, 2012).
The  current  drilling  programme  and  accompanying  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  presented  in
Section  14  has  also  resulted
in  the  identification  of  several  steeply-plunging  “shoots”
characterised  by  higher  grades.    The  shoots  plunge  steeply  within  the  plane  of  the  mineralized
zones  towards  the  northeast  and  are  subparallel  in  a  number  of  mineralized  zones.    They
correspond to parts of the mineralized zones that are also wider than the surrounding mineralized
zone  and  are  interpreted  to  correlate  with  dilational  zones  with  a  primary  structural.    These
steeply plunging trends are shown in “accumulated metal” i.e. grade x width long sections for  all
delineated mineralized zones in Figure 7-5 and Figure 7-6.
The geometry of the mineralized wireframes is further constrained by geology.   Mineralization in
Block 1, as well as the main B2FW unit in Block 2 is strongly controlled by the presence of BIF, as
shown  in  Figure  7-7,  which  has  resulted  in  strong  strain  partitioning  at  the  contacts  and  well-
constrained,  planar  mineralized  zones.    By  contrast,  zones  where  BIF  is  minimal  or  absent  and
where  mineralization  occurs  predominantly  within  amphibolites  are  characterised  by  less  planar
geometries,  changes  in  strikes  and,  in  the  case  of  both  Block  4  and  Block  3,  numerous  narrow
mineralized  zones  which  cannot,  with  the  current  amount  of  drilling,  be  modelled  as  discrete
zones  and  are  interpreted  as  oblique  splays  to  the  main  mineralized  zones.    The  geometric
disposition of mineralization in Block 3 approximates a horse-tail type structure at the edge of the
BIF horizon that persists through Block 1 and Block 2.
The BIF in Blocks 1 and 2 is not considered continuous and drillhole data suggests the presence of
several  narrow  BIF  “fragments”  in  Block  1  and  a  more  robust  BIF  unit  in  Block  2.    Given  the
markedly higher grades and tonnages from Block 1 (Section 14) it is proposed that the narrow BIF
fragments  in  Block  1  are  reflective  of  a  boudinaged  BIF  horizon  within  the  dominantly
amphibolitic  package.    The  more  competent  BIF  would  readily  accommodate  all  of  the  elastic
strain in a deformational setting, resulting in the formation of dilational zones adjacent to boudin
contacts and in boudin necks, akin to pressure shadows.

regionally), the metasedimentary phlogopite schist in the northwest is the uppermost stratigraphic
unit
7.3.1
Block 1
Gold mineralization in Block 1 is found in three discrete, steeply southeast dipping to subvertical
zones  i.e.  Zones  1,  2  and  3,  with  Zone  1  representing  the  apparent  hangingwall  of  the  Block  1
package  and  Zone  3  the  footwall.    The  block  has  a  strike  extent  of  approximately  500  m.
Mineralization  occurs  within  a  sequence  of  generally  schistose  rocks  of  assumed  mafic  volcanic
(amphibolite), ultramafic volcanic (talc schist) and metasedimentary (banded iron formation, chert,
phlogopite  schist)  origin.    Mineralization  is  structurally  controlled  within  broad  lithological
associations and each of the zones is readily identifiable on the basis of rock type, mineralization
style  and  position  relative  to  other  zones.    The  zones  are  approximately  subparallel  but  locally
diverge  and  converge,  both  down  dip  and  along  strike.  Gold  mineralization  is  associated  with
disseminated,  stringer  and  semi-massive  sulphides  (primarily  arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite)  within
quartz veins, siliceous magnetite amphibolites, amphibolites and magnetite BIF. Gold also occurs
in native form as visible gold.
The  zones  range  in  width  from  <  1  m  to  over  15  m  and  the  middlings/interzone  separation  is
highly variably, ranging from a typical approximately 15 m between each zone, diverging to over
30  m  at  depths  in  excess  of  600  m  below  surface.  At  shallower  depths  i.e.  <  400  m,  the  zones
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 48
locally converge.  Where present, the interzonal material is locally mineralized.  Figure 7-8 shows a
schematic interpretive section through Block 1.
7.3.1.1
Zone 1
Zone  1  is  developed  at  the  lithological  contact  between  a  variably  chloritic  talc  and/or
amphibolite schist and a siliceous BIF unit and is readily identifiable as a major quartz vein zone
containing  visible  gold  and  sulphide  intergrowth  (predominantly  arsenopyrite  and  to  a  lesser
extent pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite).   The quartz veins are concordant to the regional foliation and
can range in true width from < 1 cm up to 1.5 m, wall rock “remnants” can be associated with the
veins which allow this type of mineralization to be easily recognisable in the field and in drill core,
and  distinguishable  from  other  quartz  veining  (Figure  7-8).    The  widths  of  the  veins  indicate
substantial  dilation  associated  with  the  mineralizing  fluids  and  it  is  postulated  that  Zone  1
mineralization  is  preferentially  focussed  along  the  interface  between  the  schistose  and  ductile
amphibolite and talc schist and the competent siliceous BIF.   Narrow auriferous veins extend into
the wall rock, with sulphides disseminated  within these veins and in the  surrounding host rocks.
The abundance of sulphides within or near the veins is extremely variable with several areas within
the zone containing only trace sulphides and abundant visible gold (Figure 7-8).
7.3.1.2
Zone 2
Zone 2 occurs within and between the two major BIF horizons in Block 1.   The mineralization style
is complex and gold mineralization is typically associated with narrow quartz veins and/or BIF and
abundant arsenopyrite.  Narrow breccia intervals are also present within the Zone and the breccia
network  is  commonly  infilled  with  pyrrhotite.  Sulphides  are  disseminated,  aligned  with  the
foliation or  semi-massive  and consist of dominant  arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite.    The presence of
aligned/oriented
sulphides
strongly
supports  an  early/syn-deformational
timing
for
mineralization.
7.3.1.3
Zone 3
The  westernmost,  footwall  unit  within  Block  1,  contains  mineralization  that  is  hosted  in  silicified
amphibolite  and  high  strain  quartz  veins  within  amphibolite  and  garnetiferous  BIF  units.  Visible
gold  is  abundant  and  occurs  as  intergrowths  with  arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite.  The  Zone  is
generally separated from Zone 2 by a barren amphibolite, but the mineralization style is similar to
Zone 2.

7.3.2
Block 2
Block  2  comprises  three  mineralized  zones:  a  robust  footwall  zone  (B2FW)  and  two  variably
developed  zones  within  the  hangingwall.    Zone  2  mineralization  is  continuous  along  strike  for
approximately 360 m. Mineralized widths in Block 2 are significantly narrower than in Block 1, with
maximum true mineralized widths of 8 m and average true widths of between 1.5 and 2 m.  Inter-
zone  separation  is  typically  12  to  15  m  for  the  two  hanging-wall  units,  which  are  located
approximately  80  m  into  the  hanging-wall  of  the  footwall  zone.  The  zones  dip  steeply
(approximately 85 degrees) to the southeast and are subparallel.
As in Block 1, Zone 2 mineralization in Block 2 consists of silicified, planar-banded iron formation
(“BIF”) with gold intergrown with arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite disseminations, stringers, and minor
breccias  along  fractures  and  concordant  to  foliation  planes.  The  magnetite-BIF  is  frequently
garnetiferous.  The hangingwall mineralized zones in this block exhibit quartz veining within BIF.
Mineralization in the hangingwall units is similar in style to Zone 2. The hangingwall zones extend
for approximately 450 m in strike and are parallel to the B2FW unit. It is believed this hangingwall
mineralization  may  represent  a  continuation  of  the  hanging  wall  mineralization  which  is  only
poorly  developed  in  Block  1,  and  may  therefore  represent  a  significant  subsidiary  shear  zone  to
the main structure along which Block 1 and Block 2 mineralization is focussed.
7.3.3
Block 3
Block  3  is  located  along  strike  of  Block  2  to  the  northeast  and  extends  a  further  360  m  towards
the  eastern  edge  of  the  Mining  Licence  boundary.    The  block  is  characterised  by  subdued
topography  and  initial  drilling  over  the  structure  failed  to  intersect  significant  mineralization.  It
was not until NWKD201 was drilled in early 2011 that the potential for significant mineralization in
the  area  was  realised.  Subsequently  the  area  was  drilled  during  the  current  campaign  and  the
current MRE is the first time Block 3 has been included in a MRE for the Property.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 51
Gold  mineralization  occurs  mostly  as  free-gold  associated  with  vein  quartz  and  sulphides
(arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite)  in  altered  amphibolite.  The  highly  sheared  nature  of  the
mineralization makes grades and widths variable and the lack of BIF in the block appears to have
resulted  in  less  structural  localisation  of  the  mineralizing  fluids,  such  that  multiple  mineralized
zones (B3HW1, B3HW2, EEZ1 and EEZ1) have been recognised.  These zones are characterised by
highly variable widths and strike directions and appear to splay outwards from the edge of the BIF
unit in Block 2.
7.3.4
Block 4 – “Fault Offset”
Located in the apparent footwall of Block 1, mineralization in Block 4 was discovered through soil
sampling,  subsequent  trenching  and  a  limited  early  drill  programme.    Rock  types  present  are
similar  to  those  in  Block  1,  although  the  BIF  unit  that  characterises  Block  1  is  poorly  developed
and  rarely  intersected  in  Block  4.    The  phlogopite  schist  unit  which  dominates  the  footwall  of
Block 1 is present to the far north and east of the zone, talcose and typical Block  1 hanging wall
lithologies are present in the footwall of Block 4.
Mineralization is associated with quartz veins, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite typical of Block 1 style;
gold grade is  strongly correlated to  the percentage of  sulphide  minerals within the  amphibolitic
host  rock.  Veins  vary  from  50  cm  to  5.5  meters  wide.    Quartz  +  arsenopyrite  veining  is  the  sole
mineralization style in the northern part of the structure.
Nimini  geologists  maintain  that  Block  4  is  part  of  a  faulted  and  folded  offset  of  Block  1.  The
difficulty  in  tracing  high  grade  shoots  along  strike  highlights  the  structural  complexity  of  the
block.  Outcrop mapping suggests that the zone is split into a series of brittle fault blocks with a
larger fold system rotating the unit from a northeast-southwest strike orientation in the east to a
north-south  trend  in  the  west.    This  structural  complexity  has  not  been  successfully  modelled  in
the current MRE (Section 14) and it is noted that numerous mineralized intersections are present
in  this  block  that  will  require  additional  drilling  to  discern  their  orientations  and  relationship  to
other mineralized zones on the Property.
7.3.5
Southern Structures
Located 500 meters to the southwest of Block 1, mineralization was identified through a series of
surface geochemical sampling grids followed up with shallow trenching to reach saprolite.  In-situ
mineralization  associated  with  quartz  veins  and  kaolin  alteration  was  identified  in  several  of  the
trenches and subsequently the structure was tested by a man-portable diamond drilling rig. The
original soil anomaly was significantly displaced due to the prominent rotational creep of outcrop
and  movement  of  soils  down  the  hill  slope  to  the  west.  Initial  interpretations  anticipated  the
structure  to  have  a  similar  strike  to  the  already  identified  Blocks  1  and  2  but  further  drilling
confirmed that mineralization trends north-south.
Block  5/Southern  Structure  1,  which  is  the  sole  Southern  Structure  unit  included  in  the  MRE
(Section  14)  comprises  amphibolites  in  the  east  and  talcose  rocks  towards  the  west.    No  BIF  or
schists typical of Block 1 have been noted during field mapping, trenching or drilling campaigns.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 52
Mineralization  is  hosted  within  the  amphibolite  sequence  and  associated  with  vein  quartz  and
strong  phlogopite  alteration,  with  the  dominant  sulphide  being  arsenopyrite  with  subordinate
pyrrhotite.  The veins and associated minerals have been subjected to considerable strain and are
parallel  to  the  local  foliation  trend  (i.e.  north-south  on  this  part  of  the  licence).    Visible  gold  is
observed  in  the  majority  of  intersections  that  returned  grades  in  excess  of  3  g/t  Au.    True
mineralized widths are between 0.2 m and 5 m.  Mineralogically, Southern Structure 1 bears more
resemblance  to  the  Block  3  style  of  mineralization  than  the  auriferous  zones  typical  of  Block  1
zones.
Over 1.5 km south of Block 1 and approximately 700 m due south of Block 5/Southern Structure 1
lies  a  mineralized  structure  (Southern  Structure  2)  comprised  predominantly  of  BIF  that  strikes
north-south.  Only  minimal  exploration  (including  limited  drilling)  has  been  carried  out  over  the
structure which is still poorly understood and it is not a contributor to the 2013 MRE presented in
Section 14.
7.3.6
Geochemical signature of mineralization at Komahun
Only limited petrographic and geochemical characterisation work has been done at Komahun.  In
late 2012, drillhole NWKD316 was sampled honouring lithological contacts and analysed using an
aqua  regia  digestion  followed  by  ICP-AES  and  ICP-MS  finishes.  The  objective  was  to  determine
the  chemical  signatures  for  the  main  rock  types  known  in  the  licence  area  and  determine  what
other minerals are associated with gold mineralization which could potentially be used as “path-
finder”  elements  at  surface.  NWKD316  was  chosen  because  it  intersects  the  main  styles  of
mineralization as well as the talc schist, micaceous schists (phlogopite schist) and the amphibolite
rock units.
Arsenic  shows  a  good  correlation  with  mineralization  (due  to  ubiquitous  arsenopyrite)  and  was
not  found  to  be  present  in  elevated  quantities  away  from  mineralization.    It  is  a  well-known
pathfinder element in soils for mineralization over the Nimini area although limited multielement
soil  assays  have  been  carried  out  historically.    As  a  cautionary  note,  however,  arsenopyrite  is
known to occur in discordant and barren quartz-tourmaline veins and so is not an infallible guide.
Its use as a pathfinder element is well recognised because of its generally wide dispersion around
primary  mineralization,  however  the  mobility  of  arsenic  in  tropical  soils  due  to  weathering  and
microbia is well documented (Reith and McPhail, 2006).  Arsenic values of over  8,000 ppm  were
recorded  from  the  mineralized  intersection,  greater  by  several  orders  of  magnitude  than  the
surrounding wall rock.
Mercury showed a good correlation with mineralization, albeit at very low levels in fresh rock. Soil
gas  analysis  has  been  used  to  detect  deep  and  buried  gold  deposits,  and  may  represent  an
exploration technique which can be utilised on the lateritic terraces.
Bismuth,  antimony,  selenium,  strontium,  tellurium,  tungsten  and  yttrium  also  show  a  positive
correlation  to  gold  mineralization  with  yttrium  apparently  indicative  of  Zone  1  quartz  vein  style
mineralization.

From  a  lithological  perspective,  the  talc  schist  units  analysed  in  NWKD316  returned  typical
chemical  values  for  an  ultramafic  protolith,  with  elevated  levels  of  chromium,  magnesium  and
nickel  and  low  sodium,  titanium  and  potassium  values.    The  micaceous  phlogopite  schist  which
makes up the footwall and part of the hanging wall of the Komahun deposit and is the main rock
type  of  the  northern  part  of  the  licence  area  has  several  distinct  chemical  properties,  being
elevated in bismuth, iron, gallium, indium, potassium, lanthanum, lithium, molybdenum, niobium,
rubidium, thallium, uranium and zinc with moderate levels of magnesium
The amphibolite package did not return many unequivocal chemical indicators.  The amphibolites
are  known  to  be  mineralogically  diverse,  with  various  degrees  of  alteration  and  accessory
minerals. Possible signatures include  elevated levels  of calcium (calcic hornblende?), sodium and
strontium. There were only narrow BIF intersections in NWKD316 and although it is an important
mineralization  locus,  its  narrow  nature  makes  it  unlikely  to  be  a  major  influence  in  surface  soil
chemistry.
The  elevated  elemental  values  associated  with  known  mineralized  zones  discussed  above
suggests that, going forward, a proportion of all exploration soil samples collected at the Property
should be analysed for multiple elements in addition to gold.

DEPOSIT TYPES
The  Komahun  deposit  is  correlated  with  the  mesothermal  greenstone  belt  BIF-hosted  gold
deposit  type  described  by  McMillan  (1996)  and  with  the  BIF-hosted  type  (of  the  Orogenic  clan)
documented by Goldfarb et al. (2005) and Robert et al. (2007).  These typically low tonnage (1-5
Mt) but high grade (> 5 g/t) deposits typically occur  within or nearby to BIF horizons within the
stratigraphic  package  and  regionally,  most  deposits  are  associated  with  prominent  regional
structures and/or stratigraphic breaks/contacts.  Globally, only three known deposits of this type
are endowed with more than 10 Moz of gold (Homestake  – United States, Morro Velho - Brazil ,
and  Geita  –  Tanzania)  but  together  these  three  deposits  have  a  combined  gold  endowment  in
excess of 90 Moz, making deposits of this type attractive exploration targets.
Generally, these deposits are attributed to the reaction of gold and sulphur-bearing hydrothermal
fluids  with  the  iron  oxide  (or  sulphides)  in  country  rocks,  causing  precipitation  of  gold  and
sulphides.  The  gold  occurs  in  quartz  veins  as  well  as  in  the  immediate  wallrock,  where  the
precipitation  reactions  occur.    As  a  result,  the  deposits  are  broadly  stratiform  but  the
mineralization  can  be  locally  discordant.    Shear  zones  and  fault  systems  provide  access  to  the
chemically favourable BIF horizons and it is likely that the strong competency contrasts between
the BIF and its generally schistose, less competent country rocks result in strain localisation in, or
adjacent  to,  the  BIF.    Local  changes  in  strike  of  shear  zones  can  form  dilational  jogs  and
associated  gold  accumulation.    Globally,  all  known  deposits  occur  within  Archaean  and
Proterozoic greenstone belts.
Gold  typically  occurs  in  quartz  veins  and  veinlets  or  as  fine  disseminations  with  a  strong
association  with  pyrite,  arsenopyrite,  pyrrhotite  and  occasionally  magnetite  (McMillan,  1996).
Mineralization is generally  contained with Algoma-type BIF’s and  cherts although the associated
vein  systems  may  extend  into  other  units.    Given  that  the  deposits  are  usually  deformed,
mineralization  may  be  appreciably  remobilised  into  favourable  structures  and  thickened  in  fold
hinge zones.  Host-rock alteration is strongly controlled by the iron-rich nature of the rocks, with
primary  hematite  and  magnetite  being  replaced  by  pyrite  and  pyrrhotite.    Quartz,  generally
segregated into veinlets, is a common alteration mineral (Robert et al., 2007).
Two competing genetic models have been proposed for the formation of these BIF-hosted gold
deposits.    The  first,  and  most  commonly  accepted,  is  that  deformation  of  the  stratigraphic
sequence  focuses  hydrothermal  fluids  from  depth  into  a  chemically  and  structurally  favourable
environment  within  and  adjacent  to  the  BIF  units,  late  in  the  orogenic  cycle.    The  alternative
model draws parallels to currently active submarine exhalative systems and the strong association
with  chemical  sediments,  to  propose  a  syngenetic  origin  for  gold  mineralization  with
replacement-type features attributed to diagenesis and contact areas between  sulphide-rich and
sulphide-poor  material  as  primary  depositional  facies  boundaries.    The  latter,  syngenetic  model
has,  however,  fallen  out  of  favour  due  to  recent  studies  (e.g.  Poulsen  et  al.,  2000)  that  have
demonstrated a clear epigenetic origin for gold mineralization hosted in certain BIF deposits.

From an exploration perspective,  these BIF-hosted gold deposits tend to show enrichment in Si,
Fe,  S,  As,  B,  Mg,  Ca,  Au  and  Ag,  compared  to  Cu,  Zn,  Cd,  Pb  and  Mn  which  are  generally  only
moderately  enriched.    For  most  deposits,  Au  is  dominant  over  Ag  in  the  mineralized  zones.
Geophysically,  electromagnetic,  magnetic  and  Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  surveys  are  useful  in
mapping the high sulphide and magnetite content of the deposits.

hosted deposit type is shown bottom left

EXPLORATION
Exploration  activities  (other  than  drilling)  pre-March,  2012,  are  considered  historic  as  this  work
was  largely  done  under  the  auspices  of  AXMIN  and  subsequently  Polo  Resources.    They  have
been summarised in Section 6.  Exploration work conducted since March, 2012, is described below
and comprised the following key activities:
  An  airborne,  Versatile  Time  Domain  Electromagnetic  (VTEM)  survey  was  completed  in  early
2012,  totalling  1,408  line  km  at  100  m  spacing.    Data  acquisition  was  carried  out  in  late
December, 2011, and January, 2012, with the initial interpretation received in May, 2012.
  Pitting at Titimbaia


Infill soil sampling at Boya 2a and 2b and Mount Nimini
IP survey
  Structural geological assessment by Dr Andy Killick
Given the focus on the extensive drill programme carried out from March, 2012, to March, 2013,
the  surface  exploration  activities  undertaken  during  this  period  have  been  limited  to  small  soil
and pitting programmes, together with work conducted by external geophysical contractors and
consultants.    The  primary  aim  of  surface  exploration  at  the  Project  was  to  delineate  additional
potential mineralized zones in the “regional” prospect areas, with a view to developing targets for
ultimate drill testing.
9.1
VTEM Survey
An airborne (helicopter) Versatile Time Domain electromagnetic survey was carried out on behalf
of Nimini by Geotech Limited (Geotech) in December, 2011, and January, 2012, for a total of 1,011
line  kilometres,  flown  in  an  east-west  direction  across  the  Nimini  East  and  Nimini  West
exploration licences (now amalgamated into the Nimini Mining Licence).  Line spacing was 100 m
and north-south tie lines were flown at 4,000 m intervals.  The VTEM survey is considered as part
of the current exploration activities given that the interpretation report was received in May, 2012.
Minor corrections were made to the data set in May, 2013, when it was noted that the response in
the  X-coil  of  the  VTEM  instrument  was  significantly  smaller  than  usual;  the  corrections  were
carried out by Geotech.
The VTEM method is designed for detecting conductive material in the earth’s crust and, as such,
has been shown to be effective for the detection and delineation of:
  Semi-massive  to  massive  sulphides  that  exhibit  interconnectivity  and  hence  are  significant
conductors
  Magnetite-bearing  BIFs  and  serpentinised  ultramafic  rocks  that  contain  magnetite  as  an
alteration product
  Graphite i.e. graphitic shear zones
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 57
  Saline, and hence conductive, groundwaters
The rationale for the selection of the VTEM tool for exploration at Nimini was driven by the high
percentage of sulphides associated with gold mineralization at Komahun.  By extrapolation, it was
considered  possible  that  additional  sulphide-rich  mineralized  zones  may  be  delineated
throughout the licences by the VTEM survey.
Interpretation of the VTEM dataset was conducted by Tau Geophysical Consultants Limited (Botha
and  Combrink,  2012),  based  in  Calgary,  Canada.    Given  the  structurally  controlled  nature  of  BIF-
hosted gold mineralization, particular attention was paid to the delineation of structural features
including lineaments, strike orientation changes, structural splays and fold closures.  On this basis,
Botha  and  Combrink  (2012)  identified  12  target  zones  which  they  recommended  for  ground-
based  geophysical  and  geochemical  follow-ups.    The  location  of  these  zones  is  shown  in  Figure
9-1.  Conductive Maxwell plates were modelled at these target areas.
An apparent correlation exists between a modelled plate and Block 1 mineralization at Komahun.
Additional plates have been modelled in the hangingwall of Block 1 and 2 mineralization that may
account for narrow mineralized intersections from drillholes NWKD027, NWED003 and NWKD028.
This  plate  is  not  modelled  as  coming  to  surface,  which  may  account  for  the  lack  of  significant
trench  intersections  over  the  plate.    However,  some  significant  trench  intersections  are  noted  in
trenches  AX016,  AX016  NW_Ext,  TR012b  and  AX019  SE_Ext  (see  Table  6-1)  which  are  located  to
the southeast of the modelled plate and may reflect soil creep in a downslope direction.
Although  the  applicability  of  the  VTEM  method  to  the  style  of  mineralization  at  Komahun  is
locally valid i.e. in places of extreme sulphide enrichment such as the semi-massive sulphide zones
observed  locally  in  Zone  2,  Block  1,  it  also  likely  that  the  VTEM  survey  has  delineated  steeply
dipping BIF units as the conductive plates. Definitive testing of these plates should be undertaken
to ascertain their causal origins.  BIF units are known to be interbedded with phlogopite schists in
the hangingwall sequence to the southeast of Komahun (see  Figure 7-8), which may account for
the VTEM response and conductor depicted in Figure 9-2.
9.2
Pitting
A  limited  pitting  programme,  comprising  226  pits  excavated  around  the  Titambaia  regional
prospect  and  stretching  northwards  into  the  Yigbeda  prospect,  was  conducted  in  mid-  to  late-
2012.    The  pitting  programme  was  carried  out  according  to  the  established  procedures
documented  in  Section  6,  which  the  authors’  consider  appropriate  for  testing  saprolitic  portions
of potentially mineralized zones and structures.  The pitting was carried out at a nominal 25 m pit
spacing,  along  lines  spaced  between  150  m  and  1,500  m  apart.    The  primary  objectives  of  the
pitting  programme  were  to  test  the  north-south  trending  BIF  that  is  inferred  here  from  the
aeromagnetic data, in addition to testing of the Yigbeda Maxwell plate that was derived from the
VTEM interpretation (Section 9.1) and the contact between the metasedimentary Komahun Group
and  underlying  Nimini  Group.    Some  anomalous  historical  soil  samples  were  also  returned  from
this area.

Page: 58
The  results  of  the  pitting  programme  are  shown  in  Figure  9-3.    Of  key  interest  is  the  apparent
failure  of  the  programme  to  completely  cover  the  Yigbeda  Maxwell  plate.    Some  isolated
anomalous  values  were  returned  from  most  of  the  sampling  lines  but  there  is  insufficient
continuity of these anomalous values to construct a robust anomaly for further exploration.
9.3
Soil sampling
A  total  of  399  soil  samples  was  collected  from  March,  2012,  through  the  effective  date  of  this
report  by  Nimini  geologists  and  field  technicians,  according  to  the  methodology  described  in
Section  6.2.1.    The  methodology  is  considered  appropriate  for  the  aims  of  the  exploration
programme.   Sampling during the period under consideration was undertaken  at the Boma  and
Mount Nimini regional prospects, as infill programmes  following up anomalous  historical results
from these areas.  In addition to routine fire assays for gold, 50 per cent of the samples were split
off  at  the  laboratory  (ALS  Monrovia)  and  subjected  to  multielement  analysis  using  ICP-MS/OES.
The multielement data have not, as yet, been fully interrogated and only Au values are presented
here.
Samples were collected at nominal 50 m spacing along 100 m spaced sample lines.  At Boma, the
grids  were  oriented  east-west  whereas  at  Mount  Nimini,  the  grids  were  oriented  north-south  to 
allow for the  inferred east-west  strike in the  area.  A total of 1.95 km2 was  covered by the three
sampling grids.
Anomalous  Au  values  were  returned  on/near  both  western  and  eastern  contacts  of  the
amphibolite+BIF unit mapped by Dehandschutter (1990) in the Boma area.  By  contrast, very few
anomalous results were returned from the sampling at Mount Nimini.

IP survey
Between  January  and  March,  2013,  SAGAX  Afrique  SA  (SAGAX,  2013)  was  commissioned  to
undertake a ground-based induced polarisation (IP) geophysical survey, following a series of trial
lines over the Komahun Deposit that showed a positive correlation between known mineralization
in  Block  1  and  IP  response  using  the  pole-dipole  method.    A  total  of  9  trial  lines  for  1400  m
(oriented  on  140°)  were  completed  over  Block  1,  9  lines  for  9000  m  at  100  m  spacing  oriented
east-west over the Fault Offset i.e. Block 4 and a further 14, 200 m spaced east-west for 28,000 m
over the Southern structures, as shown in Figure 9-.
IP  surveys  return  data  on  the  resistivity  and  chargeability  of  the  subsurface  environment.    The
electrical  resistivity  of  rocks  depends  on  several  factors  including  the  presence  of  conductive
minerals  such  as  sulphides,  some  metallic  oxides  and  graphite  in  the  rock.  Most  rocks  without
these  minerals  are  usually  poor  conductors  and  their  resistivity  is  governed,  primarily,  by  their
porosity, degree of fracturing, salinity of pore water, the degree of saturation of the pore spaces,
and to a lesser extent by the intrinsic minerals that constitute the rock. Alteration processes such
as silicification and carbonation tend to reduce the porosity and hence increase the resistivity of
the rock. In igneous and metamorphic rocks, the resistivity is useful mainly in mapping conductive
minerals and fracture zones. In sedimentary rocks, the resistivity is frequently used in lithological
mapping  because  changes  in  lithology  are  often  associated  with  changes  in  porosity  (SAGAX,
2013).
Siliceous  units,  such  as  quartz  veins  and  cherts,  appear  as  local  resistive  anomalies.  Black
(graphitic)  schist  will  create  a  conductive  anomaly.  On  the  other  hand,  local  sedimentary  basins
(and  metamorphic  rocks)  are  generally  at  the  source  of  conductive  sectors  or  domains  because
sediments  are  more  porous  and  normally  more  subject  to  clayey  weathering  in  comparison  to
volcanic or intrusive rocks.
By  contrast,  a  high  chargeability  response  is  an  indication  of  the  presence  of  disseminated
sulphides,  some  oxides  or  cation-rich  clays  such  as  illite  and  montmorillonite.    The  strong
association between gold  mineralization and sulphides makes the IP method generally attractive
for gold exploration work.
The  survey  report  (SAGAX,  2013)  concluded  that  all  known  mineralized  zones  covered  by  the
survey  grid  are  associated  with  a  raw  chargeability  anomaly  associated  with  or  very  close  to  a
highly resistive anomaly.  The report further concluded that:
  The IP inversion is more difficult and less accurate over Block 1 due to the presence of highly
chargeable (and resistive) rocks in the immediate vicinity of the mineralized zone. This has the
effect  of  creating  a  relatively  low  chargeability  over  the  mineralized  zone.  The  anomaly
produced  by  the  mineralization,  readily  visible  on  raw  chargeability  pseudo-sections,  is
difficult to resolve in the inversion product.
  The  particular  geological  context  of  Block  1  (proximity  of  highly  chargeable  and  highly
resistive  units)  creates  the  impression  that  the  chargeable  anomalies  associated  with  it  are
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 64
weak,  however  the  chargeability  amplitude  of  17  to  20  mV/V  seen  over  some  of  Block  1  is
several times stronger than the 4-10 mV/V observed southwards from Block 1 to the Southern
Structure.

In  most  cases,  the  anomalies  relative  to  mineralized  zones  are  located  in  proximity  to  a
lithological  contact  reflected  by  an  important  change  of  the  chargeability  and/or  resistivity
background.  The  frequent  neighbouring  presence  of  a  conductor  is  attributed  to  shearing,
which tends to be spatially located at strong lithological contrast zones i.e. BIF in contact with
the phlogopite schist footwall contact.
Six target areas (Figure 9-6) have been outlined with a total of 70 chargeable anomaly axes (linear
features interpreted from individual anomalies along the IP lines using the raw filtered data).  With
several  IP  targets  not  falling  over  significant  soil  anomalies,  the  majority  of  these  high  priority
targets  are  untested,  and  it  will  not  be  clear  whether  the  IP  anomalies  correspond  with  gold
mineralization until further work is carried out. Only one drill hole designed to test an IP anomaly,
NWKD394  between  Block  One  and  Southern  Structure  One,  has  been  completed.  The  hole  did
intersect a narrow zone of arsenopyrite and associated gold mineralization (although not directly
on the anomaly).
9.5
Structural geological assessment
In February 2013, independent structural geologist, Dr Andy Killick, was commissioned by Nimini
to undertake a structural geological assessment of the Property.  Dr. Killick visited site for 10 days
in late February/early March, 2013, during which time he assessed the sparse surface exposures as
well as several drillhole cores.  Two key results emerged from his assessment:
  A major structural contact i.e. a tectonic juxtaposition, was recorded in Block 1 as indicated by
different  fabric  orientation  populations.    In  the  Qualified  Persons’  opinion,  this  tectonic
contact is likely between the predominantly ultramafic “hangingwall” to Block 1 mineralization
and  the  metasedimentary  “footwall”.    Stratigraphically,  the  “footwall”  is  likely  to  be  the
youngest  stratigraphic  unit.    Based  on  Dr.  Killick’s  interpretations,  the  Qualified  Persons
further  conclude  that  the  tectonic  contact  is  manifest  as  a  shear  zone  that  is  likely  localised
along the BIF package in Blocks 1 and 2.
  The strong steeply plunging lineation, considered by the Qualified Persons to be analogous to
the  steeply  plunging  “shoots”  discussed  in  Section  7,  was  consistently  noted  by  Dr.  Killick,
who considered this a key structural element controlling mineralization.

DRILLING
A  total  of  421  holes  totalling  92,016  m  of  diamond  drilling  (DD)  has  been  undertaken  on  the
Nimini  Mining  Licence  since  2005.    The  drilling  undertaken  by  AXMIN  (from  2005  to  2008)  and
Polo  (from  October,  2011  to  the  20  February.  2012,  i.e.  the  effective  date  of  the  2012  MRE)  is
considered  “recent”  as  the  drillhole  samples  meet  the  spatial  and  QAQC  criteria  to  warrant
inclusion in a NI 43-101 compliant MRE and has been included in the current MRE.  Subsequent
to the effective date of  the 2012 MRE, a further 164 diamond holes  and four deflections (for an
additional 55,501 m of drilling) have been  completed  (the  “current” drilling)(Figure 10-1); results
from the current programme are discussed below.
All of the drill holes, recent and current, fall within the Nimini West Exploration licence.  Of this, a
total of 409 holes were considered for inclusion in the new MRE (Section 14) as they fall within the
general vicinity of Komahun.  Of these 409 holes, a total of 344 holes (for 80,205 m) fall within the
area of interest for Mineral Resources (see Section 14); the balance are first pass exploration holes
at  insufficient  drilling  density  to  support  Mineral  Resource  Estimation.    A  summary  of  all  drilling
carried out to date on the Nimini Licence is provided in Table 10-1 below.

In addition, a total of 8 reverse circulation percussion (RC) drillholes totalling 1,421 m were drilled
over the Southern Structure.  Assay results for these 8 holes were received after the cutoff date for
the MRE in Section 14 and have subsequently not been used to inform the estimation of Mineral
Resources in the Southern Structure.  Two of these “RC” holes were finished with diamond drilling
to ensure adequate recovery over the mineralized zone.

Current drilling programme rationale
The  current  drilling  programme  (20  February,  2012,  to  31  March,  2013)  was  designed  with  the
following objectives in mind:
  Downdip  extension  of  Block  1  and  Block  2  mineralization  to  add  to  the  Mineral  Resources
contained within these blocks;

Infill drilling in Block 1 to improve the classification of the Mineral Resources contained within
this  block  (as  per  2012  MRE)  and  to  convert  the  2012  MRE  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  into
Indicated Mineral Resources; and
  Strike extension drilling, both to the southwest i.e. Block 4 (Fault Offset) and Block 3.  Block 3
mineralization  had  not  been  drill  tested  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  current  drill
programme.
No  diamond  drilling  was  planned  or  carried  out  on  the  Southern  Structure  in  the  current
programme and the restated Mineral Resource for this block (Section 14) was developed  on the
basis of reinterpretation of existing drillhole intersections from recent drilling programmes.    The
8  completed  RC  holes  were  not  used  to  supplement  the  Mineral  Resource  Estimation  over  the
Southern Structure due to the assay results becoming available only after the cutoff date for the
MRE.  These results, and a thorough discussion of the RC drilling programme are expected to be
included in subsequent MRE’s and Technical Reports.
10.2
Drilling methods
10.2.1  Diamond drilling
The current drilling was carried out by Boart Longyear Sierra Leone from March, 2012, to March,
2013, using up to 5 track-mounted LF-90 diamond drilling rigs.  Drilling continued throughout the
rainy  season  from  June  to  October,  2012,  but  was  periodically  halted  on  several  occasions  in
September,  2012  due  to  safety  concerns  about  drilling  in  the  heavy  rain  and  limited  vehicular
access to the steep hillside in Block 1.
Holes were generally collared with HQ diameter (63.5 mm core diameter) and cased down to NQ
diameter  (47.6  mm  core  diameter)  once  the  saprolite  had  been  passed  and  fresh  bedrock
intersected,  although  several  holes  were  drilled  to  completion  in  HQ  to  minimise  drillhole
deviation encountered on some of the less-steeply inclined holes.  All current holes were drilled as
inclined holes, with an average collar dip of 57.5° from the horizontal.  Deeper holes generally had
steeper inclinations.  Given the subvertical nature of the mineralization, restrictions on hole-collar
positions imposed by topography  and  the physical  equipment limitations of drilling deep (>400
m) holes at angles less than 50°, the majority of  mineralized intersections are oblique to the drill
trace  (approximately  45°).    It  should  be  noted  that  the  significant  majority  of  holes  exhibit
significant downhole deviation in dip, with the  drillhole trace shallowing with depth (i.e. drillhole
“lift”)  and  the  intersections  with  the  mineralized  zones  at  depth  are  generally  less  oblique  than
predicted from the initial setup dip on the drill rig.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 69
A stabilised, hexagonal core barrel assembly was fitted to all rigs to attempt to reduce the amount
of lift and deviation experienced by most of the deeper drill holes.
A  total  of  8  drillholes  (for  2,736  m)  in  the  current  programme,  targeting  Block  1  mineralization,
failed to reach the mineralized zones as the drill rods became stuck in the hangingwall talc schist.
In  order  to  ameliorate  this,  four  of  the  deeper  holes  were  drilled  from  the  footwall  i.e.  northern
side of Block 1.

Drilling and logging protocols
10.3.1  Drillhole setups and collar surveys
Initial  drillhole  collar  positions  were  established  using  a  hand-held  global  positioning  system
(GPS) unit or surveyed by Nimini staff using a total station from the UTM control grid established
over the licence area. Once the pad area was cleared to the drill contractor’s specification, a picket
marking  the  drill  collar  location  was  placed  on  the  pad,  usually  with  a  front  and  back  sighting
picket to assist in aligning the rig. The final rig alignment was made using a compass, allowing for
a 7 degree magnetic declination.  The initial azimuth and dip of the  drillhole was checked with a
single-shot survey tool reading, usually after 12-15 m of drilling.
Upon hole completion, the drillholes were permanently marked by a labelled concrete plinth and
a  capped  PVC  pipe  cemented  into  the  drillhole  to  indicate  the  drillhole  orientation.    Drillholes
collars  were  surveyed  in  using  a  Leica  differential  GPS  and  total  station;  in  2012  this  was
undertaken  by  the  registered  land  surveyor  David  Kelli  and  in  2013  Nimini  staff  took  over  this
function after a differential GPS was purchased and survey base station was established in camp.
Surveyed  drillhole  locations  are  checked  against  the  high-resolution  (centimetre-scale  accuracy)
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 72
LIDAR  topographic  survey  and  resurveying  was  carried  out  in  the  event  of  a  discrepancy.      All
drillhole collars have been successfully picked up using the differential survey tool.
10.3.2  Down-hole Survey
Downhole  surveying  was  carried  out  using  a  Reflex  EZ-TRAC  instrument,  supplied  by  the  drill
contractor. The first orientation reading was recorded as high up the hole as possible (usually 12 –
15m) to allow for the hole to be re-collared without significant loss in time or expense if there was
significant  deviation.    Single  shot  readings  were  then  taken  at  either  15  meter  or  30  meter
intervals,  in  order  to  track  deviations  in  dip  or  azimuth  of  the  drillhole  and  facilitate  possible
corrective action if required; single shot readings  were recorded by the drillers  on a logging slip
and supplied to the geologists at shift change in order for deviations to be monitored.  Upon hole
completion, multi-shot readings were taken every 3 m as rods were broken and pulled out of the
hole.    Due  to  the  presence  of  magnetite  and  pyrrhotite  in  the  mineralized  zones,  MSA
recommended  gyroscopic  surveys  to  be  carried  out  to  assess  the  potential  influence  of  these
magnetic minerals on the Reflex survey readings.  A  Reflex gyroscopic tool was used to survey a
series of holes in Block 1 throughout the current drill programme and it was noted that no major
difference  between  the  Reflex  multishot  and  gyroscopic  results  existed  i.e.  the  influence  of
magnetic material is minimal.
Downhole  survey  results  were  corrected  for  magnetic  declination  when  they  were  downloaded
from the instruments portable computer at the camp office.
10.3.3  Core orientation
Core  orientation  was  carried  out  on  selected  holes  using  a  Reflex  ACT  III  digital  surveying
instrument.  This allows core to be oriented in geographical space for structural logging using the
structural jig in the core shed (see Section 10.3.5).
10.3.4  Core handling
Nimini  employed  a  number  of  field  technicians  who  monitored  drill  progress  and  core  handling
on a continual basis at the drill rigs.  These technicians ensured that core was correctly handled by
the  drillers,  of  acceptable  quality,  and  correctly  placed  into  core  boxes  at  the  drill  rigs.    The
technicians ensured that stick-ups were correctly measured by the drillers and that drilling blocks
were  inserted  on  a  run-by-run  basis  and  correctly  marked  up  by  the  drillers.    These  technicians
were  also  responsible  for  ensuring  that  core  boxes  were  correctly  labelled  with  the  drillhole
number and depth range prior to the core being transported to the logging shed.
10.3.5
Logging
Core received at the coreshed was logged according to the established project protocols (logging
processes) that were reviewed and  modified by MSA in June, 2012.  The  logging procedure  was
carried out sequentially in the following order:
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 73
10.3.5.1  Recovery and geotechnical logging
Core  was  fitted  and  a  centre-line  (orientation  line  for  oriented  core)  marked  down  the  entire
length of the core.  Recovery logging is carried out on a run-by-run basis and the core was metre-
marked during the recovery logging process.  Structural and geotechnical logging was carried out
on each drillhole prior to any further logging processes.  Structural features measured included:
  Number of fractures (on a run-by-run basis)
  Calculated fracture density
  Vein density

Joint, fracture and veins including infill material
  Qualitative rock hardness
  Orientation  of  foliation  planes  and  structural  features,  oriented  using  a  jig  (when  core  is
oriented)
  Rock Quality Designation (RQD)
Data  was  captured  onto  pre-printed  log  sheets  before  being  uploaded  into  the  exploration
database.    A  detailed  structural  logging  protocol  has  been  drafted  by  Nimini  and  reviewed  by
MSA  with  a  view  to  more  detailed  structural  logging  to  be  done  in  the  future.    This  logging
protocol  places  specific  emphasis  on  likely-mineralization  controlling  structural  features  (shears,
fold closures, veins etc.).
10.3.5.2
Lithology and alteration logging
Lithological  logging  was  carried  out  on  the  core  following  the  completion  of  geotechnical  and
structural  logging.    Lithological  intervals  were  marked-up  on  the  core  and  logging  is  executed
according  to  the  logging  protocol,  which  included  predefined  lithological,  alteration  and
mineralization  style  and  type  lookups.    Particular  attention  was  paid  to  the  identification  of
sulphide  type  and  style  as  well  as  the  presence  of  visible  gold,  which  was  marked  on  the  core.
Logging  data  was  captured  onto  pre-printed  log  sheets  and  uploaded  to  the  exploration
database in the office.  Core photography was carried out upon completion of lithology, alteration
and mineralization logging (which were executed simultaneously on the same log sheet) but prior
to sampling (see Section 11).
10.4
Drilling results
The recent and current drill programmes at Komahun are characterised by good core recoveries,
with typical recoveries in the mineralized zones between 97% and 100%.  Recoveries in the upper,
saprolitic portion of the drillholes are more variable but average approximately 70%.  These lower
recoveries in the saprolite are not considered material to the MRE presented in Section  14 given
that the saprolitic portion of the Komahun deposit accounts for only 2% of the total gold content
of the deposit.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 74
Significant  results  from  the  current  drill  programme  have  been  regularly  reported  in  the  public
domain  since  September,  2012.    Several  cutoff  criteria  have  been  used  to  disclose  these  drilling
results in terms of minimum widths and grades.  These significant results have been reconstituted
below  at  common  cutoff  criteria  of  2.4  g/t  over  a  minimum  of  downhole  length  of  2  m  i.e.
corresponding to accumulated Au of 480 cm.g/t (Table 10-2)
Key results from the drilling include (refer also to Section 14):
  The delineation of four discrete mineralized zones in Block 3, representing an additional 360
m of strike extension to the northeast of Block 2 to an average depth of approximately 420 m
below surface.
  Significant  depth  extension  of  all  zones  in  Block  1.    Zone  1  has  been  extended  to
approximately 750 m below surface, Zone 2 to approximately 675 m below surface and Zone
3  to  approximately  770  m  below  surface  (in  comparison  to  the  extent  of  these  zones  as
understood in the 2012 MRE).  Both the widths and grades of these zones generally decrease
with depth, however.
  The downdip and strike extension of two discrete mineralized zones in the hangingwall to the
main mineralized zone in Block 2.  The main mineralized zone has been extended downdip to
approximately  450  m  below  surface  whereas  the  hangingwall  zones  have  been  extended
downdip to approximately 400 m below surface.  Approximately 75 m of strike extension have
been  added  to  both  hangingwall  units.    The  grade  in  the  main  Block  2  unit  decreases  with
depth.

Further delineation of Block 4 mineralization (the former “Fault Offset”) and the intersection of
multiple  mineralized  zones  in  this  block  that  may  potentially  be  converted  into  Mineral
Resources with additional drilling.
  A  narrow  arsenopyrite-bearing  intersection  (approximately  0.5  m  from  201.80  m)  in
NWKD394  (Figure  10-3)  which  is  located  approximately  halfway  between  Block  1  and  Block
5/Southern Structure and suggests possible strike continuity between these blocks.
  Several of the RC holes have produced visible gold in panned  cutting samples.   These holes
include  NWRC002  immediately  to  the  north  of  the  modelled  Southern  Structure  1  (Block  5)
wireframe (Section 14) and NWRC006 and NWRC007 to the south of the modelled extents of
the Southern Structure 1 wireframe, towards the area informally known as Southern Structure
2, where recent drilling has intersected  mineralization. The low drilling density and unproven
continuity  of  mineralization  has  prevented  the  delineation  of  a  discrete  mineralized  zone  at
this time.
As of the effective date of this report, assay results for NWKD394 and the RC holes had not been
received.

The geometries of the zones modelled on the basis of the completed current drilling programme
are  shown  in  relation  to  the  wireframes  from  the  2012  MRE  (Camus  and  Cukor,  2012)  in  Figure
10-4.
Drilling results from the current programme are shown alongside recent drilling results in a series
of sections (section location: Figure 10-5, Figure 10-6 to Figure 10-13).  Current holes are shown
with  a  dark  green  drillhole  trace,  whereas  recent  holes  are  shown  with  a  dark  grey  trace.
Simplified geological logs are plotted on the right hand side of the drill trace and assay results, as
colour coded numeric bands, on the left hand side of the drill trace.  The  drillholes are shown in
relation  to  the  modelled  zone  wireframes  (as  per  Section  14)  (colour  scheme  as  per  Figure  7-4).
The sections have an average width of approximately 40 m to allow for the inclusion of as  much
drilling data as possible; as a result some assay data is slightly off-section and appears offset from
the mineralized zone wireframes.

The completion of the current drill programme  has shown Block 1, comprising Zones 1, 2 and 3,
to have a strike length (over which all three zones are persistent) of approximately 500 m and to
persist  to  depths  of  250  m  below  sea  level,  850  m  below  surface.    Within  the  plane  of
mineralization,  a  steeply  plunging  (approximately  70°  to  the  north-east)  “shoot”  trend  of  high
grade  and  thick  mineralization  has  emerged  from  the  2013  MRE  (Section  14),  being  particularly
well developed in all zones of Block 1, as well as Block 4.
In  Block  2,  drilling  has  proven  continuity  of  all  three  mineralized  zones,  albeit  with  variable
development along strike and downdip.  The current programme has delineated a total of 360 m
of strike length in Block 2 and has also demonstrated a clear offset between Block 2 and Block 1 to
the southwest.
Mineralization  in  Block  3  has  been  shown  to  comprise  four  separately  modelled  zones,  and  is
characterised by greater variability in strike and a general northwards swing in strike.  Block 3 has
a  total  strike  extent  of  some  360  m  to  an  average  depth  below  surface  of  420  m.    The  Block  3
hanging-wall  zones  tend  to  be  narrow  (1.5  to  3  m  true  width)  and  have  an  average  inter-zone
separation ranging between 5 and 10 m.   The modelled mineralized zone in Block 4 dips steeply
to  the  southeast  and  is  subparallel  to  Block  1  mineralization  which  is  located  about  70  m  (true
distance)  in  the  hanging-wall.    No  additional  diamond  drilling  has  been  carried  out  on  the
Southern Structure since the 2012 MRE and the revised wireframe geometry is the result of data
reinterpretation.    The  introduction  of  screen  fire  assay  (SFA)  techniques  (further  discussed  in
Section  11)  for  the  analysis  of  strong  sulphide-mineralized  and  visible  gold-samples  has  had  a
demonstrable positive effect on reported gold grades and in the authors’ opinion the SFA results
significantly ameliorate the known issues of under-reporting of coarse gold by routine fire assay
techniques.    The  SFA  methodology  and  sampling  protocol  is  discussed  in  greater  length  in
Section  11  but  results  are  presented  in  Figure  10-14  below.    The  plot  shows  the  mass-weighted
composite screen fire assay result i.e. the composite final gold result, in relation to the routine fire
assay undertaken on the fine fraction of the same sample.  Significant grade uplift is indicated by
the  regression  line  and  the  location  of  the  significant  majority  of  SFA  results  above  the  1:1
correlation line, particularly at high grades.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
The MRE presented in Section 14 is based solely on assay data generated from drill core samples.
Unlike the 2012 MRE, the Qualified Persons are of the opinion that there is insufficient confidence
in the correlation of mineralized zones in the trenches with those intersected in shallow drill holes
and  note  the  common  offset  between  mineralized  trench  intersections  and  apparently
corresponding  mineralized  drillhole  intersections,  which  is  attributed  to  significant  downslope
regolith  creep.    The  discussion  below  pertains  only  to  the  preparation  and  analysis  of  those
samples  used  to  generate  the  MRE;  analytical  methods  for  other  surface  exploration  techniques
have been discussed in the relevant sections.
11.1
Sampling preparation and sampling protocol
Core  sampling  at  the  Komahun  Project  follows  the  sampling  protocol  that  was  reviewed  and
revised by MSA in June, 2012.  Given the advanced state of understanding at the project due to
the  extensive  historical  work  that  has  been  carried  out,  only  portions  of  drillholes,  known  to
correspond  to  mineralized  zones,  were  sampled.    Sampling  intervals  and  sample  numbers  were
marked on the core using China markers and the core boxes are also marked with permanent ink
markers.    Portions  of  drillholes  were  chosen  for  sampling  based  on  the  presence  of  sulphides,
veins or alteration zones known to be associated with gold mineralization. The sampling envelope
is extended at least 10 samples (typically ~ 10 m) above and below these zones into the hanging-
and footwalls of these zones.  Core was rotated to be symmetrical around the centre-line.  Half-
core samples were collected and QAQC samples inserted as described in Section 11.4.  Core was
cut using a wet-cut, petrol-powered diamond core saw and the right half of the core was packed
in clearly marked sample bags with pre-printed, triplicate sample tickets; the left half of the core
was returned to the core box as reference and stored in the core shed on site.
Samples  were  collected  according  to  lithological  controls  i.e.  samples  did  not  cross  significant
lithological boundaries, and in the cases of isolated, narrow veins, samples were collected with the
vein in the centre of the sample.  Sample lengths were governed by the sampling protocol, which
is described briefly below:

In  strongly  mineralized  zones  i.e.  visible  sulphides,  vein  material  or  visible  gold,  MSA
amended the sampling  interval from  a nominal 1  m (downhole)  to 50 cm (downhole) in
order  to  mitigate  against  the  possible  smearing  and  dilution  of  grades  associated  with
the historical 1.5 m sampling interval.

Samples extending into the hanging- and footwalls of the mineralized zones are collected
at a nominal 1 m sample length.

Since  June,  2012,  very  strongly  mineralized  samples  (visible  gold  and/or  semi-massive
sulphides)  were  submitted  for  screen  fire  assay  (SFA)  as  the  primary  assay  method  to
ameliorate  potential  under-reporting  of  gold  grades  in  coarse  gold  bearing  samples.
Screen fire assay samples were separately batched to avoid potential laboratory mixups.

All  samples  arising  from  the  current  drill  programme  were  subject  to  Specific  Gravity
determination  using  the  Archimedes  principle  and  a  wet-dry  balance.    The  dry  mass  of  half-  or
quarter-core samples was measured and compared to the “wet” mass of the sample i.e. the mass
when submerged in water.  The Specific Gravity was then calculated arithmetically from the “wet”
and  “dry”  sample  masses.    Porous  and  weathered  material  was  coated  in  paraffin  wax  prior  to
immersion in water to prevent the influx of water into voids.
11.2
Sample security
Drilled  core  was  placed  into  wooden  core  boxes  at  the  drill  rig  by  the  drilling  crews,  under  the
supervision of the Nimini field technicians.  These core boxes were collected by  Nimini staff and
delivered to the secured camp compound for logging, core cutting and sampling.  Samples were
packaged in clear polyethylene bags.  These bags were packed into wooden shipping crates that
were  sealed  and  trucked  to  Freetown  where  they  were  delivered  to  the  Geological  Survey
Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Mineral  Resources.    These  crates  were  inspected  by
Geological  Survey  Staff  in  the  presence  of  a  Nimini  representative  and  sample  export  permits
obtained.    The  samples  were  then  commercially  trucked  or  airfreighted  to  the  destination
laboratory.  The majority of sample shipments for the current programme were delivered by truck
to  the  ALS  laboratories  in  Mali  and  Liberia,  with  a  subordinate  amount  delivered  to  the  SGS
laboratory in Monrovia, Liberia and some SFA batches airfreighted to Johannesburg, South Africa.
Pulp and crush reject samples were generally retained by the laboratory for 90 days prior to being
returned  to  the  project  site  using  the  same  trucking  company  that  delivered  samples  to  the
laboratory.  The pulps and crush rejects are kept in a dedicated storage room at the exploration
camp.
11.3
Sample analyses
A description of the various sample routing, selection and analytical methods for the current drill
programme is provided below.  The analytical techniques employed for recent drill programmes,
which  included  a  number  of  laboratories  not  used  for  the  current  programme,  are  described  in
Pittuck (2008) and Camus and Cukor (2012).
11.3.1
Sample routing
The majority of samples submitted as part of the current drill programme have been submitted to
ALS laboratories in Bamako (Mali) and Monrovia (Liberia).  The Bamako laboratory was the facility
of  choice  up  until  August,  2012,  when  additional  sample  routing  options  were  implemented  in
order to improve sample turnaround time and mitigate delayed laboratory throughput in Bamako
due to political unrest in Mali.  Since September, 2012, alternating batches were sent to Bamako
and  Monrovia  with  various  laboratory  requests.    In  some  instances,  Bamako  was  instructed  to
undertake  sample  preparation,  routine  fire  assay  analysis  (FA)  and  SFA  (when  required)  and  in
other  instances,  they  were  requested  to  perform  sample  preparation  only,  with  the  prepared
pulps  air-freighted  to  the  ALS  laboratory  in  Johannesburg,  South  Africa,  for  routine  fire  assay
analysis.    For  samples  dispatched  to  Liberia,  the  default  instruction  was  for  sample  preparation,
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 92
with the prepared pulps being air-freighted to Johannesburg.  At the height of political instability
in Mali in January and February, 2013, ALS rerouted  several sample batches designated for their
Bamako  facility  to  their  laboratory  in  Ouagadougou,  Burkina  Faso,  where  both  FA  and  SFA
analyses  were  undertaken.    In  April,  2013,  a  consignment  of  half-core  samples  for  SFA  was
airfreighted directly from Freetown to ALS’s Johannesburg laboratory.
In  August,  2012,  seven  sample  batches,  for  a  total  of  1,625  samples  (including  QAQC  samples)
were  submitted  to  the  SGS  laboratory  in  Monrovia,  Liberia  as  the  primary  assay  laboratory,  to
mitigate a sample backlog at the ALS facility in Bamako.
Blind pulp duplicate analyses were carried out on a selection of pulps spanning both recent and
current  drill  programmes.    Pulps  retained  on  site  were  selected,  renumbered  and  dispatched  to
ALS Monrovia for onward  dispatch  to ALS Johannesburg.  Assay pulps retained  in Bamako were
returned to site and a selection of these were renumbered and dispatched to ALS Johannesburg
and for primary assays undertaken at ALS Johannesburg, an MSA geologist selected, renumbered
and resubmitted pulps retained at the Johannesburg laboratory to the same facility.
A selection of pulps from the full spectrum of ALS laboratories was renumbered and submitted to
SGS Monrovia for FA analyses for umpire analysis.
11.3.2  Analytical methodology
11.3.2.1  ALS laboratories
Sample preparation
Samples  submitted  for  FA  to  all  ALS  facilities  described  above  were  subject  to  the  sample
preparation  methodology  shown  in  Figure  11-1  below.  The  sample  were  logged  in  the  tracking
system, weighed, dried and finely crushed to more than 70 % passing 2 mm using a Tyler 9 mesh,
US Std. No.10 screen. A split of up to 250 g was taken and pulverized to better than 85 % passing
a 75 micron (Tyler 200 mesh, US Std. No. 200) screen.

Page: 93
For samples submitted for SFA as the primary assay method, the samples were crushed using ALS
method  CRU-31  for  a  minimum  of  1  kg  of  material  passing  the  2  mm  screen.    Thereafter,  the
passing  fraction  was  pulverised  to  85  %  passing  a  106  micron  screen  and  the  retained  coarse
fraction and passing fine fractions assayed separately.
Assay methods
Samples submitted for routine FA for gold are assayed according to ALS method Au-AA26, a fire
assay  with  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  finish.  The  prepared  sample  was  split  to  a  50  g
subsample,  which  was  fused  with  a  mixture  of  lead  oxide,  sodium  carbonate,  borax,  silica  and
other  reagents  as  required,  inquarted  with  6  mg  of  gold-free  silver  and  then  cupelled  to  yield  a
precious metal bead.  The bead was digested in 0.5 ml dilute nitric acid in the microwave oven. 0.5
ml  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  was  then  added  and  the  bead  further  digested  in  the
microwave at a lower power setting. The digested solution  was cooled, diluted to a total volume
of  10  ml  with  de-mineralized  water,  and  analysed  by  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  against
matrix-matched  standards.    The  lower  detection  limit  of  this  method  is  0.01  ppm  Au  and  the
upper  limit  is  100  ppm  Au.    Samples  returning  overlimit  results  i.e.  >  100  ppm  were  routinely
reanalysed using the gravimetric analysis Au-GRA22 method of ALS, where the prepared sample
was  fused  with  a  mixture  of  lead  oxide,  sodium  carbonate,  borax,  silica  and  other  reagents  in
order to produce a lead button. The lead button containing the precious metals  was cupelled to
remove the lead. The remaining gold and silver bead was parted in dilute nitric acid, annealed and
weighed  as  gold.  Silver  content  can  be  determined  by  the  weight  difference  although
metallurgical  work  (Section  13)  indicates  low  silver  content  at  Komahun  and  no  routine  silver
assays have been carried out to date.
Pulps submitted as part of the pulp duplicate programme did not require crushing or pulverising
and were analysed by Au-AA26 and Au-GRA22 if required.
MSA  suggested  the  implementation  of  SFA  analysis  for  high-grade  and/or  visible-gold  bearing
samples in June, 2012, a recommendation that was also put forward by Camus and Cukor (2012).
SFA  mitigates  the  known  under-reporting  of  coarse  gold  which  may  be  retained  in  the  coarse
rejects  of  a  standard  FA.    This  occurs  due  to  the  malleable  nature  of  the  gold  resulting  in  it
forming  flattened  discs  during  pulverising  which  in  turn  may  not  pass  through  the  75  micron
screen.    The  ALS  method  code  for  SFA  is  Au-SCR24,  where  1,000  g  of  the  prepared  sample  is
passed  through  a  106  micron  (Tyler  150  mesh)  stainless  steel  screen  to  separate  the  oversize
fractions.  Any  +106  micron  material  remaining  on  the  screen  is  retained  and  analysed  in  its
entirety by fire assay with gravimetric finish (Au-GRA22) and reported as the Au(+)fraction result.
The  –106  micron  fraction  is  homogenized  and  two  sub-samples  are  analysed  by  fire  assay  with
AAS finish (Au-AA26 and Au-AA26D). The average of the two AAS results is taken and reported as
the Au (-) fraction result. All three values are used in calculating the combined gold content of the
plus  and  minus  fractions.    The  gold  values  for  both  the  +100  and  -100  micron  fractions  are
reported together with the weight of each fraction as well as the calculated total gold content of
the sample.  The total gold content of the sample is calculated according to the formula shown in
Figure 11-2.

The  ALS  Bamako,  Monrovia  and  Ouagadougou  facilities  are  not  currently  accredited  under  ISO
17025,  however  the  same  preparation  and  analytical  methodology  is  followed  by  all  the  ALS
laboratories  globally,  both  accredited  and  not  accredited.    The  ALS  Johannesburg  facility  is
accredited for the methods Au-AA26 and Au-GRA22 (accreditation renewed in May, 2013) and by
extension  the  Au-SCR  method,  which  comprises  individual  Au-AA26  and  Au-GRA22  methods,
which are arithmetically combined to produce a weighted gold result.
MSA  has  not  specifically  audited  any  of  the  ALS  facilities  as  part  of  the  current  programme;
however  MSA  has  historically  undertaken  several  audits  of  the  ALS  facility  in  Johannesburg  and
the  ALS  facility  in  Ouagadougou  as  part  of  other  exploration  programmes,  with  no  materially
adverse findings.  The Qualified Persons are of the opinion that sufficient check assays and QAQC
measures  have  been  implemented  to  consider  that  no  major  bias  exists  due  to  sample
preparation and/or analysis.
11.3.2.2  SGS
FA  conducted  by  SGS  (Monrovia)  was  carried  out  according  to  the  method  FAA303,  a  30  g  fire
assay  with  atomic  absorption  finish.    The  method  is  identical  to  the  ALS  methods  documented
above,  although  a  true  equivalent  50  g  method  (FAA505)  was  not  offered  by  the  Monrovia
laboratory at the time of analysis.
11.4
Quality assurance and quality control (QAQC)
Ongoing  monitoring  of  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  assay  results  has  been  undertaken  at
Komahun since the inception of the drilling programme in 2005.  Various assay laboratories have
been  utilised  at  Komahun  since  2005;  the  tenure  of  these  laboratories  has  been  discussed  by
Pittuck (2008) and Camus and Cukor (2012).
The suitability of QAQC measures and assay performance of previous assay campaigns has been
independently  discussed  by  Pittuck  (2008)  and  Camus  and  Cukor  (2012)  in  their  reports
documenting the 2008 and 2012 MRE’s respectively.  Given that all assay results from both recent
and current drill programmes are included in the MRE presented in Section 14, an overview of all
QAQC measures and performance is included in the text below.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 95
11.4.1  QAQC protocol
Since  inception,  exploration  activities  at  Komahun  and  on  the  Nimini  Mining  Licence  (i.e.  the
former  Nimini  West  and  Nimini  East  exploration  licences)  have  been  conducted  in  accordance
with  international  best  practice  with  regard  to  QAQC  monitoring.    An  existing  QAQC  protocol,
inherited from AXMIN’s tenure at Komahun, was reviewed by MSA in July, 2012 and found to be
generally robust and the only material amendment was in regard to the nature of blank material
used.
The QAQC protocol involves the insertion of commercially-prepared certified reference materials
(CRM’s  or  standards),  unmineralized  material  (blanks)  and  field  duplicates  (quarter-core  splits
from original half-core samples) into the sampling stream.  The protocol governing the insertion
of these QAQC samples is provided below:

Insertion of 5 per cent blank material into the numbered sample sequence every 20th sample.
Since  2010,  blanks  have  also  been  inserted  intermittently  within  visually  mineralized
intersections.

Insertion  of  5  per  cent  Certificated  Reference  Material  (CRM),  obtained  from  the  Australian
company Geostats, systematically into the numbered sequence every 20 samples (inclusive of
blanks  and  duplicates)  taken.  The  CRM’s  are  inserted  in  a  sequence  as  100g  vacuum  sealed
packets within the half core that is shipped to the lab for preparation.

Insertion of 5 per cent quarter-core duplicates systematically into the numbered sequence.
Further  to  the  above,  MSA  implemented  blind  pulp  duplicate  and  umpire  programmes  at
Komahun  in  2012.    A  summary  of  the  proportions  and  types  of  QAQC  currently  captured  in  the
global assay database is presented in Table 11-1.  It should be noted that as of the effective date
of this report, several batches of umpire results from SGS Monrovia are outstanding although this
is not considered a material issue by the Qualified Persons.  A resampling exercise was carried out
on intersections drilled in the recent (2005-2011) drill programmes where the sampling protocol
governed the  collection of  samples deemed  too long  (typically 1.5 m  as opposed to the  current
protocol of 0.5 m).  The results of this resampling programme are discussed below.
The  global  Nimini  assay  database  for  trenches  and  diamond  core  contains  33,806  routine  assay
results, inclusive of resampling data.

11.4.2  QAQC performance
11.4.2.1  Blanks
Prior  to  late-2009,  locally  sourced  river  sand  was  used  as  blank  material.    Given  that  alluvial
deposits  within  and  adjacent  to  the  Nimini  Mining  Licence  are  locally  worked  by  artisanals  for
both gold and diamonds, it is unsurprising that these sands occasionally returned high Au values,
of up to 1.6 g/t.  This issue was commented on by Pittuck (2008) and remedial action was taken
by AXMIN in 2009 when a locally sourced granite replaced the river sand blank.  Performance of
this  blank  material  improved  and  the  used  of  uncrushed  material  improved  the  monitoring  of
potential  contamination  during  the  preparation  of  samples  for  assay  i.e.  during  crushing  and
milling.  A few high value assays were also been returned from the granite blanks; it is uncertain
whether  these  represent  primary  gold  mineralization  in  the  granite  or  contamination  during
sample preparation or analysis i.e. due to equipment not being properly flushed prior to use and
analysis.  The impact of these failed blanks (both in the river sand and granites) was considered by
both  Pittuck  (2008)  and  Camus  and  Cukor  (2012)  to  warrant  follow-up  but  was  not  flagged  as
being  significant  enough  to  materially  impact  their  respective  MRE’s  nor  the  categorisation  of
these Mineral Resources.
In mid-2012, MSA’s review of the QAQC protocol at Komahun suggested the replacement of the
granitic blanks with a commercially-prepared coarse (unmilled) blank material.  AMIS0305, a blank
comprising  coarse  barren  silica  chips  produced  by  African  Minerals  Standards  (AMIS)  in
Johannesburg,  was  progressively  introduced  into  the  programme  from  July,  2012,  and  had
completely replaced the granitic blanks by late September 2012.
Comparative performance of commercially prepared silica blank (AMIS305) vs. granite and river
sand blanks employed prior to 2012.  The blue arrows represent the changeover from river sand to
granite in the blue data series (non-commercial blanks)

NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 97
The exploration database contains a total of 2,521 field blanks, of which 1,654 are either river sand
or  granitic  blanks  (these  are  not  differentiated  in  the  database).    The  balance  of  867  blanks  are
AMIS0305.  In terms of relative performance, both the BLANK and AMIS0305 types exhibit similar
failure  rates  (defined  here  as  assays  greater  than  the  warning  limit  of  0.05  g/t  i.e.  5  times  the
detection  limit  of  0.01  g/t)  of  approximately  3.7%  and  4.4%,  suggesting  primary  laboratory
contamination  as  the  source  of  the  failures.    However,  there  are  significantly  less  instances  of
AMIS0305 reporting grades in excess of 0.25 g/t, which supports a primary gold argument for the
failures  of  the  non-commercially  prepared  blanks.    On  a  global  basis,  4%  of  blanks  analysed
returned values in excess of the warning limit of 0.05 g/t, with only 1% returning in excess of 0.25
g/t.    These  blank  failures  are  considered  non-material  to  the  current  MRE.    The  total  of  2,521
blanks represents 5.7% of the total samples stored in the global assay database (43,870 samples,
inclusive of trench samples).
Laboratory-inserted  blanks,  inserted  as  part  of  the  laboratory’s  internal  QAQC  procedures,  have
performed acceptably throughout the programme at Komahun.

Certified reference materials (CRM’s / standards)
A number of CRM’s have been used by the field team since the inception of exploration in 2005
and inserted as per the QAQC protocol described above.  These CRM’s are summarised in  Table
11-3.    The  performance  of  each  of  these  CRM’s  is  documented  below.    All  field-inserted  CRM’s
have been evaluated below, regardless of whether they  originated from the trenching or drilling
programmes.    Laboratory  inserted  CRM’s  have  been  visually  inspected  and  have  produced
acceptable values.
With  the  exception  of  Si64  (Rocklabs),  all  field  CRM’s  utilised  by  Nimini  have  been  supplied  by
Geostats  (Australia)  and  are  accredited  for  the  fire  assay  method  with  AA  finish.    The  analytical
method  used  to  accredit  Si64  is  not  disclosed  by  Rocklabs  and  this  CRM  consistent  under-
reported by approximately 0.15 g/t Au.  After liaison with Rocklabs, Nimini staff calculated internal
mean and standard deviations (SD) for this CRM.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 98
For  the  Komahun  project,  the  Qualified  Persons  have  set  a  failure  limit  for  CRM’s  to  3  standard
deviations  (3SD).    In  practice,  however,  single  failed  standards  per  batch  do  not  constitute  a
QAQC failure and only 3 consecutive standard failures has been regarded as a critical failure that
requires reassay. and/or mitigative action from the laboratory.
Aside  from  very  minor,  non-material  likely  CRM  mislabelling,  the  majority  of  CRM’s  have
performed  acceptably  during  assay  programmes  related  to  the  current  and  recent  drill
programmes.    Summary  statistics  for  each  of  the  individual  CRM’s  are  shown  in  Table  11-4  and
Figure  11-4  to  Figure  11-16.    These  data  show  a  general  but  non-material  under-reporting  bias
for  the  CRM’s  on  average  (approximately  3  per  cent)  with  individual  CRM’s  reporting  smaller  or
large positive or negative biases.  For the most part, SD’s are comparable with the published SD’s
for the CRM’s; the most obvious exceptions to the general low bias and SD variance are the very
high grade CRM’s which show more pronounced under-reporting and higher failure rates.  Given
only  a  very  small  proportion  of  samples  in  the  Komahun  database  (approximately  1.2  per  cent
excluding  failed  and  excluded  resampling  data)  have  grades  in  excess  of  10  g/t  Au,  this  minor
under-reporting is considered non-material to the MRE stated in Section 14.

11.4.2.3  Field duplicates
Quarter-core  field  duplicates,  corresponding  to  a  longitudinal  split  of  a  half-core  sample,  are
routinely  inserted  into  the  sampling  stream  with  unique  sample  numbers.    The  performance  of
these  field  duplicates  is  shown  in  Figure  11-17.    Consistent  with  the  nuggetty  style  of
mineralization  at  Komahun,  characterised  by  significant  sample  heterogeneity,  only  a  broad
correlation exists between original sample grade and the grade of the quarter-core duplicate.  A
total  of  447  of  the  analysed  1,550  quarter-core  duplicates  returned  values  outside  the  accepted
10% variance, corresponding to a 29% failure rate.  No detectable bias is noted, and the Qualified
Persons  consider  this  level  of  field  duplicate  failure  acceptable  for  the  style  of  mineralization
being tested.

Performance of quarter-core field duplicates
11.4.2.4  Pulp duplicates
A  total  of  1,871  pulp  duplicates,  spanning  both  recent  and  current  drilling  programmes,  were
renumbered  and  submitted  to  both  ALS  Monrovia  (for  onward  dispatch  to  Johannesburg)  and
ALS Johannesburg for analysis.  The results are shown in Figure 11-18 and indicate a moderately
good  correlation  above  the  cutoff  grade  of  the  MRE  (Section  14)  of  2.4  g/t.    As  expected,
correlation  at  lower  grades  is  poor  due  to  the  proximity  to  the  detection  limit.    Correlation  at
higher  grades  is  generally  satisfactory  for  this  style  of  mineralization.    Some  of  the  extreme
outliers are considered to represent mislabelled pulps or possibly incorrectly selected pulps and it
is  recommended  that  a  comprehensive  cataloguing  and  relabeling  exercise  is  undertaken  on
pulps stored at the Komahun camp as many of the original pulp labels have become progressively
less  legible  over  time.    A  very  slight,  non-material  negative  bias  exists,  with  the  pulp  duplicates
returning an average grade approximately 1.5% lower than the original assay grade although this
may  be  ascribed  to  the  higher  proportion  of  extreme  outliers  in  the  negative  portion  of  the
trumpet  plot  which  are  suspected  to  be  the  result  of  labelling  errors.    For  the  purposes  of  the
current exercise the results are considered satisfactory with the caveat that more attention should
be paid to the custodianship of the pulp samples and onsite storage thereof.

11.4.2.5  Laboratory repeats
Internal  laboratory  repeat  assays  on  assayed  pulps  were  carried  out  routinely  by  both  ALS  and
SGS  during  the  assay  of  samples  from  both  recent  and  current  drilling  programmes.    A  total  of
1,507 internal laboratory repeats are stored in the assay database and the repeat analyses show a
similar  distribution  to  the  blind  pulp  duplicates  documented  in  Section  11.4.2.4  above  (Figure
11-19).
Figure 11-19
Performance of internal laboratory repeats
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 109
The  failure  of  the  laboratories  to  successfully  reproduce  some  of  the  higher  grade  results  is
suggestive of some degree of pulp heterogeneity that is possibly introduced due to the malleable
nature of coarse gold.  Within the grade range (2.4 g/t to approximately 15 g/t) that form the bulk
of  the  assay  database,  the  reproducibility  of  the  repeat  assays  is  very  good,  with  poor
reproducibility  only  being  particularly  significant  at  very  low  grade  towards  the  analytical
detection limit.
11.4.2.6  Umpire samples
In late 2012, an umpire assay programme was initiated with a view to supporting the MRE stated
in Section 14.  To date, results for 1,052 umpire samples have been received, with SGS Monrovia
appointed  as  the  umpire  laboratory.    Renumbered  pulps  from  the  recent  and  current  drilling
programmes  were  dispatched  to  SGS  (inclusive  of  QAQC  samples)  for  fire  assay  by  method
FAA303, a 30 g fire assay with atomic absorption finish.
Performance of umpire (SGS) analysis on samples assayed at ALS
Figure 11-20
The  results  of  the  umpire  programme  are  robust  and  indicate  good  inter-laboratory  correlation
particularly at Mineral Resource grades.  At lower levels, below the 2.4 g/t resource cutoff grade, a
higher  variance  exists.    No  significant  bias  is  detected.    Some  of  the  extreme  outliers  are  most
likely the result of sample mislabelling and are not considered material to the current MRE.  Given
that the 30 g method used by SGS is not directly compatible with the 50 g fire assay method used
by ALS, some of the disparities noted may be the result of physical assay sample size and future
umpire  work  should  be  carried  out  using  equivalent  sample  sizes  (the  50  g  method  was  not
initially on offer at SGS Monrovia).
11.4.2.7  QAQC of the SFA programme
Implementation of a robust QAQC programme for SFA analyses is hampered by the following:
  No  CRM’s  are  accredited  for  assay  by  SFA  due  to  the  requirement  to  have  homogenised
samples i.e. all commercially available CRM’s are pulps;
  Due to large sample sizes required (1 kg of crush passing 2 mm) it is generally not possible to
create field or crush duplicates for check assay or umpire analysis;
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 110
  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  sample  preparation,  the  coarse  fraction  is  usually  analysed  in  its
entirety  using  a  gravimetric  analytical  method  i.e.  there  are  generally  no  remaining  coarse
rejects; and

Laboratories  generally  do  not  carry  accreditation  for  the  screen  fire  assay  technique;  rather
they  may  be  accredited  for  the  individual  assay  components    -  fire  assay  with  atomic
absorption finish and gravimetric fire assay in this case.
Despite  the  above,  the  Qualified  Persons  are  confident  that  the  SFA  data  used  in  the  current
estimate are robust, for the following reasons:
  CRM’s inserted into the SFA batches are processed by the laboratories in an identical manner
i.e.  they  are  passed  through  the  106  micron  screen  and  analysed  in  duplicate  using  the  Au-
method i.e. Au-AA26.  These CRM’s are recorded in the database as having being analysed by
Au-AA26  and  manual  inspection  of  the  results  has  shown  that  all  27  CRM’s  submitted  with
SFA  batches  (4.7%  CRM’s  in  total  submission  of  588  samples)  have  passed  within  three
standard deviations of their expected values.
  The  use  of  the  coarse  silica  blank,  AMIS0305,  resulted  in  these  blanks  passing  through  the
complete  sample  preparation  and  SFA  analysis  path  i.e.  the  coarse  blanks  are  crushed,
screened at 105 micron and coarse and fine fractions separately analysed.  On the basis of this
methodology,  three  sub-batches  from  the  2012  resampling  programme  (Batch  AS102)
(Section 11.4.3.2) were rejected in their entirety due to excessive contamination noted in the
blank  samples  (up  to  9.27  g/t  Au)  and  were  removed  from  the  primary  assay  database.    No
SFA  batches  from  the  current  drilling  programme  failed,  with  the  highest  returned  value  for
AMIS0305 being 0.33 g/t (indicating moderate contamination but non-material at a resource
cutoff grade of 2.4 g/t) and subsequent blanks in the batch passing at usual 0.05 g/t warning
limit.
11.4.3  Resampling programme
11.4.3.1  2011 resampling
SGS  conducted  a  sampling  exercise  on  105  core  samples  in  two  campaigns  in  March  and
November, 2011, in order to verify assay results (from the primary assay laboratory, ALS) obtained
during 2011, ahead of the SGS MRE update that was completed in mid-2012 (Camus and Cukor,
2012).   Samples were selected by SGS from drillholes NWKD198, NWKD215 and NWKD217 and
were  collected  as  quarter-core  samples  and  submitted  to  SGS  Toronto,  with  the  other  quarter
core being dispatched for primary fire assay at ALS.  The results of this verification exercise were
interpreted as showing no apparent bias and a strong correlation considering the nuggety nature
of  the  gold  mineralization  at  Komahun  (Camus  and  Cukor,  2012).    This  interpretation  is
considered valid by the current authors.

11.4.3.2  2012 resampling
In  2012,  a  data  verification  exercise  was  conducted  by  Nimini,  which  involved  re-sampling
remaining  half  core.    This  was  performed  using  half  metre  long  nominal  sample  intervals,  as
opposed  to  longer  lengths  originally  used,  with  adjustments  made  to  the  length  depending  on
the  nature  of  the  mineralization  and  the  length  of  the  original  samples.    The  re-sampling
honoured the start and end points of the original samples.  In addition, the opposite half of the
core samples that returned assays greater than 10 g/t were re-sampled for assaying by screen fire
assay  (SFA)  techniques.    The  initial  assays  were  carried  out  by  ALS  Chemex  in  Bamako  (Mali),
where  the  majority  of  the  original  assays  were  done.    Later  SFA  assays  (post  November,  2012)
were  carried  out  in  ALS  laboratories  in  Ouagadougou  (Burkina  Faso)  and  Johannesburg  (South
Africa), due to political instability in Mali.
The re-sampled data were compared with the original data in order to validate the original assays,
understand  the  effect  of  using  smaller  samples  and  assess  the  impact  of  screen  fire  assay
compared with conventional fire assay.  The results are summarised as follows:
  The Au grades of the 502 conventional fire assay samples are generally slightly lower for the
re-sampled half cores than the original half cores.
  The Au grades of the 171 screen fire assay samples are slightly higher for the re-sampled half
cores than the original half cores, the screen fire assay technique being more accurate at the
higher grade ranges where coarse native gold is expected.
  The  re-sample  lengths  are  shorter  than  the  original  lengths,  therefore  the  re-sampling
provided better definition of the mineralized zones and as such the data are more variable.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 112
  The re-sample data was reconstituted into the original sample lengths and compared with the
original  assays.    The  difference  between  the  average  Au  assays  for  the  two  datasets  is  4%
(5.46 g/t for the re-assay versus 5.69 g/t for the original).
Histograms for the original gold assay (AUGT) versus the re-assay (AUGTR) are shown side by side
in  Figure  11-22,  separately  for  conventional  fire  assay  and  for  SFA.    The  re-sampled  data  are
shown  on  the  left  and  the  original  data  on  the  right.    For  the  original  assay  data  in  the  SFA
domain, the data shown are for those samples that were originally assayed using convention fire
assay that were re-assayed by SFA.
Histograms for the Original versus Re-sampling assays

The  histograms  for  the  re-assay  data  reconstituted  into  the  original  sample  lengths  and  the
original  data,  together  with  the  scatter  and  Quartile-Quartile  (QQ)  plots,  are  shown  in  Figure
11-23.  The QQ plots show that for gold grades above approximately 4.4 g/t there is little bias.  In
the  grade  range  between  approximately  1.0  g/t  and  4.4  g/t,  the  re-assays  are  lower  than  the
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 113
original  assays  and  there  is  a  more  severe  bias  at  grades  lower  than  1.0  g/t,  the  re-assays  also
being  lower  than  the  originals.    Twelve  per  cent  of  the  data  is  less  than  1  g/t  Au  and
approximately 60 per cent of the data is less than 4.4 g/t Au. The re-sampling exercise confirmed
the high grade assays, but identified bias with respect to the lower grade data.  Re-sampling did
not  cover  the  full  extents  of  the  mineralized  zones  and  as  such  may  be  considered  selective  re-
sampling, particularly with respect to those repeated by SFA.  In order to avoid the introduction of
any additional error, the re-assay data were not used for grade estimation.  The grade distribution
achieved  by  the  re-sampling  using  the  smaller  sample  intervals  and  SFA  is  better  defined  than
that achieved by  the previous sampling  and assay protocol, and so these methods were used in
the exploration campaign from June 2012 onwards.

Concluding remarks
It  is  the  opinion  of  the  Qualified  Persons  that  the  sampling  methodology,  preparation,  security
and  analytical  procedures  employed  at  the  Property  are  acceptable  and  conform  with  best
practice for the style of mineralization being tested at Komahun.  Similarly, QAQC measures and
performance  are  adequate  and  appropriate.    The  performance  of  blanks,  CRM’s  and  various
duplicates  is  generally  within  accepted  limits  and  deviations  from  accepted  ranges  for  duplicate
samples are  considered reflective of the nuggetty  style of  mineralization.   The Qualified  Persons
consider  the  assay  data  of  acceptable  precision  and  accuracy  to  support  the  MRE  presented  in
Section  14.    Future  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  custodianship  and  relabeling  of  pulps
from current and recent drill programmes.  The Archimedes principle is considered an appropriate
method for the determination of Specific Gravity.

DATA VERIFICATION
Prior  to  June,  2012,  all  exploration  data  pertaining  to  the  Komahun  project  was  stored  in  a
bespoke Microsoft Access ™ relational database managed by Nimini’s (and prior to that, AXMIN’s)
contracted  database  manager.    Upon  MSA’s  appointment  as  exploration  consultants  to  Nimini,
the  Microsoft  Access  ™  database  was  migrated  into  the  commercial  exploration  database
management  software  Datashed  ™  (Maxwell  Geoservices),  a  SQL-based  relational  database
system  specifically  developed  for  the  management  of  exploration  data.      Datashed  ™  and  its
affiliated products offer several distinct advantages for the management of exploration data:
  Datashed ™ allows for the automated import of assay results directly from certificates issued
by  most  major  commercial  assay  laboratories,  eliminating  copy-paste  errors  that  occur
frequently  in  less  sophisticated  applications.    Assay  results  are  matched  to  sample  numbers
automatically during the import process.

The  Maxwell  QAQC  Reporting  tool  (QAQCR  ™)  allows  for  rapid  monitoring  of  assay  QAQC
and the generation of automated QAQC reports on a routine basis.
  Maxwell  offers  a  field-capture  front  end  to  their  Datashed  ™  database,  known  as  Logchief,
which  allows  field-based  staff  to  capture  logging,  sampling  and  other  relevant  data  in  the
field and database synchronises remotely with the master database stored at the server site.
This remote data is reconciled with assay data imported into the master database.
A  Maxwell  data  schema  was  defined  in  conjunction  with  the  site  geologists  that  allowed  all
historical  data  to  be  migrated  into  the  new  database  system.    As  part  of  the  data  migration
system, original assay certificates were required to be recaptured to allow  for the importation of
data and as such, the veracity of the exploration database has been confirmed.  Several database
audits  were  carried  out  by  MSA  where  material  issues  associated  with  the  historical  data  (e.g.
overlapping  intervals,  mismatched  sampling  and  assay  results,  missing  data)  were  identified  and
rectified  in  conjunction  with  the  field  team.    The  rectification  process  involved  data  entry
corrections, core checks as well as reimportation of assay certificates where required.
Since  June,  2012,  the  Komahun  exploration  database  has  been  managed  and  hosted  by  MSA  in
Johannesburg.  Field-based staff capture data, which synchronises directly with the server-hosted
database  in  Johannesburg.    Assay  certificates  are  directly  imported  in  Johannesburg.  QAQC
reports  are  generated  on  a  batch-by-batch  basis,  allowing  for  the  rapid  identification  and
discrimination of field-generated (i.e. capturing and sample mislabelling) vs. laboratory errors.
The  Qualified  Persons  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  exploration  database  is  robust  and  has  been
independently  verified  through  the  reimportation  of  data  into  the  Datashed  ™  database.
Furthermore,  the  assay  QAQC  programme,  including  the  resampling  programmes  discussed  in
Section  11.4.3,  provides  confidence  in  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  assay  data  used  in  the
MRE  (Section  14).    The  data  are  therefore  considered  adequate  for  the  purposes  used  in  this
Technical Report.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
Metallurgical  test  work  is  currently  in  progress  as  part  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment
(PEA) on the Komahun Project and will supersede historical metallurgical test work conducted by
AXMIN  and  documented  in  Pittuck  (2008).    This  historical  metallurgical  work  is  documented
briefly below.
Preliminary metallurgical tests were undertaken by SGS Johannesburg (South Africa) early in 2007.
The test battery comprised CIL  simulation bottle roll  tests which were conducted on 10 samples
from  six  drillholes  and  indicated  high  gold  recoveries  for  both  oxide  and  sulphide-hosted
mineralization.
In  2009,  AXMIN  commissioned  additional  test  work  at  SGS  Johannesburg  and  29  fresh  samples
(105  kg  total  mass)  containing  sulphide  mineralization  were  submitted  and  used  for  variability
tests whereas some were composited for bulk test work.
Key findings were:
  The  mineralized  material  is  classified  as  moderately  abrasive  according  to  the  Bond  work
index;
  Moderate ball and rod work indices suggest the mineralized material is relatively soft;
  Good bulk leach recoveries in excess of 94% were achieved on 9 g/t Au sample;
  20-25% gravity circuit recovery was recorded  on a 6  g/t sample plus 90%  leach recovery on
the gravity tails;

Lower than expected cyanide consumption;
  Variability test show recoveries are mostly in excess of 90%; and
  Silver  contents  at  Komahun  are  considered  to  be  approximately  10%  of  the  gold  content
(Stanek and v.d. Merwe, 2009).

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
MSA has, on behalf of Polo, completed a Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Project.  To
the  best  of  MSA’s  knowledge  there  are  currently  no  title,  legal,  taxation,  marketing,  permitting,
socio-economic  or  other  relevant  issues  that  may  materially  affect  the  Mineral  Resources
described in this Technical Report.
The  Mineral  Resources  presented  herein  represent  an  update  to  the  2012  Mineral  Resource
completed  by  SGS  Canada  Inc.  (Camus  and  Cukor,  2012)  effective  February  12,  2012  and
described  in  Section  6.3.    This  updated  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  incorporates  significant
additional drilling completed by Nimini since the SGS work and includes re-interpretation of the
mineralized  zones  by  MSA.    In  MSA’s  opinion  the  data  on  which  this  estimate  is  based  were
collected  in  accordance  with  The  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum  (CIM)
“Exploration Best Practices Guidelines”.
This Mineral Resource was estimated using CIM “Best Practice Guidelines for Estimation of Mineral
Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves”  and  classified  in  accordance  with  the  “2010  CIM  Definition
Standards”.  Mineral  Resources  within  the  Project  are  reported  in  accordance  with  the  Canadian
Securities  Administrators  National  Instrument  43-101  Best  Practices  guidelines.    It  should  be
noted that Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic
viability.
The  mineral  resource  estimate  was  conducted  using  CAE  Studio  3  ™  software,  together  with
Microsoft Excel ™ and Snowden Supervisor ™ for data analysis.
14.1  Mineral Resource Estimation Database
The database used for the Mineral Resource Estimate consists of:

Information from diamond drillholes:
o  Collar surveys
o  Down-the-hole-surveys
o  Sampling and Assay data
o  Specific Gravity measurements
o  Geology logs

Information  from  trenches  excavated  at  surface  (included  in  database  but  not  utilised  for
Mineral Resource Estimation; see below):
o  Spatial surveys along the trenches
o  Sampling and Assay data
o  Geology logs
  A digital terrain model based on a LIDAR Survey.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 118
The principal sources of information used for the estimate include raw data generated during the
course of the exploration drilling programme that took place between 2005 and May 2013.  The
diamond drillholes were steeply inclined and were planned to intersect the mineralized zones at a
spacing of between 40 m and 80 m on the plane of mineralization.  A total of 344 diamond drilled
drillholes  representing  80,205 m  of  drilling  were  completed  in  the  area  of  interest  for  Mineral
Resources.
A  number  of  trenches  were  excavated  during  historical  phases  of  exploration  activity  at  the
Property.    The  locations  of  the  trenches  were  surveyed  and  the  trenches  were  sampled.    The
terrain  at  Komahun  is  hilly  and  steep.    Observation  of  the  trenches  themselves  showed  that  the
remnant  structures  and  rocks  were  not  in  their  expected  orientations.    Examination  of  the
locations  of  the  high  grade  sample  assays  in  the  trenches,  in  relation  to  those  in  the  diamond
drilled intersections beneath them, revealed that many of the gold bearing zones in the trenches
were spatially offset from the drillholes, the steep terrain being responsible for displacement and
dispersion of the mineralization away from the underlying deposit.  Following discussion with the
Nimini geologists, it was  concluded that the trench  sample data  were not in-situ and the  trench
sample data were therefore discarded from the estimation database.
The cut-off-date for accepting data into this estimate was 15 May, 2013.
14.2
Exploratory Analysis of the Raw Data
The  dataset  consisted  of  sample  and  logging  data  from  diamond  drillholes.    The  following
attributes are of direct relevance to the estimate:
  Gold assays in grams per metric tonne (Au g/t)
  Relative Density (SG).

Lithological Codes
Visual inspection of the data showed that the data occurs across a wide area.  Focus was placed
on the areas  in and around Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, Block 4 and northern part of the Southern
Structure.    The  data  in  the  remaining  areas  were  discarded  for  the  purpose  of  this  Mineral
Resource Estimate, there currently being insufficient data with continuous zones of mineralization
above 1 g/t to support a mineral resource.  344 diamond drillholes were completed in the area of
interest.  The results of 234 of these were used to directly estimate the Mineral Resource.  The 110
holes that were not directly used either intersected mineralization less than the selected threshold
of 0.50 g/t Au, contained poor core recovery in saprolite, or contained mineralized that were not
supported by sufficient amounts of additional drillholes to form a cohesive zone.
A  summary  of  the  drillhole  data  that  were  used  for  Mineral  Resource  Estimation  is  provided  in
Appendix 2.

A number of rock codes exist in the database.  These were distilled into a lesser number of groups
in order to simplify the data (Table 14-1).

Excluding the re-sampling and trench channel samples, 25,458 samples were assayed for gold and
19,179 density determinations were made within the area of interest.
14.2.1  Validation of the data
The validation process consisted of:

examining the sample assay, collar survey, down-hole survey and geology data to ensure that
the data were complete for all of the drillholes;


examining the survey data in three dimensions to check for spatial errors;
examination  of  the  assay  and  density  data  in  order  to  ascertain  whether  they  were  within
expected ranges; and

checks for “From-To” errors, to ensure that the sample data did not overlap one another and
that there were no unexplained gaps between samples.
The data validation exercise revealed the following:
  Several down-hole surveys did not commence at the collar position (AT = 0).  The first survey
data  point  was  a  maximum  of  12  m  down  the  hole  and  therefore  no  corrections  were
required, the first survey being assigned to the collar.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 120

Examination  of  the  drillhole  data  in  three  dimensions  showed  that  the  collars  of  three
drillholes plotted between 8 m and 30 m above the LIDAR survey digital terrain model (DTM).
These were reported  and  corrected to the  DTM  elevation.  One drillhole collar  contained an
error in the Y coordinate; this was reported and corrected immediately by the site geologists.
  Several  of  the  relative  density  data  were  not  within  expected  ranges  for  the  rock  types  and
mineralization at Komahun.  Particularly low values were expected in the clay rich near surface
saprolite  zone  and  most  of  the  lower  values  (less  than  2.00)  occurred  within  samples  taken
from less than 50 m below surface.  High relative density values can be expected in magnetite
rich samples, although these should be less than 5.00.  The value of any sample with a relative
density  of  less  than  1.00  and  greater  than  5.00  was  removed  from  the  density  dataset.    In
total, 14 out of 18,986 values were removed from the dataset.

Extreme gold assays were noted.  The highest Au assay in the Komahun dataset is 222 g/t and
a further five values were greater than 100 g/t.  High gold assays are expected because visible
gold  is  a  feature  of  the  mineralization  at  Komahun.    The  high  values  were  retained  in  the
database for later examination for possible capping once the samples had been composited
to the same support.
  There were no “From-To” errors in the data.
Numerous drillhole  cores have been inspected on  site by the  authors.  Visible Au  mineralization
and  abundant  sulphides  in  the  remaining  half  of  the  cores,  as  well  as  the  presence  of  smoky
quartz  veins,  corresponds  well  with  high  gold  assays  received  from  the  laboratory.    These  visual
indicators of mineralization support the sampling rationale discussed in Section 11.1.
14.2.2  Statistics of the Sample Data
A  histogram  and  cumulative  frequency  plot  of  the  sample  lengths  are  presented  in  Figure  14-1.
64% of the sample lengths are 1.0 m or less and 94.1% are 1.5 m or less.  Whether a 1.0 or a 1.5 m
composite  length  is  selected  will  result  in  samples  being  split.    Splitting  of  samples  may  be
avoided  using  a  3  m  composite  however  this  length  is  not  appropriate  for  the  style  of
mineralization  and  thickness  of  the  individual  zones  at  Komahun  as  it  will  result  in  smearing
across grade boundaries.

Not  all  of  the  samples  that  were  assayed,  particularly  during  the  earlier  drilling,  had  SG
determinations performed on them.  The re-sampling was focussed on the well mineralized zones,
hence the higher mean Au grade.

Of  the  seven  assays  greater  than  100  g/t  Au,  five  are  from  amphibolite,  four  of  which  contain
quartz  veins.    The  remaining  two  assays  are  from  quartz  vein  samples,  the  quartz  vein  lithology
being  by  far  the  highest  grade  on  average  (Figure  14-2).    High  gold  grades  also  occur  within
banded iron formation (BIF) and amphibolite.  The average amphibolite grade is much lower than
the  BIF  because  it  is  influenced  by  the  large  amount  of  barren  amphibolite  outside  of  the  shear
zones, whereas the BIF commonly occurs within the shear zones.
Figure 14-2
Grade Ranges by Lithology
A log probability plot of the sample assays of the main host rocks (amphibolite, quartz veins and
BIF) indicates that a number of grade sub-sets exist in the sample population as defined by a very
subtle inflection at  approximately 0.5 g/t,  a sharper  inflection at approximately 3 g/t, and a very
sharp inflection at 39 g/t (Figure 14-3).   These define a broad  mineralized zone  above 0.5 g/t,  a
high grade zone above 3 g/t and a subset of very high grades.  The same pattern is observed on
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 123
the  total  data  set.    The  log  probability  plots  separated  into  amphibolite,  quartz  veins  and  BIF,
reveal  that  the  same  3  g/t  inflection  point  is  apparent  in  all  lithologies,  as  is  a  high  grade
inflection at between 30 g/t and 45 g/t, with the subtle 0.5 g/t inflection being most apparent in
the quartz vein lithology.

14.2.1.3
Bivariate Analysis
The sample Au grades were compared with SG in order to understand  the relationship between
grade and density.  There were no discernible relationships noticed, neither as a total data set nor
by major lithology group.
14.2.2
Exploratory Spatial Analysis
Examination of the Au grades at different thresholds spatially shows that the gold  mineralization
occurs  along  a  strong  south  west  to  north  east  trend  (approximately  060°)  in  a  number  of  sub-
vertical  zones.    This  has  been  identified  by  the  site  geologists  and  is  aligned  with  the  mapped
trends such as the strike of the phlogopite schist, talc schist and BIF rich units.  These trends have
been used in previous Mineral Resource Estimates for defining major directions of continuity and
for  guiding  wireframe  construction  of  the  separate  zones.    The  extremely  high  grade  samples
(greater than 50 g/t) tend to occur in Zone 1 of Block 1, and have a strong association with quartz
veins within the amphibolite host.  High Au grades in Zones 2 and 3 in Block 1 are associated with
a  linear  trend  of  discontinuous  BIF  fragments  within  amphibolite.    The  linear  nature  of
mineralization  is  less  well  defined  in  and  to  the  north  of  Block  4  and  in  Block  3.    The  various
blocks used to distinguish the mineralized areas are shown in Figure 14-4.

Summary of the Exploratory Analysis of the Raw Dataset
  The database is robust.  A few minor errors were identified that were corrected.
  Most  sample  lengths  are  0.5  m,  1.0  m,  or  1.5  m.    Sample  splitting  during  compositing  is
unavoidable  unless  3  m  lengths  are  used,  which  is  not  appropriate  for  the  style  of
mineralization at Komahun.
  The  host  rocks  of  the  mineralization  are  amphibolite  and  BIF,  with  enhanced  gold
mineralization in quartz veins.
  Three grade subsets occur in the sample population:
o  a subtle broad mineralized zone above 0.5 g/t
o  a high grade zone above 3 g/t
o  a subset of very high grades in excess of 30 g/t.
  There is no discernible relationship between Au grade and density.
  Mineralized zones dip sub-vertically and are linear.
  The  re-sampling  was  biased  towards  high  grade  mineralization  and  inclusion  of  re-sample
results in the Mineral Resource Estimation database may introduce bias, should the re-sample
data  be  used  directly  for  grade  estimation.    As  a  result,  the  resampling  data  have  been
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 125
excluded  from  the  estimation  database.    The  re-sampling  data  do,  however,  support  the
smaller sampling intervals utilised since June, 2012.
14.3
Geological Modelling
The  topographic  surface  provided  by  Nimini  was  in  a  .dxf  format  and  was  based  on  a  high  (cm
scale) resolution LIDAR survey.  The terrain in this area is steep and hilly with elevation differences
of over 300 m in the project area.  Most of the project area is densely covered by tall trees that
affect the reliability of the elevations derived from the survey.  Comparison of the drillhole collar
surveys  with  those  of  the  LIDAR  survey  generally  results  in  differences  of  less  than  5  m.    Any
differences  larger  than  5  m  were  interrogated  and  the  drillhole  collars  were  re-surveyed.    The
accuracy of the topographic model elevation is considered to be better than 5 m, which is fit for
the purpose of Mineral Resource Estimation.
Examination  of  the  data  resulted  in  the  definition  of  12  mineralized  zones  in  5  different  blocks
(Figure 14-4, Table 14-4).

Grade  shells  for  each  zone  were  created  using  a  0.50  g/t  Au  threshold.    Where  a  sample  with  a
grade  of  greater  than  0.50  g/t  occurred  it  was  assigned  a  zone  field  name.    If  a  sample  with  a
grade of greater than 0.50 g/t Au did not fall into one of the 12 defined zones it was assigned a
code of “ND”.   The drilled  length of  each intersection was converted to true  thickness based on
the average dip and strike of each mineralized zone.  Where the true thickness of the intersection
was found to be less than 1 m, the intersection was diluted by equal lengths of sample either side
so that a minimum intersection true thickness of 1 m was achieved.  Points were created for the
hangingwall and footwall positions of each grade zone and these were linked together in a series
of strings that were used to create the grade shell wireframes.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 126
When assigning the zone field codes, consideration was given to the following:
  Presence of BIF – in Block 1 these would normally be assigned Zone 2 or Zone 3 codes.
  Presence  of  quartz  veins  between  BIF  zones  and  the  talc  schist  unit  –  these  zones  would
normally be assigned Zone 1 code.
  Geometrical  continuity  –  the  lithological  logging  was  used  as  a  general  guide  and  this  was
overridden where the position of the sample fitted in best with a different zone.  It was found
that  BIF  fragments  do  occur  in  Zone  1,  although  quartz  vein  style  of  mineralization  is
predominant.
Should an intersection occur that did not contain samples with a grade of more than 0.50 g/t Au
on the edges of the plane of mineralization, the wireframes were constrained along dip or strike
by  half  the  distance  between  that  intersection  and  the  nearest  mineralized  intersection.    The
grade shell wireframes were extended a maximum of 40 m down-dip and 20 m along strike from
the  nearest  mineralized
intersection.  Within  the  well-mineralized  zones,
local  areas  of
mineralization  less  than  0.50  g/t  Au  were  intersected.    In  these  instances,  mineralization  of  less
than 0.50 g/t was included in order to ensure lateral or down dip continuity of the zone.
The  wireframes  were  cut  to  the  surface  elevation  using  the  topographic  surface.    A  weathering
surface  was  constructed  by  creating  a  digital  terrain  model  (DTM)  of  the  base  of  the  weathered
units (SAP, OVB and OB;  Table 14-1).  The depth of weathering at Komahun extends from a few
metres to less than 40 m below surface.
Isometric views of the zone wireframes are shown in Figure 14-5 and Figure 14-6.

Statistical Analysis of the Composite Data
The  sample  data  were  selected  from  the  respective  zones  and  composited  to  lengths  of
approximately  1  m  so  that  the  composite  lengths  were  as  near  to  1  m  as  possible  without
discarding  any  of  the  sample  length.    The  composite  data  were  de-clustered  using  cells  of  the
same  dimensions  as  the  estimation  block  model  (10  m  in  the  dip  and  strike  direction  and  2  m
across strike).  A summary of the de-clustered statistics is shown in Table 14-5 and the histograms
and log probability plots are shown in Appendix 3.
The coefficients of variation (CV’s) for the Au grade data are moderate to high, with three out of
the 12 gold grade zones exhibiting  CV’s of greater than 2.00.  Zone 1 has the highest  CV (2.15).
The  histograms  are  positively  skewed.    Density  data  exhibits  a  near  to  bell  shaped  distribution
with low CV’s (less than 0.10).

Cutting and Capping
The log probability plots and histograms of the composite data were examined for outlier values
that have a low probability of re-occurrence.  These values were capped to a threshold as shown
in  Table  14-6.    Outliers  were  defined  as  those  values  with  more  than  twice  the  preceding  value.
Where  clear  breaks  were  observed  in  the  cumulative  frequency  plot,  the  capping  threshold  was
set to the next lowest value in the distribution.  Decisions on the capping threshold were guided
by breaks in the cumulative log probability plots and the location of the high grade samples with
respect to other high grade samples.  A higher capping threshold was applied for the Zone 1 as it
is  characterised  by  the  presence  of  visible  gold  and  more  common  high  grades  than  the  other
zones.  The capping reduced the CV’s to less than 1.7, with the exception of Z1 which remained
slightly greater than 2.0.

Geostatistical Analysis
The  1  m  composite  Au  grade  data  were  examined  using  semi-variograms  that  were  calculated
and  modelled  using  Snowden  Supervisor™  software.    Gold  grades  were  transformed  to  normal
scores  distributions  and  then  the  spherical  semi-variogram  models  were  back-transformed  to
normal statistical space for use in the grade interpolation process.
Initial  exploratory  variography  was  carried  out  on  the  average  grade  and  true  thickness  of  the
intersections  for  each  mineralized  zone.    The  variogram  fans  created  in  this  way  clarified  the
direction of plunge of the higher grade mineralized shoots within the plane of the mineralization.
The longest direction of continuity was found to be between 55° and 70° towards the north east
in the strike direction.

Semi-variograms  were  calculated  on  the  1  m  composite  data  and  modelled  in  three  directions,
the major direction being along the plunge of mineralization and the minor direction being across
strike.    Normalised  semi-variograms  were  calculated  so  that  the  sum  of  the  variance  (total  sill
value) is equal to one.
There  were  insufficient  data  in  order  to  calculate  robust  semi-variograms  for  several  of  the
mineralized zones.  Assumptions were made as to the grade continuity within each zone based on
other  zones  of  similar  geological  and  grade  characteristics  at  Komahun.    The  OS  zone  was
assigned the Z1 semi-variogram model and the STH1 zone was assigned the Z3 semi-variogram
model.  There were insufficient data in order to assess the plunge of the STH1 zone mineralization
and  a  semi-variogram  of  equal  range  was  modelled  within  the  plane  of  the  mineralization,  this
being the average of the major and second major ranges of the Z3 model.  The data for Block 2
and Block 3 were combined and a single semi-variogram was calculated from the combined data.
The across strike semi-variogram could not be calculated across these zones using the combined
data and the range in this direction was assumed to be the same as that for Z3.
Semi-variograms  were  modelled  with  either  one  or  two  spherical  structures.    The  nugget  effect
was estimated by extrapolation of the first two experimental semi-variogram points (calculated at
the  same  lag  as  the  composite  length)  to  the  Y  axis.    The  semi-variogram  models  in  the  down
plunge direction were the most robust, whereas the models in the direction of shortest continuity
were less reliable.
The  semi-variogram  model  parameters  are  shown  in  Table  14-7  and  the  semi-variograms  are
presented in Appendix 4.
Table 14-8 presents a qualitative assessment of the reliability of the variogram models based on
the number of experimental variogram points within the semi-variogram range and the sensitivity
of the semi-variogram to differing lags.  MSA considers the reliability of a semi-variogram model
to  be  good  if  it  is  well  defined  by  a  number  of  semi-variogram  points  and  models  that  involve
more interpretation are less reliable.
The reliability of the semi-variograms in the plane of the mineralization for each of the variables is
generally moderate to good, however the across strike models are of lower confidence.

14.6.1  Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis
The estimation parameters were determined by a geostatistical optimisation process known as a
Kriging  Neighbourhood  Analysis  (KNA).    Several  single  block  estimates  in  various  areas  of  the
deposit  are  performed  using  a  number  of  different  parameters  with  the  aim  of  achieving  the
highest  Kriging  Efficiency  (KE%)  and  Slope  of  Regression  (PSlope).    Slope  of  Regression  is  a
measure  or  how  smoothed  the  estimate  is  and  Kriging  Efficiency  relates  to  the  accuracy  of  the
estimate.    The  choice  of  block  size  also  considers  a  likely  smallest  mining  unit  (SMU)  in  an
underground mining scenario.
The  KNA  resulted  in  a  choice  of  block  size  of  10  m  along  strike,  10  m  vertical  and  2  m  across
strike.  A  20  m  by  20  m  block  was  also  considered  as  the  Kriging  Efficiency  is  higher,  however  it
returned a slightly more smoothed estimate and it was considered that a likely SMU would be 10
m  in  strike  length  rather  than  20  m.    The  minimum  number  of  composites  required  for  a  high
confidence  estimate  was  16  and  the  maximum  number  36,  there  being  no  significant
improvement  in  the  Kriging  Efficiency  or  Slope  of  Regression  with  additional  samples  (Figure
14-7).    With  more  than  36  composites  the  number  of  negative  kriging  weights  increased.    Less
than a discretisation level of 5 strike by 5 vertical by 3 (unitless) across strike resulted in a poorer
estimate and little improvement was noted with a higher level of discretisation.

Block Modelling
Block  models  were  rotated  in  the  strike  direction  in  order  to  best  fit  the  orientation  of  the
mineralized zones.  This is with the exception of the Southern Structure that strikes close to north-
south.  The block model prototype parameters are shown in Table 14-9.  The cells were split to a
minimum  sub-cell  of  1  mX  by  5  mY  by  5  mZ  in  order  to  represent  well  the  wireframe  model
boundaries, while honouring the minimum true width criterion of 1 m.

Block  models  were  created  by  filling  below  the  topographic  surface  and  above  and  below  the
saprolite/weathered surface using the same model prototypes as shown in Table 14-9, while using
a  higher  degree  of  sub-celling  (0.25  m)  in  the  vertical  dimension  to  accurately  represent  the
wireframe  surface.    The  topographic  model  and  saprolite/weathered  models  were  added  to  the
mineralization models, so that the block model cells were coded as either saprolite or fresh rock,
and the model cells above the topographic surface were removed.
The estimate was controlled by the direction and shape of the mineralized zones using a process
known  as  dynamic  anisotropy.    This  was  achieved  by  estimating  a  dip  and  direction  into  each
block model cell based on the dip and direction of the wireframes.  The search parameters used
to estimate the dynamic angles into the block model are shown in Table 14-10.

Estimation of gold grades
Gold  grades  were  estimated  into  the  individual  mineralization  zones  using  the  1  m  composite
drillhole  sample  data  from  within  each  mineralized  zone.    The  boundaries  were  treated  as  hard
boundaries.  Ordinary Kriging was used to estimate the attributes into the block model cells using
parent cell estimation.
The saprolite domain was estimated by extrapolating the grades from the fresh rock domain for
each zone.  The core recovery in the saprolite domain was poor and the assay data derived from
these  samples  was  considered  unsuitable  for  grade  estimation.    As  a  result,  estimates  in  the
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 135
saprolite  domain  should  be  considered  as  low  confidence  estimates.    The  saprolite  domain
comprises approximately 2% of the total Mineral Resource at Komahun.
The  search  distance  and  the  rotation  angles  that  defined  the  search  ellipses  were  set  at  the
variogram range for the respective zone.  If an estimate was not achieved within the search ellipse
volume,  the  search  ellipse  was  expanded  by  50%.    Should  an  estimate  still  not  be  achieved,  the
search ellipse was further expanded so that all the cells within the area of interest were estimated.
For the second and third search ellipse volumes, a reduced maximum number of composites were
used  so  that  averages  of  many  samples  far  away  did  not  over-smooth  these  lower  confidence
estimates.    The  mineralized  zones  in  Blocks  2,  3,  4  and  the  Southern  Structure  are  generally
narrower than those in Block 1 and a slightly reduced number of composites were used for their
estimation.    Each  block  was  represented  by  a  matrix  of  points;  5  in  the  strike  direction,  5  in  the
vertical direction and 3 in the across strike direction.  Each point is estimated and then the points
are averaged to create a block estimate.  The search parameters are shown in Table 14-11.

14.10  Validation of the Estimates
The models were validated by:



visual examination of the input data against the block model estimates,
sectional validation, and
comparison of the de-clustered input data statistics against the model statistics.
The block model was examined visually in sections to ensure that the drillhole grades were locally
well represented by the model.  The conclusion of the visual examination is that the drill hole data
correlate  well  with  block  model  estimates..    Examples  of  sections  showing  the  block  model  and
drillholes shaded by Au g/t are shown in Figure 14-8.
Sectional  validation  plots  were  constructed  for  in  order  to  compare  the  average  grades  of  the
block model against the input data along a number of corridors in various directions through the
deposit.    Samples  of  the  sectional  validation  plots  are  shown  in  Figure  14-9,  Figure  14-10  and
Figure  14-11.    These  show  that  the  estimates  are  slightly  smoother  than  the  data  yet  retain  the
grade trends across the deposit.

The  de-clustered  mean  of  the  data  is  compared  to  the  model  mean  in  Table  14-13.    The  global
comparison  is  reasonable  for  most  zones.    Mean  values  tend  to  overestimate  skewed
distributions.  Average grades for the model are generally expected to be slightly lower than that
of the data, as block estimates are less skewed than data.
Histograms of the model data and the capped data are shown side by side in Appendix 5.

14.11  Classification
Classification  of  the  Komahun  Mineral  Resource  is  based  on  the  confidence  in  the  data,
confidence in the geological model and the continuity of grade.  The main considerations in the
classification of the Komahun Mineral Resource are as follows:
  All of the data that informs the Mineral Resource has been collected by Nimini.   These data
have been collected using “Best Practice” principles and there is high confidence in the quality
of the data, it having passed the necessary quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) tests.
  The  geological  framework  of  the  Mineral  Resource  is  well  understood  and  the  most  of  the
wireframes in Block 1 and portions of Block 2 are informed by a drillhole grid approximately
40 m in strike by 40 m in  dip.  Most of the wireframes in Block 3, Block 4  and  the Southern
Structure are informed by sparser drilling of approximately 80 m in strike and dip directions.
Where the closer spaced drillhole grid  exists, interpretation between drillholes is  reasonable,
however  alternative  interpretations  can  be  made  for  the  zones  informed  by  wider  spaced
drilling and continuity of mineralization between the holes has not been verified at the 80 m
drillhole spacing.
  The mineralized zones at Nimini pinch and swell in both dip and strike directions, the longest
direction  of  grade  and  thickness  continuity  being  steeply  plunging  to  the  north-east.
Wireframes  were  extrapolated  a  maximum  of  20  m  along  strike  and  40  m  down-dip  of  the
nearest  drillhole  intersection  when  the  wireframes  are  not  well  constrained  by  poorly
mineralized peripheral data.
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 140
  Grade estimates have been completed in several search volumes, the first search sourcing at
least 12 one metre composites within the semi-variogram range, the second sourcing at least
8 composites within one and a half times the semi-variogram range.
The  initial  classification  was  based  on  the  block  estimates.    Indicated  Mineral  Resources  were
declared if block estimates were achieved with the required minimum number of samples within
the  semi-variogram range  for each zone.  Where  estimates were  achieved within one  and  a half
times  the  semi-variogram  range  they  were  considered  for  classification  as  Indicated  Mineral
Resources only where they occurred largely within an area of blocks estimated by the first search
range.    Therefore  classification  of  estimates  achieved  using  a  number  of  samples  spaced  wider
than the semi-variogram range as Indicated Mineral Resources was for the purpose of achieving a
continuous zone of Indicated Mineral Resources rather than a primary classification criterion.  The
classification achieved using the aforementioned parameters was downgraded to Inferred Mineral
Resources where the geological interpretation was not considered to be robust.
All  of  the  weathered/saprolite  zones  were  classified  as  Inferred  Resources.    MSA  considers  that
the  data  collected  within  this  domain  are  unreliable  and  should  not  be  used  for  estimation;
therefore  the  weathered/saprolite  estimates  are  entirely  based  on  extrapolation  from  the  fresh
rock domain samples.  Inferred Mineral Resources in the fresh rock domain were declared should
a block estimate be located within the constraints of the wireframed zones.  The wireframes were
extrapolated by 20 m along strike and 40 m down-dip of the nearest drillhole intersection, while
considering the trend of the extents of the mineralized zones.
The  classified  areas  in  relation  to  the  drillholes  are  shown  in  long  section  projections  in  Figure
14-12 and Figure 14-13.  The reader is cautioned that the zones are projected onto long section
and  therefore  where  multiple  zones  are  shown  they  may  appear  closer  to  each  other  than  they
actually are.
Nimini  was  awarded  an  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Licence  in  August  2012  and  a  Large-
Scale  Mining  Licence  (comprising  the  total  area  previously  held  under  exploration  licences)  in
November 2012, both of which are in good standing.  To the best of MSA’s knowledge there are
no environmental, permitting, legal, tax,  socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues which
may materially affect the mineral resource estimate as reported in this technical report.
The Mineral Resources may be affected by further infill and exploration drilling, which may result
in  increases  or  decreases  in  subsequent  mineral  resource  estimates.  The  Inferred  Mineral
Resources  that  are  derived  from  extrapolation  outside  of  the  drillhole  grid  are  considered  to  be
higher  risk  estimates  that  may  change  significantly  with  additional  data.    It  cannot  be  assumed
that  all  or  part  of  an  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  will  necessarily  be  upgraded  to  an  Indicated
Mineral  Resource  as  a  result  of  continued  exploration.    The  Mineral  Resources  may  also  be
affected  by  subsequent  assessments  of  mining,  environmental,  processing,  permitting,  taxation,
socio-economic and other factors.

14.12  Mineral Resource Statement
The  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  as  at  12  June,  2013,  is  presented  for  the  whole  of  Komahun  in
Table 14-14.  The Mineral Resource is stated at a cut-off grade of 2.4 g/t Au over a minimum true
mineralized width of 1 m.  Isolated, low grade and low tonnage areas that occur outside the main
mineralized zones have been excluded from the Mineral Resource as they are considered unlikely
to  be  mined.    In  MSA’s  opinion,  the  Mineral  Resources  reported  herein  at  the  selected  cut-off
grade have “reasonable prospects for economic extraction”, taking into consideration mining and
processing assumptions.  These prospects are based on an underground mine and process plant
with operating cost of $100 per tonne and a gold price of $1,300 per Troy Ounce.
The Mineral Resource in Block 1, 2, 3 and 4 dips close to vertical, strikes close to north-east and
occurs  over  a  strike  length  of  approximately  1.2  km.    The  Southern  Structure  occurs  more  than
400 m to the South of Block 4, dips close to vertical and strikes in a near northerly direction over a
distance  of  approximately  300  m.  The  maximum  depth  of  the  Mineral  Resource  is  800  m  below
surface.
The reader is cautioned that the assessment of the mineralization estimate that is incorporated in
the  Mineral  Resource  is  solely  for  the  purpose  of  reporting  Mineral  Resources  that  have
“reasonable prospects for economic extraction” underground and does not represent an attempt
to estimate Mineral Reserves.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
The current drill programme has successfully extended mineralization in all blocks down-dip, with
Section 14 reporting Mineral Resources to a depth of approximately 800 m below surface in Block
1, approximately 500 m in Block 2, approximately 420 m in Block 3, an average of 350 m in Block
4 and 200 m in the Southern Structure
All resource blocks remain open with depth although, in Blocks 1 and the main B2FW unit in Block
2,  the  grades  and  mineralized  widths  appear  to  decrease  with  depth.    The  current  drilling
programme has, however, identified a prominent, steeply plunging trend in many of the modelled
zones (Z1-3 in Block 1, the B2HW and B2FW zones in Block 2 and the EEZ2 zone in Block 3) that is
associated with increased grades and thicknesses. It is the authors’ opinion that, should there be a
project to extend the Mineral Resource at the Property with depth, additional drilling should focus
on following these steeply plunging zones.
A significant observation is that mineralization grades and continuity are best developed in Block
1, where several discontinuous BIF horizons are known to occur.  By contrast, the grades in Block
2  are  significantly  lower,  despite  the  presence  of  a  robust  BIF  as  the  mineralization  host.    It  is
concluded that discontinuous BIF “fragments” provided local dilational sites for mineralizing fluids
in  contrast  to  the  more  robust  and  planar  BIF  in  Block  2.    In  blocks  where  BIF  is  largely  or
completely  absent  (i.e.  Block  3),  the  orientation  of  mineralized  structures  is  less  constrained  and
more  variable  which  is  attributable  to  the  lack  of  a  strong  rheological  interface  to  control  the
mineralizing fluids
Despite assay results from the RC programme and drillhole NWKD394 not being available as yet,
many  of  these  holes  support  the  possible  extension  of  mineralization  between  Block  1  in  the
north  and  Southern  Structure  1  (Block  5)  in  the  south,  as  well  as  Southern  Structure  1  and
Southern Structure 2 further to the  south.  Visibly  mineralized intersections from NWKD394 and
NWRC002  support  the  possible  continuity  between  Block  1  and  Southern  Structure  1,  whereas
NWRC006  and  NWRC007  support  the  potential  southwards  extension  of  Southern  Structure  1
towards Southern Structure 2.  All visibly mineralized intersections from these holes are at depth
and suggest that mineralization may be blind i.e. without surface expression, which is supported
by  the  lack  of  surface  geochemical  anomalies  in  either  area.    The  current  drill  programme  over
Block 4 (“Fault Offset”) returned a number of intersections that cannot at this stage be confidently
modelled  into  coherent  wireframes.    The  structural  complexity  in  Block  4  is  yet  to  be  fully
understood and will likely only be clarified with additional drilling.
Ongoing  “regional”  surface  exploration  work  has  highlighted  a  number  of  additional  potential
targets for more detailed work.  To date, less than 2 km of strike length of the interpreted  10 km
of BIF extent on the licence has been tested systematically below surface.  The documentation of
multi-element  geochemical  anomalies  associated  with  mineralization  in  Block  1  suggests  that
future  soil  sampling  work  should  include  some  multi-element  assays  to  enhance  surface
exploration activities.

Significant  amounts  of  soil  and  outcrop  creep  are  noted  at  the  Property,  to  the  extent  that
trenching data was excluded from the MRE presented in Section 14 due to obvious displacement
of  trenched  intersections  relative  to  the  underlying  mineralized  zones.    Despite  this,  all  of  the
major  “discoveries”  at  Komahun  have  relied  on  soil  sampling  as  the  primary  discovery  method.
However,  it  is  the  authors  opinion  that  deeper  penetration  geochemical  sampling  should  be
considered,  either  using  a  rotary  air  blast  (RAB)  rig  or  mechanical  auger,  that  will  facilitate
sampling of the saprolite immediately overlying potentially mineralized bedrock.
None of the modelled VTEM plates have been properly drill tested, but the apparent co-incidence
of  several  modelled  VTEM  plates  with  mineralized  intersections  in  the  vicinity  of  Komahun
suggests  a  potential  correlation.    While  the  authors  have  reservations  about  the  applicability  of
VTEM  to  the  style  of  mineralization  at  the  Project,  it  is  noted  that  none  of  the  modelled  plates
extend  to  surface  and  drill  testing  may  be  the  only  viable  option  to  establish  their  authenticity.
The  recently  completed  IP  survey  has  identified  six  large  target  areas  and  follow-up  exploration
on these targets is recommended in order to test the veracity of the IP method at Komahun.
Given  the  potential  for  strike  extensions  of  the  currently  delineated  mineralized  zones  at
Komahun, attention should be given to the exploration for potentially shallower strike extensions
given  the  likely  lower  costs  associated  with  potential  future  extraction  of  shallow,  open-pittable
Mineral  Resources  as  opposed  to  deeper,  underground  Mineral  Resources.    The  potential
continuity  of  mineralization  southwards  from  Block  1  to  the  Southern  Structure  (Block  5)  and
Southwards from Southern Structure 1, are the most obvious targets for this follow-up work.
It  is  the  authors’  opinion  that  drilling,  both  in  recent  and  current  programmes,  has  been  carried
out according to international best-practice and that the respective drill programmes have been
designed  in  order  to  maximise  value  and  return  on  expenditure.    QAQC  protocols  and
performance are considered acceptable. The Inferred Mineral Resources (Section 14) stated in this
report  are  considered  comparably  higher  risk  compared  to  the  Indicated  Mineral  Resources  and
infill  drilling  may  need  to  be  carried  out  to  convert  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  to  Indicated
Mineral Resources in order to support possible future Prefeasibility or Bankable feasibility studies.
The  authors  are  not  aware  of  any  title,  legal,  taxation,  marketing,  permitting,  socio-economic  or
other relevant issues that may materially affect the Mineral Resources described in this Technical
Report.  Furthermore, no technical risks are identified that could reasonably be expected to affect
the reliability of, or confidence in the exploration information presented or the Mineral Resource
Estimate.  Inherent technical risk does, however, exist for the proposed work programme insofar
as there are inherent risks associated with early stage exploration, particularly as the target zones
for  testing  strike  extensions  to  Komahun  do  not  appear  to  be  associated  with  surface
geochemical expressions.  Similarly, lack of mineralized continuity either down-dip or along strike
may significantly impact the proposed work programme.

RECOMMENDATIONS
In the opinion of the authors, the Komahun Project warrants continued exploration with a specific
focus  on  attempting  to  delineate  potential  strike  extensions  from  known  mineralization  at  the
Property.  Key areas to be considered are (Figure 26-1):
  The  ~  500  m  of  potential  strike  extent  between  Block  1  and  Southern  Structure  1  (Block  5),
based  on  promising  intersections  from  NWKD394  and  RC  holes  drilled  to  the  north  of  the
currently modelled extent of Block 5/Southern Structure 1
  The ~ 300 m of potential strike extent between Southern Structure 1 (Block 5) and Southern
Structure  2.    Recent  drill  campaigns  intersected  mineralization  at  Southern  Structure  2  but
insufficient  drilling  has  been  carried  out  to  establish  continuity.    Promising  RC  intersections
have  been  returned  from  RC  holes  drilled  between  Southern  Structure  1  and  Southern
Structure 2
Furthermore,  the  apparent  co-incidence  of  Block  1  hangingwall  mineralization  with  a  modelled
Maxwell  plate  from  the  VTEM  survey,  in  addition  to  the  coincidence  with  other  modelled  plates
with  Block  1  and  2  mineralization,  support  further  work  being  undertaken  to  test  these  Maxwell
plates.
A  two-phase  work  programme  is  proposed  to  execute  the  above.    Advancement  to  Phase  2
activities  is  entirely  dependent  on  positive  results  being  delivered  from  Phase  1  exploration.
Phase  2  activities,  if  undertaken,  culminate  with  a  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  on  the  potential
zones planned for testing during Phase 1.  Associated costs, including staffing, camp running and
maintenance are included for the duration of the proposed work programmes and are based on
actual expenditure incurred in 2013 as supplied by Nimini.
Additional recommendations (not costed at this stage) are also made.
26.1
Phase 1: Initial RC drill programme
Phase 1 is divided into three discrete (a, b and c) subphases, each with its own specific objectives.
The phases will most likely be executed sequentially and will utilise common equipment i.e. an RC
rig and are therefore grouped as a single work phase.  The total estimated duration for Phase 1,
including  assay  turnarounds  from  the  laboratory,  is  estimated  at  4  months.    Estimated  costs  for
Phase 1 are summarised in Table 26-1.
26.1.1  Phase 1a
Phase  1a  comprises  drill  testing  of  the  area  (approximately  500  m  long  by  200  m  wide)  of
potential  mineralized strike extent between Block 1 and Southern Structure 1 (Block 5).   Historic
surface  sampling  activities  (i.e.  soil  sampling  and  pitting)  have  not  delineated  anomalous  zones
that have warranted follow-up work.  However, visibly mineralized intersections from both the RC
programme and drillhole NWKD394 are only recorded from depth (i.e. > 150 m downhole) and it
is  considered  that  any  potential  mineralization  may  be  blind  and  not  manifest  at  surface.    It  is
therefore  recommended  that  an  inclined  RC  drilling  programme  is  undertaken  to  test  this
hypothesis.

Proposed areas for strike extension testing (green polygons)
Figure 26-1
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 152
The proposed drilling programme comprises five section  lines, spaced at a nominal 100 m along
strike  and  three  inclined,  200  m  holes  along  each  fence  hole  drilled  in  a  heel-toe  configuration,
allowing  for  across-strike  coverage  of  300  m  for  45°  inclined  holes.    The  proposed  RC  drilling
amounts  to  3000  m  in  15  holes.    Costing  for  this  phase  of  work  is  based  on  the  following
assumptions:
  All-in per metre drilling rate includes assay and sample transport costs, survey, reaming, fuel
and labour and is based on the actual incurred expenditure for the RC drilling undertaken in
2013
  The all-in rate is a weighted average between the all-in RC rate and the all-in diamond drilling
rate for diamond tails, in a proportion of 3:1 i.e. 150 m RC and 50 m of diamond tails
Positive results from Phase 1a will result in Phase 2a being undertaken.
26.1.2  Phase 1b
It  is  proposed  that  a  limited  RC  drilling  programme  is  undertaken  to  test  the  Maxwell  plate
modelled in the hangingwall to Block 1.  The plate is modelled as being concealed and drillholes
and trenches from recent and historic programmes may have intersected the upper limits of this
plate.  Three holes with an average depth of 180 m (for a total of 540 m) are proposed to test this
structure.  The costing of this drilling is based on the same assumptions as for Phase 1a.
Positive results from Phase 1b will result in a more extensive drill programme aimed at testing all
modelled Maxwell plates, as described in Phase 2b.
26.1.3  Phase 1c
Phase  1c  comprises  a  limited  RC  drill  programme  to  test  possible  strike  continuity  between
Southern Structure 1 and Southern Structure 2.  The area of interest is approximately 300 m long
by  200  m  wide  and  is  designed  to  potentially  extend  the  known  extent  of  mineralization  from
Southern Structure 1 southwards to the less well-defined  mineralization in Southern Structure 2.
Potential for this mineralization is indicated by the presence of visible gold in panned RC cuttings
from  RC  holes  drilled  to  the  south  of  the  current  extents  of  Southern  Structure  1.    Three  fence
lines, spaced nominally 100 m apart, with two inclined 200 m RC heel-toe holes are proposed for
this  programme,  for  a  total  of  1200  m  in  six  holes.    The  costing  of  this  drilling  is  based  on  the
same assumptions as for Phases 1a and 1b.
Positive results from Phase 1b will result in Phase 2c being undertaken.

Phase 2: follow up and Mineral Resource drilling
Execution of individual sub-phases with Phase 2 is entirely contingent on positive results from the
preceding  sub-phase  in  the  Phase  1  programme.    The  aims  of  the  Phase  2  programme  are  the
delineation of Inferred Mineral Resources for Phases 2a and c, and the rollout of a more extensive
drill programme to test the remaining Maxwell plates in Phase 2b.  Phase 2 is estimated to take 8
months to complete (including assay turnarounds) using three diamond drill rigs and a single RC
rig.  An overview and cost estimate of Phase 2 is provided in Table 26-2.
Phase 2 will, if supported by the data emanating from Phases 2a and 2c, culminate in an updated
MRE  and  Technical  Report.    No  addition  of  Mineral  Resources  is  planned  or  anticipated  from
Phase 2b.
26.2.1  Phase 2a
Phase  2a  has  been  formulated  on  the  assumption  of  positive  results  from  Phase  1a  is  further
subdivided into Phase 2a.1 and Phase 2a.2 as follows:
NI 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Komahun Gold Project, Kono Region, Sierra Leone
Page: 154
  Phase  2a.1:  twinning  of  two  RC  drillholes  with  diamond  core  drilling  will  be  undertaken  to
ensure  the  RC  sampling  data  is  representative  (i.e.  recovery  and  potential  bias),  for  an
estimated total of 400 m of diamond drilling
  Phase 2a.2: a further 10 holes, for a total of 2000 m of diamond drilling are estimated to be
sufficient to cover the strike identified from Phase 1a and to be used in conjunction with the
RC drill data, to potentially allow the estimation of an Inferred Mineral Resource over the area
of interest
Cost  estimates  for  this  drill  programme  have  been  taken  from  actual  expenditures  during  2013
and  allowance  for  overheads,  staffing  and  camp  costs  has  been  made  in  line  with  actual
expenditure from the same period.
26.2.2  Phase 2b
In  the  event  of  positive  results  emanating  from  the  RC  drill  testing  of  the  Block  1  hangingwall
plate (Phase 1b), it is recommended that a more extensive RC drill programme be undertaken to
test  the remaining modelled Maxwell plates.  A total  of 12 plates were modelled, but given that
one  plate  is  to  be  tested  in  Phase  1b  and  a  further  two  plates  already  coincide  with  known
mineralization  in  Blocks  1  and  2,  nine  plates  remain  to  be  tested.    Two  RC  holes  per  plate  are
envisaged for a total of 3,600 m of RC drilling in 18 holes.  Costs for this programme are based on
the same assumptions as per Phase 1a.
26.2.3  Phase 2c
As for Phase 2a, Phase 2c has been formulated on the assumption of positive results from Phase
1c is further subdivided into Phase 2c.1 and Phase 2c.2 as follows:
  Phase  2c.1:  twinning  of  two  RC  drillholes  with  diamond  core  drilling  will  be  undertaken  to
ensure  the  RC  sampling  data  (i.e.  recovery  and  potential  bias)  is  representative,  for  an
estimated total of 400 m of diamond drilling
  Phase  2a.2:  a  further  4  holes,  for  a  total  of  800  m  of  diamond  drilling  are  estimated  to  be
sufficient to cover the strike identified from Phase 1c and to be used in conjunction with the
RC drill data, to potentially allow the estimation of an Inferred Mineral Resource over the area
of interest
Cost  estimates  for  this  drill  programme  have  been  taken  from  actual  expenditures  during  2013
and  allowance  for  additional  overhead,  support,  staffing  and  camp  costs  has  been  made  in  line
with actual expenditure from the same period.

Additional recommendations
The  following  additional  recommendations  are  made  for  suggested  implementation  at  the
Property:
  The continued use of SFA’s on well-mineralized and visible-gold bearing samples;

Further  interpretation  of  IP  dataset  and  possible  ground  truthing  of  IP  areas  through
trenching or pitting;

  Multielement  analyses  should  be  carried  out  for  a  high  proportion  of  soil  samples  going
forward
  Should any further large drilling programmes be undertaken, it is highly likely that additional
coreshed  space  will  be  required  to  stored  drill  core.    An  additional  sample  (i.e.  pulps  and
coarse  rejects)  storage  area  should  also  be  considered  to  ensure  robust  custodianship  of
these samples
  Pulps and rejects currently on site should be catalogued and relabelled

Future umpire assay programmes should use identical subsample sizes (i.e. 50 g for fire assay)
to the original sampling programme

aeromagnetic survey
Algoma-type BIF
Definition 
An aeromagnetic survey is a common type of geophysical survey carried out using a magnetometer 
aboard or towed behind an aircraft. The principle is similar to a magnetic survey carried out with a 
hand-held magnetometer, but allows much larger areas of the Earth's surface to be covered quickly for 
regional reconnaissance. The aircraft typically flies in a grid-like pattern with height and line spacing 
determining the resolution of the data (and cost of the survey per unit area). 
Algoma type BIF deposits are small lenticular iron deposits that are associated with volcanic 
rocks and turbidites.  Deposition occurs in island arc/back arc basins and intracratonic rift zones.
amphibolite
Amphibolite is a metamorphic rock consisting mainly of amphibole, especially the species hornblende 
and actinolite.
Aqua regia (Latin and Ancient Italian, lit. "regal water"), aqua regis (Latin, lit. "king's water"), or nitro-
hydrochloric acid is a highly corrosive mixture of acids, a fuming yellow or red solution. The mixture is 
formed by freshly mixing concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid,[1] usually in a volume[citation 
needed] ratio of 1:3. It was named so because it can dissolve the so-called royal or noble metals, gold 
and platinum. However, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, tantalum, osmium, rhodium and a few other 
metals are capable of withstanding its corrosive properties. 
The Archean (also spelled Archaean; formerly Archaeozoic) is a geologic eon before the Proterozoic 
Eon, before 2.5 Ga (billion years), or 2,500 million years ago. 
Archimedes' principle indicates that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, 
whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. 
Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. 
Arsenopyrite is an iron arsenic sulphide (FeAsS). It is a hard (Mohs 5.5-6) metallic, opaque, steel grey 
to silver white mineral with a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1 
Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative 
determination of chemical elements employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms 
in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of 
a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analysed. AAS can be used to determine over 70 
different elements in solution or directly in solid samples employed in pharmacology, biophysics and 
toxicology research. 
(of rocks or minerals) Containing gold.
Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units 
of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age. A typical BIF consists of repeated, thin 
layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides, 
either magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3), alternating with bands of iron-poor shales and cherts, 
often red in color, of similar thickness, and containing microbands (sub-millimeter) of iron oxides.
Barren refers to unmineralized material 
Bulk Leach Extractable Gold, more commonly shortened to BLEG is a geochemical sampling/analysis 
tool used during exploration for gold. It was developed in the early 1980s to address concerns relating 
to the accurately measuring fine grained gold, and dealing with problems associated with sample 
heterogeneity. BLEG is essentially a chemical sieve, designed to focus on the fine grained gold fraction. 
Bottle roll - Bench-scale leaching test in which samples are placed in plastic bottles with the leaching 
reagent and agitated continuously by rolling on rotating rollers. The method is most frequently used 
for cyanide leaching of gold or sulphuric acid leaching of base metals. 
Boudinage is a geological term for structures formed by extension, where a rigid tabular body such as 
Hornfels, is stretched and deformed amidst less competent surroundings. The competent bed begins 
to break up, forming sausage-shaped boudins. A boudinage structure is very similar to pillow basalt in 
appearance but in overall formation is very different. Boudins are typical features of sheared veins and 
shear zones where, due to stretching along the shear foliation and shortening perpendicular to this, 
rigid bodies break up.  
Carbonation is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in a liquid. The process usually involves 
carbon dioxide under high pressure. When the pressure is reduced, the carbon dioxide is released from 
the solution as small bubbles, which causes the solution to become effervescent, or "fizz". An example 
of carbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water, resulting in carbonated water.

Definition 
Cassiterite is a tin oxide mineral, SnO2. It is generally opaque, but it is translucent in thin crystals. Its 
luster and multiple crystal faces produce a desirable gem. Cassiterite has been the chief tin ore 
throughout ancient history and remains the most important source of tin today. Most sources of 
cassiterite today are found in alluvial or placer deposits containing the resistant weathered grains. The 
best sources of primary cassiterite are found in the tin mines of Bolivia, where it is found in 
hydrothermal veins. 
A cation (+), from the Greek word κατά (katá), meaning "down", is an ion with fewer electrons than 
protons, giving it a positive charge. 
Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) are ‘controls’ or standards used to check the quality and 
traceability of products. A reference standard for a unit of measurement is an artifact that embodies 
the quantity of interest in a way that ties its value to the reference base for calibration. 
Chalcopyrite is a copper iron sulphide mineral that crystallizes in the tetragonal system. It has the 
chemical composition CuFeS2. It has a brassy to golden yellow color and a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the 
Mohs scale. Its streak is diagnostic as green tinged black. 
Chargeability (M) - One of the units of measurement of induced polarization in the time domain. True 
chargeability is the ratio of the over- or secondary voltage, Vs, to the observed voltage, Vo, applied by 
way of an electrode array so that M = Vs/Vo, expressed as a percentage or as millivolts per volt; this 
quantity is independent of topographic effects and of electrode geometry and is thus a good measure 
of induced polarization.  
Chert is a fine-grained silica-rich microcrystalline, cryptocrystalline or microfibrous sedimentary rock 
that may contain small fossils. It varies greatly in color (from white to black), but most often manifests 
as gray, brown, grayish brown and light green to rusty red; its color is an expression of trace elements 
present in the rock, and both red and green are most often related to traces of iron (in its oxidized and 
reduced forms respectively). 
The chlorites are a group of phyllosilicate minerals. Chlorites can be described by the following four 
endmembers based on their chemistry via substitution of the following four elements in the silicate 
lattice; Mg, Fe, Ni, and Mn. Chlorite is commonly found in igneous rocks as an alteration product of 
mafic minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. In this environment chlorite may be a 
retrograde metamorphic alteration mineral of existing ferromagnesian minerals, or it may be present 
as a metasomatism product via addition of Fe, Mg, or other compounds into the rock mass. Chlorite is 
a common mineral associated with hydrothermal ore deposits. 
Pertaining to, or containing, chlorite
The chlorites are a group of phyllosilicate minerals. Chlorites can be described by the following four 
endmembers based on their chemistry via substitution of the following four elements in the silicate 
lattice; Mg, Fe, Ni, and Mn. Chlorite forms by the alteration of mafic minerals such as pyroxenes, 
amphiboles, biotite, staurolite, cordierite, garnet, and chloritoid. Chlorite can also occur as a result of 
hydrothermal alteration of any rock type, where recrystallization of clay minerals or alteration of mafic 
minerals produce chlorite (called chlorotization).
Chromite is an iron chromium oxide: FeCr2O4. It is an oxide mineral belonging to the spinel group. 
Magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a solid solution with 
magnesiochromite (MgCr2O4); substitution of aluminium occurs leading to hercynite (FeAl2O4). 
Chromite is found in peridotite from the Earth's mantle. It also occurs in layered ultramafic intrusive 
rocks (Bushveld Complex, RSA). In addition, it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some 
serpentinites. Ore deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates.
Carbon-in-Leach - The recovery process in which gold is leached from gold ore pulp by cyanide and 
simultaneously adsorbed onto activated carbon granules in the same vessel. The loaded carbon is then 
separated from the pulp for subsequent gold removal by elution. The process is typically employed 
where there is a naturally occurring gold adsorbent in the ore  
Standard Deviation divided by the Mean. It is a unit less number and therefore the variability of 
different sample populations can be compared.  Generally, CV's in excess of  1.5  require greater 
understanding in terms of grade distribution. 
Coltan (short for columbite–tantalite and known industrially as tantalite) is a dull black metallic ore 
from which the elements niobium (formerly "columbium") and tantalum are extracted. The niobium-
dominant mineral in coltan is columbite, and the tantalum-dominant mineral is tantalite. Tantalum 
from coltan is used to manufacture tantalum capacitors, used in electronic products.

Definition 
A conglomerate is a rock consisting of individual clasts within a finer-grained matrix that have 
become cemented together. Conglomerates are sedimentary rocks consisting of rounded fragments 
and are thus differentiated from breccias, which consist of angular clasts. Both conglomerates and 
breccias are characterized by clasts larger than sand (>2 mm). 
Conjugate Joints occur when the joints intersect each other at angles significantly less than ninety 
degrees. Conjugate shear fold systems are often developed when brittle laminated rocks are 
subjected to stress. These structures may have an orthorhombic, monoclinic or triclinic symmetry 
depending upon the relationship of the principal axes of stress to the surface being folded. Within first 
order shear zones conjugate second order shear folds may be developed as a result of reorientation of 
the stress axes in these zones. 
A craton is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere. Having often survived cycles of 
merging and rifting of continents, cratons are generally found in the interiors of tectonic plates. They 
are characteristically composed of ancient crystalline basement rock, which may be covered by 
younger sedimentary rock. They have a thick crust and deep lithospheric roots that extend as much as 
several hundred kilometres into the Earth's mantle. 
A database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported by 
the database management system (DBMS) and refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how 
a database is constructed (divided into database tables in case of Relational Databases).  
In geology the terms sinistral and dextral refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on 
either side of a fault or the sense of movement within a shear zone. These are terms of relative 
direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. 
Movement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if 
straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer. 
Diagenesis is changes to sediment or sedimentary rocks during and after rock formation (lithification), 
at temperatures and pressures less than that required for the formation of metamorphic rocks or 
melting. It does not include changes from weathering. It is any chemical, physical, or biological change 
undergone by a sediment after its initial deposition and during and after its lithification, exclusive of 
surface alteration (weathering) and metamorphism. 
Diamond core drilling (exploration diamond drilling) utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated drill 
bit attached to the end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to 
make diamond core bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds, and the 
ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in 
different types of rock formations . The diamonds are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from 
brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the 
rock which must be cut. 
Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement to Global Positioning System that 
provides improved location accuracy, from the 15-meter nominal GPS accuracy to about 10 cm in case 
of the best implementations. DGPS uses a network of fixed, ground-based reference stations to 
broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the satellite systems and the known fixed 
positions. 
Dilational emplacement, in which the country rock moves aside, often under a tensional stress, to 
allow the magma to fill the space that has been created by the movement. The country rocks are not 
significantly deformed by this process. 
DXF is a file extension for a graphic image format typically used with AutoCAD (Computer Assisted 
Drafting) software. DXF stands for Drawing eXchange Format. Since its initial release in 1982, there 
have been many changes to the DXF file format specifications. For that reason, AutoDesk maintains a 
current list of DXF file format specifications. Depending on the software creating the DXF file, it can 
either be in an ASCII or a binary format. 
A dike or dyke in geology is a sheet of rock that formed in a crack in a pre-existing rock body. 
However, when the crack is between the layers in a layered rock, it is called a sill, not a dike. It is a type 
of tabular or sheet intrusion, that either cuts across layers in a planar wall rock structures, or into a 
layer or unlayered mass of rock.
Epidote is a calcium aluminium iron sorosilicate mineral. Well-developed crystals of epidote, 
Ca2Al2(Fe3+;Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: 
they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single 
plane of symmetry.
Epigenetic Deposits are mineral deposits that formed later than the enclosing rocks. The mineral 
composition and chemical composition of epigenetic deposits differ markedly from the composition of 
the enclosing rocks. Epigenetic deposits usually occur in the form of veins, lenses, stocks, and pipes 
that cut through the rocks; zones of mineralization accompanying epigenetic deposits form in the 
enclosing rocks through their action. Epigenetic deposits include magmatic deposits of 
titanomagnetites, chromites, platinoids, diamonds, and apatite, as well as certain bodies of sulphide

copper-nickel ores.
An estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams 
flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Estuaries form a transition zone between 
river environments and maritime environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as 
tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and 
sediment. 
 
Associated with /or containing iron; and/or having the color of iron rust (reddish-brown). 
Fire assaying is the industry standard process for obtaining analytical gold and platinum group 
element (PGE) data from high grade ores. It is a modernized process but in its simplest form, has been 
in use for centuries. Fire assaying is used in the determination of gold in all sample types, including 
drill core, soil and chip samples. 
A geological fold occurs when one or a stack of originally flat and planar surfaces, such as 
sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of permanent deformation. Synsedimentary folds are 
those due to slumping of sedimentary material before it is lithified. Folds in rocks vary in size from 
microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold 
trains of different sizes, on a variety of scales. Folds form under varied conditions of stress, 
hydrostatic pressure, pore pressure, and temperature gradient, as evidenced by their presence in soft 
sediments, the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks, and even as primary flow structures in some 
igneous rocks. 
The two sides of a non-vertical fault (inclined fault) are known as the hanging wall and footwall. By 
definition, the footwall occurs below the fault. This terminology comes from mining: when working a 
tabular ore body, the miner stood with the footwall under his feet and with the hanging wall hanging 
above him.

Garnets are a group of silicate minerals that have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and 
abrasives. Garnets possess similar physical properties and crystal forms but different chemical 
compositions. The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties of which 
are hessonite or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. Garnets are nesosilicates 
having the general formula X3Y2(SiO4)3. Garnet species are found in many colors including red, orange, 
yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black, pink and colorless.
Gneiss is a common and widely distributed type of rock formed by high-grade regional metamorphic 
processes from pre-existing formations that were originally either igneous or sedimentary rocks. It is 
foliated (composed of layers of sheet-like planar structures). The foliations are characterized by 
alternating darker and lighter colored bands, called "gneissic banding". 
A granitoid or granitic rock is a variety of coarse grained plutonic rock similar to granite which 
mineralogically are composed predominantly of feldspar and quartz. Examples of granitoid rocks 
include granite, quartz monzonite, quartz diorite, syenite, granodiorite and trondhjemite. Many are 
created by continental volcanic arc subduction or the collision of sialic masses. 
Granulites are medium to coarse–grained metamorphic rocks that have experienced high temperature 
metamorphism, composed mainly of feldspars sometimes associated with quartz and anhydrous 
ferromagnesian minerals, with granoblastic texture and gneissose to massive structure. They are of 
particular interest to geologists because many granulites represent samples of the deep continental 
crust. The minerals present in a granulite will vary depending on the parent rock of the granulite 
and the temperature and pressure conditions  
Greenschist are metamorphic rocks that formed under the lowest temperatures and pressures usually 
produced by regional metamorphism, typically 300–450 °C (570–840 °F) and 1–4 kilobars (14,500–
58,000 psi). The name comes from commonly having an abundance of green minerals such as chlorite, 
serpentine, and epidote, and platy minerals such as muscovite and platy serpentine.
Greenstone belts are zones of variably metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic volcanic sequences with 
associated sedimentary rocks that occur within Archaean and Proterozoic cratons between granite and 
gneiss bodies. The name comes from the green hue imparted by the colour of the metamorphic 
minerals within the mafic rocks.

Definition 
Greywacke or Graywacke is a variety of sandstone generally characterized by its hardness, dark color, 
and poorly sorted angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and small rock fragments or lithic fragments set in 
a compact, clay-fine matrix. It is a texturally immature sedimentary rock generally found in Palaeozoic 
strata. The larger grains can be sand- to gravel-sized, and matrix materials generally constitute more 
than 15% of the rock by volume. The term "greywacke" can be confusing, since it can refer to either 
the immature (rock fragment) aspect of the rock or the fine-grained (clay) component of the rock. 
The two sides of a non-vertical fault (inclined fault) are known as the hanging wall and footwall. By 
definition, the hanging wall occurs above the fault plane. This terminology comes from mining: when 
working a tabular ore body, the miner stood with the footwall under his feet and with the hanging wall 
hanging above him. 
Hinge - points of maximum curvature within a single folded surface. The fold axis and fold hinge line 
have the 
same attitude. The hinge may be represented by a point or by a zone. The inflection point occurs 
when the curvature becomes zero. The limb of a fold is that part of the folded surface between 
adjacent hinge points or zones.
Hornblende is a complex inosilicate series of minerals (ferrohornblende – magnesiohornblende). It is 
not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a 
dark amphibole. Hornblende is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules; a calcium-iron-magnesium 
silicate, an aluminium-iron-magnesium silicate, and an iron-magnesium silicate. The general formula 
can be given as (Ca,Na)2–3(Mg,Fe,Al)5(Al,Si)8O22(OH,F)2.
Horsetail splay - Like any other fault, strike-slip faults may terminate in zones of ductile deformation. 
In brittle terminations, the displacement is distributed through several branching splay faults. These 
small faults, curved away from the strike of the main fault, form an open, imbricate fan called a 
horsetail splay. 
Hydrothermal Ore Deposits - Any concentration of metallic minerals formed by the release of solids 
from hot mineral-laden water (hydrothermal solution). The solutions are thought to arise in most cases 
from the action of deeply circulating water heated by magma. Another source of heating that may be 
involved includes energy released by radioactive decay. 
An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) is a type of plasma source in which the energy is supplied by 
electric currents which are produced by electromagnetic induction, that is, by time-varying magnetic 
fields. There are two types of ICP geometries: planar and cylindrical. In planar geometry, the electrode 
is a length of flat metal wound like a spiral (or coil). In cylindrical geometry, it is like a helical spring. ICP 
discharges are of relatively high electron density, on the order of 1015 cm−3. As a result, ICP 
discharges have wide applications where a high-density plasma is needed. 
Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the 
detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that uses the inductively coupled 
plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths 
characteristic of a particular element. 
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry which is 
capable of detecting metals and several non-metals at concentrations as low as one part in 1012 (part 
per trillion). This is achieved by ionizing the sample with inductively coupled plasma and then using a 
mass spectrometer to separate and quantify those ions. Compared to atomic absorption techniques, 
ICP-MS has greater speed, precision, and sensitivity. However, analysis by ICP-MS is also more 
susceptible to trace contaminants from glassware and reagents. 
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique 
used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that uses the inductively 
coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths 
characteristic of a particular element. The intensity of this emission is indicative of the concentration of 
the element within the sample. 
Illite is a non-expanding, clay-sized, micaceous mineral. Illite is a phyllosilicate or layered alumino-
silicate. Its structure is constituted by the repetition of tetrahedron – octahedron – tetrahedron (TOT) 
layers. The interlayer space is mainly occupied by poorly hydrated potassium cations responsible for 
the absence of swelling, even though its structure is constituted by TOT layers. Structurally illite is quite 
similar to muscovite with slightly more silicon, magnesium, iron, and water and slightly less tetrahedral 
aluminium and interlayer potassium.

Definition 
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to 
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
Induced polarization (IP) is a geophysical imaging technique used to identify subsurface materials, 
such as ore. The method is similar to electrical resistivity tomography, in that an electric current is 
induced into the subsurface through two electrodes, and voltage is monitored through two other 
electrodes. 
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
in situ typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport. For example, in situ is used 
in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion, the difference being that erosion 
requires a transport medium (such as wind, ice, or water), whereas weathering occurs in situ. 
Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation explicitly implements the assumption that things that 
are close to one another are more alike than those that are farther apart. IDW assumes that each 
measured point has a local influence that diminishes with distance. It gives greater weights to points 
closest to the prediction location, and the weights diminish as a function of distance, hence the name 
inverse distance weighted. Geostatistical Analyst uses power values greater or equal to 1. When p = 2, 
the method is known as the inverse distance squared weighted interpolation. 
ISO/IEC 17025 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories is the 
main ISO/CASCO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories. Originally known as ISO/IEC 
Guide 25, ISO/IEC 17025 was initially issued by the International Organization for Standardization in 
1999. There are many commonalities with the ISO 9000 standard, but ISO/IEC 17025 is more specific in 
requirements for competence. And it applies directly to those organizations that produce testing and 
calibration results.
Kaolinite is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals, with the chemical composition 
Al2Si2O5(OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet linked through oxygen atoms 
to one octahedral sheet of alumina octahedra. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or 
china clay.
Kriging is a geostatistical estimator that infers the value of a random field at an unobserved location 
(e.g. elevation as a function of geographic coordinates) from samples (see spatial analysis and 
computer experiments). Example of one-dimensional data interpolation by kriging, with confidence 
intervals. Squares indicate the location of the data. The kriging interpolation is in red. The confidence 
intervals are in green. The theory behind interpolating or extrapolating by kriging was developed by 
the French mathematician Georges Matheron based on the Master's thesis of Danie G. Krige, the 
pioneering plotter of distance-weighted average gold grades at the Witwatersrand reef complex in 
South Africa. Kriging is based on the idea that the value at an unknown point should be the 
average of the known values at its neighbors; weighted by the neighbors' distance to the unknown 
point. 
The Landsat "program" is the longest running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. 
On July 23, 1972 the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched. This was eventually renamed 
to Landsat. The most recent, Landsat 8, was launched on February 11, 2013. The instruments on the 
Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at 
Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and 
applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance and 
education. Landsat 7 data has eight spectral bands with spatial resolutions ranging from 15 to 60 
meters; the temporal resolution is 16 days. 
Lidar (also written LIDAR or LiDAR) is a remote sensing technology that measures distance by 
illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light. The term lidar comes from 
combining the words light and radar. Lidar is popularly known as a technology used to make high 
resolution maps, geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, 
remote sensing, atmospheric physics, airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), laser altimetry, and 
contour mapping.

Definition 
Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock that is rich in magnesium and iron; the term 
is a portmanteau of the words "magnesium" and "ferric". Most mafic minerals are dark in color and the 
relative density is greater than 3. Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, 
amphibole, and biotite. Common mafic rocks include basalt, dolerite and gabbro.
Magnetite is a mineral, one of the two common naturally occurring iron oxides (chemical formula 
Fe3O4) and a member of the spinel group. Magnetite is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring 
minerals on Earth. Small grains of magnetite occur in almost all igneous and metamorphic rocks. It is 
black or brownish-black with a metallic luster, has a Mohs hardness of 5–6 and a black streak.
Mesothermal Deposits - a class of hydrothermal mineral deposits originating in the earth’s interior by 
deposition of a mineral mass from hot mineralized aqueous solutions, circulating at depths of 
approximately 1,000 m; the solutions are under great pressure and have temperatures of 300°-200°C. 
Mesothermal deposits form veins, sheetlike bodies, and irregularly shaped deposits. 
Metamorphism is the change of minerals or geologic texture (distinct arrangement of minerals) in 
pre-existing rocks (protoliths), without the protolith melting into liquid magma (a solid-state change). 
The change occurs primarily due to heat, pressure, and the introduction of chemically active fluids. The 
chemical components and crystal structures of the minerals making up the rock may change even 
though the rock remains a solid. Changes at or just beneath Earth's surface due to weathering and/or 
diagenesis are not classified as metamorphism. Metamorphism typically occurs between diagenesis 
200°C, and melting 850°C. Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in 
a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form".  
Migmatite is a rock that is a mixture of metamorphic rock and igneous rock. It is created when a 
metamorphic rock such as gneiss partially melts, then that part refreezes into an igneous rock, creating 
a mixure of the unmelted metamorphic part with the recrystalized igneous part. Migmatites form 
under extreme temperature conditions during prograde metamorphism, where partial melting occurs 
in pre-existing rocks. 
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, 
Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than 
that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of 
confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a Measured 
Mineral Resource. A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid 
inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, 
and industrial minerals in or on the Earth‟s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted 
from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
Molybdenite is a mineral of molybdenum disulphide, MoS2. Similar in appearance and feel to 
graphite, molybdenite has a lubricating effect that is a consequence of its layered structure. The atomic 
structure consists of a sheet of molybdenum atoms sandwiched between sheets of sulfur atoms. 
Molybdenite occurs in high temperature hydrothermal ore deposits. Its associated minerals include 
pyrite, chalcopyrite, quartz, anhydrite, fluorite, and scheelite.
Montmorillonite is a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that typically form in microscopic 
crystals, forming a clay. It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite, a member of the 
smectite family, is a 2:1 clay, meaning that it has 2 tetrahedral sheets sandwiching a central octahedral 
sheet. The particles are plate-shaped with an average diameter of approximately one micrometre. 
Members of this group include saponite. Montmorillonite is the main constituent of the volcanic ash 
weathering product, bentonite. 
Million tonnes 
Mylonite is a fine-grained, compact rock produced by dynamic recrystallization of the constituent 
minerals resulting in a reduction of the grain size of the rock. It is classified as a metamorphic rock. 
Mylonites can have many different mineralogical compositions; it is a classification based on the 
textural appearance of the rock. 
Mylonitic rocks are a type of clastic rock (a rock formed by the breaking or crushing of rock fragments 
or mineral grains), and they include protomylonites, mylonites, and blastomylonites.  
Orogeny refers to forces and events leading to a large structural deformation of the Earth's 
lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle) due to the engagement of tectonic plates. Response to such 
engagement results in the formation of long tracts of highly deformed rock called orogens or orogenic 
belts. The word "orogeny" comes from the Greek (oros for "mountain" plus genesis for "creation" or 
"origin"), and it is the primary mechanism by which mountains are built on continents. Orogens 
develop while a continental plate is crumpled and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges.

Definition 
There are elements, called 'pathfinder elements', which, although not economic in themselves, can be 
used in indicating the potential of certain rocks to contain ore minerals. The presence of some 
chemical elements may indicate the presence of a certain mineral. Chemical analysis of rocks and 
plants may indicate the presence of an underground deposit. For instance elements like arsenic and 
antimony are associated with gold deposits and hence, are example pathfinder elements. Tree buds 
can be sampled for pathfinder elements in order to help locate deposits. 
Pelite (Greek pelos, clay) is old and currently not widely used field geological term for a clayey fine-
grained clastic sediment or sedimentary rock, i.e. mud or a mudstone. More commonly, metamorphic 
geologists currently use pelite for a metamorphosed fine-grained sedimentary rock, i.e. mudstone or 
siltstone, which should technically be called a metapelite.
Phlogopite is a yellow, greenish, or reddish-brown member of the mica family of phyllosilicates. It is 
also known as magnesium mica. Phlogopite is the magnesium endmember of the biotite solid solution 
series, with the chemical formula KMg3AlSi3O10(F,OH)2. For physical and optical identification, it shares 
most of the characteristic properties of biotite.
Pillow lavas are lavas that contain characteristic pillow-shaped structures that are attributed to the 
extrusion of the lava under water, or subaqueous extrusion. Pillow lavas in volcanic rock are 
characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses, commonly up to one metre 
in diameter. They form the upper part of 'Layer 2' of normal oceanic crust. 
A pluton in geology is a body of intrusive igneous rock (called a plutonic rock) that is crystallized from 
magma slowly cooling below the surface of the Earth. Plutons include batholiths, stocks, dikes, sills, 
laccoliths, lopoliths, and other igneous bodies. 
Induced polarization (IP) is a geophysical imaging technique used to identify subsurface materials, 
such as ore. The method is similar to electrical resistivity tomography, in that an electric current is 
induced into the subsurface through two electrodes, and voltage is monitored through two other 
electrodes. Pole-Dipole IP - An electrode array used in a lateral search conducted during a resistivity 
or induced polarization survey, or in drill hole logging, in which one current electrode is placed at 
infinity while another current electrode and two potential electrodes in proximity are moved across the 
structure to be investigated.
In science and engineering, the parts-per notation is a set of pseudo units to describe small values of 
miscellaneous dimensionless quantities, e.g. mole fraction or mass fraction. Since these fractions are 
quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement. 
Commonly used are ppm (parts-per-million, 10–6), ppb (parts-per-billion, 10–9), ppt (parts-per-trillion, 
10–12) and ppq (parts-per-quadrillion, 10-15). 
ppm (parts-per-million, 10–6) 
The Proterozoic is a geological eon representing the time just before the proliferation of complex life 
on Earth. The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means "earlier life". The Proterozoic Eon 
extended from 2,500 Ma to 542.0±1.0 Ma (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the 
informally named "Precambrian" time. 
Psammite (Greek psammos, sand) is a general term for sandstone. It is equivalent to the Latin-derived 
term arenite. Also, it is commonly used in various publications to describe a metamorphosed 
sedimentary rock with a dominantly sandstone protolith.
The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is an iron sulphide with the formula FeS2. This mineral's metallic 
luster and pale brass-yellow hue have earned it the nickname fool's gold because of its superficial 
resemblance to gold. Pyrite is the most common of the sulphide minerals
Pyrrhotite is an unusual iron sulphide mineral with a variable iron content: Fe(1-x)S (x = 0 to 0.2). The 
FeS endmember is known as troilite. Pyrrhotite is also called magnetic pyrite because the color is 
similar to pyrite and it is weakly magnetic. The magnetism increases as the iron content decreases, and 
the troilite is non-magnetic.
In statistics, a Q–Q plot ("Q" stands for quantile) is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for 
comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. First, the set of 
intervals for the quantiles are chosen. A point (x,y) on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of 
the second distribution (y-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (x-
coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the (number of the) 
interval for the quantile. 
Quality assurance (QA) refers to the engineering activities implemented in a quality system so that 
requirements for a product or service will be fulfilled. It is the systematic measurement, comparison 
with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error 
prevention. Quality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all 
factors involved in production.

Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's continental crust, after feldspar. It is made 
up of a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared 
between two tetrahedra, giving an overall formula SiO2. There are many different varieties of quartz, 
several of which are semi-precious gemstones.
Quartzite is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. 
Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic 
compression within orogenic belts. Pure quartzite is usually white to gray, though quartzites often 
occur in various shades of pink and red due to varying amounts of iron oxide (Fe2O3). Other colors, 
such as yellow and orange, are due to other mineral impurities.
The Quaternary Period is the most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era in the geologic 
time scale of the ICS. It follows the Neogene Period and spans from 2.588 ± 0.005 million years ago to 
the present. The relatively short period is characterized by a series of glaciations and by the 
appearance and expansion of anatomically modern humans. 
The Holocene is a geological epoch which began at the end of the Pleistocene (at 11,700 calendar 
years BP) and continues to the present. The Holocene is part of the Quaternary period. Its name comes 
from the Greek words ὅλος (holos, whole or entire) and καινός (kainos, new), meaning "entirely 
recent". 
Regolith is a layer of loose, heterogeneous material covering solid rock. It includes dust, soil, broken 
rock, and other related materials and is present on Earth, the Moon, Mars, some asteroids, and other 
terrestrial planets and moons. 
Electrical resistivity (also known as resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) 
quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of electric current. A low resistivity indicates 
a material that readily allows the movement of electric charge. Resistivity is commonly represented by 
the Greek letter ρ (rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm⋅metre (Ω⋅m). 
RC drilling is similar to air core drilling, in that the drill cuttings are returned to surface inside the rods. 
The drilling mechanism is a pneumatic reciprocating piston known as a "hammer" driving a tungsten-
steel drill bit. RC drilling utilises much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 metres are 
routinely achieved. RC drilling ideally produces dry rock chips, as large air compressors dry the rock 
out ahead of the advancing drill bit. RC drilling is slower and costlier but achieves better penetration 
than RAB or air core drilling; it is cheaper than diamond coring and is thus preferred for most mineral 
exploration work. 
Saline water is a general term for water that contains a significant concentration of dissolved salts 
(mainly NaCl). The salt concentration is usually expressed in parts per thousand (permillle, ‰) or parts 
per million (ppm). The United States Geological Survey classifies saline water in three salinity 
categories. Salt concentration in slightly saline water is around 1,000 to 3,000 ppm (0.1-0.3%), in 
moderately saline water 3,000 to 10,000 ppm (0.3-1%) and in highly saline water 10,000 to 35,000 ppm 
(1-3.5%).  
Saprolite is a chemically weathered rock. Saprolites form in the lower zones of soil profiles and 
represent deep weathering of the bedrock surface. In most outcrops its color comes from ferric 
compounds. Deeply weathered profiles are widespread on the continental landmasses between 
latitudes 35°N and 35°S. 
Schist is a medium-grade metamorphic rock with medium to large grains of mica flakes in a preferred 
orientation (nearby mica flakes are roughly parallel). Geological foliation (metamorphic arrangement in 
layers) with medium to large grained mica flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called 
"schistocity". 
Schistose foliation is foliation that is comprised of minerals that are large enough to be viewed with 
the naked eye. This type of foliation is the opposite of salty cleavage which requires a microscope.  
If a sample is identified to contain ‘coarse’ gold, a screen fire assay is the best way to obtain a 
definitive result. This procedure involves screening a large pulverised sample (commonly 1 kg) at 75 
microns. The entire oversize (including the disposable screen) is fire assayed as this contains the 
‘coarse’ gold and a duplicate determination is made on the ‘minus’ 75 micron fraction. A calculation 
can then be made to determine the total weight of gold in the sample. 
Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition of material at the Earth's 
surface and within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause 
mineral and/or organic particles (detritus) to settle and accumulate or minerals to precipitate from a 
solution. Particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being 
deposited, sediment was formed by weathering and erosion in a source area, and then transported to 
the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers which are called agents of 
denudation.

The semivariogram depicts the spatial autocorrelation of the measured sample points. Once each pair 
of locations is plotted (Binning the empirical semivariogram), a model is fit through them (Fitting a 
model to the empirical semivariogram). There are certain characteristics that are commonly used to 
describe these models. The semivariogram and covariance functions quantify the assumption that 
things nearby tend to be more similar than things that are farther apart. Semivariogram and covariance 
both measure the strength of statistical correlation as a function of distance.
Serpentinite is a rock composed of one or more serpentine group minerals. Minerals in this group are 
formed by serpentinization, a hydration and metamorphic transformation of ultramafic rock from the 
Earth's mantle. The alteration is particularly important at the sea floor at tectonic plate boundaries. 
A shear zone is a very important structural discontinuity surface in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. 
It forms as a response to inhomogeneous deformation partitioning strain into planar or curviplanar 
high-strain zones. Intervening (crustal) blocks stay relatively unaffected by the deformation. Due to the 
shearing motion of the surrounding more rigid medium, a rotational, non co-axial component can be 
induced in the shear zone. A shear zone is a zone of strong deformation (with a high strain rate) 
surrounded by rocks with a lower state of finite strain. It is characterised by a length to width ratio of 
more than 5:1. 
Shear is the response of a rock to deformation usually by compressive stress and forms particular 
textures. Shear can be homogeneous or non-homogeneous, and may be pure shear or simple shear. 
Study of geological shear is related to the study of structural geology, rock microstructure or rock 
texture and fault mechanics. The process of shearing occurs within brittle, brittle-ductile, and ductile 
rocks.  
Relating to or containing or resembling silica 
Silicification is the process in which organic matter becomes saturated with silica. A common source 
of silica is volcanic material. Studies done by Sigleo and Mustoe have shown that in this process, most 
of the original organic matter is destroyed. Silicification most often occurs in two environments-either 
the specimen is buried in sediments of deltas and floodplains or organisms are buried in volcanic ash. 
Water must be present for silicification to occur because it reduces the amount of oxygen present 
and therefore reduces the deterioration of the organism by fungi, maintains organism shape, and 
allows for the transportation and deposition of silica. 
Sillimanite is an alumino-silicate mineral with the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Sillimanite is named after 
the American chemist Benjamin Silliman (1779–1864). Sillimanite is one of three alumino-silicate 
polymorphs, the other two being andalusite and kyanite. A common variety of sillimanite is known as 
fibrolite. 
In geology the terms sinistral and dextral refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on 
either side of a fault or the sense of movement within a shear zone. These are terms of relative 
direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. 
Movement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if 
straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer. 
In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the extent to which a probability 
distribution of a real-valued random variable "leans" to one side of the mean. The skewness value can 
be positive or negative, or even undefined.
Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance compared to the density (mass of the 
same unit volume) of a reference substance. Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a 
volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance.
In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the Greek letter sigma, σ) 
shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average (mean), or expected value. A low 
standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; high standard 
deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values. 
Stratiform Deposits are mineral deposits concentrated within one or more strata of volcano-
sedimentary and sedimentary bedded rock formations. The most characteristic examples are deposits 
of lead and zinc ores in strata of carbonate rocks. In stratiform deposits, there is a predominance of 
stratified bodies that are conformable with the enclosing rocks. The ores in these bodies have simple 
mineral compositions determined by the dissemination of copper, zinc, and lead sulphides and the 
accompanying minerals in one or more strata of the ore-bearing rocks. Stratiform deposits are 
generally of large size, cover a broad area, and form vast ore regions or provinces. 
Stratigraphy is a branch of geology which studies rock layers and layering (stratification). It is primarily 
used in the study of sedimentary and layered volcanic rocks. Stratigraphy includes two related 
subfields: lithologic stratigraphy or lithostratigraphy, and biologic stratigraphy or biostratigraphy.

Strike and dip refer to the orientation or attitude of a geologic feature. The strike line of a bed, fault, 
or other planar feature is a line representing the intersection of that feature with a horizontal plane. On 
a geologic map, this is represented with a short straight line segment oriented parallel to the strike 
line. Strike (or strike angle) can be given as either a quadrant compass bearing of the strike line (N25°E 
for example) or in terms of east or west of true north or south, a single three digit number 
representing the azimuth, where the lower number is usually given (where the example of N25°E would 
simply be 025), or the azimuth number followed by the degree sign (example of N25°E would be 025°). 
Sedimentary exhalative deposits (SedEx deposits) are ore deposits which are interpreted to have 
been formed by release of ore-bearing hydrothermal fluids into a water reservoir (usually the ocean), 
resulting in the precipitation of stratiform ore. SedEx deposits are distinctive in that it can be shown 
that the ore minerals were deposited in a marine second-order basin environment, related to 
discharge of metal-bearing brines into the seawater. Sedimentary (Submarine)-exhalative-type 
deposits are characterised by their very large size unusually high grades. Because of this, these types of 
deposits are especially important economically. For this type of deposit to form, the timing and 
amount of heat flow into seawater is critical. Consequently, a better understanding of the dynamics of 
fluid flow in submarine systems and the quantitative relations of submarine ore-forming fluids with 
respect to exhalative metalization is essential.  
A sulphide (IUPAC-recommended spelling) or sulphide (UK) is an anion of sulfur in its lowest 
oxidation state of 2-. Sulphide is also a slightly archaic term for thioethers, a common type of 
organosulfur compound that are well known for their bad odors. Many important metal ores are 
sulphides. Significant examples include: argentite (silver sulphide), cinnabar (mercury), galena (lead 
sulphide), molybdenite (molybdenum sulphide), pentlandite (nickel sulphide]), realgar (arsenic 
sulphide), and stibnite (antimony), sphalerite (zinc sulphide), and pyrite (iron disulphide), and 
chalcopyrite (iron-copper sulphide). 
Supracrustal rocks are rocks that were deposited on the existing basement rocks of the crust, hence 
the name. They may be further metamorphosed from both sedimentary and volcanic rocks.
Talc is a mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula H2Mg3(SiO3)4 or 
Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It has 
a perfect basal cleavage, and the folia are non-elastic, although slightly flexible. It is the softest known 
mineral and listed as 1 on the Mohs hardness scale. It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. It is also 
sectile (can be cut with a knife). It has a specific gravity of 2.5–2.8, a clear or dusty luster, and is 
translucent to opaque. Talc is not soluble in water, but it is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids. Its 
colour ranges from white to grey or green and it has a distinctly greasy feel. Its streak is white.
Tertiary is an officially deprecated but still widely used term for a geologic period from 65 million to 
1.806 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the 
Quaternary. 
Tourmaline is a crystal boron silicate mineral compounded with elements such as aluminium, iron, 
magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium. Tourmaline is classified as a semi-precious stone and the 
gemstone comes in a wide variety of colors.  
The troy ounce (oz t) is a unit of imperial measure. In the present day it is most commonly used to 
gauge the mass of precious metals. One troy ounce is currently defined as exactly 0.0311034768 kg or 
31.1034768 g. There are approximately 32.15 troy oz in 1 kg. One troy ounce is equivalent to 
approximately 1.09714 avoirdupois ounces. 
Tuff is a type of rock consisting of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic 
eruption. Tuff is sometimes called tufa, particularly when used as construction material, although tufa 
also refers to a quite different rock. Rock that contains greater than 50% tuff is considered tuffaceous. 
Ultramafic rocks are igneous and meta-igneous rocks with very low silica content (less than 45%), 
generally >18% MgO, high FeO, low potassium, and are composed of usually greater than 90% mafic 
minerals (dark colored, high magnesium and iron content). The Earth's mantle is composed of 
ultramafic rocks. 
In geology, a vein is a distinct sheetlike body of crystallized minerals within a rock. Veins form when 
mineral constituents carried by an aqueous solution within the rock mass are deposited through 
precipitation. The hydraulic flow involved is usually due to hydrothermal circulation. Veins are 
classically thought of as being the result of growth of crystals on the walls of planar fractures in rocks, 
with the crystal growth occurring normal to the walls of the cavity, and the crystal protruding into open 
space.
Geotech's proprietary VTEM is the leading time-domain electromagnetic system in the world. The 
coincident, vertical dipole transmitter-receiver configuration provides a symmetric system response. 
Any asymmetry in the measured EM profile is due to the conductor dip, not the system or direction of 
flying. This allows for easy identification of the conductor location and for interpretation of the EM 
data. The low noise receiver, plus the high power transmitter yields a low noise system that has the

Volcanic rock is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from 
other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is 
artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an 
important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. 
Volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS) are a type of metal sulphide ore deposit, mainly Cu-
Zn-Pb which are associated with and created by volcanic-associated hydrothermal events in submarine 
environments. These deposits are also sometimes called volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) 
deposits. They are predominantly layered accumulations of sulphide minerals that precipitate from 
hydrothermal fluids on or below the seafloor in a wide range of ancient and modern geological 
settings. In modern oceans they are synonymous with sulfurous plumes called black smokers. As a 
class, they represent a significant source of the world's Cu, Zn, Pb, Au, and Ag ores, with Co, Sn, Ba, S, 
Se, Mn, Cd, In, Bi, Te, Ga and Ge as mining by-products. 
A wire frame model is a visual presentation of a three dimensional or physical object used in 3D 
computer graphics. It is created by specifying each edge of the physical object where two 
mathematically continuous smooth surfaces meet, or by connecting an object's constituent vertices 
using straight lines or curves. The object is projected onto the computer screen by drawing lines at the 
location of each edge. The term wireframe comes from designers using metal wire to represent the 3 
dimensional shape of solid objects.
