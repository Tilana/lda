NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
June 30, 2016
NOTE A-BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Seitel, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the
instructions of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. In preparing the Company’s financial statements, a number of
estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the accounting for and
recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Operating results for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for any other quarter of 2016 or for the year ending December 31, 2016. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the
audited balance sheet of the Company as of that date. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-03, “Interest - Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.” The new standard
changed the presentation of debt issuance costs from an asset to a direct deduction from the
related liability. The Company applied the provisions of the new standard retrospectively, which
resulted in a decrease of $4.3 million in prepaid expenses, deferred charges and other assets
and Senior Notes liability amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
Other than the reclassification of the December 31, 2015 amount, the adoption of this standard
did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated Statements of Operations or Statements
of Cash Flows.
NOTE B-REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from Data Acquisition
The Company generates revenue when it creates a new seismic survey that is initially licensed
by one or more of its customers to use the resulting data. The payments for the initial licenses are
sometimes referred to as acquisition underwriting or prefunding. Customers make periodic
payments throughout the creation period, which generally correspond to costs incurred and work
performed. These payments are non-refundable. Contracts which are signed up to the time the
Company makes a firm commitment to create the new seismic survey are considered acquisition
underwriting. Any subsequent licensing of the data while the survey is in progress or once it is
completed is considered a resale license (see “Revenue from Non-Exclusive Data Licenses”).
Acquisition underwriting revenue is recognized throughout the creation period using the
proportional performance method based upon costs incurred and work performed to date as a
percentage of total estimated costs and work required. Management believes that this method is
the most reliable and representative measure of progress for its data creation projects. On
average, the duration of the data creation process is approximately one year. Under these
contracts, the Company creates new seismic data designed in conjunction with its customers and
specifically suited to the geology of the area using the most appropriate technology available.
The Company outsources the substantial majority of the work required to complete data
acquisition projects to third party contractors. The Company’s payments to these third party
contractors comprise the substantial majority of the total estimated costs of the projects and are
paid throughout the creation period. A typical survey includes specific activities required to
complete the survey, each of which has value to the customers. Typical activities, that often occur
concurrently, include:
•permitting for land access, mineral rights, and regulatory approval;
•surveying;
•drilling for the placement of energy sources;
•recording the data in the field; and
•processing the data.
The customers paying for the initial licenses receive legally enforceable rights to any resulting
product of each activity described above. The customers also receive access to and use of the
newly acquired, processed data.
8
Table of Contents
The customers’ access to and use of the results of the work performed and of the newly acquired,
processed data is governed by a master license agreement, which is a separate agreement from
the acquisition contract. The Company’s acquisition contracts require the customer either to have
a master license agreement in place or to execute one at the time the acquisition contract is
signed. The Company typically maintains sole ownership of the newly acquired data, which is
added to its library, and is free to license the data to other customers.
Revenue from Non-Exclusive Data Licenses
The Company recognizes a substantial portion of its revenue from licensing of data once it is
available for delivery. This revenue is sometimes referred to as resale licensing revenue, late
sales or shelf sales.
These sales fall under the following four basic forms of non-exclusive license contracts.
Specific license contract—The customer licenses and selects specific data from the data library,
including data currently in progress, at the time the contract is entered into and holds this license
for a long-term period.
•
•
Library card license contract—The customer initially receives only access to certain data. The
customer may then select specific data, from the collection of data to which it has access, to hold
long-term under its license agreement. The length of the selection periods under the library card
contracts is limited in time and varies from customer to customer.
•
Review and possession license contract—The customer obtains the right to review a certain
quantity of data for a limited period of time. During the review period, the customer may select
specific data from that available for review to hold long-term under its license agreement. Any
data not selected for long-term licensing must be returned to the Company at the end of the
review period.
•
Review only license contract—The customer obtains rights to review a certain quantity of data
for a limited period of time, but does not obtain the right to select specific data to hold long-term.
The Company’s non-exclusive license contracts specify the following:
•
•
•
that all customers must also have in place or execute a master license agreement that governs
the use of all data received under the Company’s non-exclusive license contracts;
the specific payment terms, generally ranging from 30 days to 12 months, and that such
payments are non-cancelable and non-refundable;
•the actual data that is accessible to the customer; and
that the data is licensed in its present form, as is, where is, and that the Company is under no
obligation to make any enhancements, modifications or additions to the data unless specific
terms to the contrary are included.
Revenue from the non-exclusive licensing of seismic data is recognized when the following
criteria are met:
•the Company has an agreement with the customer that is validated by a signed contract;
•the sales price is fixed and determinable;
•collection is reasonably assured;
•the customer has selected the specific data or the contract has expired without full selection;
•the data is currently available for delivery; and
•the license term has begun.
Copies of the licensed data are available to the customer immediately upon request.
For licenses that have been invoiced for which payment is due or has been received, but that
have not met the aforementioned criteria, revenue is deferred along with the related direct costs
(primarily consisting of sales commissions). This normally occurs under the library card, review
and possession or review only license contracts because the data selection may occur over time.
Additionally, if the contract allows licensing of data that is not currently available or
enhancements, modifications or additions to the data are required per the contract, revenue is
deferred until such time that the data is available.
Revenue from Non-Monetary Exchanges
In certain cases, the Company will take ownership of a customer’s seismic data or revenue
interest (collectively referred to as “data”) in exchange for a non-exclusive license to selected
seismic data from the Company’s library and, in some cases, services provided by Seitel
Solutions (“Solutions”). In connection with specific data acquisition contracts, the Company may
choose to receive both cash and ownership of seismic data from the customer as consideration
for the underwriting of new data
9
Table of Contents
acquisition. In addition, the Company may receive advanced data processing services on
selected existing data in exchange for a non-exclusive license to selected data from the
Company’s library. These exchanges are referred to as non-monetary exchanges. A non-
monetary exchange for data always complies with the following criteria:
•the data license delivered is always distinct from the data received;
•the customer forfeits ownership of its data; and
•the Company retains ownership in its data.
In non-monetary exchange transactions, the Company records a data library asset for the seismic
data received or processed at the time the contract is entered into or the data is completed, as
applicable, and recognizes revenue on the transaction in equal value in accordance with its
policy on revenue from data licenses or data acquisition, or as services are provided by
Solutions, as applicable. The data license to the customer is in the form of one of the four basic
forms of contracts discussed above. These transactions are valued at the fair value of the data
received or the fair value of the license granted or services provided, whichever is more readily
determinable.
Fair value of the data exchanged is determined using a multi-step process as follows:
•
First, the Company considers the value of the data or services received from the customer. In
determining the value of the data received, the Company considers the age, quality, current
demand and future marketability of the data and, in the case of 3D seismic data, the cost that
would be required to create the data. In addition, the Company applies a limitation on the value
it assigns per square mile on the data received. In determining the value of the services
received, the Company considers the cost of such similar services that it could obtain from a
third-party provider.
•
Second, the Company determines the value of the license granted to the customer. Typically,
the range of cash transactions by the Company for licenses of similar data during the prior six
months are evaluated. In evaluating the range of cash transactions, the Company does not
consider transactions that are disproportionately high or low.
Due to the Company’s revenue recognition policies, revenue recognized on non-monetary
exchange transactions may not occur at the same time the seismic data acquired is recorded as
an asset. The activity related to non-monetary exchanges was as follows (in thousands):

NOTE C-SEISMIC DATA LIBRARY
The Company’s seismic data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for license to
customers on a non-exclusive basis. Costs associated with creating, acquiring or purchasing the
seismic data library are capitalized and amortized principally on the income forecast method
subject to a straight-line amortization period of four years, applied on a quarterly basis at the
individual survey level.
Costs of Seismic Data Library
For purchased seismic data, the Company capitalizes the purchase price of the acquired data.
For data received through a non-monetary exchange, the Company capitalizes an amount equal
to the fair value of the data received by the Company or the fair value of the license granted or
services provided to the customer, whichever is more readily determinable. See Note B –
“Revenue Recognition – Revenue from Non-Monetary Exchanges” for discussion of the process
used to determine fair value.
For newly created data, the capitalized costs include costs paid to third parties for the acquisition
of data and related permitting, surveying and other activities associated with the data creation
activity. In addition, the Company capitalizes certain internal costs related to processing the
created data and reprocessing existing data. Such costs include salaries and benefits of the
Company’s processing personnel and certain other costs incurred for the benefit of the
processing activity. The Company
10
Table of Contents
believes that the internal processing costs capitalized are not greater than, and generally are less
than, those that would be incurred and capitalized if such activity were performed by a third party.
Capitalized costs for internal data processing were $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.5 million and $1.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Data Library Amortization
The Company amortizes each survey in its seismic data library using the greater of the
amortization that would result from the application of the income forecast method to each
survey’s revenue, subject to a minimum amortization rate, or a straight-line basis over four years,
commencing at the time such survey is completed and available for licensing to customers on a
non-exclusive basis.
The Company applies the income forecast method by forecasting the ultimate revenue expected
to be derived from a particular data library component over the estimated useful life of each
survey comprising part of such component. This forecast is made by the Company annually and
reviewed quarterly. If, during any such review, the Company determines that the ultimate revenue
for a library component is expected to be significantly different than the most recent estimate of
total revenue for such library component, the Company revises the amortization rate attributable
to future revenue from each survey in such component. The Company applies a minimum
amortization rate of 70%. In addition, in connection with the forecast reviews and updates, the
Company evaluates the recoverability of its seismic data library investment, and if required,
records an impairment charge with respect to such investment. See discussion on “Seismic Data
Library Impairment” below.
The greater of the income forecast or straight-line amortization policy is applied quarterly on a
cumulative basis at the individual survey level. Under this policy, the Company first records
amortization using the income forecast method. The cumulative amortization recorded for each
survey is then compared with the cumulative straight-line amortization. If the cumulative straight-
line amortization is higher for any specific survey, additional amortization expense is recorded,
resulting in accumulated amortization being equal to the cumulative straight-line amortization for
such survey. This requirement is applied regardless of future-year revenue estimates for the
library component of which the survey is a part and does not consider the existence of deferred
revenue with respect to the library component or to any survey.
The actual aggregate rate of amortization depends on the specific seismic surveys licensed and
selected by the Company’s customers during the period and the amount of straight-line
amortization recorded. The income forecast amortization rates can vary by component and, as of
July 1, 2016, is 70% for all components. For those seismic surveys which have been fully
amortized, no amortization expense is required on revenue recorded.
Seismic Data Library Impairment
The Company evaluates its seismic data library investment by grouping individual surveys into
components based on its operations and geological and geographical trends, resulting in the
following data library segments for purposes of evaluating impairments: (I) North America 3D
onshore comprised of the following components: (a) Texas Gulf Coast, (b) Eastern Texas, (c)
West Texas, (d) Panhandle Plays in North Texas/Oklahoma, (e) Southern Louisiana/Mississippi,
(f) Northern Louisiana, (g) Rocky Mountains, (h) Utica/Marcellus in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West
Virginia, (i) other United States, (j) Montney in British Columbia and Alberta, (k) Horn River in
British Columbia, (l) Cardium in Alberta and (m) other Canada; (II) United States 2D; (III) Canada
2D; (IV) Mexico; (V) Gulf of Mexico offshore; and (VI) international data outside North America.
The Company believes that these library components constitute the lowest levels of
independently identifiable cash flows.
The Company evaluates its seismic data library investment for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The
Company considers the level of sales performance in each component compared to projected
sales, as well as industry conditions, among others, to be key factors in determining when its
seismic data investment should be evaluated for impairment. In evaluating sales performance of
each component, the Company generally considers five consecutive quarters of actual
performance below forecasted sales to be an indicator of potential impairment.
The impairment evaluation is based first on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows
over each component’s remaining estimated useful life with the carrying value of each library
component. If the undiscounted cash flows are equal to or greater than the carrying value of such
component, no impairment is recorded. If undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying
value of any component, the forecast of future cash flows related to such component is
discounted to fair value and compared with such component’s carrying amount. The difference
between the library component’s carrying amount and the discounted future value of the
expected revenue stream is recorded as an impairment charge.
For purposes of evaluating potential impairment losses, the Company estimates the future cash
flows attributable to a library component by evaluating, among other factors, historical and recent
revenue trends, oil and gas prospectivity in particular regions, general economic conditions
affecting its customer base and expected changes in technology and other factors that the
11
Table of Contents
Company deems relevant. The cash flow estimates exclude expected future revenues
attributable to non-monetary data exchanges and future data creation projects.
The estimation of future cash flows and fair value is highly subjective and inherently imprecise.
Estimates can change materially from period to period based on many factors, including those
described in the preceding paragraph. Accordingly, if conditions change in the future, the
Company may record impairment losses relative to its seismic data library investment, which
could be material to any particular reporting period.
The Company did not have any impairment charges during the six months ended June 30, 2016
or 2015.

Current operations
Change in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of settlements with taxing
authorities and revisions of positions taken during prior periods
Change in valuation allowance
Income tax benefit
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company provided a full valuation
allowance against the federal tax benefit generated from its U.S. operations as it was more likely
than not that such benefit would not be realized. For the same periods, the Company recognized
the tax benefits generated from its Canadian operations.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company settled its outstanding appeal with Canada
Revenue Agency related to certain royalty payments made to the Company’s U.S. entities for
years 2003 to 2007. In addition, based on this settlement, the Company remeasured its
remaining uncertain tax positions. These items together resulted in a tax benefit of $2.1 million
recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The benefit recorded in the six months ended
June 30, 2016 was $2.0 million due to additional interest expense on uncertain tax positions.
The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $1.4 million in
unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary within the coming year due to expected settlements
with taxing authorities and a lapse in statute of limitations. If the positions are settled as
anticipated, the impact to the tax provision would be approximately $0.5 million, which would
affect the effective tax rate.

Less: unamortized debt issuance costs(3,738
 
9½% Senior Unsecured Notes: On March 20, 2013, the Company issued, in a private placement,
$250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9½% senior notes (the “9½% Senior Notes”). As
required by their terms, the 9½% Senior Notes were exchanged for senior notes of like amounts
and terms in a publicly registered exchange offer in August 2013. The 9½% Senior Notes mature
on April 15, 2019. Interest is payable in cash, semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each
year. The 9½% Senior Notes are unsecured and are jointly and severally guaranteed by
substantially all of the Company’s significant domestic subsidiaries on a senior basis. The 9½%
Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants which limit the Company’s ability to, among other
things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends and make other restricted
payments, engage in transactions with affiliates, and complete mergers, acquisitions and sales of
assets.
From time to time on or before April 15, 2016, the Company was entitled to redeem up to 35% of
the aggregate principal
12
Table of Contents
amount of the 9½% Senior Notes with the net proceeds of equity offerings at a redemption price
equal to 109.50% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company did
not exercise this redemption option before it expired. Upon a change of control (as defined in the
indenture), each holder of the 9½% Senior Notes will have the right to require the Company to
offer to purchase all of such holder's notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest.
Credit Facility: On May 25, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit
Facility”) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC and Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corporation
Canada. The Credit Facility provided a $30.0 million revolving credit facility with a Canadian
sublimit of $5.0 million (Canadian), subject to borrowing base limitations based on the
Company’s seismic data assets and eligible accounts receivable, each as defined in the Credit
Facility, calculated on a monthly basis. The Credit Facility expired on its own terms in May 2016
and the Company decided not to extend or renew the Credit Facility. No amounts were
outstanding at the maturity date.
NOTE F-FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Authoritative guidance on fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair
value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value,
giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs).
The Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of the Company’s assets
and liabilities, market data or assumptions are used that the Company believes market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when
appropriate. The Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include
the following (in thousands):

Cash equivalents
At December 31, 2015: 
Cash equivalents
The Company had no transfers of assets between any of the above levels during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
Cash equivalents include treasury bills and money market funds that invest in United States
government obligations and a Canadian dollar investment account, all with original maturities of
three months or less. The original costs of these assets approximate fair value due to their short-
term maturities.
Other Financial Instruments:
At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of the Company’s debt was $246.3 million, net of $3.7
million of unamortized debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value was
$245.7 million, net of $4.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The estimated fair value of
the debt was approximately $172.5 million at June 30, 2016 and $152.5 million at December 31,
2015. The fair value of the Company’s 9½% Senior Notes is based on quoted market prices
(Level 1 inputs).
NOTE G-STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included $0.5 million of
restricted cash related to collateral on seismic operations bonds. The balance at December 31,
2015 also included $125,000 (Canadian) of restricted cash posted as security against Company
issued credit cards.

NOTE H-COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved from time to time in ordinary, routine claims and lawsuits incidental to
its business. In the opinion of management, uninsured losses, if any, resulting from the ultimate
resolution of these matters should not be material to the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of the
legal actions brought against it or by it, or to provide an estimate of all additional losses, if any,
that may arise. At June 30, 2016, the Company has recorded the estimated amount of potential
exposure it may have with respect to claims. Such amounts are not material to the financial
statements.
NOTE I-RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606)”. The objective of the ASU is to establish a single comprehensive model in
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the
existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle
of the guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also significantly expands disclosure
requirements concerning revenues for most entities. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”
which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”, amending the principal-versus-agent
implementation guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies
that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or
service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-
10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing”, which amends certain aspects of the guidance related to identifying performance
obligations and licensing implementation. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients” to address certain issues in the guidance on assessing collectibility,
presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract
modifications at transition. The Company is required to adopt the guidance set forth by these
ASUs on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. Entities
have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt the new
guidance. The Company anticipates adopting the new revenue recognition guidance effective
January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the effect on its
consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” with the objective of
increasing transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to
recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the present value of the rights and
obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU will also require
disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied
using a modified retrospective approach and will be effective for
14
Table of Contents
the Company as of January 1, 2019, but early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” The amendments
in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective
on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, but does not expect that it will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.
NOTE J-SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTORS CONSOLIDATING CONDENSED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION
On March 20, 2013, the Company completed a private placement of 9½% Senior Notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million. The Company’s payment obligations under the
9½% Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s
significant 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (“Guarantor Subsidiaries”). All subsidiaries of the
Company that do not guarantee the 9½% Senior Notes are referred to as Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries.
The indenture governing the 9½% Senior Notes provides that the guarantees by the Guarantor
Subsidiaries will be released in the following customary circumstances: (i) upon a sale or other
disposition, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the equity interests of that
guarantor to a person that is not the Company or a restricted subsidiary of the Company; (ii) the
guarantor sells all or substantially all of its assets to a person that is not the Company or a
restricted subsidiary of the Company; (iii) the guarantor is properly designated as an unrestricted
subsidiary or ceases to be a restricted subsidiary; (iv) upon legal defeasance of the 9½% Senior
Notes or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture governing the 9½% Senior Notes; (v) the
guarantor becomes an immaterial subsidiary or (vi) the guarantor, having also been a guarantor
under a credit facility, is released from its guarantee obligations under a credit facility and does
not guarantee any indebtedness of the Company or the Guarantor Subsidiaries.
The consolidating condensed financial statements are presented below and should be read in
connection with the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. Separate
financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented because (i) the Guarantor
Subsidiaries are wholly-owned and have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 9½% Senior
Notes on a joint and several basis and (ii) the Company’s management has determined such
separate financial statements are not material to investors.
The following consolidating condensed financial information presents the consolidating
condensed balance sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the consolidating
condensed statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 and consolidating condensed
statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 of (a) the
Company; (b) the Guarantor Subsidiaries; (c) the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; (d) elimination
entries; and (e) the Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method. The principal elimination
entries eliminate investments in subsidiaries, intercompany balances, intercompany transactions
and intercompany sales.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Item
2.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this document.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Statements contained in this report about our future outlook, prospects, strategies and
plans, and about industry conditions, demand for seismic services and the future economic life of
our seismic data are forward-looking, among others. All statements that express belief,
expectation, estimates or intentions, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are
forward-looking. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “propose,” “plan,”
“target,” “foresee,” “should,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “potential” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
represent our present belief and are based on our current expectations and assumptions with
respect to future events and their potential effect on us. While we believe our expectations and
assumptions are reasonable, they involve risks and uncertainties beyond our control that could
cause the actual results or outcome to differ materially from the expected results or outcome
reflected in our forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the forward-looking events discussed in this Quarterly Report may not occur. Such risks and
uncertainties include, without limitation, actual customer demand for our seismic data and related
services, the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and
condensate and natural gas liquids, conditions in the capital markets during the periods covered
by the forward-looking statements, the effect of economic conditions, our ability to obtain
financing on satisfactory terms if internally generated cash flows are insufficient to fund our
capital needs, the impact on our financial condition as a result of our debt and our debt service,
our ability to obtain and maintain normal terms with our vendors and service providers, our ability
to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations, changes in the oil and gas industry or the
economy generally and changes in the capital expenditure budgets of our customers, as well as
the risk factors identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The forward-looking statements contained in this report speak only as of the date hereof and
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Except as
required by federal and state securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
any other reason. All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person
acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
contained or referred to herein, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC and in our future periodic reports filed with the SEC.
Overview
General
We are a leading provider of onshore seismic data to the oil and gas industry in North America.
We own an extensive library of onshore and offshore seismic data that we have accumulated
since our inception in 1982 that we offer for license to exploration and production (“E&P”)
companies. Our primary areas of focus are onshore United States and Canada and, to a lesser
extent, offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the energy reform in Mexico, we began to
expand our data library coverage into Mexico in 2015. We believe our data library is one of the
largest onshore three-dimensional (“3D”) databases available for licensing in North America and
includes leading positions in oil, liquids-rich and natural gas unconventional plays as well as
conventional areas.
Our products and services are used by E&P companies in oil and gas exploration and
development efforts to increase the probability of drilling success, to better delineate existing oil
and gas fields and to augment their reservoir completion and management techniques. In
unconventional plays, E&P companies use seismic data as a development tool to better identify
efficient drilling plans and maximize production by identifying and understanding a series of
critical characteristics of the targeted resource. We generate revenue primarily by licensing data
from our data library and from new data creation projects, which are substantially underwritten or
paid for by our clients. By participating in underwritten, non-exclusive surveys or purchasing
licenses to existing data, E&P companies can obtain access to surveys at reduced costs as
compared to acquiring seismic data on a proprietary basis.

Table of Contents
E&P companies have further reduced their capital expenditure budgets in 2016 as compared to
2015 in an effort to protect cash flows. As a result, we expect the demand for seismic data to
remain weak throughout 2016. We are unable to predict the severity or duration of such
weakness in demand. We have implemented a number of measures to deal with the industry
environment, including reducing our investment in new data acquisition and reducing our
headcount by approximately 40% since the beginning of 2015. We believe we are well
positioned to deal with this challenging environment due to our variable operating structure,
asset-light business model and our strong cash balance at June 30, 2016.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Business
Our business is dependent upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
following are those that we consider to be principal factors affecting our business.
Demand for Seismic Data: Demand for our products and services is cyclical due to the nature of
the oil and gas industry. In particular, demand for our seismic data services depends upon
exploration, production, development and field management spending by E&P companies and,
in the case of new data creation, the willingness of these companies to forgo ownership in the
seismic data. Capital expenditures by E&P companies depend upon several factors, including
actual and forecasted oil and natural gas commodity prices, prospect availability and the
companies’ own short-term and strategic plans. These capital expenditures may also be affected
by worldwide economic or industry-wide conditions.
Merger and Acquisition/Joint Venture Activity: Merger and acquisition (“M&A”) activity continues
to occur within our client base. This activity could have a negative impact on seismic companies
that operate in markets with a limited number of participating clients. However, we believe that,
over time, this activity could have a positive impact on our business, as it should generate re-
licensing fees, result in increased vitality in the trading of mineral interests and result in the
creation of new independent customers through the rationalization of staff within those
companies affected by this activity.
Exploiting unconventional plays is a capital intensive endeavor and many technically proficient
E&P companies remain subject to capital constraints. These companies find themselves needing
to sell their positions to, or create partnerships with, large well-capitalized companies in order to
develop their recoverable resource base. These joint venture partners or new owners will often
need to purchase licenses to our seismic data for their own use.
North America Drilling Activity: The decline in crude oil prices and the reduction in capital
spending by E&P companies in 2015 and 2016 has had a direct impact on drilling activity in
North America. As of July 22, 2016, the North American land rig count had fallen by
approximately 76% since its peak in October 2014. The North American land rig count began to
improve in the second quarter of 2016 and, as of July 22, 2016, had increased to 543 rigs, an
increase of 29% from a low of 422 rigs in May 2016.
Availability of Capital for Our Customers: Some of our customers are independent E&P
companies and private prospect-generating companies that rely primarily on private capital
markets to fund their exploration, production, development and field management activities.
Certain of our customers have credit facilities with borrowing bases that are tied to the net
present value of their reserves. Low oil prices have decreased the value of those reserves and,
as a result, the borrowing bases under such facilities have been reduced. Reductions in cash
flows resulting from lower commodity prices, along with the reduced availability of credit and
increased costs of borrowing, has had, and could continue to have, a material impact on the
ability of such companies to obtain funding necessary to purchase our seismic data.
Government Regulation: Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state,
foreign and local laws and regulations, including environmental and health and safety laws. We
invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit
requirements. Modification of existing laws or regulations and the adoption of new laws or
regulations limiting or increasing exploration or production activities by oil and gas companies
may have a material effect on our business operations.
Key Performance Measures
Management considers, among others, the following performance and financial measures in
evaluating and managing our operating performance and financial condition. Some of these
measures are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company’s
performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are
not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and
presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement
the presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP and should
not be considered substitutes for GAAP financial measures.

Cash Resales: Cash resales represent new contracts for data licenses from our library, including
data currently in progress, payable in cash. We believe cash resales are an important measure of
our operating performance and are useful in assessing overall industry and client activity. Cash
resales are likely to fluctuate quarter to quarter as they do not require the longer planning and
lead times necessary for new data creation.
Cash resales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in
thousands):

2015
2015
Cash EBITDA: Cash EBITDA represents cash generated from licensing data from our seismic
library net of recurring cash operating expenses. We believe this measure is helpful in
determining the level of cash from operations we have available for debt service and funding of
capital expenditures (net of the portion funded or underwritten by our customers). Cash EBITDA
includes cash resales plus all other cash revenues other than from data acquisitions, less cost of
goods sold and cash selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding severance and
other non-routine costs).

Growth of Our Seismic Data Library: We regularly add to our seismic data library through four
different methods: (1) recording new data; (2) buying ownership of existing data for cash;
(3) obtaining ownership of existing data sets through non-monetary exchanges; and (4) creating
new value-added products from existing data within our library. For the period from January 1,
2016 to August 8, 2016, we completed the addition of approximately 1,000 square miles of
seismic data to our library. As of August 8, 2016, we had approximately 200 square miles of
seismic data in progress.
Critical Accounting Policies
We operate in one business segment, which is made up of seismic data acquisition, seismic data
licensing, seismic data processing and seismic reproduction services. There have not been any
changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.

second quarter of 2015. Acquisition underwriting revenue was $4.9 million in the second quarter
of 2016 compared to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in acquisition
underwriting revenue was due to a planned reduction in new data acquisition projects as a result
of the current industry environment. The majority of new data acquisition activity in the second
quarter of 2016 occurred in the U.S. with a focus in the Permian unconventional play as well as
activity in Northern Louisiana. Total resale licensing revenue was $19.1 million in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. Cash resales were
$19.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to cash resales of $15.1 million in the
second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we saw some clients begin to take
advantage of improving economics and M&A opportunities which positively impacted our cash
resale activity in the quarter. We cannot predict whether this level of activity will continue for the
remainder of the year. Non-monetary exchanges fluctuate quarter to quarter depending upon the
data available for trade. The decrease of $7.8 million between the second quarter of 2015 and
second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to one large non-cash licensing contract entered into in
the second quarter of 2015. Revenue recognition adjustments are non-cash adjustments to
revenue and reflect the net amount of (i) revenue deferred as a result of all of the revenue
recognition criteria not being met and (ii) the subsequent revenue recognition once the criteria
are met. The $2.9 million change in revenue recognition adjustments between the second
quarters of 2015 and 2016 primarily resulted from an increase in revenue recognized on
previously deferred direct licensing contracts and an increase in selections from library card
contracts, partially offset by higher deferrals associated with new licensing contracts. Solutions
and other revenue was $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.3 million in the
second quarter of 2015.
Total revenue for the first six months of 2016 was $36.3 million compared to $55.0 million in the
first six months of 2015. Acquisition underwriting revenue was $9.9 million for the first six months
of 2016 compared to $22.2 million in the first six months of 2015. This decrease was primarily
attributable to the planned reduction in activity discussed above. Total resale licensing revenue
was $25.5 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $31.7 million in the first six months
of 2015. Cash resales for the first six months of 2016 were $21.8 million compared to $27.3
million in the first six months of 2015 reflecting reduced capital spending by our E&P clients as a
result of the continued low commodity price environment. We had one large non-monetary
exchange in the first six months of 2015 causing the significant decrease from the first six months
of 2015 to the first six months of 2016. The increase of $7.0 million in revenue recognition
adjustments from the first six months of 2015 to the first six months of 2016 was primarily due to
an increase in revenue recognized on previously deferred direct licensing contracts and a
decrease in the deferral of new licensing contracts, partially offset by a decrease in selections of
data from library card contracts. Solutions and other revenue was $0.9 million in the first six
months of 2016 compared to $1.1 million in the first six months of 2015. Solutions revenue is
primarily driven by the level of seismic revenue; therefore, the decrease between the six-month
periods resulted from the lower level of seismic revenue activity.
At June 30, 2016, we had a deferred revenue balance of $24.5 million, compared to the
December 31, 2015 balance of $25.9 million. The deferred revenue balance related to (i) data
licensing contracts on which selection of specific data had not yet

occurred, (ii) deferred revenue on data acquisition projects and (iii) contracts in which the data
products are not yet available or the revenue recognition criteria has not yet been met. The
deferred revenue will be recognized when selection of specific data is made by the customer,
upon expiration of the data selection period specified in the data licensing contracts, as work
progresses on the data acquisition contracts, as the data products become available or as all of
the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Depreciation and Amortization
The table below sets forth the components of depreciation and amortization and presents seismic
data amortization as a percentage of total seismic revenue for the three months and six month
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):

Total seismic data library amortization amounted to $23.6 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared to $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $37.5 million for the first half of 2016
compared to $40.9 million for the first half of 2015. The amount of seismic data library
amortization fluctuates based on the level and location of specific seismic surveys licensed
(including licensing resulting from new data acquisition) and selected by our customers during
the period as well as the amount of straight-line amortization required under our accounting
policy. Income forecast amortization as a percentage of total seismic revenue fluctuated from
2015 to 2016 primarily due to the mix of data being licensed. In all periods, we had resale
revenue recognized from data whose costs were fully amortized. In the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, the percentage of resale revenue recognized from data whose costs were
fully amortized was 36% and 49%, respectively, as compared to 66% and 58% in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015. Straight-line amortization represents the expense required
under our accounting policy to ensure the book value of our data is fully amortized within four
years of when the data becomes available for licensing. The amount of straight-line amortization
varies between periods due to the distribution of revenue among the various seismic surveys.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $4.7 million in the second quarter of
2016 compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $10.6 million in the first six
months of 2016 compared to $11.9 million in the first six months of 2015. SG&A expenses are
made up of the following cash and non-cash expenses (in thousands):

The decrease in cash SG&A expenses of $0.8 million from the second quarter of 2015 to the
second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to savings of $0.7 million in salaries and benefits from
headcount reductions throughout 2015 and 2016 through attrition and layoffs in October 2015
and February 2016. The decrease in cash SG&A expenses of $1.1 million from the first six
months of 2015 to the first six months of 2016 primarily consisted of a $2.1 million decrease in
routine overhead costs partially offset by an increase in non-routine costs of $1.0 million. The
reduction in routine overhead costs in the six month periods mainly consisted of savings of $1.5
million in salaries and benefits from headcount reductions discussed previously. Additionally,
variable compensation was lower in the first six months of 2016 by $0.2 million resulting from
lower revenue activity. Non-routine costs were primarily made up of termination benefits of $0.9
million related to layoffs of personnel in 2016. Currently, we estimate that our 2016 SG&A
expenses (excluding severance and other non-routine costs) will be approximately $3.0 million
less than our routine SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our overall
reduction in headcount, including a further reduction of headcount in our Canadian operations in
August 2016, and other planned cost savings.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense (benefit) was $(2.2) million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.7
million in the second quarter of 2015. The income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2016 was
primarily comprised of (i) a $2.1 million benefit on our uncertain tax positions resulting from
settlement of our outstanding appeal with Canada Revenue Agency in the second quarter of
2016 and remeasurement of our remaining uncertain tax positions due to the settlement and (ii) a
benefit of $0.2 million related to our Canadian operations. The federal tax benefit of $4.0 million
resulting from our second quarter 2016 U.S. operations was offset by a valuation allowance
because it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. Income tax
expense in the second quarter of 2015 was primarily comprised of (i) U.S. federal tax expense of
$0.3 million, which included approximately $1.0 million expense resulting from a revision in our
estimated annual effective tax rate, (ii) $0.7 million expense related to our Canadian operations,
which included approximately $0.5 million expense resulting from a rate adjustment recorded
due to an increase in Alberta's provincial tax rate enacted in the second quarter of 2015, (iii) a
U.S. state tax expense of $0.1 million and (iv) a benefit of $0.3 million related to certain research
and development tax credits in Canada.
Income tax benefit was $3.7 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The benefit for the first six months of 2016 was comprised of (i) a $1.7 million
benefit related to our Canadian operations and (ii) a $2.0 million benefit which primarily related to
uncertain tax position settlements and remeasurements recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
The federal tax benefit of $7.1 million resulting from our U.S. operations was offset by a valuation
allowance because it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized.
The benefit for the first six months of 2015 was comprised of (i) U.S. federal tax benefit of $4.5
million on our U.S. operations, (ii) $0.2 million expense related to our Canadian operations,
which included approximately $0.5 million expense resulting from the rate adjustment mentioned
above and (iii) a benefit of $0.3 million related to certain research and development tax credits in
Canada.
Net Loss
Net loss was $9.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $2.3 million in the second
quarter of 2015. The increase in the loss between quarters was primarily due to a reduction in
revenues and higher amortization of our seismic data library partially offset by lower SG&A
expenses and higher income tax benefit. Net loss was $23.1 million in the first six months of
2016 compared to $9.9 million in the first six months of 2015. The $13.2 million increase in loss
between the six month periods was primarily due to a reduction in revenues and lower income
tax benefit offset slightly by lower SG&A expenses and lower amortization of our seismic data
library.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, we had $44.5 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, including $0.5 million of restricted cash. Our foreign subsidiary regularly holds cash
which is used to reinvest in our Canadian operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate
those funds to the U.S., we may be required to pay taxes on certain of those funds based on
applicable U.S. tax rates net of foreign taxes. Cash held by our foreign subsidiary fluctuates
throughout the year and at June 30, 2016, was $2.4 million.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
Historically, our liquidity sources also included available borrowings under our Credit Facility;
however, the Credit Facility expired on its own terms in May 2016 and management made a
decision not to renew or extend this facility. A summary of our 9½% Senior Notes is included
below; for additional information regarding the Senior Notes and the Credit Facility, See “Note E -
Debt” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements herein.
9½% Senior Unsecured Notes: On March 20, 2013, we issued in a private placement $250.0
million aggregate principal amount of our 9½% Senior Notes. Interest is payable in cash, semi-
annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The notes mature on April 15, 2019. To the
best of our knowledge, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture
governing our 9½% Senior Notes at June 30, 2016.
We may from time to time, as part of various financing and investment strategies, purchase our
outstanding indebtedness. These purchases, if any, could have a material positive or negative
impact on our liquidity available to repay outstanding debt obligations or on our consolidated
results of operations.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Cash flows provided by operating activities were $4.8
million and $46.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Operating cash flows for 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to the first six months of 2015
including significant collections from cash resale activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as
the reduced level of cash resales and lower acquisition underwriting revenue in 2016.
33
Table of Contents
Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Cash flows used in investing activities were $13.0 million
and $37.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash
expenditures for seismic data were $12.9 million and $37.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in cash invested in seismic data for 2016
compared to 2015 was primarily due to a planned reduction in our capital expenditures as a
result of the current industry environment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Cash flows used in financing activities were $0.1 million
for both the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Anticipated Liquidity: Our ability to cover our operating and capital expenses, make required debt
service payments on our 9½% Senior Notes, incur additional indebtedness and comply with our
various debt covenants will depend primarily on our ability to generate substantial operating cash
flows. Over the next 12 months, we expect to obtain the funds necessary to pay our operating,
capital and other expenses, as well as interest on our 9½% Senior Notes and principal and
interest on our other indebtedness, from our operating cash flows and cash and cash equivalents
on hand. Our ability to satisfy our payment obligations depends substantially on our future
operating and financial performance, which necessarily will be affected by, and subject to,
industry, market, economic and other factors. To the extent our operating cash flows and cash on
hand are not sufficient to cover our anticipated expenditures, we could seek to obtain additional
financing. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such
financing on satisfactory terms or at all. If necessary, we could choose to further reduce our
spending on capital projects and operating expenses to ensure we operate within the cash flow
generated from our operations. We will not be able to predict or control many of these factors,
such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and competitive pressures.
Deferred Taxes
As of June 30, 2016, we had a net deferred tax liability of $1.6 million attributable to our
Canadian operations. In the United States, we had a federal deferred tax asset of $94.6 million,
which was fully offset by a valuation allowance. The recognition of the U.S. federal deferred tax
asset will not occur until such time that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
federal deferred tax asset will be realized. As of June 30, 2016, it was more likely than not that all
of the U.S. federal deferred tax asset will not be realized. Additionally, in the U.S., we had a state
deferred tax asset of $1.4 million of which all but $59,000 was offset by a valuation allowance.
The remaining state deferred tax asset was recognized as it is more likely than not that the state
deferred tax asset will be realized.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
Other than operating leases, we do not maintain any off-balance sheet transactions,
arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are
reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenue or expense, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.
Capital Expenditures
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, capital expenditures for seismic data and other
property and equipment amounted to $10.8 million. Our capital expenditures for the remainder of
2016 are presently estimated to be $16.1 million. The first six months of 2016 actual and 2016
estimated remaining capital expenditures are comprised of the following (in thousands):

Net cash capital expenditures represent total capital expenditures less cash underwriting
revenue from our clients and non-cash additions to the seismic data library. We believe this
measure is important as it reflects the amount of capital expenditures funded from our operating
cash flow. The following table shows how our net cash capital expenditures (a non-GAAP
financial measure) are derived from total capital expenditures, the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure (in thousands):

Net cash capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016, reflected acquisition
underwriting revenue in excess of gross capital costs. Gross capital costs in the first six months of
2016 included a revision to the previous estimated costs related to one of our new data
acquisition surveys resulting in a reduction of the gross costs of approximately $2.5 million.
As of August 8, 2016, we had capital expenditure commitments related to data acquisition
projects of approximately $11.2 million, of which we have obtained approximately $11.1 million
of cash underwriting. We expect all of the work on these projects to occur in 2016. See
discussion of our sources of liquidity under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” beginning on page
33 of this Quarterly Report.
Item 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk, including adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Historically, we have not entered into financial instruments to mitigate these risks. We do not
enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates chosen for the estimated sensitivity
analysis are considered to be reasonable near-term changes generally based on consideration
of past fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, since it is not possible to
accurately predict future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, these hypothetical changes
may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations.
The following information about our market-sensitive financial instruments constitutes a “forward-
looking statement.”
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Our Canadian subsidiary conducts business in the Canadian dollar and is therefore subject to
foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investing transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, we do not have any
open forward exchange contracts.
Additionally, certain intercompany balances between our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Since this is not the functional currency of our Canadian subsidiary,
the changes in these balances are translated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a
result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as it relates to these intercompany balances. A
sensitivity analysis on the intercompany balance as of June 30, 2016 indicates that if the U.S.
dollar strengthened or weakened 4% (determined using an average of the last three years’
historical exchange rates) against the Canadian dollar, the effect upon our Consolidated
Statements of Operations would be approximately $0.1 million.
We have not had any significant changes in our market risk exposures during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016.
Item 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and President and
our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act),
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
35
Table of Contents
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President along with our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
June 30, 2016 were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
