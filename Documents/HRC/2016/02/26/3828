</b></p>
<p><b>  Switzerland: revised draft decision 
</b></p>
<p><b>  17/&#8230; Panel on the promotion and protection of human rights in the  
 context of peaceful protests  
</b></p>
<p> At its &#8230; meeting, on &#8230; June 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt the 
following text: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights 
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, States Members of the United Nations have pledged themselves to 
achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect 
for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without 
distinction, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression 
and of association are human rights guaranteed to all, and that therefore everyone 
must be able to express their grievances through public and peaceful protests 
without fear of being injured, beaten, detained, tortured or killed,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that peaceful protests should not be viewed as a threat and therefore 
encouraging States faced with peaceful protests to engage in an open, inclusive and 
meaningful national dialogue, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that when peaceful protests occur, States have the responsibility to 
promote and protect human rights and to prevent human rights violations, in 
particular extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary detention, 
enforced disappearances, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, 
</p>

<p>2 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> therefore the need to reflect on the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the context of peaceful protests,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its eighteenth 
session, a panel discussion on the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
context of peaceful protests, with a particular focus on the ways and means to 
improve the protection of these rights in such contexts in line with human rights law;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to liaise with relevant special procedures, States and other 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report 
on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.&#8221;
