<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> Following the presentation of her interim report to the General Assembly on the 
issue of trafficking in persons and global supply chain, submitted in compliance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 17/1 (A/67/261), the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, convened an international consultation in Ankara, 
on 12 and13 November 2012, on the main findings and recommendations of her report and 
to discuss elements for possible benchmarks and indicators to help businesses to exercise 
due diligence in preventing and detecting trafficking cases in their supply chains. The 
consultation brought together leading experts and anti-trafficking organizations, including 
20 representatives of business enterprises, trade unions, non-governmental organizations, 
academia and international organizations. 
</p>
<p> The consultation focused on understanding the relationship between human 
trafficking and global supply chains, and the risks run by workers and business. In this 
regard, speakers described the international migration framework, referred to specific cases 
of abuse documented by the media and the different forms of exploitation at the recruitment 
and employment stages of the employment relationship, and highlighted factors increasing 
the vulnerability of migrant workers.

<p> Participants then identified some of the responses of the business community to the 
risks of human trafficking in supply chains, in particular, the commitments made by two 
companies and their efforts to monitor their supply chains and mitigate risks associated 
with human trafficking. A number of responses were also discussed, including the role of 
social auditing and workplace assessments, recruitment and employment conditions facing 
workers in the supply chain, the importance of working together with suppliers (for 
example, by promoting training and capacity-building programmes), the need for social 
responsibility initiatives to focus attention on service providers (for example, call centres), 
and the importance of giving special consideration to the rights of migrant and foreign 
contract workers in the supply chain. The concept of ethical recruitment as an emerging 
measure in the fight against human trafficking was also considered. Participants discussed 
at length the themes of partnership and dialogue as key elements in addressing the risks of 
human trafficking in supply chains; in this regard, the experience of organizations and 
companies that have been working together in this field were explained. The international 
normative context for the engagement of the business community in the fight against 
human trafficking in global supply chains was also recalled by reviewing the applicable 
international human rights instruments and standards on States&#8217; obligations and business 
</p>
<p>responsibility. New strategies for supply chain engagement, particularly the role of 
consumers within this field, were also examined, including a number of innovative 
programmes. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, participants looked at the steps to be taken in future, reviewing in particular a 
draft checklist of indicators and benchmarks that enterprises could use to assess the risks of 
human trafficking and forced labour in their supply chains. These indicators and 
benchmarks are intended to complement the existing important initiatives developed by 
enterprises themselves and civil society organizations. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
the indicators and benchmarks could be a valuable tool for businesses to exercise due 
diligence, as promoted by the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in their 
supply chains in order to detect and prevent cases of trafficking. As a result, the Special 
Rapporteur sees the checklist as a specific tool aimed at building on and complementing the 
Guiding Principles. She is also of the view that promoting a set of indicators and 
benchmarks, though voluntary, under her mandate may help in efforts to further specify 
corporate responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis human rights and, more specifically, trafficking in 
persons.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 12 and 13 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, convened in Ankara an international consultation on 
trafficking in persons and global supply chains.1 The consultation brought together leading 
experts and anti-trafficking organizations, including 20 representatives from the business 
community, trade unions, non-governmental organizations, academia and international 
organizations. The aim of the meeting was: 
</p>
<p>(a) To discuss the main findings and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
outlined in her report submitted to the General Assembly;2 
</p>
<p>(b) To enhance and broaden thematic expertise on issues relating to human 
trafficking and supply chains; 
</p>
<p>(c) To share information among stakeholders on current trends, good practices 
and lessons learned, including case studies, in addressing trafficking in global supply 
chains;  
</p>
<p>(d) To consider and discuss elements of possible standards and indicators for 
achieving a trafficking-free supply chain. 
</p>
<p>2. The initiative of the Special Rapporteur was enthusiastically received by 
participants, who agreed that greater efforts to address trafficking in persons in supply 
chains were both timely and of crucial importance. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report contains a summary of the discussions that were held at the 
meeting. All relevant documentation is available on the webpage of the Special Rapporteur 
at the address www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Trafficking/Pages/GlobalSupplyChains.aspx. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of discussions 
</b></p>
<p>4. The consultation was officially opened by the United Nations Resident Coordinator 
in Turkey , who welcomed participants, expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to host 
the meeting and provided an overview of human trafficking in the global and regional 
context. He encouraged participants to share the recommendations made at the meeting 
with his office and to regard Turkey as a laboratory for testing and validating those 
recommendations in the future. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, delivered the opening remarks. She welcomed participants and reviewed 
the structure and modalities of the consultation. The Special Rapporteur clarified the 
objectives of the meeting, including the intention to explore ways to promote public-private 
partnerships to fight human trafficking, to examine and learn from each other and existing 
initiatives, and to share information and consider the need for and development of new 
tools and benchmarks addressed to business in order to combat effectively human 
trafficking in supply chains (see appendix I). 
</p>
<p>  
 1  Support for the preparation of the consultation was graciously provided by the United Nations country 
</p>
<p>team in Turkey, particularly the Office of the Resident Coordinator, to whom the Special Rapporteur 
extends her warmest thanks.

</b></p>
<p>6. The agenda of the consultation was divided into seven themes, divided into sessions 
to be held over two days (see appendix II). The themes addressed were: 
</p>
<p>1.  Challenges and risks posed by human trafficking to workers and business  
</p>
<p>2.  Business responses to human trafficking 
</p>
<p>3.  The concept of ethical recruitment and the role of private employment 
agencies  
</p>
<p>4.  Partnership approaches in the fight against human trafficking  
</p>
<p>5.  International standards and public policies addressed to human trafficking, 
forced labour and supply chains  
</p>
<p>6.  New strategies for supply chain and consumer engagement  
</p>
<p>7.  Next steps in taking action  
</p>
<p>The above themes were considered in the light of a background paper prepared for the 
consultation.3 
</p>
<p><b> A. Session 1: Human trafficking and global supply chains: Understanding 
</b></p>
<p><b>the challenges and risks for business and workers 
</b></p>
<p>7. In their presentations, the speakers focused on understanding the relationship 
between human trafficking and global supply chains, and the risks run by both workers and 
business. The aim of the session was to identify how, why and where human trafficking 
manifests itself in the supply chain and to better understand the opportunities and 
challenges that businesses face in addressing the issue. 
</p>
<p>8. The speakers focused on a variety of topics to contextualize the discussion on 
business engagement. These included the international migration framework, specific cases 
of abuse documented by the media, different forms of exploitation at the stages of 
recruitment and employment of the employment relationship, and factors increasing the 
vulnerability of migrant workers. Four speakers referenced the truly global nature of 
trafficking in persons, highlighting cases from Asia, Africa, Europe and the United 
Kingdom, including in such economic sectors as manufacturing, agriculture and services. A 
consistent feature raised by speakers was the threat of debt bondage facing migrant 
workers, who are often charged excessive and even illegal recruitment fees and other costs 
at different stages of the migration process. Workers were charged at every stage, thus 
compounding their vulnerability to abuse and exploitation in the host country and 
workplace. Other important features highlighted by speakers and participants included the 
vulnerability of poor, unskilled workers, the risks linked to the informal economy, the 
problems associated with unregulated or poorly regulated migration systems, the risks to 
business in the retail and hospitality sector associated with working conditions in 
agricultural supply chains, and specific forms of abuse, such as passport confiscation, 
deception in the recruitment process, the levying of security deposits as &#8220;runaway 
insurance&#8221; and threats of physical or sexual abuse. Participants also noted the important 
role that business can play in addressing recruitment and employment conditions in the 
supply chain, the leverage large buyers have vis-&#224;-vis their first tier suppliers, the potential 
for improvement in the auditing and monitoring of labour and human rights standards, and 
the potential for business to push for greater say by workers and to secure access to redress

</p>
<p>in the workplace and host communities. Participants also emphasized the important role 
played by Government and the labour administration in the fight against human trafficking, 
and the need to increase the resources and capacities of labour inspectorates to address the 
issue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Session 2: Raising the game I: Business response to the risks of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>9. Speakers discussed the response of enterprises to the risks of human trafficking in 
supply chains. The aim of the session was to explore the different ways that companies 
address this risk, highlighting specific examples from selected industries, and to draw 
lessons for effective business-led anti-trafficking initiatives. 
</p>
<p>10. Discussions held during the session focused on the commitments of two companies 
and their efforts to monitor effectively their supply chains and to mitigate the risks 
associated with human trafficking. The Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition4 was 
identified as an example of a good practice in the industry, bringing together companies 
large and small from across the sector to raise supply chain standards for labour, 
environment, ethics, and health and safety. Other topics discussed during the session 
included the role of social auditing and workplace assessments, recruitment and 
employment conditions facing workers in the supply chain; the importance of working 
together with suppliers (for example, by promoting training and capacity-building 
programmes); the need for social responsibility initiatives to focus attention on service 
providers (for example, call centres); and the importance of giving special consideration to 
the rights of migrant and foreign contract workers in the supply chain. Speakers also 
highlighted the importance of dialogue between the business community, civil society 
groups and the United Nations system to promote public-private partnerships; examples of 
such partnerships showed that companies can also engage in anti-trafficking initiatives 
outside their own supply chain corporate social responsibility programmes. Speakers also 
introduced the global Business Coalition against Trafficking (www.gbcat.org/), a new 
business-led initiative launched in 2012. The initiative was founded by like-minded 
companies as a place where businesses may come together to discuss anti-trafficking efforts 
and learn from each other. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Session 3: Raising the game II: Business response to the risks of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking: the concept of ethical recruitment 
</b></p>
<p>11. Participants in the session expanded on session 2 and considered the concept of 
ethical recruitment as an emerging measure in the fight against human trafficking. The aim 
of the session was to identify the response of the recruitment industry to the issue, to 
examine the role played by industry and trade associations, and to introduce practical 
insights and tools from the field of ethical recruitment and employment. 
</p>
<p>12. Speakers highlighted the importance of the code of conduct adopted by the 
International Confederation of Private Employment Agencies as a key reference point for 
industry efforts to combat human trafficking and to promote ethical recruitment. The role of 
the Confederation itself was also emphasized, in particular its efforts to promote the 
ratification of Convention No. 181 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on 
Private Employment Agencies as a first step in establishing the legal and regulatory

</b></p>
<p>foundation for recruitment industries at the national level. Speakers emphasized the 
importance of the business community, working alongside civil society groups and in 
consultation with workers&#8217; organizations, encouraging Governments to ratify ILO 
conventions and to establish the mechanisms required to prevent unscrupulous recruitment 
agencies from charging workers excessive fees for services. 
</p>
<p>13. Other speakers highlighted a key model of ethical recruitment, the business benefits 
of the model, some of the challenges faced in implementing it and the measures that help to 
eliminate risks of trafficking for workers. New and emerging tools that promote ethical 
recruitment and safe migration were also introduced, including the Dhaka Principles for 
Migration with Dignity,5 which were developed by the Institute for Human Rights and 
Business, based in the United Kingdom. The Dhaka Principles are based on the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights and international labour and human rights 
standards. They provide key principles that employers and migrant recruiters should respect 
at each stage of the recruitment, employment and repatriation process to ensure migration 
with dignity. Other tools introduced during the session were those recently developed by 
Verit&#233;, a no-governmental organization based in the United States of America, including 
the Fair Hiring Toolkit6 and the Ethical Framework for Cross-Border Labour Recruitment.7 
These tools provide a complementary, overarching framework of normative and technical 
guidance for business at all levels of supply chain engagement, from multinational brands 
and their suppliers to private employment agencies operating within global supply chains. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Session 4: Raising the game III: Partnership and dialogue in the fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>14. Participants explored the themes of partnership and dialogue as key elements in 
addressing the risks of human trafficking in supply chains. The aim of the session was to 
introduce and assess examples of good practices in multi-stakeholder engagement and 
social dialogue. 
</p>
<p>15. Speakers drew attention to a number of organizations and companies working 
together in a partnership. These included End Human Trafficking Now, an association 
founded in 2006 in Switzerland that promotes the Athens Ethical Principles. 8 The 
association seeks to raise awareness of human trafficking and the role that business can 
play in combating it, partnering with signatories to the Athens Ethical Principles and other 
organizations to develop tools, such as e-learning courses (in partnership with the Global 
Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking) and case studies to promote good practices (with the 
Global Compact). The association also works with global media to raise public awareness. 
Participants in the session also considered the activities of the United Nations Inter-Agency 
Project on Human Trafficking, 9 which has worked with media and investigative journalists 
such as the CNN Freedom Project to highlight abuses of human trafficking in the South-
east Asia region. The Project has also worked with an information technology company to 
facilitate development of a smartphone application to aid law enforcement officers in the 
identification of trafficking victims, thus leveraging the core competencies of the company 
while contributing to more effective law enforcement. Lastly, participants also highlighted 
the work of the Not For Sale campaign in the United States of America and its partnership

<p>with the International Labour Rights Fund to provide consumers with information about the 
links between forced labour, human trafficking and consumer products to enable them to 
make better, more-informed choices about their purchases.10 One of the key initiatives of 
Not For Sale is the Free2Work website and smartphone application, which allows 
consumers who visit the website or scan a product barcode with the application  to have 
access to detailed information about initiatives by companies to address modern- day 
slavery. The site provides a grade of &#8220;A&#8221; to &#8220;F&#8221; to each brand. The discussion concluded 
with consideration of the role of social dialogue, with the examples of agricultural trade 
unions in Ireland winning collective bargaining rights and protections to cover migrant 
workers in the sector; the national trade union centre in Nepal and its efforts to protect 
outgoing migrant workers bound for the Gulf Region; and partnerships between unions and 
enterprises in India to ensure that migrant workers&#8217; rights in that country are protected. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Session 5: International standards and public policy addressed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>human trafficking and supply chains 
</b></p>
<p>16. Participants reviewed the international normative context for the engagement of the 
business community against human trafficking in global supply chains. The aim of the 
session was to situate the role of Governments and intergovernmental agencies in the 
discussion, to introduce examples of public policies addressing supply chains and human 
trafficking, and to achieve a better understanding of what policy actors were doing on the 
issue. 
</p>
<p>17. Speakers introduced the relevant international human rights, labour and anti-
trafficking instruments, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 
in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional 
Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the 
Vienna Declaration, the Beijing Platform of Action and the OHCHR Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking. More than 20 instruments on slavery, human trafficking 
and forced labour were acknowledged by the participants, including the recent ILO 
Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189). Discussions also focused on the role of 
government in labour administration and inspection; normative and regulatory instruments 
(some voluntary), such as the Global Compact; the special procedures and OHCHR, 
including the latter&#8217;s function of supporting the mandate of mandate holders; and the role of 
the State as the primary duty bearer in the field of human rights. At the same time, a 
question was raised about the need for effective implementation and enforcement of 
international instruments and national laws for States parties thereto; the need for new laws 
and policy measures to address business and supply chains directly; the importance of 
regional and subregional engagement; and the role of partnership and collaboration in this 
context, including the key role of civil society groups. Special mention was also made of 
the recently adopted Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which were 
identified as marking the emergence of a new, non-binding platform for corporate and 
multi-stakeholder engagement. The Guiding Principles provide a common, authoritative 
standard and reference point for mitigating the risk of a negative impact on human rights 
linked to business. A special procedure mechanism in the form of a working group had also 
been established by the Human Rights Council with the mandate of, inter alia, promoting 
the dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines. Lastly, comments were expressed 
about the need to engage international finance institutions such as the World Bank, the

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.4

</b></p>
<p>International Finance Corporation and regional development banks, and the role of the 
Global Forum on Migration and Development in coming years. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Session 6: New strategies for supply chain and consumer engagement 
</b></p>
<p>18. Discussions held during session 6 focused on new strategies for supply chain 
engagement and the role of consumers in that this field. The aim of the session was to 
introduce new normative and technical tools for businesses and consumer-based and IT 
approaches for fighting human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>19. A number of innovative programmes were discussed by participants. These included 
the Buy Responsibly Campaign launched by the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM),11 which seeks to raise the awareness of consumers about the products they buy and 
to have a positive influence on consumer behaviour. The campaign indirectly aims to raise 
awareness among business actors and to establish partnerships with such enterprises such as 
MTV and Saatchi and Saatchi to support efforts to address human trafficking. IOM also 
works with private employment agencies. New initiatives discussed during the session were 
the Slavery Footprint and the Made in a Free World platform.12 The initiatives had been 
launched five years earlier with the aim of making consumers directly involved in the issue 
of human trafficking and using the power of conversation to drive changes in behaviour. 
Slavery Footprint allows users to take a brief online survey to discover their connection to 
modern-day slavery, guiding them from an initial, simple question: &#8220;How many slaves 
work for you?&#8221; In contrast, the Made in a Free World platform is addressed to companies 
working to eradicate forced labour from their supply chains. The platform provides a model 
for them to identify high-risk suppliers and to encourage greater visibility in the supply 
chain. Lastly, the work of World Vision Australia was considered, in particular, its Don&#8217;t 
Trade Lives campaign,13 which calls on individuals, Governments and the private sector to 
combat human trafficking. The campaign seeks to inform the Australian public about 
human trafficking internationally and how it is interwoven into their lives and consumer 
choices. The campaign promotes ethical consumerism and practical advocacy action to 
influence consumer behaviour, business and Government practice. It also promotes 
responsible public and private procurement practices, and provides companies striving to 
address labour exploitation in their supply chains with concrete and practical guidance. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Session 7: Where do we go from here? Next steps in supply chain 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the last session of the consultation, participants looked at the next steps in 
supply chain engagement and considered the question: &#8220;Where do we go from here?&#8221; The 
aim of the session was to explore the next steps necessary for business and multi-
stakeholder engagement, to consider key challenges and new forms of engagement, and to 
discuss potential new benchmarks and indicators to promote trafficking-free supply chains. 
Participants in the session were provided with a draft checklist of indicators and 
benchmarks for business to assess risks of human trafficking and forced labour in the 
supply chain (see appendix I). The draft was assessed and revised by three working groups 
on the basis of wide-ranging and detailed discussions of its content and form.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.4

<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>21. The indicators and benchmarks contained in the draft were intended to complement 
the existing important initiatives developed by enterprises and civil society organizations, 
some of which have been discussed above. Participants also suggested that, in long-term 
planning, the indicators and benchmarks should be accompanied by a user&#8217;s guide. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that the set of indicators and benchmarks could prove to be a 
valuable tool for businesses to help them to exercise due diligence, in accordance with the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in their supply chains in order to detect 
and prevent trafficking cases. As a result, the Special Rapporteur sees the checklist as a 
specific tool aimed at building on and complementing the Guiding Principles. She is also of 
the view that promoting a set of indicators and benchmarks under her mandate, although 
these remain voluntary, may contribute to further specifying corporate responsibilities vis-
&#224;-vis human rights and, more specifically, trafficking in persons. </p>
