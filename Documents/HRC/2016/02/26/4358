<p><i> Guided </i>by the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that everyone is entitled 
to the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms, inter 
alia, the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal 
respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all in accordance with the Charter, other instruments relating to human rights, and 
international law, and that the universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond 
question,  
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that all human rights must be treated in a fair 
and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that, while the 
significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and 
religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, all States, regardless of their political, 
economic and cultural systems, have the duty to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Reaffirming </i> that all cultures and civilizations in their traditions, customs, religions 
and beliefs share a common set of values that belong to humankind in its entirety, and that 
those values have made an important contribution to the development of human rights 
norms and standards,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that traditions shall not be invoked to justify harmful practices violating 
universal human fights norms and standards, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 12/21 of 2 October 2009, 
</p>
<p>  1. <i>Welcomes</i> the holding on 4 October 2010 of a workshop for an exchange of 
views on how a better understanding of traditional values of humankind underpinning 
international human rights norms and standards can contribute to the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Also welcomes</i> the report of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights containing the summary of discussions at the said 
workshop;1 
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Affirms</i> that dignity, freedom and responsibility are traditional values, shared 
by the entire humanity and embodied in universal rights instruments; 
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Recognizes</i> that the better understanding and appreciation of these values 
contribute to promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes</i> the important role of family, community, society and educational 
institutions in upholding and transmitting these values, which contributes to promoting 
respect for human rights and increasing their acceptance at the grass roots and calls upon all 
States to strengthen this role through appropriate positive measures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare a study 
on how a better understanding and appreciation of traditional values of dignity, freedom 
and responsibility can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights, and to 
present that study to the Council before its twenty-first session; 
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
