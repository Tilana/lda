Item 1.01.                                        Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 23, 2016, Mines Management, Inc., an Idaho corporation (the “Company”), Hecla Mining Company, a
Delaware corporation (“Hecla”), and HL Idaho Corp., an Idaho corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Hecla (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. The Original Merger Agreement was amended on June 29,
2016 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”).  On July 29, 2016, the Company, Hecla, and Merger Sub entered into
Amendment No. 2 to Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement Amendment”). The Merger Agreement
Amendment provides the Company, Hecla, and Merger Sub additional time to meet certain closing conditions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement by extending the August 15, 2016 deadline for consummating the Merger to
September 30, 2016, thereby allowing the parties to continue to move forward with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.
Other than as expressly modified pursuant the Merger Agreement Amendment, the Merger Agreement, which was
filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
by the Company on May 27, 2016 and amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was
filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC by the Company on July 7, 2016, remains in
full force and effect as originally executed. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement Amendment and the
transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by,
the full text of the Merger Agreement Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
On May 23, 2016, the Company, Newhi Inc., Montanore Minerals Corp., Montmin Resources Corp., and Montanore
Minerals Wisconsin Corp., entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement with Hecla, as lender (the “Term Loan
Agreement”), which provides for a $2.3 million secured term loan facility (the “Term Facility”). On July 29, 2016, the
Company, Newhi Inc., Montanore Minerals Corp., Montmin Resources Corp., Montanore Minerals Wisconsin Corp.,
and Hecla entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement
Amendment”). The Term Loan Agreement Amendment amends the Term Facility such that it matures on the earlier of
September 30, 2016 and the date the Merger is completed.
Other than as expressly modified pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement Amendment, the Term Loan Agreement,
which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC by the Company on May 27,
2016, remains in full force and effect as originally executed on May 23, 2016. The foregoing description of the Term
Loan Agreement Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is
subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Term Loan Agreement Amendment, which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
Additional Information
In connection with the proposed transaction between the Company, Hecla and Merger Sub, Hecla filed with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4, which includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
Company’s meeting of stockholders to be held to approve the Merger.  The Company will mail a definitive proxy
statement/prospectus and related materials to its stockholders. The Company’s stockholders and other interested
persons are advised to read, when available, the proxy statement/prospectus in connection with the Company’s
solicitation of proxies for its special meeting of stockholders to be held to approve the Merger because the proxy
statement/prospectus will contain important information about the Company and the proposed Merger. The proxy
statement/prospectus will be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as of a record date to be established for voting on
the Merger. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement/prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC by Hecla and Mines Management, without charge, once available, at the SEC’s Internet site at
www.sec.gov or by directing a request to Hecla’s Investor Relations Department at Hecla Mining Company, Investor
