notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
Note 1: summary of significant accounting policies
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Vulcan Materials Company (the “Company,” “Vulcan,” “we,” “our”), a New Jersey corporation, is the nation's
largest producer of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of
asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.
We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is used in virtually all types
of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We
serve markets in twenty states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico
and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states in metropolitan markets in the United States that are
expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three
demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and
primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia,
Southwestern and Western markets.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in compliance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and thus do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
financial statements. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from
the audited financial statement, but it does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of our management, the statements reflect all
adjustments, including those of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of the reported
interim periods. Operating results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information,
refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in our most recent Annual Report on Form
10-K.
Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described in Note 2, the results of the Chemicals business
are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with
the 2016 presentation.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
In 2014, we announced changes to our executive management team, and a new divisional organization
structure that was effective January 1, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we
incurred $320,000 and $4,098,000, respectively, of costs related to these initiatives. Future related charges for
these initiatives are estimated to be immaterial.

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. Antidilutive common
stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share calculations. In periods of loss, shares that
otherwise would have been included in our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding computation
are excluded. There were no excluded shares for the periods presented.
The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-
average market price is as follows:

Note 2: Discontinued Operations
In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of
Occidental Chemical Corporation. The financial results of the Chemicals business are classified as
discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
for all periods presented. There were no revenues from discontinued operations for the periods presented.

The losses from discontinued operations noted above include charges related to general and product liability
costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former
Chemicals business.

Note 3: Income Taxes
Our estimated annual effective tax rate (EAETR) is based on full-year expectations of pretax earnings, statutory
tax rates, permanent differences between book and tax accounting such as percentage depletion, and tax
planning alternatives available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting,
we calculate our quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the EAETR. Each quarter, we update our
EAETR based on our revised full-year expectation of pretax earnings and calculate the income tax provision so
that the year-to-date income tax provision reflects the EAETR. Significant judgment is required in determining
our EAETR.
In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $54,200,000
compared to $19,867,000 in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in our income tax expense resulted
largely from applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings.
For the first six months of 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $63,964,000
compared to $5,791,000 for the first six months of 2015. The increase in our income tax expense resulted
largely from applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will
pay) based on the differences between the financial statement’s carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or
credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future
tax returns. With our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes” as of December 31, 2015, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent.
We adopted this standard prospectively and as a result, we did not restate periods prior to adoption.
Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred
tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either
the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or
all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Based on our second quarter 2016 analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit
of all our deferred tax assets with the exception of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. For 2016, we
project deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of $60,131,000, of which
$57,841,000 relates to Alabama. The Alabama net operating loss carryforward, if not utilized, would expire in
years 2022 – 2029. Prior to 2015, we carried a full valuation allowance against this Alabama deferred tax asset
as we did not expect to utilize any portion of it. During 2015, we restructured our legal entities which, among
other benefits, resulted in a partial release of the valuation allowance in the amount of $4,655,000 during the
third quarter of 2015. Our analyses over the last three quarters have confirmed our third quarter 2015 conclusion
but resulted in no further reductions of the valuation allowance. We expect to further reduce, or possibly
eliminate, this valuation allowance once we have returned to sustained profitability (as defined in our most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K), which we project could occur in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that
the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the
more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we
judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized
portion of any tax benefit. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing
circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.
A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9 “Income Taxes” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note 4: deferred revenue
In 2013 and 2012, we sold a percentage interest in future production structured as volumetric production
payments (VPPs).
The VPPs:
§relate to eight quarries in Georgia and South Carolina
§relate to eight quarries in Georgia and South Carolina
§provide the purchaser solely with a nonoperating percentage interest in the subject quarries’ future production
from aggregates reserves
§are both time and volume limited
§contain no minimum annual or cumulative guarantees for production or sales volume, nor minimum sales price
Our consolidated total revenues exclude the sales of aggregates owned by the VPP purchaser.
We received net cash proceeds from the sale of the VPPs of $153,282,000 and $73,644,000 for the 2013 and
2012 transactions, respectively. These proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and
are amortized to revenue on a unit-of-sales basis over the terms of the VPPs (expected to be approximately 25
years, limited by volume rather than time).

Note 5: Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data
Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
Assets subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

We have established two Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee
nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred
compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1
investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available.
Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in the fund (short-
term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).
Net gains of the Rabbi Trust investments were $535,000 and $184,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi
Trusts at June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $(571,000) and $22,000, respectively.
The year-to-date decrease of $6,363,000 in total Rabbi Trust asset fair values at June 30, 2016 is primarily
attributable to the elections by several retired executives to receive their distributions from the nonqualified
retirement and deferred compensation plans.
The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt,
trade payables and accruals, and other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are
presented in Notes 6 and 7, respectively.

We recorded $10,506,000 and $5,190,000 of losses on impairment of long-lived assets for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reducing the carrying value of these Aggregates segment assets
to their estimated fair values of $0 and $0. Fair value was estimated using a market approach (observed
transactions involving comparable assets in similar locations).
Note 6: Derivative Instruments
During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we
use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not utilize derivative
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends
on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging
relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either cash flow hedges
or fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period
the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap fair value hedges are
recorded as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the
risk being hedged.
CASH FLOW HEDGES
During 2007, we entered into fifteen forward starting interest rate locks on $1,500,000,000 of future debt
issuances in order to hedge the risk of higher interest rates. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related
fixed-rate debt, underlying interest rates were lower than the rate locks and we terminated and settled these
forward starting locks for cash payments of $89,777,000. This amount was booked to AOCI and is being
amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.
This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income as follows:

The loss reclassified from AOCI for the six months ended June 30, 2015 includes the acceleration of a

described in Note 7.
For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017, we estimate that $2,092,000 of the pretax loss in AOCI will be
reclassified to earnings.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES
In June 2011, we issued $500,000,000 of 6.50% fixed-rate notes due in 2016 to refinance near term floating-rate
debt. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of $500,000,000 to
reestablish the pre-refinancing mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread of 4.05% and received a fixed interest rate of 6.50%.
Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our $150,000,000 of 10.125%
fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of 8.03% and
received a fixed interest rate of 10.125%. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap
agreements for $25,382,000 of cash proceeds. The $23,387,000 gain component of the settlement (cash
proceeds less $1,995,000 of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and was
amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt using the effective interest
method.
This deferred gain amortization was reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income as follows:

proportional amount of the deferred gain in the amount of $1,642,000 referable to the debt purchases as

1 Borrowings on the bank line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve
months and as long-term debt otherwise.
2 The effective interest rate is the spread over LIBOR as of the most recent balance sheet date.
3 Non-publicly traded debt.
4 The unamortized deferred gain was realized upon the August 2011 settlement of interest rate swaps as
described in Note 6.
5 Face value of our debt is equal to total debt less unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, and
unamortized deferred interest rate swap gain, as follows: June 30, 2016 — $2,004,189 thousand, December
31, 2015 — $2,004,198 thousand and June 30, 2015 — $2,071,813 thousand.
Our total debt is presented in the table above net of unamortized discounts from par, unamortized deferred debt
issuance costs and unamortized deferred interest rate swap settlement gain. Discounts and debt issuance costs
are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective notes resulting in $2,203,000
of net interest expense for these items for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The estimated fair value of our debt presented in the table above was determined by: (1) averaging several
asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and (2) assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The
fair value estimates for the publicly traded notes were based on Level 2 information (as defined in Note 5) as of
their respective balance sheet dates.

LINE OF CREDIT
In June 2015, we cancelled our secured $500,000,000 line of credit and entered into an unsecured
$750,000,000 line of credit (incurring $2,589,000 of transaction fees).
The line of credit agreement expires in June 2020 and contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
customary for an unsecured facility. The primary negative covenant limits our ability to incur secured debt. The
financial covenants are: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of 3.5:1, and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to
net cash interest expense of 3.0:1. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants.
Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and
as long-term debt if we have the intent and ability to extend repayment beyond twelve months. Borrowings bear
interest, at our option, at either LIBOR plus a credit margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%, or SunTrust Bank’s
base rate (generally, its prime rate) plus a credit margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00%. The credit margin for both
LIBOR and base rate borrowings is determined by either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based
on the metric that produces the lower credit spread. Standby letters of credit, which are issued under the line of
credit and reduce availability, are charged a fee equal to the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings plus 0.175%.
We also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit that ranges from 0.10%
to 0.35% determined by either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based on the metric that
produces the lower fee. As of June 30, 2016, the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings was 1.25%, the credit
margin for base rate borrowings was 0.25%, and the commitment fee for the unused amount was 0.15%.
As of June 30, 2016, our available borrowing capacity was $475,160,000. Utilization of the borrowing capacity
was as follows:
§$235,000,000 was borrowed
§$39,840,000 was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit
TERM DEBT
All of our term debt is unsecured. All such debt, other than the $489,000 of other notes, is governed by two
essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant
in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt. As of
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the term debt covenants.
In December 2015, we repaid our $150,000,000 10.125% notes due 2015 via borrowing on our line of credit. In
August 2015, we repaid our $14,000,000 industrial revenue bond due 2022 via borrowing on our line of credit.
These repayments did not incur any prepayment penalties.
In March 2015, we issued $400,000,000 of 4.50% senior notes due 2025. Proceeds (net of underwriter fees and
other transaction costs) of $395,207,000 were partially used to fund the March 30, 2015 purchase, via tender
offer, of $127,303,000 principal amount (32%) of the 7.00% notes due 2018. The March 2015 debt purchase
cost $145,899,000, including an $18,140,000 premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction
costs of $456,000. The premium primarily reflects the trading price of the notes relative to par prior to the tender
offer commencement. Additionally, we recognized $3,138,000 of net noncash expense associated with the
acceleration of a proportional amount of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred
interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined first quarter 2015 charge of $21,734,000 is
presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a
component of interest expense for the six month period ended June 30, 2015.
The remaining net proceeds from the March 2015 debt issuance, together with cash on hand and borrowings
under our line of credit, funded: (1) the April 2015 redemption of $218,633,000 principal amount (100%) of the
6.40% notes due 2017, (2) the April 2015 redemption of $125,001,000 principal amount (100%) of the 6.50%
notes due 2016 and (3) the April 2015 purchase, via the tender offer commenced in March 2015 of $185,000
principal amount (less than 1%) of the 7.00% notes due 2018. The April 2015 debt purchases cost
$385,024,000, including a $41,153,000 premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs
of $52,000. The premium primarily reflects the make-whole value of the 2016 notes and the 2017 notes.
Additionally, we recognized $4,136,000 of net noncash expense associated with the acceleration of
unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and
losses. The combined second quarter 2015 charge of $45,341,000 was a component of interest expense for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
We provide, in the normal course of business, certain third-party beneficiaries with standby letters of credit to
support our obligations to pay or perform according to the requirements of an underlying agreement. Such
letters of credit typically have an initial term of one year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified
or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that
participate in our $750,000,000 line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. Our standby letters
of credit as of June 30, 2016 are summarized by purpose in the table below:

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or
local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or
similar state and local environmental laws. Generally, we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other
PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in
determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that
cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the
nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of
involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential
obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and
financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available,
the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a material effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period
could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period.
We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with
precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve
possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.
In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, other material legal
proceedings are more specifically described below.
§Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site) — The Lower Passaic River Study Area is part of the
Diamond Shamrock Superfund Site in New Jersey. Vulcan and approximately 70 other companies are parties
(collectively the Cooperating Parties Group) to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (draft
RI/FS) of the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River (River). However, before the draft RI/FS was issued in final
form, the EPA issued a record of decision (ROD) in March 2016 that calls for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy
for the lower 8 miles of the River. The EPA estimates that the cost of implementing this proposal is $1.38
billion. The Cooperating Parties Group draft RI/FS estimates the preferred remedial action presented therein to
cost in the range of $475 million to $725 million.
Efforts to remediate the River have been underway for many years and have involved hundreds of entities that
have had operations on or near the River at some point during the past several decades. Vulcan formerly
owned a chemicals operation near the mouth of the River, which was sold in 1974. The major risk drivers in the
River have been identified as dioxins, PCBs, DDx and mercury. Vulcan did not manufacture any of these risk
drivers and has no evidence that any of these were discharged into the River by Vulcan.
14
The AOC does not obligate us to fund or perform the remedial action contemplated by either the draft RI/FS or
the ROD. Furthermore, the parties who will participate in funding the remediation and their respective
allocations, have not been determined. Vulcan does not agree that a bank-to-bank remedy is warranted, and
Vulcan is not obligated to fund any of the remedial action at this time; nevertheless, we previously estimated the
cost to be incurred by us for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy and recorded an immaterial loss for this matter in
2015.
§TEXAS BRINE MATTER — During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a
salt lease from 1976 – 2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The
Texas Brine Company (Texas Brine) operated this salt mine for the account of Vulcan. Vulcan sold its
Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchaser, and Vulcan has had no association with
the leased premises or Texas Brine since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome
and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including
class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in
New Orleans.
There are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the
litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 by Texas Brine. Vulcan has since been added as a direct
and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the state of Louisiana. The damages
alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs’ claims for property damage, to the state of Louisiana’s
claim for response costs, to claims for physical damages to oil pipelines, to business interruption claims. In
addition to the plaintiffs’ claims, Vulcan has also been sued for contractual indemnity and comparative fault by
both Texas Brine and Occidental Chemical Co. (Occidental).  The total amount of damages claimed is in excess
of $500 million. It is alleged that the sinkhole was caused, in whole or in part, by Vulcan’s negligent actions or
failure to act. It is also alleged that Vulcan breached the salt lease, as well as an operating agreement and a
drilling agreement with Texas Brine; that Vulcan is strictly liable for certain property damages in its capacity as a
former assignee of the salt lease; and that Vulcan violated certain covenants and conditions in the agreement
under which it sold its Chemicals Division in 2005. Vulcan has made claims for contractual indemnity,
comparative fault, and breach of contract against Texas Brine, as well as claims for contractual indemnity and
comparative fault against Occidental. Discovery is ongoing and the first trial date in any of these cases has been
set for March 2017. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability pertaining to this matter.
§HEWITT LANDFILL MATTER — In September 2015, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) issued a Cleanup and Abatement Order (CAO) directing Vulcan to assess, monitor, cleanup and
abate wastes that have been discharged to soil, soil vapor, and/or groundwater at the former Hewitt Landfill in
Los Angeles. The CAO follows a 2014 Investigative Order from the RWQCB that sought data and a technical
evaluation regarding the Hewitt Landfill, and a subsequent amendment to the Investigative Order requiring
Vulcan to provide groundwater monitoring results to the RWQCB and to create and implement a work plan for
further investigation of the Hewitt Landfill. In April 2016, Vulcan submitted an interim remedial action plan
(IRAP) to the RWQCB, proposing a pilot test of a pump and treat system;  testing and implementation of a
leachate recovery system; and storm water capture and conveyance improvements. Until this pilot testing and
additional investigative work is complete, we are unable to estimate the cost of remedial action.
Vulcan is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the EPA, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
and other stakeholders regarding the potential contribution of the Hewitt Landfill to groundwater contamination
in the North Hollywood Operable Unit (NHOU) of the San Fernando Valley Superfund Site. We are gathering
and analyzing data and developing technical information to determine the extent of possible contribution by the
Hewitt Landfill to the groundwater contamination in the area. This work is also intended to assist in identification
of other PRPs that may have contributed to groundwater contamination in the area. In July 2016, the EPA sent a
letter to Vulcan requesting that we enter into an AOC for remedial design work at the NHOU including, but not
limited to, the design of two groundwater extraction wells south of the Hewitt Landfill. We expect to have further
discussions with the EPA regarding their request. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability
pertaining to this matter.
It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we
are involved, and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings, or the
verdict of a particular jury, could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs. No liability was
recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a
loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred.
In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per
occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Note 9: Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets.
Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating
expenses. If the ARO is settled for something other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain
or loss on settlement.
We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially
all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For
the three and six month periods ended June 30, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the
liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows:

Note 10: Benefit Plans
We sponsor three funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all
employees hired prior to July 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement
age is 65, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried Plan and the
Chemicals Hourly Plan are generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction
Materials Hourly Plan provides benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service. In addition to these
qualified plans, we sponsor three unfunded, nonqualified pension plans.
Effective July 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans to no longer accept new participants. In
December 2013, we amended our defined benefit pension plans so that future service accruals for salaried
pension participants ceased effective December 31, 2013. This change included a special transition provision
which allowed covered compensation through December 31, 2015 to be considered in the participants’ benefit
calculations.

We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the qualified plans through 2017.
In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired
employees. In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage
cost at the 2015 level. Substantially all of our salaried employees and, where applicable, certain of our hourly
employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service
requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered individuals become
eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age 65, whichever
occurs first.

Note 13: Segment Reporting
We have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates,
Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. The vast majority of our activities are domestic. We sell a relatively small
amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Intersegment sales are made at local market
prices for the particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed
concrete. Management reviews earnings from the product line reporting segments principally at the gross profit
level.

Note 15: Goodwill
Goodwill is recognized when the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and

for impairment. There were no charges for goodwill impairment in the six month periods ended June 30, 2016
and 2015.
We have four reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix,

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a
manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. A
decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a
material, noncash write-down of goodwill.

Note 16: Acquisitions and Divestitures
ACQUISITIONS
Through the six months ended June 30, 2016, we purchased the assets of a trucking business to complement
our aggregates logistics and distribution activities  for $1,611,000 of cash consideration.
For the full year 2015, we purchased the following for total consideration of $47,198,000  ($27,198,000 cash
and $20,000,000 exchanges of real property and businesses (twelve California ready-mixed concrete
operations)):
§one aggregates facility in Tennessee
§three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona and New Mexico
§three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona and New Mexico
§thirteen asphalt mix operations, primarily in Arizona
DIVESTITURES AND PENDING DIVESTITURES
As noted above, in 2015 (first quarter), we exchanged twelve ready-mixed concrete operations in California

Note 17: New Accounting Standards
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED
NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE INVESTMENTS    During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2015-07, “Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset
Value per Share (or its Equivalent).” This ASU removed the requirement to categorize investments within the
fair value hierarchy when their fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
This ASU also removed the requirement to make certain disclosures for investments that are eligible to be
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to
investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The impact
of this standard is limited to our annual pension plan fair value disclosures.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION
CREDIT LOSSES  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-13,
“Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which amends guidance on the impairment of
financial instruments. The new guidance estimates credit losses based on expected losses, modifies the
impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for
purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early
adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently
evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvement to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which amends several aspects of the accounting for employee share-
based payment transactions. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the
income statement when the awards vest or are settled (i.e., the use of APIC pools will be eliminated).
Additionally, the guidance changes the employers’ accounting for an employee’s use of shares to satisfy the
employer’s statutory income tax withholding obligation. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early
adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our
consolidated financial statements.
22
LEASE ACCOUNTING  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which amends existing
accounting standards for lease accounting and adds additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. Under
the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for
all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement and presentation of cash flow
in the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted and
modified retrospective application is required. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this
standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  In January 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which
amends certain aspects of current guidance on the recognition, measurement and disclosure of financial
instruments. Among other changes, this ASU requires most equity investments be measured at fair value.
Additionally, the ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value for instruments not recognized at fair value in our financial statements. This ASU is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within
those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the interim
period ending March 31, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
INVENTORY MEASUREMENT  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory,” which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market principle to
the lower of cost and net realizable value principle. The guidance applies to inventories that are measured
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost method, but does not apply to inventories that are measured
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method. We use the LIFO method for approximately 67% of
our inventory (based on the December 31, 2015 balances); therefore, this ASU will not apply to the majority of
our inventory. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will
adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2017. While we are still evaluating the
impact of ASU 2015-11, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
GOING CONCERN  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an
Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which requires management to perform interim and annual
assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern (meet its obligations as they become due)
within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial
doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required. This ASU is
effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter.
Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this standard as of and for the annual period ending December 31,
2016. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
REVENUE RECOGNITION  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU  2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With
Customers,” which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising
from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-
specific guidance. This ASU provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and expands
required revenue recognition disclosures. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue From
Contracts With Customers: Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),”
which amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 provide
guidance on recording revenue on a gross basis versus a net basis based on the determination of whether an
entity is a principal or an agent when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer.
These ASUs are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting
periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Further, in
applying these ASUs an entity is permitted to use either the full retrospective or cumulative effect transition
approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial
statements and determining our transition method.

ITEM 2
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
GENERAL COMMENTS
Overview
Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the U.S. economy. We are the
nation's largest producer of construction aggregates  (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major
producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.
Demand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in
population growth, household formation and employment. The primary end uses include public construction,
such as highways, bridges, airports, schools and prisons, as well as private nonresidential (e.g., manufacturing,
retail, offices, industrial and institutional) and private residential construction (e.g., single-family houses,
duplexes, apartment buildings and condominiums). Customers for our products include heavy construction and
paving contractors; commercial building contractors; concrete products manufacturers; residential building
contractors; state, county and municipal governments; railroads and electric utilities.
We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is used in virtually all types
of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.
Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if
not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally
produced materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the
Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these
markets from quarries that have access to long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our
quarry on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three
Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.
There are practically no substitutes for quality aggregates. Because of barriers to entry created in many
metropolitan markets by zoning and permitting regulation and because of high transportation costs relative to
the value of the product, the location of reserves is a critical factor to our long-term success.
While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and
downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain
markets to generate acceptable financial returns. We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete
primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern and Western markets. Aggregates comprise approximately
95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In all of these downstream
businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our own operations.
Seasonality and cyclical nature of our business
Almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related
conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any
quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings
are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive
to national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic and population fluctuations, and particularly
to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.

§a pretax charge of $4.2 million associated with acquisitions and divestitures
§a pretax loss on impairment of $0.9 million
§Discrete items in the second quarter of 2015 include:
§a pretax charge of $2.6 million associated with acquisitions and divestitures
§a pretax loss on impairment of $5.2 million
§a pretax charge of $1.3 million for restructuring
§a pretax charge of $45.3 million for debt purchase
§Net earnings were $123.8 million, an increase of $75.6 million, or 157%
§Adjusted EBITDA was $279.8 million, an increase of $49.0 million, or 21%
Our second quarter results reflect continued strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite below-trend
shipment growth due to extremely wet weather and slower than expected large project starts. These
factors impacted shipments in several key markets, particularly during May. Compared with the prior year’s
second quarter, aggregates shipments rose 1.3 million tons, or 3%, and freight-adjusted aggregates pricing
increased $0.84 per ton, or 7%. For the first half of 2016, aggregates shipments grew 9% over the same period
in 2015, while freight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased 8%. Second quarter aggregates gross profit
increased 23% on 3% growth in shipments and 7% growth in freight-adjusted pricing. Net earnings for the
second quarter increased 157% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% versus the prior year as gross profit
margins improved significantly in the Aggregates, Asphalt Mix and Concrete segments.
The fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business remain attractive, and we are reaffirming our full year
Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.0 to $1.1 billion (information reconciling forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to
the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable without unreasonable effort, as discussed in the
following Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section). Weather patterns and the timing of large
project activity have led to higher month-to-month and state-to-state variability in our shipments, somewhat
masking the continued recovery in construction materials demand across our footprint. In several markets,
higher levels of public funding for transportation and other infrastructure have yet to convert into construction
activity, creating a “lull” in materials shipments to these end uses. In addition, some markets may have seen a
portion of second quarter shipment activity pulled forward into the first quarter. Taken in total, however, our first
half aggregates shipment growth of 9% was roughly in line with recent trend. Longer-term project pipelines
appear healthy, and the foundations for sustained, multi-year volume and pricing growth remain in place.
Importantly, our teams continued to manage costs, pricing and product mix well in the quarter. They improved
per-ton gross profit in our Aggregates segment by almost 20% despite relatively modest shipment growth and
uneven production schedules. These disciplines, and the resulting improvements to our customer service and
profitability, reinforce our confidence in both our 2016 and longer-term Adjusted EBITDA outlooks.
25
At the end of the second quarter, total debt outstanding was approximately $2 billion, including $235.0 million of
floating-rate borrowings. The quarter end cash balance was $91.9 million.
As of June 30, cash capital expenditures were $199.8 million, including $50.3 million invested in the purchase
of two replacement ships to transport aggregates from our high-volume quarry in Mexico, as well as new site
development and investment in other growth opportunities. For the full year, core capital expenditures are
expected to be approximately $275 million. Internal growth capital investments, excluding acquisitions, are
expected to be approximately $125 million.
During the first half of 2016, we returned $122.5 million to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.
The strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding performance of our teams led
to strong earnings growth in 2015 and that momentum has continued through the first half of 2016. Unit
profitability continues to improve and incremental margins remain strong in our Aggregates, Asphalt Mix and
Concrete segments, off-setting some risks to our full year volume outlook. Although we still expect full year
aggregates shipments to exceed 190 million tons, two key factors will be important to realizing full year
shipment growth of 8% to 9%: (1) the ability of our customers to recover weather-delayed volume from the
second quarter, which can be a challenge in a growing market, and (2) the absence of further delays in several
large projects in key markets. And, as always, fourth quarter weather and the ultimate length of the construction
season can impact our shipments in a given year.
Importantly, the volatility in volume growth rates that we have experienced recently relates primarily to the timing
of shipments (i.e., in which month or quarter they occur) and not to the longer-term health of the recovery in
demand. Our first half 2016 results and full year outlook are aligned with our longer range market expectations
and performance goals. Since the beginning of this recovery in the second half of 2013, our teams’ efforts have
resulted in trailing twelve months aggregates gross profit increasing nearly $525 million on a 45 million ton
 increase in annualized shipments. We remain on track to deliver further gains in profitability and cash flow as
the recovery moves forward.
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Gross profit  margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle
(GAAP) measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating
results. Likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our
operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities. Reconciliation
of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

Aggregates segment gross profit  margin as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues is not a GAAP measure.
We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe
that this presentation is meaningful to our investors as it excludes freight, delivery and transportation revenues,
which are pass-through activities. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill
tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-
adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in
freight-adjusted revenues. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented

GAAP does not define "cash gross profit" and “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”
(EBITDA). Thus, cash gross profit and EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures
defined by GAAP. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such
metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess
performance. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ability to incur
and service debt and to assess the operating performance of a company’s businesses. We use cash gross profit
and EBITDA to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company.
Additionally, we adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from
period to period.  We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of these
metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:
cash gross profit
Cash gross profit adds back noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization (DDA&A)
to gross profit. Cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing cash gross profit by tons shipped.

A reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected
results is not available without unreasonable effort. We are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the
outcome of legal proceedings, charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures, impairment of long-lived
assets and other unusual gains and losses.

SECOND quarter 2016 Compared to SECOND Quarter 2015
Second quarter 2016 total revenues were $956.8 million, up 7% from the second quarter of 2015. Shipments
increased in aggregates (+3%), asphalt mix (+1%) and ready-mixed concrete (+1%). Diesel fuel expenditures
were $7.1 million lower, with most of this benefit realized in the Aggregates segment.
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 were $123.8 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $48.2
million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. Each period’s results were impacted by
discrete items, as follows:
§Net earnings for the  second quarter of 2016 include a pretax gain of $11.0 million from business interruption
claims, pretax charges of $4.2 million associated with acquisitions and divestitures, and a $0.9 million pretax
asset impairment loss
§Net earnings for the second quarter of 2015 include pretax charges of $2.6 million associated with acquisitions
and divestitures, a $5.2 million pretax asset impairment loss, a $1.3 million pretax charge for restructuring, and
a pretax loss on debt purchase of $45.3 million presented as a component of interest expense (see Note 7 to
the condensed consolidated financial statements)
Continuing Operations — Changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the second

Aggregates segment sales were $791.5 million, up 8%, from the prior year’s second quarter while aggregates
freight-adjusted revenues were $614.8 million, up 10%. Second quarter total aggregates shipments increased
3%, or 1.3 million tons, compared to the second quarter of 2015. As previously noted, weather patterns and the
timing of large projects led to highly variable second quarter shipment results across our markets. Many of our
key states realized strong double-digit volume growth, including markets in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and
South Carolina. In contrast, Texas shipments fell 13% — with particular weakness in the coastal region, where
year-over-year shipments fell by more than 30%. Shipments in California, Illinois and Virginia also declined by
high-single digits. Weather and other factors most severely impacted shipments in May, during which our
average daily shipment rates were approximately 5% below the prior year. By comparison, our April and June
daily shipping rates were approximately 8% and 6% ahead of the prior year, respectively.
For the trailing twelve months, shipments rose 9% over the year-earlier period. This was the twelfth consecutive
quarter in which the rate of shipments increased, as measured on a trailing twelve months basis. Despite these
recent gains, demand for aggregates remains well below demographic-driven historical levels in the U.S. We
believe conditions remain in place for a sustained, multi-year recovery in demand for aggregates, although
quarter-to-quarter trends may vary significantly.
For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 7%, or $0.84 per ton, versus the
prior year. Geographic and product mix factors had a slightly negative impact on our average sales price and
the rate of price growth in the quarter. On a trailing twelve months basis, pricing in all of our major markets has
increased versus the prior year’s comparable period. The overall pricing climate remains favorable as
construction materials producers stay focused on earning adequate returns on capital.
Second quarter unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) in the Aggregates segment was flat versus the prior year’s
second quarter. Excluding the benefits of lower unit costs for diesel fuel, unit costs were approximately 2%
 higher in the quarter. For
31
the trailing twelve months, unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted), excluding the impact of lower diesel costs, was
essentially flat. These results reflect our continued commitment to plant-level cost controls and operating
disciplines.
Aggregates segment unit margins continued to increase. Gross profit per ton increased $0.84, or 19%, from the
prior year’s second quarter. Cash gross profit per ton increased $0.86, or 15%, from the prior year. On a trailing
twelve months basis, unit gross profit has increased 31% to $4.77 per ton, while unit cash gross profit has
increased 21% to $6.02 per ton.
For the quarter, our Aggregates segment gross profit flow-through rate was strong. Freight-adjusted revenues
increased $56.4 million, while gross profit for the segment increased $46.7 million. Incremental gross profit was
83% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues. Because quarterly results can vary significantly due to
seasonality and other factors, we encourage investors to also consider longer-term trends. On a trailing twelve
months same-store basis, this flow-through rate has consistently exceeded our stated goal of 60% beginning in
the first quarter of 2014.
Asphalt Mix segment gross profit was $30.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $21.1 million in the
prior year. This year-over-year improvement was due to solid sales and operating disciplines as well as
effective materials margin management. Total volumes increased 1% and pricing was flat versus the prior year.
Large-project delays negatively impacted volumes in the quarter, including in California.
Concrete segment gross profit was $6.1 million compared to  $4.9 million in the prior year’s second quarter.
Sales volumes increased 1% versus the prior year, with weather negatively impacting our concrete operations
in Virginia and Maryland. Unit margins, as measured by gross profit per cubic yard delivered, were well ahead
of the prior year period.
Our Calcium segment reported gross profit of $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016,  in-line with the prior
year.
SAG expenses increased $13.5 million versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase resulted primarily
from certain compensation-related charges during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the significant
improvement in our business performance and stock price, and investments to enhance our sales initiatives. For
the year, SAG expense should approximate $310 million and continue to decline as a percentage of total
revenues.
Gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared to $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2015.
During the second quarter of 2016, we settled 17 of 22 business interruption claims related to the 2010 Gulf
Coast oil spill, resulting in a gain of $11.0 million.
We recorded $0.9 million and $5.2 million of losses on impairment of long-lived assets for the second quarters
of 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we wrote off $0.9 million of nonrecoverable
project costs related to two Aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete. During
the second quarter of 2015, we did not renew an Aggregates segment lease on a land parcel in California
resulting in a $5.2 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets related to the associated reclamation
obligation.
There were no restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.3 million in the second
quarter of 2015. See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these
costs.
Other operating expense, generally consisting of various cost items not included in cost of revenues, was $6.2
million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2015.  The year-over-year
increase resulted mostly from $3.8 million of the aforementioned $4.2 million of discrete charges associated
with acquisitions and divestitures (the remainder, $0.4 million of business development costs, was charged to
SAG expense). These discrete items are composed of a pension withdrawal settlement revision ($1.5 million)
and environmental liability accruals associated with previously divested properties ($2.3 million).
Net interest expense was $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $83.7 million in 2015. The
lower interest expense is due mostly to the second quarter 2015 debt refinancing charges of $45.3 million
described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Income tax expense from continuing operations was  $54.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
$19.9 million in the second quarter of 2015.  The increase in our income tax expense resulted largely from
applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings.
Earnings from continuing operations were $0.93 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
$0.37 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.
32
Discontinued Operations — Second quarter pretax loss from discontinued operations was $4.2 million in 2016
and $2.7 million in 2015. Both periods include charges related to general and product liability costs, including
legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. For
additional details, see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
year-to-date june 30, 2016 Compared to year-to-date june 30, 2015
Total revenues for the first six months of 2016 were $1,711.6 million, up 12% from the first six months of 2015.
Shipments increased in aggregates (+9%) and ready-mixed concrete (+6%) while they were down slightly in
asphalt mix (-1%). Diesel fuel expenditures were $13.5 million lower, with most of this benefit realized in the
Aggregates segment.
Net earnings for the first six months of 2016 were $142.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $8.5
million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2015. Each period’s results were impacted by
discrete items, as follows:
§Net earnings for the  first six months of 2016 include a pretax gain of $11.0 million from business interruption
claims, pretax charges of $16.5 million associated with acquisitions and divestitures, pretax charges of $10.5
million from asset impairment losses and a $0.3 million pretax charge for restructuring
§Net earnings for the first six months of 2015 include a pretax gain of $1.0 million (net of $4.9 million of charges
associated with acquisitions and divestitures) related to the sale of real estate and businesses, a $4.1 million
pretax charge for restructuring, a $5.2 million pretax asset impairment loss, and a pretax loss on debt
purchases of $67.1 million presented as a component of interest expense (see Note 7 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements)

$     211.0
Gross profit for our Aggregates segment was $402.4 million for the first six months of 2016 versus $275.0 million
in 2015. Aggregates segment sales of $1,426.4 million were up 15% from the prior year’s first half, while
aggregates freight-adjusted revenues  of $1,101.7 million were up 17%.  First half aggregates shipments
increased 9%, or 7.0 million tons, compared to the prior year — the level of increase was muted by wet weather
and the timing of large projects in a number of our markets during the second quarter of 2016. Freight-adjusted
average sales price for aggregates increased 8%, or $0.93 per ton, versus the first half of 2015, with all major
markets realizing price improvement. First half 2016 unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) in the Aggregates
segment was down 3% versus the prior year’s first half; excluding the benefits of lower unit costs for diesel fuel,
unit costs were down 1%. Gross profit per ton increased $1.17, or 34%, from the prior year’s first half.
For the first half, our Aggregates segment gross profit flow-through was strong. Freight-adjusted revenues
increased $163.4 million, while gross profit for the segment increased $127.4 million. Thus, incremental gross
profit was 78% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues.
Asphalt Mix segment gross profit of $43.1 million was up $13.2 million from the first six months of 2015. This
improvement resulted from effective materials margin management as volume and pricing were both down 1%.
33
Concrete segment gross profit was $9.6 million for the first six months of 2016, an improvement of $3.9 million
from the prior year. This improvement resulted from increased ready-mix concrete volumes (+6%) and pricing
(+3%).
Our Calcium segment reported gross profit of $1.7 million in the first half of 2016, consistent with the prior year.
SAG expenses increased $23.2 million and 0.4 percentage points (40 basis points) as a percentage of total
revenues. The increase was due primarily to certain compensation-rated charges in 2016 as a result of the
significant improvement in our business performance and stock price, and investments to enhance our sales
initiatives.
Gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $0.9 million in the first six months of 2016
compared to $6.6 million in the first six months of 2015.
As previously discussed, during the first six months of 2016, we  recognized a gain of $11.0 million related to
business interruption claims from the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill.
We recorded $10.5 million and $5.2 million of losses on impairment of long-lived assets for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the second quarter of 2016, we wrote off $0.9 million of
nonrecoverable project costs related to two Aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to
complete. During the first quarter of 2016, we terminated a nonstrategic aggregates site lease we no longer
intended to develop resulting in a $9.6 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets. During the second
quarter of 2015, we did not renew an Aggregates segment lease on a land parcel in California resulting in a
$5.2 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets related to the associated reclamation obligation (see
Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).
Restructuring charges were $0.3 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $4.1 million in the first six
months of 2015. See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these
costs.
Other operating expense, generally consisting of various cost items not included in cost of revenues, was
$20.1 million in the first six months of 2016 versus $9.2 million in the first six months of 2015.  The year-over-
year increase resulted mostly from $15.7 million of the aforementioned $16.5 million of discrete charges
associated with acquisitions and divestitures (the remainder, $0.8 million of business development costs, was
charged to SAG expense). These discrete items are composed of charges associated with office space no
longer needed and vacated ($5.2 million), the write-off of a prepaid royalty asset resulting from a change in long-
term mining plans ($3.6 million), a property litigation settlement ($1.9 million), a pension withdrawal settlement
revision ($1.5 million) and environmental liability accruals associated with previously divested properties ($3.5
million).
Net interest expense was $67.1 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $146.1 million in 2015. The
lower interest expense is due mostly to the 2015 debt refinancing charges of $67.1 million described in Note 7
to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Income tax expense from continuing operations was  $64.0 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to
$5.8 million in the first six months of 2015.  The increase in our income tax expense resulted largely from
applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings.
Earnings from continuing operations were $1.09 per diluted share in the first six months of 2016 compared to
$0.10 per diluted share in the prior year.
Discontinued Operations — Year-to-date June pretax loss from discontinued operations was $7.2 million in
2016 and $7.7 million in 2015. Both periods include charges related to general and product liability costs,
including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals
business. For additional details, see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities and a substantial, committed bank
line of credit. Additional sources of capital include access to the capital markets, the sale of reclaimed and
surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. We believe these financial resources are
sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2016, including:
§cash contractual obligations
§capital expenditures
§debt service obligations
§dividend payments
§potential share repurchases
§potential acquisitions
We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly
managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:
§maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity
§proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single
year is low
§minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility
§opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable
Cash
Included in our June 30, 2016 cash and cash equivalents balance of $91.9 million is $57.7 million of cash held
at one of our foreign subsidiaries. All of this $57.7 million of cash relates to earnings that are indefinitely
reinvested offshore. Use of this cash is currently limited to our foreign operations.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $102.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016, $37.9
million higher than the same period of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the $134.2 million
increase in net earnings, $67.1 million of which was due to the first half 2015 charges associated with debt
purchases (see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).  Cash paid for this debt purchase is
presented as a component of financing activities.

cash from investing activities
Net cash used for investing activities was $195.9 million during the first six months of 2016, a $28.9 million
increase compared to the same period of 2015. We invested $199.8 million in our existing operations in the first
half of 2016, a $51.0 million increase compared to the prior year. Of this $199.8 million, $50.3 million was
invested in shipping capacity replacement, new site developments and other growth opportunities. Additionally,
during the first half of 2015, we acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete operations
in Arizona and New Mexico for $21.4 million.
cash from financing activities
Net cash used for financing activities in the first six months of 2016 was $98.8 million, a decrease of $134.6
million from the cash provided by financing activities in the same period of 2015. This large decrease was
primarily attributable to a $95.9 million increase in return of capital to our investors via dividends and share
repurchases. Finally, there were no proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in 2016 (compared to
$50.8 million in the first half of 2015) as only stock-only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) remained
outstanding at the beginning of the year.

Line of credit
In June 2015, we cancelled our secured $500.0 million line of credit and entered into an unsecured $750.0
million line of credit (incurring $2.6 million of transaction fees).  The expanded borrowing capacity is a part of the
refinancing plans disclosed at our February 25, 2015 Investor Day (the 2015 refinancing plans). Borrowings at
June 30, 2016 are consistent with the 2015 refinancing plans and are intended to remain outstanding going
forward.
The line of credit agreement expires in June 2020 and contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
customary for an unsecured facility (none of which materially impact our ability to execute our strategic,
operating and financial plans). The financial covenants are: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of 3.5:1, and
(2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense of 3.0:1. As of June 30, 2016, we were in
compliance with the line of credit covenants.

Borrowings and other cost ranges and details are described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements. As of June 30, 2016, the credit margin for London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) borrowings was
1.25%, the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 0.25%, and the commitment fee for the unused amount
was 0.15%.
As of June 30, 2016, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $475.2 million. Utilization of
the borrowing capacity was as follows:
§$235.0 million was borrowed
§$39.8 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit
TERM DEBT
All of our  term debt is unsecured.  All such debt, other than the $0.5 million of other notes, is governed by two,
essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant
in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt.  As of
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the term debt covenants.
In March, April and August of 2015, we completed the refinancing of $485.1 million principal amount of debt as
described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. And, in December 2015 we refinanced
at maturity the $150.0 million of 10.125% notes via borrowings on our line of credit. These refinancing actions
were consistent with the aforementioned 2015 refinancing plans and had the following benefits, among others:
(1) eliminated $621.1 million of debt maturities in 2015 – 2018, (2) extended the weighted-average life of our
debt portfolio, and (3) lowered our weighted-average interest rate.
The 2015 refinancing actions resulted in charges totaling $67.1 million. Such charges are detailed in Note 7 to
the condensed consolidated financial statements and are presented in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the six month period
ended June 30, 2015.
CURRENT MATURITIES of long-term debt
The  $0.1 million of current maturities of long-term debt as of June 30, 2016 includes all long-term debt  that we
intend to pay within twelve months, as described above, and is due as follows:

Cash Contractual Obligations
Our obligation to make future payments under contracts is presented in our most recent Annual Report on Form
10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A
summary of these policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 (Form 10-K).
We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience,
current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and
evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for
our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the
accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ
from these estimates.
We believe that the accounting policies described in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” section of our Form 10-K require the most significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30,
2016.
new Accounting standards
For a discussion of the accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption and the effect such
accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note 17 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
MARKET RISK
We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of
business. In order to manage these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not
enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
As discussed in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section of Part I, Item 2, we actively manage our capital
structure and resources to balance the cost of capital and financial risk. Such activity includes balancing the
cost and risk of interest expense. In addition to floating-rate borrowings under our line of credit, we at times
utilize interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt.
While floating-rate debt exposes us to rising interest rates, it is typically cheaper than issuing fixed-rate debt at
any point in time but can become more expensive than previously issued fixed-rate debt. However, a rising
interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results. Since 2002, our EBITDA and
Operating income are positively correlated to floating interest rates (as measured by 3-month LIBOR). As such,
our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates, and floating-rate debt serves as a natural hedge
against weaker operating results due to general economic weakness.
At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt including current maturities was $2,272.3 million
compared to a book value of $1,982.7 million. The estimated fair value was determined by averaging several
asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair
value estimate is based on information available as of the balance sheet date. The effect of a decline in interest
rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our debt by $111.8 million.
We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds and the expected
return on plan assets. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other
postretirement benefits costs is discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ITEM 4
controls and procedures
disclosure controls and procedures
We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d - 15(e)), include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30,
2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
No material changes were made during the second quarter of 2016 to our internal controls over financial
reporting, nor have there been other factors that materially affect these controls.

risk factors
In March 2016, two (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) of our three credit ratings were upgraded to investment-grade.
Our current ratings make us less dependent on the noninvestment-grade debt market (which is more volatile
than the investment-grade debt market).  There were no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in
Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
