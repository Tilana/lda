approximately 60% and attributable nickel resources by over 200% to 1.8 million tonnes
Commenting  on  the  results,  Colin  Steyn,  President  and  CEO  of  LionOre,  said  “I am pleased to report a 
36% increase  in  net  profit  for  the  year  to  $78.2 million on increased  net  mineral  sales  of  36%  to  $338.2 
million.  Cash  flow  from  operations  at  $161.7  million  was  up  130%  year-over-year.    Increased 
production  combined  with  strong  commodity  prices  have  delivered  superior  results,  despite  some  cost 
increases  due  to  the  impact  of  unusually  high  rainfall  at  Tati,  higher  diesel  prices,  strong  producer 
currencies and price participation.
Looking  forward,  LionOre  has  an  exciting  year  ahead  in  2005. Organic growth  at  our  operations  and 
the  addition  of  the  MPI  assets,  as  well  as  a  50%  interest  in  the  Nkomati  nickel  mine  will  produce 
immediate earnings growth in the short term and a platform for solid growth in the long term.”

LionOre  will  host  a  teleconference  and  webcast  on  Wednesday  March  16th,  2005,  at  9:00am EST.

Corporate Highlights 
 
MPI Transaction 
The  successful  takeover  bid  for  MPI  Mines  Ltd (MPI) closed on December 22, 2004. LionOre received 
acceptances  amounting  to  94.8%  of  MPI’s  outstanding  shares  and  moved  to  compulsorily  acquire  the 
remaining  shares,  a  process  completed  on  February  7,  2005.    Cash  compensation  paid  amounted  to 
A$129.5  million,  with  94.8%  of  the  total  cash  being  paid  on  January  7,  2005  and  the  remaining  5.2% 
paid on February 7, 2005.  
 
To  satisfy  the  share  compensation  component,  LionOre  issued  20.6  million  new  common  shares  on 
January  7,  2005  and  1.1  million  new  common  shares  on  February  7,  2005.  MPI is now a 100%-owned 
subsidiary  of  LionOre.  MPI’s  nickel  assets,  which  include  the  Black  Swan  nickel  operations  and  the 
Honeymoon  Well  nickel  sulphide  deposit,  are  held  in  MPI’s  80%-owned  subsidiary,  MPI  Nickel,  with 
US-based OM Group owning the remaining 20%. 
 
The  Honeymoon  Well  deposit  contains  an  Indicated  Resource  of  131,500,000  tonnes  at  0.8%  nickel 
for approximately 1 million tonnes of contained nickel. 
 
Nkomati Transaction 
On  February  2,  2005,  LionOre  announced  the  acquisition  of  a  50%  share  in  the  Nkomati  nickel  mine  in 
South  Africa  from  African  Rainbow  Minerals  (ARM).    Consideration  of  $28.5  million  will  be  paid  on 
the  close  of  the  transaction,  with  a  further  $20.0  million  to  be  paid  if  LionOre  and  ARM  agree  to 
proceed  with  the  expansion  project  at  the  significantly  larger,  lower  grade  disseminated  ore  body.  The 
effective date of this transaction is January 1, 2005. 
The  Nkomati  orebody  contains  an  Indicated  Resource  of  139,000,000  tonnes  at  0.49%  nickel  for 
approximately 700,000 tonnes of contained nickel.
These  two  transactions  will  increase  LionOre’s  near  term  nickel  production  by  approximately  60%  and 
nickel resources by 200%, from 555,000 tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes of contained nickel.
Activox® 
Following  the  success  of  the  demonstration  phase  of  the  Activox®  Hydrometallurgical  Plant  at  Tati 
Nickel  in  Botswana,  local  management  has  decided  to  maintain  the  plant  at  a  full  operational  level 
throughout  2005.    During  the  trial  phase,  the  plant  achieved  nickel  extractions  of  up  to  98%  against  a 
target  of  96%,  while  copper  extractions  were  considerably  above  target,  achieving  up  to  90%.  The 
quality  of  nickel  and  copper  cathode  consistently  graded  above  99.9%  and  99.99%  respectively.    The 
2005  campaign  (Phase  1),  will  focus  on  stable  continuous  operating  conditions,  fine-tuning  the 
metallurgical performance, testing materials of construction and ongoing training of personnel. 
 
 
Financial Review 
 
•  Working capital was $154.8 million at December 31, 2004, (2003: $67.0 million).  
•  Subsequent  to  year  end,  the  cash  portion  of  the  cost  of  the  MPI  acquisition  in  the  amount  of  $101.1 
million  was  paid  to  MPI  shareholders  and  financed  by  a  short-term  loan  facility  with  a  major 
Australian bank.
Operational Review 
 
Tati Nickel (85%-owned) Botswana 
 
•  Production  levels  in  the  fourth  quarter  were  adversely  affected  by  abnormally  heavy  rainfall  over  a 
36-hour  period  at  the  beginning  of  December.    As  a  consequence,  the  higher  grade  base  of  the 
Phoenix pit could not be mined, resulting in lower than planned production and higher cash costs
•  4th  quarter  sales  of  payable  nickel  were  3,899  tonnes  (Q4  2003:    3,360  tonnes),  this  included  all 
leaving  no  finished 
concentrates 
concentrates  on-hand  at  year  end.  The  scheduled  BCL  shutdown  also  adversely  effected  Tati’s 
efficiencies and costs during 2004.

•  4th  quarter  production  of  2,332  tonnes  of  payable  nickel  at  a  cash  cost  of  $2.93  per  pound  (2003:
3,370 tonnes at a cash cost of $2.52 per pound) reflected the above factors.
•  Annual  production  was  11,446  tonnes  (2003:  11,509  tonnes)  of  payable  nickel  at  a  cash  cost  of
$2.60 per pound (2003: $2.37 per pound).
Lake Johnston (100%-owned), Australia 
 
•  4th  quarter  production  was  1,771  tonnes  of  payable  nickel  at  a  cash  cost  of  $2.95  per  pound (2003:
1,878 tonnes at a cash cost of $2.60 per pound).
•  Annual  production  was  7,706 tonnes (2003: 7,145 tonnes) of payable nickel at a cash cost of $2.58
per pound (2003: $2.23 per pound).
•  Sales  of  payable  nickel  during  the  fourth  quarter  were  2,060  tonnes  (2003:  3,796  tonnes).    In  the 
previous  year,  fourth  quarter  sales  included  concentrate  produced,  but  not  sold  in  the  third  quarter, 
due to the Inco strike.
•  Plant  upgrade  at  Emily  Ann  to  500,000tpa  was  completed  in  December  with  the  installation  of  a
second ball mill.
Thunderbox (100%-owned), Australia 
•  4th  quarter  gold  production  was  42,636  ounces  at  a  cash  cost  of  $301  per  ounce  (2003:  39,498, 
$213  per  ounce).    Costs  were  pushed  higher  by  the  increase  in  commodities  costs,  specifically 
diesel fuel, and the strong Australian dollar.
•  Construction  of  a  gas  pipeline  to  site  and  the  subsequent  conversion  of  the  power  station  from
diesel to duel fuel will result in a reduction in energy costs from the second quarter 2005.
•  Annual  gold  production  was  156,916  ounces  at  a  cash  cost  of  $265  per  ounce  (2003:  212,459 
ounces  at  a  cash  cost  of  $138  per ounce).  LionOre’s share of production was 60% prior to October 
30, 2003, when Dalrymple was acquired, increasing LionOre’s ownership to 100%.
•  The  initial  stage  of  an  oxygen  injection  process  was  commissioned  in  December  resulting  in
increased plant recovery.
Exploration - Botswana 
 
Exploration  activities  in  the  fourth  quarter  concentrated  on  drill  data  compilation  and  resource 
estimation  work  for  the  drilling  completed  during  the  year  to  the  south  of  the  pit.    The  preparation  of 
an  updated  drill-hole  database  was  completed  in  the  first  half  of  the  quarter,  and  subsequently 
submitted  to  the  resource  consultants  for  joint  estimation  work  with  Tati  Nickel’s  geologists.    LionOre 
expects the results of this work to be published in the 2004 Annual Report. 
 
A  further  campaign  of  diamond  drilling  to  evaluate  the  potential  continuity  of  vein-hosted  economic 
mineralization  at  depth,  below  the  vertical  limits  of  the  current  open  pit,  commenced  early  in  the  fourth 
quarter.    This  evaluation  is  being  carried  out  at  a  drill  support  spacing  that  will  provide  resource 
category information for mine life planning scenarios. 
 
Exploration will resume at Selkirk mine with a view to securing additional nickel units. 
 
Exploration – Australia 
 
A  decision  to  develop  the  Waterloo  deposit  as  an  exploration  decline,  that  will  also  yield  production 
tonnage, will be taken shortly. 
 
LionOre  entered  into  an  agreement  to  earn  60%  of  the  nickel  rights  in  a  700  square  kilometer  tenement 
package  held  by  Jackson  Gold  and  Placer  Dome  in  the  Kalgoorlie  and  Kanowna  district.    This  area 
covers  highly  prospective  ground  along  strike  from  LionOre’s  recently  acquired  Black  Swan  nickel 
operations,  which  has  not  previously  been  effectively  explored  for  nickel  owing  to  its  long  term 
ownership by gold companies.
ABOUT LIONORE:
