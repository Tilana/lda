Forward-looking statements 
This presentation contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding: trends in
commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand for commodities; plans, strategies and
objectives of management; closure or divestment of certain operations or facilities (including
associated costs); anticipated production or construction commencement dates; capital costs and
scheduling; operating costs and shortages of materials and skilled employees; anticipated
productive lives of projects, mines and facilities; provisions and contingent liabilities; tax and
regulatory developments. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as ‘intend’, ‘aim’,
‘project’, ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘plan’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘will’, ‘continue’,
‘annualised’ or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations concerning the
results of operations or financial condition, or provide other forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the
statements contained in this presentation. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on
forward-looking statements. 
For example, future revenues from our operations, projects or mines described in this
presentation will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum
produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially
adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the
expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing operations. 
Other factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or
production output and anticipated lives of operations, mines or facilities include our ability to
profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable
markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals,
petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in some of the countries
where we are exploring or developing these projects, facilities or mines, including increases in
taxes, changes in environmental and other regulations and political uncertainty; labour unrest;
and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP Billiton’s filings with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F)
which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any
obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future
performance. 
Non-IFRS financial information 
BHP Billiton results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
including Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA which are used to measure segment
performance. This release may also include certain non-IFRS and other financial measures
including Adjusted effective tax rate, Free cash flow, Gearing ratio, Net debt, Net operating
assets, Underlying attributable profit, Underlying basic (loss)/earnings per share, Underlying
EBIT margin and Underlying EBITDA margin. These measures are used internally by
management to assess the performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of our
resources and assess operational management. Non-IFRS and other financial measures have
not been subject to audit or review and should not be considered as an indication of or
alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity. 
Presentation of data 
Unless specified otherwise: all data is presented on a continuing operations basis to exclude the
contribution from assets that were demerged with South32; references to Underlying EBITDA
margin exclude third party trading activities; data from subsidiaries is shown on a 100 per cent
basis and data from equity accounted investments and other operations is shown on a
proportionate consolidation basis. Queensland Coal comprises the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi
Alliance (BMA) asset, jointly operated with Mitsubishi, and the BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal (BMC)
asset, operated by BHP Billiton. Numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals
provided due to rounding. 
No offer of securities 
Nothing in this presentation should be construed as either an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
offer to buy or sell BHP Billiton securities in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a
recommendation or advice by BHP Billiton. 
Reliance on third party information 
The views expressed in this presentation contain information that has been derived from publicly
available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is
made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This presentation should

Financial impact of Samarco dam failure 
Investment in Samarco written down to US$nil at 
31 December 2015 
US$1.2 billion provision at 30 June 2016 reflects uncertainty around potential restart 
- equivalent to 50% share of current estimate of Samarco’s funding obligations under terms of
Framework Agreement 
- US$134 million funding support to Foundation’s reparatory and compensatory programs will be
offset against provision 
Direct costs incurred by BHP Billiton1 of US$70 million 
Samarco financial support made available for remediation and stabilisation work and to support
operations 
- short-term funding facility of US$116 million for restart and working capital will be released only
as required - safe restart is an important priority, along with the restructure of Samarco’s debt

We remain positive on long-term copper fundamentals 
Short-term overcapacity in copper remains persistent 
Subdued demand with slower than expected growth in China and recession in key non-Asian
emerging economies 
Increased supply from new and expanded operations with more growth expected near term 
Long-term fundamentals are sound 
Demand growth will continue as China transitions to a consumer-driven economy, and copper-
intensive renewable energy capacity and electric vehicles grow rapidly 
Emerging markets will recover and converge to their natural intensity curves 
Grade decline and mine depletions will require investment in new supply 
Global demand slow recently, but long run trend is still positive

Oil and US gas markets expected to rebalance 
Outlook remains healthy 
Fundamentals tightening, as healthy demand growth intersects with slower global production
growth due to falling production in the US 
Rate of inventory drawdown will impact price recovery - OPEC and US production remain key
watch points 
Higher prices will be required to induce the new supply needed to offset natural field decline and
meet growing demand 
Near-term US natural gas prices driven by storage and weather; long-term market supported by
robust demand growth 
Mild winter, industry-wide productivity gains and resilient supply resulted in record inventory
levels 
Inventories forecast to return to average levels by end CY16 on strong demand growth and
declining production 
While investment in new supply sources will be required, the abundant lower-cost supply will
moderate price inflation

Iron ore demand outlook remains modest 
Chinese and global steel growth to slow 
Global steel production is likely to grow modestly in the future 
China’s steel demand growth to become more cyclical as it moves past the inflection point on its
intensity curve 
As China slows, global steel demand growth will mostly come from emerging economies,
primarily India and Southeast Asia 
Low-cost iron ore to continue to displace higher cost supply 
Supply growth will continue to outweigh demand growth in coming years 
Lower costs through productivity is likely to remain a long-term feature

Metallurgical coal outlook supported by growing demand 
for high-quality product 
Demand improvement to be moderate, supply slowly adjusting 
Cost curve has flattened 
Lower prices are leading to closures and reduced investment 
The world continues to require steel and metallurgical coal is essential for pig iron production 
China expected to continue to import seaborne metallurgical coal – demand supported by
coastal market access and requirement for consistent, quality product in larger blast furnaces –
encouraging signs following domestic coal supply reforms 
Robust outlook underpinned by scarcity of high-quality resources and demand growth in
emerging economies – particularly in India where we expect strong steel production growth

Energy coal expected to remain an important part of the 
global energy complex 
Markets expected to remain oversupplied in the near term 
China’s demand for imports is likely to fall further as domestic overcapacity persists, however
coal supply reforms encouraging 
More supply rationalisation is required to balance the market 
Coal’s share of the fuel mix will decline but total volume will grow due to cost competitiveness in
Asia 
Absolute demand expected to increase by 10-15% by the mid-2020s, despite a declining share
in the global electricity generation fuel mix 
India and South East Asia have 26% of the world’s population, but still account for only 13% of
global electricity generation – low-cost energy coal is expected to be a preferred fuel source 
Additional seaborne supply required to meet expected demand
