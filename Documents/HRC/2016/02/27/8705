<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report contains a comprehensive account of communications sent to 
Governments between 16 March 2009 and 15 March 2010, along with replies received 
between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2010. It also contains responses received to 
communications that were sent in earlier years. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications and replies 
</b></p>
<p>2. Along with fuller reproductions or summaries of correspondence, this report 
summarizes the correspondence regarding each communication under four headings for 
ease of reference. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Violation alleged 
</b></p>
<p>3. Violations are classified into the following categories: 
</p>
<p>(a). Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions relating 
to the imposition of capital punishment (&#8220;Death penalty safeguards&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(b). Death threats and fear of imminent extrajudicial executions by State officials, 
paramilitary groups, or groups cooperating with or tolerated by the Government, as 
well as unidentified persons who may be linked to the categories mentioned above 
and when the Government is failing to take appropriate protection measures (&#8220;Death 
threats&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(c). Deaths in custody owing to torture, neglect, or the use of force, or fear of 
death in custody due to life-threatening conditions of detention (&#8220;Deaths in 
custody&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(d)  Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials or persons acting 
in direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is inconsistent 
with the criteria of absolute necessity and proportionality (&#8220;Excessive force&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(e). Deaths due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or 
tolerated by the State (&#8220;Attacks or killings&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(f). Violations of the right to life during armed conflicts, especially of the civilian 
population and other non-combatants, contrary to international humanitarian law 
(&#8220;Violations of right to life in armed conflict&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(g). Expulsion, refoulement, or return of persons to a country or a place where 
their lives are in danger (&#8220;Expulsion&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>(h). Impunity, compensation and the rights of victims (&#8220;Impunity&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>The short versions contained in parentheses are used in the tabulation of 
communications. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Subject(s) of appeal 
</b></p>
<p>4. The subjects of appeal are classified in accordance with paragraph 6 of Commission 
of Human Rights resolution 2004/37 and paragraph 5 (b) of General Assembly resolution 
61/173. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Character of replies received 
</b></p>
<p>5. The replies received have been classified according to the following five categories 
designed to assist the Commission in its task of evaluating the effectiveness of the mandate: 
</p>
<p>(a). &#8220;Largely satisfactory response&#8221; denotes a reply that is responsive to the 
allegations and that substantially clarifies the facts. It does not, however, imply that 
the action taken necessarily complies with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>(b) &#8220;Cooperative but incomplete response&#8221; denotes a reply that provides some 
clarification of the allegations but that contains limited factual substantiation or that 
fails to address some issues. 
</p>
<p>(c) &#8220;Allegations rejected but without adequate substantiation&#8221; denotes a reply 
denying the allegations but which is not supported by documentation or analysis that 
can be considered satisfactory under the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>(d) &#8220;Receipt acknowledged&#8221; denotes a reply acknowledging that the communication 
was received but without providing any substantive information. 
</p>
<p>(e) &#8220;No response&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>6. There are two minor, additional characterizations: (i) Where a response has been 
received but has not yet been translated by the United Nations, the response is characterized 
simply as &#8220;Translation awaited&#8221;; (ii) Where a response has not been received from the 
Government but less than 90 days has elapsed since the communication was sent, that fact 
is indicated by characterizing the response as: &#8220;No response (recent communication)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. In order to underscore the importance of the dialogue between the Special 
Rapporteur and Governments and to avoid any appearance that the principal goal is the 
exchange of correspondence for its own sake, this report contains brief comments by the 
Special Rapporteur on the extent to which he considers each reply to have responded 
adequately to the concerns arising under the mandate. An indication is also provided in 
instances in which additional information is required to respond effectively to the 
information received.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Tabulation of communications and replies 
</b></p>
<p>8. To provide an overview of the activities of the mandate in the past year, this report 
also includes a table that contains the following information by country. </p>

<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Deaths due to the attacks or killings by security forces of the State, or by 
paramilitary groups, death squads or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by 
the State 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 6 males 
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: No response </p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur:</b> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Afghanistan has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given 
by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 17 July 2009</b>, sent with Working Group on the use of mercenaries 
as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of people to 
self-determination. 
</p>
<p>13. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning reports of a shooting incident that 
occurred on 29 June 2009, between armed Afghan Special Guards (also referred to by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>14  
</b></p>
<p>local population as &#8220;Afghan Special Forces&#8221;) and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the 
Attorney General&#8217;s office in Kandahar, Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>14. While the precise identity and chain of command of the Afghan Special Guards is 
unclear, according to information received, it is an Afghan private entity operating as a 
security company.  Information received indicates that it may be working with, or led by, 
American Special Forces in Afghanistan, or armed international intelligence services. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 29 June 2009, at 11.45 am a shoot out erupted between Afghan Special 
Guards and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the Attorney General&#8217;s office in 
Kandahar.  
</p>
<p> It is alleged that the Afghan Special Guards went to the Attorney General&#8217;s 
office to forcefully and unconditionally demand the release of a suspect, who had 
been arrested by the ANP in connection with a criminal offence for theft of a motor 
vehicle.  
</p>
<p> The Attorney General, Mr. Hafizullah Khaliqya, reportedly refused to release 
the suspect on the grounds that it would be illegal and unconstitutional.  He also 
advised the Afghan Special Guards that the arrested suspect will have to be charged 
for the offence as required in law. The Attorney General then reportedly called the 
Chief of Police (B.G. Matiullah Khan Qateh) and the Chief of Crime (Col. Abdul 
Khalik) for assistance.  Both the Chief of Police and the Chief of Crime arrived at 
the scene accompanied by their body guards. Then, it is alleged that an argument 
erupted inside the Attorney General's office and that the Afghan Special Guards 
opened fire and killed the Chief of Police, the Chief of Crime and four other ANP 
officers. There are unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p> According to police reports, 41 suspects have been arrested in connection 
with the incident and await charge before the court in Kabul. In addition, it was also 
reported that six ANP sustained gun wound injuries and were admitted at Mirwais 
provincial hospital for treatment.  
</p>
<p>15. Without expressing at this stage any opinion on the facts of the case, we would like 
to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention its concern regarding the allegation 
referred to above and would welcome detailed information on the following questions:  
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate, including 
regarding the individuals and institutions involved? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details on the Afghan Special Guards involved in the 
shooting, and whether it is a private military and security company, and if so, whether it is 
registered in accordance with the Afghan procedure for regulating activities of private 
security companies in Afghanistan. Please also specify whether its personnel and weapons 
are registered with the Afghan authorities.  Please specify the regulations that are in place 
to ensure the accountability of these Afghan Special Guards.  If the force is a private 
company, which Governments or organizations does it contract its services to?   
</p>
<p> 3. If the Afghan Special Guards involved in the shooting are not members of a 
private security company, please provide information on what authority, if any, they 
operate under, or what command structure, if any, they report to.      
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation which may have been carried out in relation to this event.  Please also indicate 
what steps are being taken to ensure that the alleged perpetrators of the shooting are 
investigated, tried, and convicted.  </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed 
response provided by the Government of Bangladesh.   
</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 26 January 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers.  
</p>
<p>16. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the death sentences imposed on 
Messrs. Syed Farooq-ur Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM 
Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Bazlul Huda, five men found guilty of the murder of Prime 
Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members on 15 August 1975. It is our 
understanding that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh was scheduled to review the death 
sentences on 24 January 2010, and if confirmed, the men will be at imminent risk of 
execution.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 15 August 1975, army officers entered the residence of the then Prime 
Minister of Bangladesh, H.E. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and killed him, his wife, 
sons, a brother and a number of other individuals staying at the residence that night. 
Only his two daughters, who were abroad at the time, survived the killing.  
</p>
<p> In 1978 the then President of Bangladesh signed the Indemnity Ordinance, 
which gave immunity from prosecution to those involved in the killing of H.E. 
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Immunity Ordinance was revoked only in 1996 and 
prosecutions for the murders were launched. 
</p>
<p> On 12 July 1996, Mr. Bazlul Huda was arrested in Thailand upon request of 
the Government of Bangladesh. He was still in detention in Thailand when the trial 
against him and the other men accused of the murder of H.E. Sheikh Mujibur 
Rahman took place in Dhaka. At the trial, Mr. Huda was represented by a 
Government-appointed lawyer. (The information submitted to us does not clarify 
how many others of the defendants were tried in absentia). 
</p>
<p> On 8 November 1998, the court in Dhaka sentenced 15 defendants to death, 
including Messrs. Syed Farooq-ur Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, 
Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Bazlul Huda. Mr. Huda was 
extradited to Bangladesh on the same day.  
</p>
<p> The defendants appealed to the High Court. On 30 April 2001, the High 
Court delivered its judgment, upholding the death sentence for 12 of the 15 
defendants, including the five defendants named above. Messrs. Syed Farooq-ur 
Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM Mohiuddin 
Ahmed, and Bazlul Huda appealed their sentence to the Supreme Court, which 
granted leave to appeal in 2007. By judgment of 19 November 2009, the Supreme 
Court upheld the five death sentences. On 3 January 2010, warrants for the 
execution (&#8220;death warrants&#8221;) of the five defendants were issued. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>16  
</b></p>
<p> The rejection of the appeals by the Supreme Court left two remedies open to 
the defendants: a further review by the Supreme Court and petitions for clemency to 
the President of Bangladesh, known as &#8220;mercy petitions&#8221;. The Supreme Court 
review was scheduled to take place on 24 January 2010.  
</p>
<p> On 7 January 2010, Messrs. Huda, Mohiuddin Ahmed, and AKM Mohiuddin 
Ahmed filed their mercy petitions. As of 21 January 2010, Messrs. Syed Farooq-ur 
Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan had not yet requested clemency.  
</p>
<p> Before the Supreme Court review was concluded, representatives of the 
authorities announced that preparations for the execution of the five men had begun 
and that the prisoners would be executed by the first week of February. The Minister 
of State of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. Qamrul 
Islam, for instance, told the media on 19 November 2009 that &#8220;the five condemned 
will be executed in January&#8221;. According to media reports, on 19 January 2010, the 
President considered and rejected the mercy petitions of Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM 
Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Bazlul Huda.  
</p>
<p> Throughout the years, the judicial proceedings in this case were accompanied 
by considerable pressure from supporters of the current Prime Minister of 
Bangladesh, who is the daughter of H.E. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In several 
instances, when the judges in the case made statements or took decisions they 
disagreed with, the supporters of the Prime Minister took part in violent riots. 
</p>
<p>17. Without in any way prejudging the accuracy of the information summarized above, 
we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to some principles of 
international law applicable to this case. We would in the first place respectfully remind 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment cases the obligation to observe 
rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Bangladesh is a party, admits of no 
exception.  
</p>
<p>18. In expounding on the fundamental right to a fair hearing, the UN Human Rights 
Committee, the independent expert body monitoring the implementation of the Covenant 
by States Parties and thus its most authoritative interpreter, has observed that  
</p>
<p>19. &#8220;[f]airness of proceedings entails the absence of any direct or indirect influence, 
pressure or intimidation or intrusion from whatever side and for whatever motive. A 
hearing is not fair if, for instance, the defendant in criminal proceedings is faced with the 
expression of a hostile attitude from the public or support for one party in the courtroom 
that is tolerated by the court, thereby impinging on the right to defence, or is exposed to 
other manifestations of hostility with similar effects.&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 25).  
</p>
<p>20. In writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government about this case, we are fully conscious 
that a crime of such heinous nature and profound political impact as the murder of Prime 
Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family will nearly inevitably result in tensions 
surrounding the trial of the persons accused of it. Under such circumstances, the need for 
the other branches of Government to live up to their obligation to protect the independence 
of the judiciary from &#8220;improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, 
direct or indirect, from any quarter&#8221; (see the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of 
the Judiciary, particularly Principles 1 and 2), and thereby to ensure the right to a fair trial, 
becomes all the more pressing.  
</p>
<p>21. Article 6(2) of the Covenant guarantees to &#8220;[e]veryone charged with a criminal 
offence &#8230; the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.&#8221; In this 
respect, the UN Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]t is a duty for all public 
authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial, e.g. by abstaining from making </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>public statements affirming the guilt of the accused.&#8221; Statements by senior Government 
representatives discussing the execution of the defendants before the judicial proceedings 
have come to a conclusion, such as those reportedly made by the Minister of State of the 
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, risk to be seen as prejudging the 
outcome of the trial and as influencing the judicial process. 
</p>
<p>22. With specific regard to the defendants tried and sentenced to death in absentia, 
including Mr. Huda, we would further recall that the minimum guarantees of the right to a 
fair trial include the right to be &#8220;tried in [one&#8217;s] presence, and to defend [one]self in person 
or through legal assistance of [one&#8217;s] own choosing&#8221; (article 14(3)(d) of the Covenant). In 
this regard, we are concerned that Mr. Huda may have been tried in Dhaka in absentia and 
represented by Government-appointed lawyers while he already was in detention in 
Thailand awaiting extradition upon request of your Excellency&#8217;s Government. We are also 
concerned that following his extradition to Bangladesh he may not have been allowed to 
present evidence to his discharge which was not considered at the in absentia trial. 
</p>
<p>23. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights of Messrs. Syed Farooq-ur Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, 
Mohiuddin Ahmed, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Bazlul Huda under international law, in 
particular the right to the most scrupulous observation of due process in death penalty 
cases, are respected.  
</p>
<p>24. In the circumstances of this case, considering the 35 years expired since the 
commission of the crime and the inevitable difficulty of providing a fair hearing to the 
defendants, we would attach the highest importance to the granting of clemency. In this 
respect, article 6(4) of the Covenant expressly provides that &#8220;[a]mnesty, pardon or 
commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>25. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please indicate the specific circumstances under which Mr. Huda and the 
other defendants were tried in absentia. Please indicate the measures taken to ensure in 
subsequent proceedings that the defendants tried in absentia were able to exercise fully their 
right to a fair trial.  
</p>
<p> 3. Assuming the information summarized above is accurate in this respect, 
please explain why the mercy petitions of three of the defendants were rejected before the 
Supreme Court review of their cases had concluded. Why were the warrants for the 
execution (&#8220;death warrants&#8221;) of the five defendants issued on 3 January 2010, before the 
Supreme Court review scheduled for 24 January 2010? 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government of Bangladesh dated 5 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Permanent Mission has duly forwarded the contents of the communication to 
the competent authorities in Bangladesh. However this mission is honored to proved the 
following preliminary response awaiting a more detailed one from the capital on this long 
standing justice issue:  
</p>
<p>27. On 15 August 1975, the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 
was brutally killed, along with eighteen members of his family. In addition, twelve civilians 
and a policeman also lost their lives in this heinous act. Bangabandhu&#8217;s two daughters- 
Sheikh Hasina, current prime minister of the country and Sheikh Rehana survived as they 
were abroad at that time. The government which took over after the assassinations, granted </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>18  
</b></p>
<p>indemnity to all the self-confessed killers from the prosecution and offered them foreign 
assignments. Enjoying such impunity, many of the killers went to public claiming at home 
and abroad, with the print as well as in electronic media, that they orchestrated the heinous 
killings. It remained as a dark spot in the history of the nation for a long time. Due legal 
processes could commence only in 1996.  During the intervening years, except for a brief 
period, the country was under unconstitutional rule with military and quasi-military 
governments in power.  
</p>
<p>28. The first information report (FIR) was filed on 2 October 1996, by Mr. A.F.M. 
Mohitul Islam with the Dhanmondi Police Station. On 12 November 1996, the Parliament 
repealed the indemnity Ordinance of 1975, removing legal obstacle in holding the trial.  
</p>
<p>29. Following proper investigations, submission of charge sheet, and framing of 
charges, the trial court completed its first proceedings on 8 November 1998, pronouncing 
death sentences to 15 of the accused and acquitting four others.  
</p>
<p>30. The hearing of the death reference started in the high court on 28 June 2000, about 
20 months after the verdict of the trial court and was completed on 30 April 2001. Judges 
embarrassment in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court further delayed completion 
of the trial of the case. No hearing took place during the term of the previous government 
(2001-2006) for one reason or another.  
</p>
<p>31. A five member special bench began hearing of the regular appeal after the Grand-
Alliance formed the government following the elections of 29 December 2008. The hearing 
started on 5 October 2009. After 29 days of hearing, the Appellate Division of the Supreme 
Court delivered the final verdict on 19 November 2009. On 17 December 2009, all five of 
the Bench signed the final verdict.  
</p>
<p>32. Death warrants were issued against Syed Faruk Rahman, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul 
Huda, A.K.M Mohiuddin abd Sultan Sharriar Rashid Khan on 3 January 2010. All five 
death-row convicts submitted separate review petitions and a special four member bench of 
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, headed by chief Justice Md. Tafazzul Islam, 
dismissed the review petitions on 27 January 2010. Clemency pleas were rejected by the 
Honorable President as well. The five convicted killers were executed past midnight of 27 
January 2010, in accordance with the final verdict.  
</p>
<p>33. The trial of this high profile case conducted in an transparent manner in an open, 
regular court. The process was open to the public, judicial and constitutional scrutiny. Penal 
provisions and Jail Code were followed throughout the process. Extreme caution was taken 
in each step to uphold due process of law.  
</p>
<p>34. It took four years for justice to be served. In this case justice was delayed but not 
denied. Even though the process of trying the killers has been long and arduous, it has 
fulfilled the demands of the law. The verdict has ended impunity and reaffirmed the rule of 
law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Bangladesh dated 23 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has made three specific queries regarding the murder case of 
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  The queries are as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the alleged facts in the summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Under what circumstances Mr Huda and others accused were tried in 
absentia? What are measures taken to ensure in subsequent proceedings that the 
accuseds tried in absentia were able to exercise fully their right to fair trial  
</p>
<p>3. Why the mercy petitions of the three convicts were rejected before the review 
applications in the Appellate Division (Supreme Court) had concluded? Why were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the warrants for execution (death warrant) of five convicts issued on 3 January 2010, 
before the Supreme Court review scheduled for 24 January 2010? 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply to Question No. 1  
</b></p>
<p>36. The facts alleged in the necessary are not comprehensive. In order to assess the 
whole events, there are also some important facts which do deserve consideration.  
</p>
<p>37. After the killing of  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members 
including his wife, three sons, two daughters in law, one brother and Col. Jamil, S.I 
Siddiqur Rahman, Sepoy Shamsul Hossain in the fateful night of August 15, 1975, 
Indemnity Ordinance 1975 was promulgated on 26.09.1975 with a view to protect the 
killers from being tried for the murder. No one was dared to initiate any proceedings 
against the killers in the adverse situation and it was not also possible to take legal action 
against the killers.  
</p>
<p>38. After establishment of democratic government on 14.11.1996 Indemnity Repeal Act 
1996 was enacted and the Indemnity Ordinance 1975 was repealed. The convict Shahriar 
Rashid Khan and mother of convict Faruque Rahman challenged the validity of indemnity 
Repeal Act 1996 by filing writ petitions in the High Court Division and the writ petitions 
were dismissed. They filed appeal in the Appellate Division (Supreme Court) against the 
dismissal of their petitions and the Appellate Division after a full and lengthy hearing 
dismissed the appeal in declaring the indemnity Repeal Act 1996 is a valid law.  
</p>
<p>39. The instant criminal case was initiated by lodging First Information Report (FIR) 
with Dhanmondi Police Station on 02.10.1996 and the investigating agency investigated the 
case and submitted charge sheets (recommendations for trial) against 20 alive accused who 
were found involved in the killing. Out of 20 accuseds, one accused Jubaida Rashid was 
discharged by the High Court Division on an application filed by her. And finally 19 
accuseds were put on trial in the court sessions Judge, Dhaka and charges under section 
301/34 of the Penal Code (for committing murders in furtherance of common intention) 
302/120B of the Penal Code (criminal conspiracy for murder) and 201 of the Penal Code 
(for screening out evidence) and in support of the charges 61 witnesses were examined by 
defense counsel on behalf of the accuseds who were present and also by the state defence 
lawyers engaged for the absconding accused. After examining the witnesses and hearing the 
defense and as well as the arguments learned serious convicted 15 accused under section 
302/34 and 302/120B of the Penal Code and sentenced them to death by his judgment and 
order dated 08.11.1998. The hearing in the Court of Session Judge took place for 151 days.  
</p>
<p>40. In compliance of law, the case was submitted before the High Court Division for 
confirmation of death sentences and 4 convicts namely Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, 
Bazlul Huda, Sayed Farook Rahman, Muhiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) filed separate appeals 
against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Sessions 
Judge. The Death reference and connected appeals were taken up for hearing in a Division 
Bench of the High Court Division, and Honorable Senior Judge of the Division Bench after 
hearing confirmed the death sentence of 10 convicts and acquitted the other 5 but the other 
Honorable Judge confirmed the death sentences of all 15 accuseds. Hearing in the Division 
Bench continued for 63 days. Thereafter as per law the matter was placed before a 3rd Judge 
and Honorable 3rd Judge after hearing the parties for 25 days confirmed the death sentence 
of 12 convicts and acquitted 3 convicts.  
</p>
<p>41. The convicts (1) Sayed Farook Rahman (2) Sultan Shariar Rashid Khan (3) A.K.M. 
Muhiuddin (Lancer) (4) Muhiuddin Artillery (5) Bazlul Huda filed five separate petition for 
leave to appeal in the Appellate Division. A.K.M. Muhiddin though was absconding during 
trial and at the stage of appeal in the High Court Division, he was deported to Bangladesh 
on 18.02.2007 from U.S.A and all the leave petitions were heard together and leave was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>20  
</b></p>
<p>granted on 23.09.2007 after hearing the cases for 26 days. Even petition for leave to appeal 
of A.K.M. Muhiddin was time barred, he was granted leave.  
</p>
<p>42. Thereafter five separate appeals were taken up for hearing in the Appellate Division 
in a bench of 5 Judges. They heard the parties for 29 days and all the Judges dismissed the 
appeals in upholding the conviction and death sentences on 19.11.2009.  
</p>
<p>43. After dismissing the appeals in the Appellate Division the trial court issued 
execution warrant on 03.01.2010 and in the meantime five convicts filed 5 separate review 
petitions and review petitions were heard on 25.01.2010 to 26.01.2010 and the review 
petitions were dismissed on 27.01.2010 and sentences were executed on 28.01.2010 at 
midnight.  
</p>
<p>44. In holding trial all the procedure have meticulously been followed. The accuseds 
who were present have been defended by the counsel of their own choice and the 
absconding accuseds were defended by the state engaged state defense lawyers, trial was 
held in the court of Sessions Judge under general law and no special law were enacted nor 
any Special Sessions was set up for trial. It is relevant here to mention that convicts Sayed 
Farook Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Muhiuddin (Artillery) made confession 
admitting their guilt. The case was started on 02.10.1996 and ended on 19.11.2009 by the 
judgment and order of the Appellate Division dismissing all the appeals. So all the legal 
processes are being followed in holding trial and the defence also got all the opportunity to 
make their defence. No illegality or irregularity has been done in the trial and hearing of the 
appeals in the High Court Division as well as in the Appellate Division.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply to Question No. 2 
</b></p>
<p>45. In our law there is a provision (section 339B of the Code of Criminal Procedure) of 
holding trial in absentia. Section 339B of the Code of Criminal Procedure is quoted here 
</p>
<p>46. <i>&#8220;339B. Trial in absentia- (1)  Where after the compliance with the requirements of

complained of shall, recording its decision so to do, try such person in his absence.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p>47. It says for in absentia trial compliance of provision of section 87 and 88 of the 
criminal is necessary Section 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are as follows:  
</p>
<p><i>87. Proclamation of a person absconding:-

that the requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the 
proclamation was published on such day. 
</i></p>
<p><i>88. Attachment of property of person absconding: 
</i></p>
<p><i>(1) The Court issuing a proclamation under section 87 may at any time order the 
attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the

liable to attachment under this section, the claim or objection shall be inquired into, 
and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part:Provided that any claim

<p><i>(6B) Claims or objections under sub-section (6A) may be preferred or made in the 
Court by which the order of attachment is issued or, if the claim or objection is in

by an order under sub-section (6A) may, within a period of one year from the date of 
such order, institute a suit to establish the right which he claims in respect of the

conclusive.  
(6E) If the proclaimed person appears within the time specified in the 
proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from the

</i></p>
<p><i>(7) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the 
proclamation, the property under attachment shall be at the disposal of the

natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the 
owner, in either of which cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks 
fit. 
</i></p>
<p>48. After compliance of section 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if an 
accused is found to be absconding and concealing himself so he can not be arrested and 
produced for trial and there is no immediate prospect of arresting him a  notification in the 
news paper notifying him to appear before the court is necessary.  
</p>
<p>49. In the case of Mr. Huda and other absconding accused were found absconding ( they 
having had the full knowledge of he case were hiding and keeping themselves away from 
the process of the court) and the court prior to commencement of trial complied the 
provision of above quoted law and only thereafter their cases was taken up for trial.  
</p>
<p>50. In our criminal administration of justice, a criminal trial commences with the 
framing charge and prior to framing charge as per provision of rule 1 chapter XII of the 
Legal Remembrancers Manual, state defence lawyers were engaged for the absconding 
accused and the accused who were present engaged their lawyer by their own choice. The 
engaged lawyers both by the accuseds themselves and state defence lawyers cross 
examined the witnesses extensively and argued the case for the defence.  
</p>
<p>51. After conviction by the trial court when the death reference and appeals were heard 
in the High Court Division, state defence lawyers were also appointed for the absconding 
accuseds and they and as well as the defence lawyer appeared for he convicts defended </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>their respective accuseds.  And point for determination is also same against all. The accused 
who were present were defended by renowned lawyers having reputation in the legal field 
along with state defence lawyers and the accuseds were given all the facilities to ensure a 
fair trial.  
</p>
<p>52. In the case of Mr. Huda, who was brought back to Bangladesh and produced before 
the court on 08.11.1998 after pronouncement of judgement he was sent to fail [sic]. 
Thereafter he filed appeal in the High Court Division and his appeal was heard and 
dismissed. Then he filed petition for leave to appeal and leave was granted and his appeal 
was heard and dismissed. In the Appellate Division the case of Mr. Huda and other 
appellants were considered in the light of evidence and materials on record and after 
assessment of entire evidence the Appellate Division dismissed his appeal.  
</p>
<p>53. Though Mr. Huda was absconding during trial of the case he was defended by a 
lawyer and his lawyer engaged by his choice defended him in the appeals and there is no 
doubt that his right of fair trial has been ensured and exercised by him.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply to Question No. 3  
</b></p>
<p>54. When a death sentence is passed, it shall not be executed till it is confirmed by the 
High Court Division. The court which passes the sentence shall submit the proceeding 
before the High Court Division for confirmation. The relevant provision is Section 374 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure which says 
</p>
<p><i>374. Sentence of death to be submitted by Court of Session: - When the Court of 
Session passes sentence of death, the proceedings shall be submitted to the High 
Court Division and the sentence shall not be executed unless it is confirmed by the 
High Court Division. 
</i></p>
<p>55. And when the sentence is confirmed by the High Court Division, the court which 
passes the sentence on receiving the order of the High Court Division causes such order to 
be carried into effect and issues execution warrant. This is guided by the provision of 
section 381 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 381 says,  
</p>
<p><i>381. Execution of order passed under section 376:- When a sentence of death passed 
by a Court of Session is submitted to the High Court Division for confirmation, such 
Court of Session shall, on receiving the order of confirmation or other order of the 
High Court Division thereon, cause such order to be carried into effect by issuing a 
warrant or taking such other steps as may be necessary. 
</i></p>
<p>56. In the instant case, sentence of death against 15 convicts was passed by the trial 
court on 08.11.1998. High Court Division confirmed the death sentence against 12 on 
30.04.2001. The court could have issued the execution warrant after confirmation of 
sentence by the High Court Division but as the convicts obtained an order of stay from the 
Appellate Division, the trial court did not issue the same. The Appellate Division dismissed 
the appeal of five convicts on 19.11.2009 and also vacated the order of stay. After dismissal 
of the appeal and vacating the order of stay there remains no legal bar to issue execution 
warrant and trial court issued the execution warrant only after receiving the judgement and 
order of the Appellate Division.  
</p>
<p>57. In our criminal procedure, there is no provision for review of judgement passed by a 
criminal court. The appellate division in exercising constitutional power may review of its 
judgement and review only lies only on a point of law if there is an error of law appears or 
on the face of record.  
</p>
<p>58. Here convict Bazlul Huda and A.K.M Muhiuddin filed review petition on 
10.01.2010. Convict Shahriar Rashid Khan filed review petititon on 17.01.2010 and 
convicts Sayed Farooque Rahman and Muhiuddin Ahmed (Artillery) filed review petitions </p>

<p><b>24  
</b></p>
<p>on 19.01.2010. All the review petitions were dismissed. While review petitions were 
pending there was no stay order against executions of sentence.  
</p>
<p>59. The trial court on receiving the judgement and order of the Appellate Division 
passed in appeals of 5 convicts issues execution warrant on 03.01.2010. Rule 991 of Jail 
Code says that execution of death sentence will be carried into effect between 21 to 28 days 
after receiving the execution warrant. The jail Authority received the execution warrant on 
03.01.2010 and as per rule jail authority fixed the date for execution on 28.01.2010 which is 
within the time framed under the above stated rule. There is no violation of any law or rule 
in carrying out the execution. The only limitation in execution is if any petition for special 
leave to appeal is pending before the Supreme Court, the execution shall not be held but in 
the present case the appeals were dismissed earlier on 19.11.2010 [sic]. The jail authority 
having received the certificate given by the lawyers of the condemned convicts intimating 
filing of review petition, even though there was no stay order from court abstained from 
carrying the execution. And execution was carried into effect only after dismissing the 
review petition 
</p>
<p>60. Three convicts filed review petitions and also filed review mercy petitions to the 
president. The president when receives a mercy petition, it is his prerogative to allow or 
reject it and it is always seen and disposed of expeditiously, filing of review petition does 
not create any legal bar from exercising the prerogative by the president and therefore the 
three convicts filed the mercy petition even though they had review petitions. The president 
after giving due consideration and in following the law and practice rejected the mercy 
petitions.  
</p>
<p>61. The execution warrant was issued only after receiving the order of the Appellate 
Division on 03.01.2010, when the execution warrant was issued there was no review 
petition and there was no stay order. The trial court in view of above noted provision of 
section 381 of the code is under an obligation to issue such warrant. The trial court has not 
violated any law or rule in issuing the execution warrant on 03.01.2010.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 5 March 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>62. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
attention information we have received about the alleged attacks on Jumma villages, in 
Rangamati and Khagrachari districts, Chittagong Hill Tracts, which have resulted in 
numerous dead and injured, as well as in hundreds of people displaced. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 19 February 2010, Bangladesh army personnel of the Baghaihat zone 
army camp and Bengali settlers, launched attacks against indigenous peoples in 14 
indigenous villages in Sajek Union, in Rangamati district, Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
Bengali settlers, allegedly backed by the Bangladesh army, burnt down over 200 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>houses of the indigenous Jumma villagers. Several shops and one Buddhist temple 
were also burnt to the ground, and homes have been looted. 
</p>
<p> On 20 February, military personnel reportedly opened fire into a crowd of 
indigenous villagers. According to the information received, six Jumma villagers 
were killed and at least 25 Jumma villagers were injured in the attacks. Further, 1500 
indigenous peoples have been displaced as a result of the attacks. The displaced 
indigenous villagers whose houses have been burnt have not been provided any 
assistance from Government authorities, and many people are currently living in the 
jungles with no shelter.  
</p>
<p> On 23 February, in Khagrachari district, Chittagong Hill Tracts, houses and 
shops belonging to indigenous peoples were burned down by Bangali settlers, 
reportedly in the presence of military personnel. 
</p>
<p> It is reported that the Bangladesh army personnel had prohibited independent 
observers including human rights activists and journalists from accessing the 
villages where the attacks occurred.  
</p>
<p> Jumma people have been living in the area for decades, and have 
continuously protested the Bengali settlement on their land. In January 2010, 
Bengali settlers, with the support of the army, resumed expansion of their 
settlements into Jumma lands within the Sajek area, Rangamati district, thereby 
escalating already existing tensions.  
</p>
<p> These events follow similar events from 20 April 2008, during which a group 
of Bengali settlers allegedly attacked several indigenous Jumma villages, injuring 
people and burning down more than 70 houses, reportedly with no effective 
intervention by the Bangladesh authorities. According to the information received, 
since the incidents in 2008, tensions in the area have remained high and the 
indigenous residents have feared additional attacks by military personnel and 
settlers.  
</p>
<p>63. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations we would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law in relation to the concerns raised. We would like to like to stress that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government has the obligation under the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to ensure that every individual has the right to life and security 
of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (article 6). Further as expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the 
Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;) law enforcement 
officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of 
force (Basic Principles, Principle 4). Whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law 
enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence, minimize injury, and respect human life (Basic Principles, Principle 5) and 
intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to 
protect life (Basic Principles, Principle 9).  
</p>
<p>64. We would also like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
recommendations made by the Human Rights Council at its eleventh session of the 
universal periodic review for Bangladesh to address the problems of extrajudicial killings 
and torture by security forces, to take steps to address the culture of impunity for human 
rights violations by law enforcement agencies, to adopt further measures to fight impunity 
for human rights violations, including by law enforcement officials and  to fight impunity 
and hold all officers and persons acting on their behalf accountable for acts of torture and 
harassment of civilians (paras. 20 and 26, Report of the working group on the universal 
periodic review, A/HRC/1118).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>26  
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions has argued in detail in his report 
presented to the General Assembly at its sixty first session that force should not normally 
be the first resort: so far as the circumstances permit, law enforcement officials should 
attempt to resolve situations through non-violent means. As a first step, officials should 
attempt to &#8220;restrain or apprehend the suspected offender&#8221; Without using force that carries a 
high risk of death &#8212; perhaps by physically seizing the suspect. If the use of firearms does 
prove necessary, law enforcement officials should &#8220;give a clear warning of their intent to 
use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would 
unduly place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious 
harm to other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances 
of the incident&#8221; (A/61/311, paras 41- 45). 
</p>
<p>66. We would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s attention that your Government has a 
duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish all violations of the right to life.  The 
investigation of such cases &#8220;shall be thorough, prompt and impartial. &#8230; The purpose of the 
investigation shall be to determine the cause, manner and time of death, the person 
responsible, and any pattern or practice which may have brought about that death.&#8221; 
(Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions, &#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;). Further 
Principle 17 (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) provides that &#8220;[a] written report 
shall be made within a reasonable period of time on the methods and findings of such 
investigations. The report shall be made public immediately and shall include the scope of 
the inquiry, procedures and methods used to evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and 
recommendations based on findings of fact and on applicable law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>67. In addition, we note that this situation follows up on a letter sent to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government by the former Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Professor Rodolfo Stavenhagen. On 
3 April 2008, the former Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food, sent a letter to the Government of Bangladesh to 
call its attention to information received concerning the alleged ongoing illegal seizure of 
the traditional lands of Jumma indigenous communities in Barbadan, Khagrachari and 
Merung districts, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
</p>
<p>68. While we appreciate your Government&#8217;s letter of 12 March 2009, in which the 
Government reiterated its full support and cooperation with the mandate and work of the 
Special Rapporteur and to other human rights special procedures, and assured that the 
contents of the communication were duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities 
in Bangladesh for necessary inquiry and actions, we note that we have still not received the 
full substantive response to the 3 April 2008 letter, almost two years later. 
</p>
<p>69. Further, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 
September 2007. In particular we refer to the following provisions: 
</p>
<p><i>Article 10 
</i></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No 
relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the 
indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation 
and, where possible, with the option of return. 
</p>
<p><i>Article 26(1) 
</i></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they 
have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p><i>Article 26(3) 
</i></p>
<p>States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and 
resources. Such recognition shall be conducted with due respect to the customs, 
traditions and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p><i>Article 32(2) 
</i></p>
<p>States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples 
concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free 
and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or 
territories and other resources [... ]. 
</p>
<p>70. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the 
rights and freedoms of the Jumma villagers are respected, and that the accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations, including military personnel, is ensured. We also 
request that your Government adopt immediate and effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>71. Further, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention, with a view towards 
engaging in a possible future constructive dialogue with your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 
this matter. We would be grateful for your cooperation and comments on the following: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to the alleged killings. If no inquiries have taken place, 
or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken; and where none have been 
undertaken please explain why. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions 
been imposed on the alleged perpetrators?  
</p>
<p>4. Please indicate what measures are being undertaken to discourage the use of 
excessive force and to eliminate the number of fatal shootings occasioned by law 
enforcement officials. 
</p>
<p>5. What measures have been taken to ensure the immediate security and safety 
of the alleged victims, including food, water and shelter, for all women, men and 
children who have been left homeless because of the arson attacks? 
</p>
<p>6. What steps has the Government taken, or intends to take, to prevent the 
expansion of Bangali settlers into Jumma villages? 
</p>
<p>7. Does your Government have a plan and timeline to implement the Chittagong 
Hill Tracts Accord? In this connection, what steps have been taken to fairly resolve 
all outstanding land disputes in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in accordance with the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord? What steps have been taken to demilitarize the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts area, in accordance with the Accord? </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>:  The Government of Belarus replied to the 
communication below on 18 December 2010.  The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response but unfortunately had not received a translation of it from the relevant services at 
the time this report was finalized.  He is unable, therefore, to make observations, and 
expects they will be included in the next report.  However, a copy of the original response 
letter is available online at the following address: 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/docs/Belarus_18.12.09_6.2009.pdf. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 13 October 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>72. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the reportedly imminent execution 
of Mr. Vasily Yusepchuk.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Vasily Yusepchuk was sentenced to death for murder on 29 June 2009 by 
the Brest Regional Court. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal on 2 October 2009. 
Mr. Yusepchuk has until 12 October 2009 to apply for clemency.  
</p>
<p> Reports indicate that in Belarus, prisoners are given no prior notification that 
they are about to be executed. In accordance with prevailing practice, prisoners are 
informed in the presence of the director of the detention facility, the prosecutor and 
one other Ministry of Interior employee that their appeal for clemency has been 
denied and that the death sentence will be carried out. They are then reportedly 
immediately taken to a room, where they are forced to their knees and shot in the 
back of the head with a pistol. Their families are not informed of the rejection of the 
clemency petition and not given the opportunity for a last visit to the prisoner. They 
are informed days or sometimes weeks later that the execution has taken place. The 
body of the executed prisoner is not handed over to the family and the place of 
burial is not disclosed to them.  
</p>
<p>73. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to 
recall that such secrecy in post-conviction proceedings in capital cases has been found to 
violate international legal obligations, in particular articles 6(2) and 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Belarus is a party. Article 6(2) enshrines 
the principle that, &#8220;[i]n countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the death 
sentence may only be imposed &#8220;not contrary to the [other] provisions of the &#8230; Covenant&#8221;, 
which include the due process guarantees of article 14(1) of the Covenant. Article 7 
provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>74. As found in a report to the Human Rights Council on Transparency and the 
imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3), &#8220;[r]efusing to provide convicted 
persons and family members advance notice of the date and time of execution is a clear 
human rights violation.&#8221; The practice of informing prisoners of their impending execution </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>only moments before they die, and families only later, is &#8220;inhuman and degrading and 
undermine[s] the procedural safeguards surrounding the right to life.&#8221; (para. 32). 
</p>
<p>75. In the case of <i>Banderenko v Belarus</i> (28 April 2003, CCPR/C/77/D/886/1999) the 
Human Rights Committee found that the lack of transparency described above put the 
mother of a condemned prisoner in a state of anguish and mental stress amounting to 
inhuman treatment in violation of article 7 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee 
observed that &#8220;[c]omplete secrecy surrounding the date of execution, and the place of burial 
and the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing 
families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress. The 
Committee considers that the authorities&#8217; initial failure to notify the [mother of the convict] 
of the scheduled date for the execution of her son, and their subsequent persistent failure to 
notify her of the location of her son&#8217;s grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the [mother 
of the convict], in violation of article 7 of the Covenant.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>76. The Committee called upon Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to prevent similar 
violations in the future. Similar observations were made in the case of <i>Lyashkevish v 
Belarus</i> (Communication No. 887/1999 para 9.2).  
</p>
<p>77. We would therefore respectfully call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that Vasily Yusepchuk&#8217;s right to due process in post-conviction 
proceedings, his right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment, as well as 
his and his family&#8217;s privacy rights are fully respected. A refusal to provide Vasily 
Yusepchuk, his family and lawyer with timely and reliable information on the timing of any 
planned execution is highly likely to lead to violations of due process rights. 
</p>
<p>78. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged above accurate?  If not so, please provide all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</p>
<p>2. Please explain the steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure 
that the due process rights of Vasily Yusepchuk and his right not to be subjected to 
inhuman and degrading treatment continue to be protected 
</p>
<p>3. Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Belarus 
to bring its practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital 
punishment, into line with the principles set forth in my report on Transparency and 
the imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3).

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Belarus, and notes that, as the Government states, the 
execution of Mr. Zhuk had not taken place at the time of the Government&#8217;s response.  
However, he regrets that, despite the detail the Government provided with respect to other 
aspects of its death penalty procedures, the Government&#8217;s response did not address the 
concern specifically raised in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter, namely that prisoners are 
given no prior notification that they are about to be executed.  As the Government is aware, </p>

</b></p>
<p>the Human Rights Committee has twice found that the Government&#8217;s secrecy with respect 
to notification of execution violates Article 7 of the ICCPR.  The Special Rapporteur looks 
forward to the Government&#8217;s response to the specific issue of secrecy in post-conviction 
proceedings, and to the Government&#8217;s explanation of the steps taken to ensure that Mr. 
Zhuk&#8217;s due process rights and his right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading

</p>
<p> As we indicated in our recent communication to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government of 13 October 2009 regarding the case of Vasily Yusepchuk, our 
concerns focus on reports we have received with respect to an alleged lack of 
transparency in the proceedings following Supreme Court confirmation of a death 
sentence in Belarus. The reports received allege that:  
</p>
<p> In Belarus, prisoners are given no prior notification that they are about to be 
executed. In accordance with prevailing practice, prisoners are informed in the

<p><b>  Response of the Government of Belarus dated 18 December 2009 (translated from 
Russian) 
</b></p>
<p>86. Information from Belarus in response to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; note regarding the 
death sentence handed down to Mr. A.S. Zhuk 
</p>
<p>87. In connection with the enquiry made by Special Rapporteurs Mr. P. Alston and Mr. 
M. Nowak on the death sentence handed down to Mr. A.S. Zhuk, the Belorusian authorities 
wish to respond as follows: 
</p>
<p> 1. The convicted party, Mr. Andrei Sergeevich Zhuk, a citizen of Belarus, was 
born in 1983 in the village of Skovshin in the Soligorsk district of Minsk Region, was 
divorced, unemployed, had completed specialized secondary education and was living in 
building 4, flat 4, Komsomol Street, Soligorsk, in Minsk Region. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>32  
</b></p>
<p> Prior convictions: in 2005, he was sentenced to six months&#8217; punitive deduction of 
earnings, with the State receiving 10 per cent of his income, and in 2006 he was sentenced 
to four months and five days&#8217; deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk was convicted by the Minsk Regional Court on 17 July 2009 under article 
139, paragraph 2 (1), 2 (12) and 2 (15); article 205, paragraph 2; article 207, paragraph 3; 
article 294, paragraph 3; and article 328, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code of Belarus, and 
sentenced to the ultimate sanction of the law &#8211; the death penalty with confiscation of 
property. 
</p>
<p> On 27 October 2009 the criminal division of the Supreme Court of Belarus issued a 
decision confirming the sentence handed down to Mr. Zhuk by the criminal division of the 
Minsk Regional Court on 17 July 2009, and his cassational appeal was denied. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk received a written copy of that decision in prison (5 November 2009). The 
manner in which an appeal for clemency should be formulated was explained to him. 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to article 174, paragraph 2 (1), of the Penal Enforcement Code, Mr. Zhuk 
as the convicted party submitted an appeal for clemency on 13 November 2009, which was 
transmitted on the same day to the Presidential Pardons Commission. 
</p>
<p> Until that appeal is considered by the President, Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s sentence will be 
suspended pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Regulations on granting clemency for convicts 
and on reducing the criminal responsibility of persons cooperating in uncovering crime and 
in mitigating its effects. 
</p>
<p> 2. Mr. Zhuk has been found guilty of committing a series of crimes. 
</p>
<p> Between 15 January and 23 February 2009 he and convict I.S. Sorokin broke into 
number 31 Sadovaya Street in the village of Zazhevichi in the Soligorsk district of Minsk 
Region, where they stole an IZ-12 hunting shotgun, 30 cartridges, a cartridge belt and a 
hunting knife belonging to Mr. N.I. Dubovski, resulting in a loss of property worth 239,800 
Belarusian roubles (around 85 US dollars). 
</p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk used the hunting gun to make a sawn-off shotgun. 
</p>
<p> On 27 February 2009 at about 7.30 p.m., with the assistance of convict Mr. V.N. 
Moroz, Mr. Zhuk and Mr. Sorokin carried out an armed assault on Mr. G.A. Zubets and 
Ms. S.N. Laptsueva, staff of the agricultural production cooperative Bolshevik-Agro, in the 
village of Krivichi, in the Soligorsk district of Minsk Region, and absconded with the 
cooperative&#8217;s payroll funds in a Chevrolet Niva car with car plate number 78-44 AX-5. 
</p>
<p> During the armed assault, Mr. Zhuk, with the help of Mr. Sorokin, who held the 
victims down, killed Mr. Zubets, shooting him in the head with the sawn-off shotgun, and 
Ms. Laptsueva with two shots, one to the shoulder and one to the head. After killing their 
victims, they took 62,468,810 Belarusian roubles in large bills (around US$ 26,000) and 
fled to Slutsk, where they divided the money between them. 
</p>
<p> On his arrest on 1 March 2009, Mr. Zhuk was in possession of narcotics: 0.7 ml of 
methadone, equal to 0.001 grams of dry substance, which he had purchased for personal 
use. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s guilt for the crimes for which he has been convicted is proven by the 
case file and is supported by all the evidence, which was appropriately investigated, 
evaluated and taken into consideration by the court during sentencing. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk pleaded guilty on all counts and confirmed that he had killed Mr. Zubets 
and Ms. Laptsueva with shots to the head using the sawn-off shotgun. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p> Mr. Zhuk, Mr. Sorokin and Mr. Moroz fled to the town of Slutsk, where they 
divided the money between them. Mr. Zhuk and Mr. Sorokin received 22 million roubles 
each, and Mr. Moroz received 16 million roubles. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Sorokin, as a defendant, gave a similar statement and confirmed that Mr. Zhuk 
shot the victims dead with a sawn-off shotgun. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Moroz, as a defendant, confirmed that on 27 February 2009 he had assisted Mr. 
Zhuk and Mr. Sorokin in an armed assault on the staff of the agricultural production 
cooperative Bolshevik-Agro who were carrying the payroll money. 
</p>
<p> Searches of the accused persons&#8217; homes conducted on 1 March 2009 resulted in the 
discovery and seizure of the following sums of money: 
</p>
<p> In Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s possession &#8211; 15,950,000 roubles; 
</p>
<p> In Mr. Moroz&#8217;s possession &#8211; 11,302,200 roubles; 
</p>
<p> In Mr. Sorokin&#8217;s possession &#8211; 17,400,000 roubles, in bank packaging bearing the 
name of the open joint stock company Belagroprombank, dated 27 February 2009 and with 
the reference number MFO 153001917. 
</p>
<p> Bank worker Mr. S.A. Tyabus has testified as a witness, confirming that on 27 
February 2009 money in such packets had been given to Ms. Laptsueva, who was killed by 
Mr. Zhuk during the armed assault. 
</p>
<p> The court conducted a thorough psychological assessment of Mr. Zhuk. 
</p>
<p> The forensic psychologists concluded that the accused, Mr. Zhuk, was and remains 
of sound mind. 
</p>
<p> At the time the crime was committed he was not manifesting any signs of temporary 
psychological disorder, and the court considered him to be fully aware of his criminal 
conduct. 
</p>
<p> In carrying out multiple killings, Mr. Zhuk was fulfilling the role allocated to him as 
part of a criminal plan. His actions constitute criminal behaviour in all respects. 
</p>
<p> Since Mr. Zhuk as accused had two prior convictions for wilful commission of 
crimes, and as he once again wilfully committed a criminal offence, the court had sound 
grounds to conclude that the accused was a recidivist under article 43, paragraph 1, of the 
Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> When sentencing Mr. Zhuk, the court of first instance proceeded on the basis of 
individualization of the penalty, taking into account the nature and degree of public danger 
of the crimes committed, Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s role in those crimes, the motives and aims of the 
criminal conduct, information about his personality, the nature of the harm inflicted, and 
extenuating and aggravating circumstances. 
</p>
<p> The court considered Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s open remorse for committing the crimes, his active 
assistance in their disclosure by helping to locate evidence and the weapons used in the 
crime, his partial redress of the wrong done, and the fact that he has a young child as 
extenuating circumstances. 
</p>
<p> The court, however, also noted the fact that Mr. Zhuk committed a crime, wilfully 
taking the lives of two people, among the aggravating circumstances, which also included 
the fact that he was under the influence of alcohol when the crime was committed. 
</p>
<p> As the organizer of and most active participant in the crimes, Mr. Zhuk acted in cold 
blood and in a particularly insidious manner when committing them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>34  
</b></p>
<p> Taking into account the particularly dangerous nature of the crimes Mr. Zhuk 
committed and the exceptional danger he poses to society, the court was justified in 
handing down the highest possible sentence &#8211; the death penalty. 
</p>
<p> In handing down this type of sentence, the court took account of the provisions of 
Part III, article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> The Supreme Court of Belarus considers the sentence to be fair and in line with the 
degree of danger to society posed by the crimes committed and the information regarding 
the defendant&#8217;s personality. 
</p>
<p> There is no doubt about the legality and grounds for the sentence handed down to 
Mr. Zhuk. 
</p>
<p> 3. Belarus recognizes the supremacy of the universally accepted principles of 
international law and ensures its legislation is in line with those principles (article 8 of the 
Constitution). 
</p>
<p> Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter, 
&#8220;the Covenant&#8221;), which Belarus has ratified, provides, inter alia, that every human being 
has the inalienable right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his life. In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, a 
sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the 
law in force at the time of the commission of the crime. Anyone sentenced to death shall 
have the right to seek a pardon or commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or 
commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases. Article 6 of the Covenant 
stipulates, however, that, &#8220;Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay or to prevent the 
abolition of capital punishment by any State Party to the present Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to article 24 of the Constitution, each person shall have the right to life. 
The death penalty, until it is abolished, may be used in accordance with the law as the 
ultimate sanction for particularly serious crimes, and only by sentence of a court. 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to article 59, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code, the death penalty 
(shooting) may be applied as the ultimate sanction for certain particularly serious crimes 
involving premeditated deprivation of life among the aggravating circumstances (until such 
time as the death penalty is abolished). 
</p>
<p> In accordance with the provisions of article 174 of the Penal Enforcement Code, 
after the sentence has entered into force, persons sentenced to death have the following 
rights: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To submit, in the established legal order, a petition for clemency 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To have consultations with a lawyer and any persons with the right to provide legal 
assistance, without restrictions to length and number 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To receive and send letters without restrictions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To have one short meeting per month with close relatives 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To receive one parcel or delivery every three months, in accordance with the 
regulations set by the prison administration 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To obtain over the course of a month, food products by cashless settlement, and 
other essential items by cash from their personal accounts, including by postal order, 
in an amount set for persons held in high security prisons 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To officialize, in accordance with the law, the necessary civil and legal and marital 
and family relationships </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; To meet with members of the clergy 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To receive essential medical care 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to the provisions of article 175 of the Penal Enforcement Code, when a 
death sentence comes into force it is carried out upon receipt of an official communication 
certifying that complaints submitted in accordance with supervisory procedures and 
petitions for clemency have been denied. The death penalty is carried out in private, by 
shooting. A death penalty is carried out in the presence of the procurator, a representative of 
the facility in which the sentence is being implemented and a physician. The prison 
administration is obliged to inform the court that handed down the sentence that it has been 
carried out, and the court notifies a member of the sentenced person&#8217;s immediate family. 
</p>
<p> Respect for the law in force in Belarus when the death sentence is carried out is 
guaranteed by the presence of the procurator.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Government of China replied to the 
communication below on 2 July 2010.  The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response but 
unfortunately had not received a translation of it from the relevant services at the time this 
report was finalized.  He is unable, therefore, to make observations, and expects they will 
be included in the next report.  However, a copy of the original response letter is available 
online at the following address: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/ 
docs/Chine_21.08.09_17.2009.pdf  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 9 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>88. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the death of Mr. Phuntsok Rabgay, a 27-year-old 
monk, in Drango County, Garz&#234; Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, 
</p>
<p> On 25 March 2009, Phuntsok Rabgay was pasting leaflets containing 
allegations that monks had been tortured and imprisoned by the authorities and an 
appeal to the local population to forego crop cultivation and harvest as a gesture of 
mourning and disobedience. He was detected by Drango County Public Security 
Bureau (PSB) personnel and tried to elude arrest by fleeing on a motorcycle. The 
PSB personnel, however, managed to pursue and catch him. Upon arrest, they beat 
him with batons. He died shortly thereafter. The PSB officers reportedly dropped his 
body from a hill in order to create the appearance of a case of suicide.  
</p>
<p>89. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the rights to life and physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, particularly those in custody of State agents. These rights </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>36  
</b></p>
<p>are set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. When 
the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this 
respect we would like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a 
custodial death case (Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 
(21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2): 
</p>
<p> &#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether 
Hugo Dermit committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while 
in custody; yet, the inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the 
Uruguayan authorities either by act or by omission were responsible for not taking 
adequate measures to protect his life [&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>90. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting 
from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 
on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>91. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring 
to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to 
the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring and end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to 
justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>92. We would also like to appeal to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or 
Belief and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>93. Further, we would like to refer to the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 
63/181, which urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of 
thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this end: (a) To ensure that their constitutional 
and legislative systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion and belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the provision of 
effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief, or the right to practise freely one&#8217;s religion, including the right to change one&#8217;s 
religion or belief, is violated; (b) To ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived 
of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of religion or belief and that no one 
is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or 
arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to bring to justice all perpetrators of 
violations of these rights&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>94. We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned 
person, in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights which provides that &#8220; Everyone shall have the right to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>95. We urge your Government to carry out an inquiry into the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Phuntsok Rabgay expeditiously, impartially and transparently, also 
with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations.  
</p>
<p>96. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they 
have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p>4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the family of 
Phuntsok Rabgay.

<p><b>  China: Death sentences against Losang Gyaltse, Loyar, Gangtsu, Dawa Gangpo and

relating to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 4 males, 1 female 
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of China, and the clarification that the two deaths sentences 
imposed with a two-year reprieve will be commuted if the individuals at issue, Mr. Dawa 
Gangpo and Ms. Penkyi, each commits no other &#8220;deliberate offences&#8221; by the end of the 
reprieve period.  The Special Rapporteur would appreciate the Government keeping his 
successor informed whether the sentences are in fact commuted at the end of the reprieve 
period, and the outcomes of any appeals. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur notes that all the death sentences at issue in this 
communication appear to have been imposed for arson and not for a charge of, or 
conviction for, an offence based on an intention to kill which results in the loss of life.  As 
such, the imposition of the death penalty in these cases would not meet the &#8220;most serious 
crime&#8221; requirement under international law.   
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s explanation that defendants 
have a right to retain defence counsel of their choice and would appreciate further 
explanation of the means by which the individuals at issue in this communication were 
offered the ability to exercise that right, and the manner in which they may have chosen not 
to do so.

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 1 May 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence

</b></p>
<p>99. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the imposition of the death 
sentence on five individuals on charges related to the March 2008 riots in Lhasa, Tibet 
Autonomous Region (TAR).  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 8 April 2009, the Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in Lhasa tried 
five persons accused of setting fire to shops in Lhasa and thereby causing the death 
of seven persons.  
</p>
<p> The Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court found Mr. Losang Gyaltse guilty 
of setting fire to two clothes shops on 14 March 2008. The arson resulted in the 
death of one shop owner. 
</p>
<p> Messrs. Loyar, Gangtsu and Dawa Gangpo were found guilty of setting fire 
to a motorcycle dealership on 15 March 2008. The arson resulted in the killing of 
five people. Loyar received the death sentence, Gangtsu the death sentence with 
two-year reprieve, and Dawa Gangpo a sentence of life imprisonment.   
</p>
<p> Ms. Penkyi, aged 21 and from Norbu Village, Dogra township in Sakya 
County, was given a suspended death sentence with two-year reprieve, after being 
found guilty of setting fire to Hongyu Trousers on Qingnian road, on 14 March 
</p><p>2008. A shop owner, Zuo Rencun, died in the fire.  
</p>
<p> A spokesperson for the Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court stressed that 
during the trial the five defendants had been assisted by lawyers. Other sources, 
however, indicate that the lawyers who assisted the defendants were appointed by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government, while a group of lawyers from across the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China who had volunteered to represent Tibetans charged in connection 
with the March 2008 riots were warned not to take up such cases and allegedly even 
threatened with revocation of their license. 
</p>
<p>100. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to these cases under international law. 
</p>
<p>101. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). The reports brought to our attention indicate that, 
while the arson Losang Gyaltse, Loyar, Gangtsu and Penkyi were found guilty of did in fact 
result in loss of life, they might not have been charged with and found guilty of intentional 
killing.  
</p>
<p>102. We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment 
cases there is an obligation to provide criminal defendants with &#8220;a fair and public hearing 
before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights). Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes the right to be 
assisted by legal counsel of one&#8217;s own choosing. Principle 16 of the Basic Principles on the 
Role of Lawyers provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that lawyers &#8230; (c) shall not 
suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for 
any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics.&#8221; 
While we acknowledge that your Government reportedly provided legal counsel to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>defendants, the alleged intimidation of lawyers who volunteered to defend Tibetans 
criminally charged in relation to the incidents in March 2008 would represent a serious 
interference with the independent and fair administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>103. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as permitted under international law from a summary execution, which violates 
human rights standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights of Losang Gyaltse, Loyar, Gangtsu and Penkyi 
under international law are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not carried out unless all of the 
concerns raised are convincingly dispelled. 
</p>
<p>104. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details regarding the trials of Losang Gyaltse, Penkyi, Loyar 
and Gangtsu: which provisions of criminal law were they found guilty of having 
violated? What conduct were they charged with and found guilty of? In particular, 
what were the Court&#8217;s findings regarding the willfulness of the killing of the persons 
who died as result of arson? 
</p>
<p>3. Is it accurate that the authorities discouraged lawyers who volunteered to 
defend Tibetans charged in relation to the incidents in March 2008? Who selected 
the lawyers who defended Losang Gyaltse, Penkyi, Loyar and Gangtsu? When and 
how often did the lawyers who defended them meet with their clients ahead of the 
trials on 8 April 2009? 
</p>
<p>4.  Are the judgments rendered by the Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in 
Lhasa in the cases of Losang Gyaltse, Penkyi, Loyar and Gangtsu accessible to the 
public?  
</p>
<p>5.  Please explain the remedies open to Losang Gyaltse, Penkyi, Loyar and 
Gangtsu to challenge the sentences imposed against them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government of China dated 9 June 2009 (translated from Chinese)  
</b></p>
<p>105. Receipt is acknowledged of the joint communication No. UA G/SO 214 (3-3-13) 
G/SO 214 (33-24) CHN 11/2009 from the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Chinese Government has looked 
carefully into the matters raised in the communication and replies as below. 
</p>
<p>106. All five of the people in question, Lobsang Gyaltse, Loyar, Gangtsu, Dawa Gangpo, 
and Penkyi, from Sajia County, were principal offenders in a fatal case of arson during the 
&#8220;14 March&#8221; events. They intentionally set fire to shops, killing 11 innocent people and 
burning down 4 stores, causing destruction to lives and property, and severely undermined 
social order, public security and stability. Their acts violated article 115, paragraph 1, of the 
Criminal Law (Whoever commits arson, breaches dikes, causes explosions, spreads poison 
or causes serious injury, death or major damage to public or private property shall be liable 
to not less than 10 years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or death). 
</p>
<p>107. When trying the above cases, the court acted in accordance with the law from start 
to finish in handling the cases, conducting the trials and rendering its judgements. It applied </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>40  
</b></p>
<p>a policy of both leniency and severity, ensuring that the death penalty is applied strictly, in 
limited circumstances, and with the utmost caution. Among the above-mentioned five 
defendants, only two, Lobsang Gyaltse and Loyar, were sentenced to death. Their offences 
were extremely serious and the circumstances particularly heinous; they caused grave 
damage to society. The court might have rendered death sentences in the other cases, but 
meted out lesser punishments to the defendants who met the statutory requirements. The 
death sentences with a two-year reprieve will be commuted if, by the end of the reprieve 
period, the convicts concerned have committed no further deliberate offences. 
</p>
<p>108. China is a State governed by the rule of law. It ensures strict observance of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure in all trials of criminal offences. The above cases were tried, and the 
sentence pronounced, in public; the evidence was irrefutable. The defendants had a right to 
retain defence lawyers of their choice. The court appointed lawyers for those who did not, 
in accordance with the law. In addition, the court arranged Tibetan language interpreters for 
the defendants. The defence lawyers were able to set out their arguments in full. The 
defendants&#8217; procedural rights were fully protected and their ethnic customs and human 
dignity were respected. On investigation, it has been found that the Government did not 
prevent lawyers from defending the Tibetans who participated in the &#8220;14 March&#8221; events. 
</p>
<p>109. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, if the defendants do not accept this 
judgement they may appeal to a higher court, in this case the Tibet Autonomous Region 
High People&#8217;s Court. The law provides for a special review of death sentences and death 
sentences with a two-year reprieve which has been upheld in the second instance. 
Authorization for the execution of a death sentence must be sought from the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Court.

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 9 July 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>111. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the large number of deaths, 
casualties and mass arrests resulting from violent clashes in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous 
Region. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 5 July 2009, at least 156 people were killed and over 800 injured 
following violent clashes between Han and Uighurs during demonstrations in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.  Police have 
detained some 1,434 individuals in connection with the protests.   
</p>
<p> The exact circumstances surrounding the aforementioned events remain 
unclear.  However, the protests may have been sparked by alleged Government 
inaction following the June 2009 killing of two Uighurs by Han at a factory in 
Shaoguan, Guangdong. 
</p>
<p>112. While initial internet footage of the demonstration showed protesters marching 
peacefully through Urumqi, violent clashes later ensued between Uighur groups and Han 
groups, and resulted in mass bloodshed and destruction of property.  According to some 
reports, excessive police force may have contributed to the deaths of several protesters.   
State media has reportedly accused separatist Uighur groups, based both inside and outside 
the country, of instigating the violence. 
</p>
<p>113. According to media accounts, officials have said that the death penalty will be 
sought against those responsible for the riots.  
</p>
<p>114. During the protests mobile phone services were reportedly blocked and internet 
connections minimized, with websites and online discussion forums ordered not to publish 
any material related to the protests. Media watchdog groups and others have expressed 
concerns that media censorship during the protests may be an attempt to prevent 
independent reporting on the circumstances surrounding the demonstrations.   
</p>
<p>115. Without in any way implying any determination on the facts of the case, we would 
like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principle set forth in Article 
3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that every individual has 
the right to life and security of the person. This includes a due diligence obligation on the 
part of Your Government to protect the lives of persons within your territory and 
jurisdiction from attacks by other persons within your territory (<i>Jim&#233;nez Vaca v. Colombia</i>, 
CCPR/C/74/D/859/1999, UN Human Rights Committee, 25 March 2002, paragraph 7.3).  
</p>
<p>116. We would also like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the duty 
to thoroughly, promptly and impartially investigate killings, and to prosecute and punish all 
violations of the right to life.  As reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34, all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, 
and &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible&#8221;.  At the same time, with respect to 
reports that the death penalty will be sought against those responsible for the riots, we 
would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not 
prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and 
can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the 
most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases 
where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). 
</p>
<p>117. With respect to the allegations that the security forces were responsible for the 
killing of some protesters we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
to Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Officials, which provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, 
as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and 
firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms 
is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in 
proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) 
Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life.&#8221; (Adopted by the Eighth </p>

<p>United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990). 
</p>
<p>118. We would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the right to freedom of expression, as recognized in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without 
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and 
regardless of frontiers&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>119. We would further like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure the right to freedom of assembly and association, as recognized in 
article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone 
has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>120. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the affected persons are respected and the accountability of 
any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>121. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provided detailed information as to the exact number of people killed, 
and explain the circumstances in which each killing occurred.   
</p>
<p>3.   If there were any killings by police or security forces, please explain whether 
the use of lethal force was justified in accordance with the UN Basic Principles on 
the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, and what investigations have been 
carried out to make this determination. What were the instructions given to the 
security forces before and during the demonstrations?  
</p>
<p>4. What measures were and are being taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to protect people from the outbreak of violence? 
</p>
<p>5. What efforts have been undertaken to promptly and thoroughly investigate 
the alleged killings during the riots?  Please provide the details and results of any 
investigations, medical examinations, judicial or other inquiries that have been or 
will be initiated, including any investigation into the conduct of the security forces. 
</p>
<p>6.  Have any alleged perpetrators been detained and charged?  In the event that 
the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of any 
prosecutions that have been or will be undertaken? 
</p>
<p>7. Please provide the details on how the actions undertaken by public officials 
regarding this case are compatible with the international norms and standards of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the related right to peaceful assembly 
and association. 
</p>
<p>8. Please provide information on the legal basis upon which protesters were 
arrested and detained and how that is compatible with the international norms and

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur notes the information

the death penalty in the cases of Ms. Du Yimin and Mr. Tang Yanan does not comply with 
international law.  While there may have been serious financial crimes at issue in each of 
these cases, the offences did not involve any intentional killing and thus cannot meet the 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; requirement as it is interpreted and applied by international human 
rights bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal dated 31 August 2009 
</b></p>
<p>122. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding two cases of persons sentenced to 
death on charges of &#8220;fraudulent raising of public funds&#8221;. Ms. Du Yimin&#8217;s death sentence 
was reportedly executed on 5 August 2009, while Mr. Tang Yanan&#8217;s case is reportedly still 
pending before the Supreme People&#8217;s Court.  
</p>
<p> According to the information I have received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Tang Yanan and approximately 20 other co-defendants were reportedly 
charged with having illegally obtained, from 2004 to 2007, 970 million Yuan from 
nearly 50,000 investors. The investors were told that the funds were to be invested 
with high returns in a deer breeding centre to cull deer antlers which could be used 
in Chinese herbal medicines. On 11 December 2008, the Bozhou City Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court in Anhui province convicted Tang Yanan of &#8220;fraudulent raising of 
public funds&#8221; and sentenced him to death. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Tang Yanan appealed against the conviction. The Anhui Provincial 
People&#8217;s High Court upheld the guilty verdict on 12 August 2009. The death penalty 
is now pending for confirmation before the Supreme People&#8217;s Court.  
</p>
<p> Ms. Du Yimin, a businesswoman running beauty parlours, was found guilty 
of illegally raising approximately 700 million Yuan from hundreds of investors. The 
Hangzhou Intermediate People&#8217;s Court found her guilty of &#8220;fraudulent raising of 
public funds&#8221; and sentenced her to death in March 2008. On 13 January 2009, her 
appeal was rejected. The Supreme People&#8217;s Court confirmed the death sentence. She 
was executed on 5 August 2009. 
</p>
<p>123. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to me, I 
would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most

be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This would exclude charges of fraudulent raising 
of public funds from those for which the death penalty can be imposed under international 
law. </p>

<p><b>  Response from the Government of China dated 12 February 2010 (translated from 
Chinese)  
</b></p>
<p>126. Receipt is hereby acknowledged of joint communication No. UA G/SO 214 (33-27) 
CHN 25/2009 from the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions.  The Chinese Government has looked into the matter 
carefully and wishes to make the following reply: 
</p>
<p> 1. Case of Du Yimin, originally from Zhejiang, Board Chairman of Yicheng 
Investment Management Co., Ltd.  From 2003 to June 2006, Du Yimin invested in beauty-
parlour and cosmetics businesses which were operating at a loss, she backed out of a few 
real estate investments after they were developed, and made unsuccessful investments in 
mining ventures in Vietnam and a molybdenum mine in Qingtian county of Zhejiang 
Province.  Nevertheless, using the need for large-scale capital investments in those projects 
as a smokescreen, she falsified real-estate investment development agreement documents 
and official seals, and with high interest returns as an inducement, illegally raised 709 
million yuan renminbi from common citizens in Liandu District and Puyun County of 
Lishui City in Zhejiang Province.  In addition to partially repaying interest and principal, 
she used the income from the funds raised to purchase building properties, vehicles and 
make other lavish expenditures, and was unable to repay 128 million yuan renminbi 
outstanding at the time the case came to the attention of the authorities.  The case was tried 
in the Lishui Municipal Intermediate People's Court, which ruled that since the amount of 
Du Yimin's fraud was especially large and had entailed especially large economic losses, 
the circumstances of the commission of the crime were especially serious and the crime 
itself was extremely grave, it accordingly sentenced defendant Du Yimin to death for the 
fraudulent raising of funds, with lifetime deprivation of political rights and confiscation of 
all her personal assets.  After the sentence had been pronounced, Du appealed the ruling to 
a higher court.  In the trial of second instance, the Zhejiang Provincial Superior People's 
Court rejected the appeal and upheld the original ruling, and reported the case to the 
Supreme People's Court for review in accordance with the law.  Following its review, the 
Supreme People's Court held that the trials in the first and second instance had clearly 
established the facts of the case, the evidence had been ample and factual, the verdicts 
accurate, the sentences appropriate, and the trial procedures lawful, and therefore approved 
the death penalty for Du in accordance with the law.  Her death sentence was carried out on 
5 August 2009. 
</p>
<p> 2. Case of Tang Ya'nan, originally from Anhui, Board Chairman of 
Wanwuchun Technology Development Co., Ltd.  From June 2004 to March 2007, despite 
being fully aware that the Wanwuchun Company was operating at a loss, and that he was 
absolutely unable to repay principal and interest on the proceeds of a sika deer-breeding </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>operation, nevertheless, using high interest returns as an inducement, and overstating and 
falsifying the company's business condition, illegally raised 973 million yuan renminbi in 
seven provinces and municipalities and 116 counties and districts including Anhui, Henan 
and Beijing.  Most of the money was spent on personal purchases of vehicles, real estate, 
luxury items, transfers and concealment as well as repaying principal and interest on funds 
raised earlier and issuing high-denomination fund-raising business commissions and 
incentives.  At the time the case came to the attention of the authorities, a total of 333 
million yuan renminbi in raised funds could not be repaid, leading to the suicide of one of 
the victims of the fraud.  The case was tried in the Bozhou Municipal People's Court in 
Anhui, which ruled that in having planned and directed the fraudulent fund-raising 
activities, Tang was the prime culprit in the joint offense as well as a recidivist, that the 
circumstances of the commission of the crime were especially serious and that the crime 
itself was extremely grave, and accordingly sentenced defendant Tang Ya'nan to death for 
the fraudulent raising of funds, with lifetime deprivation of political rights and confiscation 
of all his personal assets.  After sentence had been pronounced, Tang appealed the ruling to 
a higher court.  In the trial of second instance, the Anhui Provincial Superior People's Court 
rejected his appeal and upheld the original ruling, reporting the case to the Supreme 
People's Court for review in accordance with the law.  Following its review, the Supreme 
People's Court held that the trials in the first and second instance had clearly established the 
facts of the case, the evidence had been ample and factual, the verdicts accurate, the 
sentences appropriate, and the trial procedures lawful, and therefore approved the death 
penalty for Tang in accordance with the law.  His death sentence was carried out on 7 
January 2010. 
</p>
<p>127. China's Criminal Law contains clear provisions regarding the sentencing of those 
convicted of crimes of all types.  Although the death penalty continues to exist, its 
application is strictly controlled, especially with reference to non-violent crimes.  In the 
case of fraudulent fund-raising, the death penalty is lawfully applied only in serious cases 
where the amounts involved are extremely large and the damage to the interests of the 
State, society or the public is extremely grave.  The general public demands that crimes of 
this nature be punished severely, and the application of the death penalty in such cases 
assists in deterring and preventing them.  In order to ensure the correct application of the 
death penalty, as well as reduce and control its application to the greatest extent possible, 
China's Criminal Procedure Law provides that upon the conclusion of general first- or 
second-instance trial procedures, death-penalty verdicts must undergo a special death-
penalty review process, and take effect only after review and approval by the Supreme 
People's Court of China.  In order to ensure transparency and achieve impartiality in the 
administration of justice, all judgments and rulings of Chinese courts are publicly available, 
and members of the public in need of knowledge about the contents of relevant court 
judgments and rulings can learn about them via open channels.

its entirety in a relevant document of the United Nations.

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 23 October 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>129. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the case Mr. Akmal Shaikh, a man 
sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges.  
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p> On 12 September 2007, Mr. Akmal Shaikh was arrested at the airport of 
Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR), when he 
arrived on a flight from Tajikistan. He was accused of carrying four kilograms of 
heroin in his luggage. There are credible allegations that Mr. Shaikh is suffering 
from severe mental illness, which would impact his culpability.  Nevertheless, the 
judicial authorities denied his counsel&#8217;s request that Mr. Shaikh be evaluated by 
mental health professionals. On 29 October 2008, the XUAR Intermediate People&#8217;s 
 Court found him guilty and sentenced him to death. His appeal against the 
sentence was rejected by the Uighur Autonomous Regional Higher People's Court in 
the course of the current month of October 2009 (the precise date has not been 
reported to us). The case is now before the Supreme People&#8217;s Court for confirmation 
of the death sentence.  
</p>
<p>130. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This would exclude charges of drug trafficking 
from those for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law.  In addition, 
given the serious concerns about Mr. Shaikh&#8217;s mental health, it is not clear that the 
intentionality requirement is met in his case.   
</p>
<p>131. We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Safeguards 
Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984.  Of particular relevance is paragraph 3 
which provides that the death penalty shall not be carried out on persons who have become 
insane.  In addition resolution 1989/64 of the Economic and Social Council resolution of 24 
May 1989 on the Implementation of the Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights 
of Those Facing the Death Penalty, recommends in paragraph 1(d) that States further 
strengthen the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, eliminating the 
death penalty for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental 
competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution. Legal authorities have 
concluded that it has become a norm of customary law that the insane may not be executed. 
</p>
<p>132. We note that the denial by the judicial authorities of his counsel&#8217;s request that Mr. 
Shaikh be evaluated by mental health professionals also raises concerns with regard to his 
right to &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (article 10 </p>

</b></p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights). In this connection we would also like to 
refer Your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary, adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and 
the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 September 1985 and 
endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 
December 1985. In particular, principle 6 provides that &#8220;the principle of the independence 
of the judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are 
conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>133. In view of the irrevocable nature of the death penalty, we urge your Government not 
to proceed with the execution of Akmal Shaikh, should the Supreme People&#8217;s Court 
confirm the death sentence in his case.  
</p>
<p>134. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>

<p><b>  Response from the Government of China dated 4 January 2010 (translated from 
Chinese) 
</b></p>
<p>135. Receipt is hereby acknowledged of joint communication No. UA G/SO 214 (3-3-16) 
G/SO 214 (33-27) CHN 31/2009 from the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur of the Human 
Rights Council on the independence of judges and lawyers.  The Chinese Government has 
looked into the matter carefully and wishes to make the following reply: 
</p>
<p>136. Review by the Chinese Supreme People&#8217;s Court of the death penalty for drug 
trafficking imposed in the case of Akmal Shaikh (a British national) has now been 
completed.  In its review, the Supreme People's Court verified that in the early hours of 12 
September 2007, Akmal arrived at Urumqi International Airport in Xinjiang on an 
international flight from Dushanbe in the Republic of Tajikistan carrying 4,030 grams of 
heroin.  Upon his arrival, Chinese Customs security personnel discovered the heroin in the 
lining of his hand-luggage; the purity level of the heroin was analyzed as 84.2 per cent.  In 
the view of the Supreme People's Court, the fact that Akmal illicitly brought a large 
quantity of heroin into China is clear and the evidence is irrefutable; his actions amount to 
the crime of drug trafficking, and the nature of the offence is serious.  Under the provisions 
of articles 48 and 347 of the Chinese Criminal Law, the death sentence imposed on Akmal 
by the Urumqi Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court was appropriate, and the Supreme 
People&#8217;s Court therefore approved this death sentence in accordance with the law.  Akmal 
was executed by lethal injection in Urumqi, Xinjiang on 29 December. 
</p>
<p>137. China is a State ruled by law; its judicial organs handle cases independently in strict 
accordance with the law.  Throughout the entire process of his being taken into custody and 
put on trial, the legal rights and relevant treatment to which Akmal was entitled were fully 
guaranteed in accordance with the law.  With regard to the issue of his undergoing a court-
ordered psychiatric evaluation, under Chinese law, evidence of the possibility that the 
accused suffers from mental illness must be produced when applying to have the accused 
undergo a psychiatric evaluation, so that the court may decide whether or not such an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>48  
</b></p>
<p>evaluation is needed.  Although British consular officials requested a court-ordered 
psychiatric evaluation of Akmal, the materials presented were insufficient to prove that 
Akmal suffered from mental illness or that members of his family had ever suffered from 
mental illness; nor did Akmal himself provide relevant materials.  Upon deliberation, the 
court concluded that nothing in the case gave cause to doubt Akmal&#8217;s mental condition, and 
the application for a psychiatric evaluation did not meet the requirements for acceptance. 
</p>
<p>138. The Chinese Government wishes to reiterate that while the death penalty continues 
to exist under Chinese law, its application is strictly controlled.  On the other hand, crimes 
involving drugs are recognized throughout the world as serious offenses, entailing serious 
harm to society; both the international community and Chinese civil society demand that 
such crimes be punished severely.  The application of the death penalty in cases of crimes 
so harmful to society is appropriate, helps to deter and prevent them, and accords with the 
vital interests of the general public. 
</p>
<p>139. The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in 
its entirety in a relevant document of the United Nations.

<p><b>  China: Death sentences against persons tried in connection with violence in Xinjiang 
Province 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions 
relating to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:  12 males 
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: Cooperative but incomplete response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur notes the detailed 
response of the Government of China, but regrets that the response does not address the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s two questions concerning whether the death penalty was imposed in 
the 12 cases at issue here after a fair trial, as required by international law.  First, although 
the Government describes the outcomes of trials and appeals in each of the 12 cases, it does 
not address whether the accused were assisted by counsel of their own choice, a 
fundamental fair trial right, and, if not, how counsel were selected.  Similarly, the 
Government does not respond to the concern that the trial judges of the Urumqi 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court who rendered the death sentences were not impartial, and 
were, instead, selected on political grounds and received instructions from the Communist 
Party as to how the cases should be handled.  Any such interference with the judicial 
process would be a violation of the requirement of &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an 
independent and impartial tribunal.&#8221; Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 10.   
</p>
<p>140. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that two of the accused were sentenced 
to death for crimes that did not result in an intentional killing, which is a violation of the 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; requirement as interpreted by international human rights bodies.  In 
the first instance, Anwar Akbar was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for 
robbery, and in the second, Xi&#8217;erzhati Maimaititusong was sentenced to death with a two-
year suspension, for arson.  The Special Rapporteur urges that these sentences be 
commuted and requests that the Government keep the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s successor 
informed of any such developments in these cases.    
</p>
<p>141. Urgent appeal dated 3 November 2009, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>142. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the trials before the Urumqi 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of men accused in relation to the violent protests in Urumqi in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>July 2009, resulting in the imposition of the death sentences against twelve of the 
defendants. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> The violent protests in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province, from 5 to 7 July 2009 
resulted, according to information provided by the Government of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China, in the death of 197 persons, 134 of them Han Chinese, and 
injuries to about 1,600 others. 
</p>
<p> On 12 and 15 October 2009, the Urumqi Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court heard cases on charges relating to violence in the July 5 riots in Urumqi. The 
trial hearing sessions were concluded in one day. Nine of the defendants were 
sentenced to death including Messrs. Abdukerim Abduwayit, Gheni Yusup, Han 
Junbo, Abdulla Mettohti, Adil Rozi, Nureli Wuxiu'er, and Alim Metyusup. Three 
people including Mr. Ainiwa&#8217;er Aikepa&#8217;er were sentenced to death with a two year 
reprieve. In the case of Mr Tayirejan Abulimit the death sentence was reduced to a 
sentence of life imprisonment in view of his cooperation with the police 
investigation. Four other defendants in the case were sentenced to life and another 
five were given jail terms. A number of concerns have been raised and are 
summarized below.  
</p>
<p> The Urumqi Intermediate People&#8217;s Court failed to give public notification of 
the upcoming trials, as it would have been required to do under the criminal 
procedure law. No foreign observers or journalists were present. There are concerns 
that the audience at the trial could have been selected among court personnel and 
civil servants. 
</p>
<p> The judges and prosecutors involved in the trials were specifically selected to 
hear these cases based on political criteria, and received direct instructions from 
Communist Party authorities regarding the handling of the cases. Official reports 
state that the Party Committee of the Xinjiang High People's Court organized special 
training sessions for the selected judicial officers, who were also given a manual 
entitled the &#8220;Propaganda Education Manual on the Truth about the July 5th Incident 
in Urumqi,&#8221; prepared by the Party authorities. 
</p>
<p> On 11 July 2009, judicial authorities in Urumqi and Beijing warned lawyers 
to exercise caution in accepting cases related to the July 2009 violent protests in 
Urumqi. Partners of law firms were told to report such cases immediately and to 
&#8220;positively accept monitoring and guidance from legal authorities and lawyers&#8217; 
associations&#8221; in this regard. Reports indicate that the lawyers appointed to defend 
the accused were chosen not only for their legal skills but also for &#8220;their good 
political qualities&#8221;. Lawyers were furthermore banned from making comments to the 
print and electronic media or on the internet.  
</p>
<p> On 30 October 2009, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Higher 
People's Court upheld the nine death sentences imposed by the Urumqi Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court. The nine people are currently at risk of imminent 
execution which will be carried if their sentences are approved by the Supreme 
Court. 
</p>
<p>143. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to these cases under international law.  
</p>
<p>144. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it is essential that in capital punishment </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>50  
</b></p>
<p>cases the defendants&#8217; right to &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial 
tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights) is scrupulously 
respected.  
</p>
<p>145. With regard to the reports concerning the alleged selection by the authorities and 
intimidation of lawyers who defended those criminally charged for their involvement in the 
July 2009 riots in Urumqi, we wish to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that the right to a fair trial includes the right to be assisted by legal counsel of 
one&#8217;s own choosing. This right is set forth in Principle 5 of the Basic Principles on the Role 
of Lawyers (Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990).  Also 
Principle 1 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers stipulates that all persons are 
entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their 
rights and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings. Further Principle 16 of the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that 
lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, 
hindrance, harassment or improper interference &#8230;&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>146. Additionally, in relation to the alleged restrictions on the freedom of expression of 
counsel, we would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Principle 23 of the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers stipulates that &#8220;lawyers like other citizens are 
entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. In particular, they shall 
have the right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the 
administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights ...&#8221; If the reports 
we have received regarding legal counsel to the defendants were (also only in part) 
accurate, this would represent a serious interference with the independence and fair 
administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>147. With regard to alleged selection criteria for the judges assigned to hear the cases 
related to the July 2009 riots in Urumqi, we would like to draw the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary 
(Adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 September 1985 and endorsed 
by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 
1985), which provide authoritative guidance as to the meaning of the right to &#8220;a fair and 
public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221;. Principle 1 states that it &#8220;is 
the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence 
of the judiciary.&#8221; Principle 2 provides that &#8220;the judiciary decide matters before them 
impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, 
improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, 
from any quarter or for any reason.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>148. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure that the rights guaranteed under international law to all the persons on trial in 
relation to the July 2009 incident in Urumqi, including Messrs. Abdukerim Abduwayit, 
Gheni Yusup, Abdulla Mettohti, Adil Rozi, Nureli Wuxiu'er, Alim Metyusup and Tayirejan 
Abulimit and the six reportedly sentenced to death on 14 October 2009, are fully respected. 
Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as 
still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a summary execution, 
which violates the most fundamental human right.  Considering the irreversible nature of 
the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all 
concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety.  
</p>
<p>149. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details regarding the charges against the sentenced to death on 
charges related to the July 2009 riots in Urumqi, including Messers. Abdukerim 
Abduwayit, Gheni Yusup, Abdulla Mettohti, Adil Rozi, Nureli Wuxiu'er, Alim 
Metyusup and Mr Tayirejan Abulimit: which provisions of criminal law were they 
charged with and found guilty of having violated?  
</p>
<p>3. Please indicate whether the accused persons were assisted by counsel of their 
own choosing. If not so, what were the selection criteria for the lawyers who 
defended the accused persons?  
</p>
<p>4. Please indicate how the judges sitting on the trials before the Urumqi 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on 11 and 14 October 2009 were selected. Is it accurate 
that these judges received direct instructions from Communist Party authorities 
regarding the handling of the cases and underwent a special training session 
organized by the Party Committee of the Xinjiang High People's Court?

<p><b>  Response of the Government of China dated 17 December 2009 (translated from 
Chinese) 
</b></p>
<p> Letter No. GJ/066/2009 
</p>
<p>150. Receipt is acknowledged of the joint communication from the Special Rapporteur on 
Arbitrary Executions and the Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges and Lawyers 
regarding the Urumqi &#8220;7.5&#8221; incident (UA G/SO 214 (3-3-16) G/SO 214 (33-27) CHN 
32/2009). The Chinese Government answered an earlier letter about the incident from the 
Special Rapporteur on Arbitrary Executions and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of 
Opinion and Expression, on 12 August. In a spirit of active cooperation with the United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, the Government has made thorough inquiries into the 
trials and verdicts arising out of the Urumqi &#8220;7.5&#8221; incident. Below is our reply. 
</p>
<p> 1. The Urumqi &#8220;7.5&#8221; incident was a case of serious premeditated, organized, 
violent criminal beating, smashing, looting and arson. It was planned, directed, and 
instigated by foreign separatist forces, and organized and carried out by domestic separatist 
elements. It caused significant losses of life and property: altogether 197 people died.  
</p>
<p>151. In October 2009, the Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of Urumqi City conducted public 
trials and rendered judgement in first instance on 6 cases with 21 defendants charged with 
murder and arson in the Urumqi &#8220;7.5&#8221; incident. Nine defendants were sentenced to death, 
among them Abdukerim Abduwayit, Gheni Yusup, and Alim Metyusup. Three defendants 
were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, among them Aizezijiang Yasin.  Four 
defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment, among them Ruzi Imam. Five defendants

judgements and sentences passed on the defendants mentioned in the joint communication 
are detailed below. 
</p>

circumstances and consequences of his crimes were especially serious. Based on the 
relevant laws, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death and deprivation of 
political rights in perpetuity; he was also sentenced to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment for </p>

</p>
<p>(6) Alim Metyusup engaged in multiple acts of beating, smashing, looting and 
arson. He assaulted innocent people, causing five deaths and one serious injury; he

circumstances of his crimes were especially abominable, and the consequences, 
extremely serious. He was convicted of murder, and sentenced to death and

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>(10) Anwar Akbar was a ringleader in mass smashing of vehicles and shops and 
an accessory to attempted murder. He was convicted of robbery and sentenced to 
death with a two-year reprieve, deprivation of political rights in perpetuity, and 
confiscation of his personal properties. For the (attempted) murder he was sentenced

applied with a two-year suspension, that Anwar should be deprived of his political 
rights in perpetuity, and that all his personal property should be confiscated. 
</p>
<p>(11) Aizezijiang Yasin was involved in the beating of one person to death, and in 
theft of property. Considering that he confessed his offence when brought to justice, 
and played an important role in solving the case, he was convicted of murder and 
sentenced to death with a two-year suspension and deprivation of political rights in 
perpetuity. He was also sentenced to nine years&#8217; imprisonment for robbery. The 
court determined that the death penalty should be applied with a two-year 
suspension, and that Yasin should be deprived of his political rights in perpetuity. 
</p>

two-year suspension and deprivation of political rights in perpetuity.  
(13) Tayirejan Abulimit was involved in assaults on innocent people, leaving 
three dead and one seriously injured in odious circumstances. Considering his 
offence, he should have been sentenced to death; but when brought to justice he 
confessed and assisted in capturing Alim Metyusup, which was highly meritorious 
service meriting lesser punishment in accordance with the law. He was convicted of 
murder and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights in 
perpetuity. He was also sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine for robbery. 
The court determined that the life sentence should be applied, that Abulimit should

</p>
<p>(14) Ruzi Imam set fire to vehicles, causing substantial losses of public and 
private property. He was convicted of arson and sentenced to life imprisonment and

</p>
<p>(15) Tusongjiang Maimaiti was a ringleader in urging people to commit beating,

robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of political rights in 
perpetuity, and confiscation of his personal property.  
</p>
<p>(16) Tu&#8217;ersong Abulizi was involved in assaulting innocent people and caused one

</p>
<p> 2. Under Chinese law, the court of second instance renders final judgement. A 
defendant can appeal the decision rendered in first instance to a higher-level court. After the 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of Urumqi City announced its decisions, six defendants, 
among them Abdukerim Abduwayit and Alim Metyusup, did not appeal. The six included 
two people sentenced to death, one to life imprisonment and three to fixed terms of 
imprisonment. The other 15 defendants appealed within the statutory deadlines; they 
included 7 people sentenced to death, 3 to death with a two-year suspension, 3 to life 
imprisonment, and 2 to fixed terms of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p> The High People&#8217;s Court of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) 
formed a collegiate bench in accordance with the law and conducted an open hearing on the 
appeals against three of the death sentences. During the hearing, the procurator presented 
physical evidence, testimony, expert evaluations and records of the crime scenes. The 
appellants each stated their reasons for appealing and fully exercised the procedural rights 
specified by the law. Lawyers presented the defence&#8217;s arguments before the court. The 
court used the appellants&#8217; native languages in conducting its proceedings. The hearings 
were attended by more than 100 people including the victims, the appellants&#8217; relatives, and 
members of the public. The court concluded that the facts established in the decisions 
reached at first instance were clear, the law had been correctly applied, the sentences 
handed down were appropriate, the trial procedure was legal, and the appellants&#8217; grounds 
for appeal were unsustainable. It therefore dismissed the appeals in accordance with the law 
and upheld the original judgements.  
</p>
<p> In addition, the XUAR High People&#8217;s Court reviewed the cases of the appellant and 
defendant and heard the opinions of other parties to the proceedings during its consideration 
in second instance of the charges of murder and robbery against Aizejiang Yasin. Having 
done so, it dismissed the appeal and upheld the original judgement. It reviewed the death 
sentences passed on Abdukerim Abduwayit for murder and arson and on Alim Metyusup 
for murder, robbery and arson, neither of whom had appealed, in accordance with the 
established procedure, concluding that the death sentences handed down in first instance 
were appropriate and upholding the original judgements in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> Chinese law requires death sentences to be referred to the Supreme People&#8217;s Court 
for approval unless the sentence is imposed by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court itself. The 
XUAR High People&#8217;s Court thus referred the nine cases attracting the death penalty to the 
Supreme People&#8217;s Court for approval. After review, the Supreme People&#8217;s Court upheld the 
nine death sentences.  
</p>
<p> In November, the Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of Urumqi City, acting on an order 
issued by the President of the Supreme People&#8217;s Court, executed the nine seriously violent 
criminals implicated in the &#8220;7.5&#8221; events.  
</p>
<p> As the law provides, the Court executed the nine criminals by lethal injection. 
Before the execution, it arranged for the criminals to meet their relatives. After the 
execution, relatives of the executed criminals from ethnic minorities and religious people </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>held ceremonies. The convicts&#8217; ethnic customs, dignity and human rights were fully 
respected. 
</p>
<p> 3. The Chinese Government would like to emphasize the following points. 
</p>
<p>(1) The rule of law obtains in China. Under the Criminal Code, all offenders are 
equal before the law. Anyone who commits a crime will be called to account 
regardless of their ethnicity and religion. Even so, where statutory or discretionary 
mitigating circumstances apply, lesser or lighter punishments may be imposed. The 
nine people sentenced to death in the Urumqi &#8220;7.5&#8221; events killed innocent people. 
Their offences were extremely serious. They deserved the punishments they 
received under Chinese law. For example, Abdukerim Abduwayit kept beating, 
smashing, looting and fire-raising all the way along the Tuanjie Road in Urumqi on 
the evening of 5 July. He kicked, stabbed and bludgeoned (with pliers) five innocent 
people to death. Later he set fire to buildings in the downtown area, which caused 
financial loss of more than 260,000 yuan and forced 13 people to leap to safety. 
Gheni Yusup mustered a crowd on the evening of July 5 to engage in beating, 
smashing, looting and arson and led three other defendants, Abdulla Mettohti, Adil 
Rozi and Nureli Wuxiu&#8217;er, in beating and smashing with sticks and stones, looting 
and arson at four sites near Zhongwan Road; together they beat four innocent people 
to death, and injured another person. Along with other rioters, Gheni Yusup beat one 
innocent person to death and injured another. Abdulla Mettohti also set fire to the 
Tianshan grain store on Zhongwan Road in Tienshan District, causing five innocent 
people hiding in the shop to be burned to death and doing more than 1.37 million 
yuan-worth of damage. 
</p>
<p>(2) The courts strictly followed the law and legal procedure in trying these cases. 
The facts of the defendants&#8217; offences were clearly established and the evidence was 
conclusive. The prosecution presented evidence in court that fully substantiated the 
charges, and used an audio-visual system to display video recordings of the crime 
scenes. The victims, relatives of the defendants and members of the public attended 
the hearings.  
</p>
<p>(3) The defendants fully exercised their procedural rights during the hearings. 
Their counsel put forward arguments for the defence in court. A collegiate bench 
presided over the prosecutions and conducted a judicial examination of the facts. 
The court proceedings were conducted in the defendants&#8217; native languages. After the 
trials in first instance, the XUAR High People&#8217;s Court considered the appeals and 
publicly announced its decisions. The nine death sentences were referred to the 
Supreme People&#8217;s Court for approval. The Supreme People&#8217;s Court upheld them 
after review. During its review, the Court interrogated the defendants and heard out 
their confessions and defence submissions.

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 11 February 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>153. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding alleged violations of the right to a 
fair trial in the case of Mr. Gan Jinhua, who is reportedly currently awaiting a review by the 
Supreme Court of his death sentence. 
</p>
<p> According to information we have received:  
</p>
<p> Mr. Gan was detained on 12 November 2004 in Chencun town, Shunde 
District, Guangdong Province and charged with killing two persons in the course of 
a robbery. On 10 June 2005, the Foshan City Intermediate Court sentenced Gan 
Jinhua to death for robbery.  Gan Jinhua appealed; on 28 December 2005, the 
Guangdong Province Higher Court upheld his sentence. In April 2006, Gan Jinhua 
was granted a last-minute reprieve as the Guangdong Province Higher Court sent his 
case back for a retrial, but on 18 April 2008 Gan was again convicted and sentenced 
to death by the Foshan City Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. Gan Jinhua appealed, but 
in December 2009 the Guangdong Higher People's Court upheld the ruling.  Mr. 
Gan&#8217;s case is currently before the Supreme People&#8217;s Court for review of the death 
sentence. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Gan was convicted and sentenced to death primarily on the strength of 
his confession. This confession was obtained after Mr. Gan had been prevented from 
sleeping for more than three days, interrogated over the course of more than one 
hundred hours, from 8 a.m. on 12 November to 11 p.m. on 16 November 2004, and 
threatened by the police while being questioned. As a result, there are glaring 
inconsistencies between Mr. Gan&#8217;s confession and the other evidence in the case, 
amongst others with regard to the way the robber entered and left the crime scene 
and the weapon used for the killing. Other inconsistencies concern the record of Mr. 
Gan's interrogation on 15 November 2004. It states that it took place in the Shunde 
Detention Center, but Mr. Gan&#8217;s wife, mother, and sister visited him that evening in 
the Chencun Police Station. Mr. Gan also stated that part of his statement was 
written by a policeman, who forced him to sign without allowing him to look at its 
content.   
</p>
<p> In the course of Mr. Gan&#8217;s final retrial, his wife, mother, and elder sister were 
prevented from testifying by the presiding judge, preventing Mr. Gan's lawyers from 
addressing some central facts of the case.   
</p>
<p>154. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to this case under international law.  
</p>
<p>155. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that it is essential that in 
capital punishment cases the defendant&#8217;s right to &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an 
independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights) is scrupulously respected. The right to a fair trial includes the right to obtain the 
attendance and examination of witnesses on one&#8217;s behalf under the same conditions as 
witnesses on behalf of the prosecution. While we recognize that the charges against Mr. 
Gan were examined and reviewed by a number of first instance and appeals courts and a 
full retrial appears to have been granted, the information summarized above suggests that 
Mr. Gan was not allowed to call potentially important witnesses on his behalf.  
</p>
<p>156. With regard to the reports that Mr. Gan&#8217;s confession was obtained under duress, 
specifically following more than three days of sleep deprivation, we wish to bring to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the right to a fair trial also requires the right 
not to be compelled to confess. Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China is a Party, states that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture 
may be invoked as evidence in any proceedings. This principle was recently reiterated by 
the Human Rights Council in paragraph 6c of resolution 8/8 of 2008. In addition to being a 
crucial fair trial guarantee, it is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to 
physical and mental integrity protected by the Convention Against Torture.  To make this 
right effective, the Convention Against Torture dictates in Article 13 that &#8220;[e]ach State 
Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any 
territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly 
and impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that 
the complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a 
consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>157. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment from a summary execution. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to take all necessary steps to ensure that Mr. Gan Jinhua&#8217;s right to life be respected. 
Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death 
penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>158. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details regarding the circumstances under which Mr. Gan 
Jinhua&#8217;s confession was obtained.  
</p>
<p>3. What is, under Chinese law, the value of a confession given to police 
investigators but revoked at trial? 
</p>
<p>4. Please explain on what grounds Mr. Gan&#8217;s wife, mother, and elder sister were 
prevented from testifying at the re-trail? 
</p>
<p>5. Are the judgments rendered in the case of Mr. Gan Jinhua accessible to the 
public?

<p>159. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el presunto asesinato de 12 
miembros de la comunidad ind&#237;gena Aw&#225; el 26 de agosto de 2009 en el territorio ind&#237;gena 
de Gran Rosario, en el municipio de Tumaco, Nari&#241;o. Entre las 12 personas asesinadas se 
encuentran cuatro ni&#241;os y cinco adolescentes de entre ocho meses y diecinueve a&#241;os de 
edad.  
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas:  
</p>
<p>El 26 de octubre, aproximadamente a las 5 horas de la ma&#241;ana, un grupo de hombres 
armados habr&#237;a invadido la casa de la Sra. <b>Tulia Mariana Guanga Garc&#237;a</b>. Los 
hombres habr&#237;an llevado ropa camuflageada sin insignia y habr&#237;an estado 
encapuchados. Habr&#237;an matado a tiros a doce personas. Las v&#237;ctimas (con sus edades 
aproximadas) fueron la Sra. <b>Guanga Garc&#237;a</b>, 30, y sus dos hijos, <b>James Laurencio 
Garc&#237;a</b>, 3, y <b>Angie Jazm&#237;n Rodr&#237;guez</b>, 8, un beb&#233; de 8 meses, <b>Jeison Ferney 
Rodr&#237;guez</b>,<b> Alex Rodr&#237;guez</b>, 8, <b>Luis Garc&#237;a Bisbicus</b>, 15; <b>Juana Guanga Garc&#237;a</b>, 
17, el Sr. <b>Fabio Taicuz Garc&#237;a</b>, 18, el Sr. <b>Nolberto Guanga Taicuz</b>, 19, el Sr. 
<b>Amado Nastacuas Guanga</b>, 19, el Sr. <b>&#193;lvaro Guillermo Pascal Guanga</b>, 21, y el 
Sr. <b>Lorenzo Garc&#237;a Cuasaluzan</b>, 40. Adem&#225;s, tres personas habr&#237;an resultado 
heridas en el incidente: <b>David Garc&#237;a</b>, 12; el Sr.<b> Javier Garc&#237;a</b>, 20 y la <b>Srta. 
Yolanda Bisbicus</b>, 22.  
</p>
<p>160. Tomamos nota con profunda preocupaci&#243;n de que, de ser confirmado, &#233;sta ser&#237;a la 
segunda vez en el a&#241;o en curso que la comunidad ind&#237;gena Aw&#225; es v&#237;ctima de masacre: En 
febrero de 2009, m&#225;s de 20 personas Aw&#225; habr&#237;an sido asesinadas en un ataque que despu&#233;s 
habr&#237;a sido reivindicado por guerrilleros de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de 
Colombia (FARC) quienes asumieron responsabilidad por ocho de las muertes.  
</p>
<p>161. Adem&#225;s, observamos que, desde hace casi dos a&#241;os, han habido advertencias 
oficiales sobre la amenaza de violencia que enfrenta la comunidad ind&#237;gena Aw&#225;, 
incluyendo el riesgo de asesinatos m&#250;ltiples. Desde principios de octubre de 2007, el 
sistema de alerta temprana de la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo habr&#237;a emitido informes sobre 
riesgos que alertan sobre la amenaza seria que enfrenta la comunidad ind&#237;gena Aw&#225; como 
resultado del conflicto en Nari&#241;o y la presencia del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional de Colombia, 
guerrilleros de las FARC y otros grupos armados ilegales en la regi&#243;n. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, con estas 12 muertes del 26 de agosto de 2009, el n&#250;mero de 
miembros asesinados de la comunidad Aw&#225; habr&#237;a ascendido a 38 en este a&#241;o.  
</p>
<p>162. Las muertes recientes son a&#250;n m&#225;s preocupantes puesto que el incidente tuvo lugar 
en la casa de la Sra. Garc&#237;a quien habr&#237;a sido la &#250;nica testigo del presunto asesinato de su 
esposo, el Sr. Gonzalo Rodr&#237;guez Guanga, incidente que la Sra. Garc&#237;a habr&#237;a denunciado 
como ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial cometida por el Ej&#233;rcito Nacional de Colombia.  
</p>
<p>163. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 23 de mayo de 2009, el Sr. Rodr&#237;guez y 
la Sra. Garc&#237;a habr&#237;an estado viajando cerca del kil&#243;metro 80 en el municipio de Tumaco 
cuando fueron detenidos por miembros del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional de Colombia. Seg&#250;n el 
testimonio que la Sra. Garc&#237;a supuestamente dio a las autoridades ind&#237;genas y a la 
Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo de la regi&#243;n, miembros de las fuerzas armadas habr&#237;an ordenado a la 
Sra. Garc&#237;a que se alejara de su esposo y le habr&#237;an ordenado que siguiera caminando. 
Seg&#250;n el presunto testimonio de la Sra. Garc&#237;a, se habr&#237;a alejado de su esposo y habr&#237;a 
empezado a caminar cuando un poco despu&#233;s habr&#237;a escuchado unos disparos. La Sra. 
Garc&#237;a habr&#237;a afirmado que la muerte de su esposo se trataba de una ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial.  
</p>
<p>164. De acuerdo con nuestras fuentes fidedignas, el <b>Batall&#243;n</b> de <b>Contraguerrilla</b> n&#250;mero 
23 de la Brigada Militar No. XXIII, habr&#237;a aceptado responsabilidad de la muerte del Sr. 
Rodr&#237;guez. Miembros de las fuerzas armadas habr&#237;an reportado a las autoridades que el Sr. 
Rodr&#237;guez habr&#237;a sido detenido en marzo de 2009 y que habr&#237;a sido acusado de ser </p>

<p>miembro de las FARC. Un juez habr&#237;a ordenado su liberaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n los miembros de las 
fuerzas armadas, el 23 de mayo de 2009, el Sr. Rodr&#237;guez habr&#237;a sido detenido nuevamente 
y habr&#237;a sido asesinado cuando intentaba escapar de custodia militar y empezaba a disparar 
contra sus captores. El cad&#225;ver del Sr. Rodr&#237;guez habr&#237;a sido trasladado al dep&#243;sito de 
cad&#225;veres para una necropsia. La oficina de la Procuradur&#237;a General habr&#237;a iniciado una 
investigaci&#243;n de la muerte del Sr. Rodr&#237;guez pero luego habr&#237;an transferido el caso al 
sistema de justicia militar el 28 de mayo de 2009 donde sigue bajo investigaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>165. Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles 
y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo el derecho 
a la vida y a la seguridad de su persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley 
y que nadie sea arbitrariamente privado de su vida. Como ha sido reiterado por el Consejo 
de Derechos Humanos en su Resoluci&#243;n 8/3 sobre ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o 
arbitrarias, todos los Estados tienen &#8220;la obligaci&#243;n &#8230;de llevar a cabo investigaciones 
completas e imparciales en todos los casos en que se sospeche que ha habido ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, de identificar y enjuiciar a los responsables&#8230; y de 
adoptar todas las medidas que sean necesarias, incluidas medidas jur&#237;dicas y judiciales, para 
poner t&#233;rmino a la impunidad e impedir que se repitan esas ejecuciones, como se se&#241;ala en 
los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>166. Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos espec&#237;ficamente al Art&#237;culo 6(1) del Pacto 
Internacional sobre Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos (PIDCP) que estipula que el Estado 
garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n de toda persona que se encuentra bajo amenaza de muerte. Como 
expresado en los principio 4 y 15 de los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e 
investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, esto requiere que se 
garantice una protecci&#243;n eficaz a toda persona en peligro de ejecuci&#243;n. Quisi&#233;ramos instar 
al Gobierno de su Excelencia a que adopte inmediatamente todas las medidas necesarias, en 
conformidad con el Derecho Internacional, para proteger el derecho a la vida de los 
sobrevivientes y los testigos de la masacre del 26 de agosto, as&#237; como la de los miembros de 
sus familias y l&#237;deres de la comunidad, cuyo bienestar pueda estar en peligro en el curso de 
la investigaci&#243;n de estos asesinatos y en espera del resultado del proceso judicial.   
</p>
<p>167. Adem&#225;s, el Art&#237;culo 6 del PIDCP estipula que los funcionarios encargados de hacer 
cumplir la ley, deben utilizar la fuerza solamente cuando sea absolutamente necesario y la 
fuerza utilizada debe de ser proporcional al objetivo leg&#237;timo que se persiga (V&#233;anse los 
principios 4 y 9 de los Principios B&#225;sicos de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Empleo de la 
Fuerza y de Armas de Fuego por los Funcionarios Encargados de Hacer Cumplir la Ley). 
La ley no permite el uso de fuerza letal contra individuos no armados detenidos por las 
fuerzas de seguridad de un Estado, bajo ninguna circunstancia. Adem&#225;s, cuando un Estado 
detiene a un individuo, debe ce&#241;irse a un grado elevado de diligencia para proteger los 
derechos del mismo. Como consecuencia, cuando un individuo muere en custodia estatal, 
se presume la responsabilidad del Estado. Para superar la presunci&#243;n de responsabilidad del 
Estado, debe de haber &#8220;una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los 
casos en que haya sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, incluidos 
aquellos en los que las quejas de parientes u otros informes fiables hagan pensar que se 
produjo una muerte no debida a causas naturales en las circunstancias referidas&#8221; (principio 
9 de los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones 
extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias). 
</p>
<p>168. Por &#250;ltimo, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las 
normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas s<b>obre los

</p>
<p><b>60

ind&#237;genas son libres e iguales a todos los dem&#225;s pueblos y personas y tienen derecho a no 
ser objeto de ning&#250;n tipo de discriminaci&#243;n en el ejercicio de sus derechos, en particular la 
fundada en su origen o identidad ind&#237;genas.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>169. Quisi&#233;ramos instar al Gobierno de su Excelencia a que inicie una investigaci&#243;n 
imparcial y transparente sobre las circunstancias que rodean a) las muertes de las personas 
ind&#237;genas Aw&#225; asesinadas el 26 de agosto de 2009, y b) la muerte del Sr. Rodr&#237;guez el 23 
de mayo de 2009, con vistas a tomar toda acci&#243;n disciplinaria o judicial que sea apropiada y 
asegurar que rinda cuentas cualquier persona culpable de asesinatos il&#237;citos, as&#237; como 
compensar a las familiares de las v&#237;ctimas. Tomamos nota, en este sentido, de la medida en

justicia en los asesinatos de sus hijos. El Sr. Smith Porras Bernal ayuda a las Madres de 
Soacha y realiza campa&#241;as para exigir justicia y poner fin a la impunidad en este caso 
conocido como &#8220;los falsos positivos de Soacha&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas:  
</p>
<p> El 2 de noviembre de 2009, el Sr. Smith Porras Bernal habr&#237;a recibido una 
carta en la que dec&#237;a &#8220;as&#237; se esconda y se encierre en ese apartamento usted sale 
porque sale y hay te vamos a coger porque se le advirti&#243;&#8230; si no quieres que te pase 
nada l&#225;rguese lo m&#225;s pronto posible porque le queda muy poco tiempo no lo olvide 
no estamos jugando porque ya lo tenemos fichado cr&#233;alo no estamos jugando&#8230;&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, el 20 de octubre de 2009, el Sr. Smith Porras Bernal habr&#237;a 
recibido otra carta amenazante en su casa que dec&#237;a que, &#8220;se atuviera a las 
consecuencias&#8221;. Esta amenaza se referir&#237;a a otra carta amenazante enviada el 10 de 
octubre de 2009 en la que el autor habr&#237;a advertido al Sr. Smith Porras Bernal y a las 
otras personas que exigen justicia en relaci&#243;n con las ejecuciones extrajudiciales en 
Soacha que deben guardar silencio, una amenaza que habr&#237;a sido ignorado. 
</p>
<p> Cabe a&#241;adir que otras de las Madres de Soacha han sido objeto de 
intimidaci&#243;n y hostigamiento.  
</p>
<p>172. Se teme que las amenazas contra el Sr. Smith Porras Bernal y la Sra. Porras Bernal y 
los actos de intimidaci&#243;n y hostigamiento contra otros miembros de las Madres de Soacha 
est&#233;n relacionados con las actividades que realizan en defensa de los derechos humanos, y 
en particular con sus esfuerzos para exigir justicia en el caso de sus hijos ejecutados 
extrajudicialmente. Como se mencion&#243; en el comunicado de prensa despu&#233;s de la visita de 
la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos a 
Colombia en septiembre de 2009, siguen existiendo en Colombia patrones de hostigamiento 
y persecuci&#243;n contra los defensores de derechos humanos, y a menudo contra sus 
familiares. El Gobierno de su Excelencia tiene la responsabilidad de investigar de manera 
exhaustiva las violaciones cometidas contra los defensores de derechos humanos y enjuiciar 
a sus autores. Asimismo, el Gobierno de su Excelencia debe condenar firmemente cualquier </p>

</p>
<p><b>62  
</b></p>
<p>acto de agresi&#243;n o intimidaci&#243;n contra los defensores de derechos humanos, tomando la 
oportunidad para reconocer la importancia de su labor. 
</p>
<p>173. Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, deseamos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de los individuos, los grupos y 
las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos 
establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a 
promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la responsabilidad primordial 
y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger, promover y hacer efectivos todos los derechos 
humanos, adoptando las medidas necesarias para crear las condiciones sociales, 
econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas requeridas para que 
toda persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la 
pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p> Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; el art&#237;culo 6, apartados b) y c), estipula que toda persona tiene derecho, 
individualmente y con otras, conforme a lo dispuesto en los instrumentos de 
derechos humanos y otros instrumentos internacionales aplicables, a publicar, 
impartir o difundir libremente a terceros opiniones, informaciones y conocimientos 
relativos a todos los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales y a estudiar y 
debatir si esos derechos y libertades fundamentales se observan, tanto en la ley como 
en la pr&#225;ctica, y a formarse y mantener una opini&#243;n al respecto, as&#237; como a se&#241;alar a 
la atenci&#243;n del p&#250;blico esas cuestiones por conducto de esos medios y de otros 
medios adecuados. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, 
presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona 
tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes 
nacionales al reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con 
inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia 
perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p>174. Adem&#225;s, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de su 
Excelencia para que adopte las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho a la 
libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados 
en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y reiterados en el 
art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; ser 
molestado a causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; 
este derecho comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir informaciones e ideas de 
toda &#237;ndole, sin consideraci&#243;n de fronteras, ya sea oralmente, por escrito o en forma 
impresa o art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>175. Consideramos apropiado hacer referencia a la resoluci&#243;n 12/16 del Consejo de 
Derechos Humanos, la cual insta a los estados a que garanticen que las v&#237;ctimas de 
violaciones al derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n puedan interponer recursos eficaces para 
investigar efectivamente las amenazas y actos de violencia [&#8230;] y llevar ante la justicia a los 
responsables de esos actos, para luchar contra la impunidad. </p>

</p>
<p>177. Teniendo en cuenta la urgencia del caso, agradecer&#237;amos recibir del Gobierno de su

</p>
<p>179. Dans ce contexte, nous souhaiterions attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de votre 
Excellence sur des informations que nous avons re&#231;ues concernant l&#8217;assassinat de M. Bruno 
Koko Chirambiza. M. Chirambiza &#233;tait journaliste-pr&#233;sentateur du journal en Swahili de la 
radio <i>Star</i>  &#233;mettant &#224; Bukavu, province du Sud-Kivu. 
</p>
<p> Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p> Dans la nuit du samedi 22 au dimanche 23 ao&#251;t 2009, alors qu&#8217;il rentrait d&#8217;un 
mariage, M. Chirambiza aurait &#233;t&#233; poignard&#233; &#224; mort par un groupe de huit personnes 
arm&#233;es en tenue civile. M. Chirambiza serait d&#233;c&#233;d&#233; des suites de ses blessures &#224; 
l&#8217;h&#244;pital g&#233;n&#233;ral de r&#233;f&#233;rence de Bukavu. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>64  
</b></p>
<p> De vives craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que l&#8217;assassinat de M. 
Chirambiza soit li&#233; &#224; ses activit&#233;s non violentes de promotion et de protection des 
droits de l&#8217;homme, et ce dans l&#8217;exercice de son droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et 
d&#8217;expression. M. Chirambiza est le troisi&#232;me journaliste assassin&#233; &#224; Bukavu en 2 
ans, apr&#232;s  MM. Didace Namujimbo et  Serge Maheshe de Radio Okapi, assassin&#233;s 
en novembre 2008 et juin 2007 respectivement. De vives craintes sont de ce fait 
r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;es quant &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale des journalistes -et plus largement 
des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme- travaillant dans l&#8217;est de la RDC. 
</p>
<p>180. Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade pr&#233;juger des faits qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, nous voudrions 
attirer l&#8217;attention au Gouvernement de votre Excellence aux principes fondamentaux 
applicables en vertu du droit international en l&#8217;esp&#232;ce. En particulier, je voudrais r&#233;f&#233;rer &#224; 
l&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;Homme et &#224; l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, qui stipulent que tout individu a le droit &#224; 
la vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par la loi, et que nul ne 
peut &#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. 
</p>
<p>181. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou arbitraires a 
soulign&#233; dans un rapport &#224; la Commission des droits de l&#8217;homme que des &#8220;crimes, y 
compris des meurtres, perp&#233;tr&#233;s par des particuliers peuvent aussi engager la responsabilit&#233; 
de l&#8217;&#201;tat si celui-ci n&#8217;a pas pris les mesures voulues pour dissuader, emp&#234;cher et punir les 
auteurs&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.). Le Conseil des droit de l&#8217;homme a, dans sa r&#233;solution 
8/3 sur le mandat du Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou 
arbitraires,  rappel&#233; que &#8220;tous les &#233;tats ont l&#8217;obligation de mener des enqu&#234;tes exhaustives et 
impartiales sur tous les cas pr&#233;sum&#233;s d&#8217;ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou 
arbitraires.&#8221; Le Conseil ajouta que cette obligation comprend l&#8217;obligation &#8220;d&#8217;adopter toutes 
les mesures n&#233;cessaires, notamment d&#8217;ordre l&#233;gislatif et judiciaire, afin de mettre un terme &#224; 
l&#8217;impunit&#233; et d&#8217;emp&#234;cher la r&#233;it&#233;ration de telles pratiques, comme le pr&#233;voient les Principes 
relatifs &#224; la pr&#233;vention efficace des ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, arbitraires et sommaires et 
aux moyens d&#8217;enqu&#234;ter efficacement sur ces ex&#233;cutions. &#8220; En particulier nous souhaiterions 
attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de votre excellence au principe 4 qui pr&#233;voit que les 
gouvernements doivent assurer une protection efficace par des moyens judiciaires ou autres 
aux personnes et aux groupes qui seront menac&#233;s d'une ex&#233;cution extrajudiciaire, arbitraire 
ou sommaire. 
</p>
<p>182. Nous voudrions aussi attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de votre Excellence sur les 
principes fondamentaux &#233;nonc&#233;s dans la D&#233;claration sur le droit et la responsabilit&#233; des 
individus, groupes et organes de la soci&#233;t&#233; de promouvoir et de prot&#233;ger les droits de 
l&#8217;homme et les libert&#233;s fondamentales universellement reconnus, et en particulier l&#8217;article 1 
et 2 qui stipulent que &#171; chacun a le droit, individuellement ou en association avec d&#8217;autres, 
de promouvoir la protection et la r&#233;alisation des droits de l&#8217;homme et des libert&#233;s 
fondamentales aux niveaux national et international &#187; et  que  &#171;  chaque &#201;tat a, au premier 
chef, la responsabilit&#233; et le devoir de prot&#233;ger, promouvoir et rendre effectifs tous les droits 
de l'homme et toutes les libert&#233;s fondamentales, notamment en adoptant les mesures 
n&#233;cessaires pour instaurer les conditions sociales, &#233;conomiques, politiques et autres ainsi 
que les garanties juridiques voulues pour que toutes les personnes relevant de sa juridiction 
puissent, individuellement ou en association avec d'autres, jouir en pratique de tous ces 
droits et de toutes ces libert&#233;s &#187;.  
</p>
<p>183. De m&#234;me, nous souhaiterions attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de votre 
Excellence sur les dispositions suivantes, en particulier : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; l&#8217;article 6, a), conform&#233;ment auquel chacun a le droit, individuellement ou en 
association avec d'autres de d&#233;tenir, rechercher, obtenir, recevoir et conserver des

</p>
<p>&#8226; l&#8217;article 6, alin&#233;as b) et c), qui stipule que chacun a le droit, individuellement ou en

communiquer &#224; autrui ou diffuser librement des id&#233;es, informations et connaissances

moyens appropri&#233;s, d'appeler l'attention du public sur la question ; 
</p>

dans le cadre de l'exercice l&#233;gitime des droits vis&#233;s dans la pr&#233;sente D&#233;claration. &#192; 
cet &#233;gard, chacun a le droit, individuellement ou en association avec d'autres, d'&#234;tre 
efficacement prot&#233;g&#233; par la l&#233;gislation nationale quand il r&#233;agit par des moyens

</p>
<p>184. Nous souhaiterions &#233;galement rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les 
normes et principes fondamentaux pertinents &#233;nonc&#233;s &#224; l'article 19 de la D&#233;claration

condamn&#233; &#224; perp&#233;tuit&#233; et MM. Kikunda et Olangi &#224; 20 ans d&#8217;emprisonnement pour 
complicit&#233; dans la m&#234;me affaire.  Leurs avocats auraient interjet&#233; appel. 
</p>
<p> Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que les proc&#232;s de MM Yangambi, Lokundo, Kikunda et Olangi 
auraient &#233;t&#233; &#233;maill&#233;s d&#8217;irr&#233;gularit&#233;s. La Cour aurait notamment fond&#233; sa d&#233;cision sur 
des proc&#232;s verbaux d&#8217;interrogatoire men&#233;s sous la torture et sans la pr&#233;sence des 
avocats des pr&#233;venus.  
</p>
<p> Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 27 septembre 2009, alors qu&#8217;ils se rendaient 
&#224; un rendez vous avec un officier de la garde r&#233;publicaine dans le cadre de leur 
enqu&#234;te, MM. Yangambi et Getumbe auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s par l&#8217;ANR et d&#233;tenus au 
secret. 
</p>
<p> Le 28 septembre 2009, M. Mende Omalanga, Ministre de la Communication 
et porte-parole du  Gouvernement, aurait annonc&#233; l&#8217;arrestation de M. Yangambi 
pour avoir &#171; convoy&#233; une cargaison d&#8217;armes dans le but de lancer un nouveau 
mouvement insurrectionnel contre la R&#233;publique D&#233;mocratique du Congo &#224; partir de 
Kisangani &#187;.  
</p>
<p> Le 30 septembre 2009, le domicile de M. Yangambi aurait &#233;t&#233; perquisitionn&#233; 
par des officiers de la justice militaire, de la police et de l&#8217;ANR mandat&#233;s par 
l&#8217;Auditeur sup&#233;rieur de garnison de Kisangani. La perquisition aurait eu lieu en 
pr&#233;sence des avocats du barreau de Kisangani et de t&#233;moins. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; qu&#8217;aucune 
preuve soutenant les charges retenues contre M. Yangambi n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; trouv&#233;e. Le 
m&#234;me jour, M. Getumbe aurait &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233; alors que M Yangambi &#233;tait transf&#233;r&#233; au 
Centre p&#233;nitentiaire et de r&#233;&#233;ducation de Kinshasa. 
</p>
<p> Le 18 novembre 2009, MM. Yangambi, Olangi, Kikunda et Lokundo 
auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s devant &#224; la Cour militaire de Kinshasa/Gombe. Lors de 
l&#8217;audience, MM. Kikunda et Olangi auraient d&#233;clar&#233; avoir &#233;t&#233; tortur&#233;s pendant leur </p>

</b></p>
<p>d&#233;tention. M. Yangambi aurait &#233;t&#233; priv&#233; de sommeil et de nourriture pendant 
plusieurs jours.  
</p>
<p> De graves craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que la condamnation &#224; mort 
de M. Yangambi et les condamnations &#224; 20 ans d&#8217;emprisonnement de MM. Olangi 
et Kikunda par un tribunal militaire fond&#233; sur des proc&#232;s verbaux d&#8217;interrogatoire 
men&#233;s sous la torture et sans la pr&#233;sence des avocats des pr&#233;venus. De tr&#232;s s&#233;rieuses 
craintes sont &#233;galement exprim&#233;es quant &#224; leur int&#233;grit&#233; physique et psychologique. 
</p>
<p>188. Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade nous prononcer sur les faits qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, nous 
souhaiterions attirer l&#8217;attention de votre Gouvernement sur le fait que bien que la peine de 
mort ne soit pas prohib&#233;e en droit international,, celle-ci a toujours &#233;t&#233; interpr&#233;t&#233;e par les 
principaux organes des Nations Unies comme constituant une exception au principe du 
droit fondamental &#224; la vie, qui ne peut &#234;tre prononc&#233;e que pour les crimes les plus graves.  
En l&#8217;occurrence, un examen approfondi et syst&#233;matique de la jurisprudence de l&#8217;ensemble 
des principaux organes des Nations Unies charg&#233;s d&#8217;interpr&#233;ter les dispositions concernant 
les crimes les plus graves r&#233;v&#232;le que la peine de mort ne peut &#234;tre impos&#233;e que dans le 
respect de la restriction selon laquelle elle doit &#234;tre cantonn&#233;e aux crimes les plus graves, 
aux cas o&#249; il peut &#234;tre d&#233;montr&#233; qu&#8217;il y avait intention de tuer et que cette intention a 
entra&#238;n&#233; la perte d&#8217;une vie humaine (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). La peine capitale devrait par 
cons&#233;quent &#234;tre exclue dans les cas de d&#233;tentions ill&#233;gales d&#8217;armes de guerre et de 
tentatives d'organisation d'un mouvement insurrectionnel. Comme le Comit&#233; de droits de 
l&#8217;homme a not&#233; dans son Observation g&#233;n&#233;rale n&#176; 32: &#171; Dans les affaires o&#249; l&#8217;accus&#233; risque 
la peine capitale, il va de soi qu&#8217;il doit b&#233;n&#233;ficier de l&#8217;assistance effective d&#8217;un avocat &#224; 
tous les stades de la proc&#233;dure &#187;, ce qui n&#8217;&#233;tait pas le cas au cours du proc&#232;s des MM 
Yangambi, Lokundo, Kikunda et Olangi. 
</p>
<p>189. Dans ce contexte, nous rappelons &#233;galement &#224; votre Gouvernement que l&#8217;article 15 
de la dite Convention stipule que &#171; Tout Etat parie veille &#224; ce que toute d&#233;claration dont il 
est &#233;tabli qu&#8217;elle &#224; &#233;t&#233; obtenue par la torture ne puisse &#234;tre invoqu&#233;e comme un &#233;l&#233;ment de 
preuve dans un proc&#233;dure, si ce n&#8217;est contre la personne accus&#233;e de torture pour &#233;tablir 
qu&#8217;une d&#233;claration a &#233;t&#233; faite. &#187; L&#8217;Assembl&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale, dans le paragraphe 7 de sa 
R&#233;solution A/RES/61/153 du 14 f&#233;vrier 2007, a r&#233;it&#233;r&#233; cette demande. 
</p>
<p>190. Dans le paragraphe 22 de son observation g&#233;n&#233;rale n&#176; 32, le Comit&#233; de droit de 
l&#8217;homme a &#233;voqu&#233; que &#171; Le jugement de civils par des tribunaux militaires ou d&#8217;exception 
devrait &#234;tre exceptionnel, c&#8217;est-&#224;-dire limit&#233; aux cas o&#249; l&#8217;&#201;tat partie peut d&#233;montrer que le 
recours &#224; de tels tribunaux est n&#233;cessaire et justifi&#233; par des raisons objectives et s&#233;rieuses et 
o&#249;, relativement &#224; la cat&#233;gorie sp&#233;cifique des personnes et des infractions en question, les 
tribunaux civils ordinaires ne sont pas en mesure d&#8217;entreprendre ces proc&#232;s. &#187; Cet argument 
&#233;tait aussi soutenu par le Comit&#233; dans sa d&#233;cision relative &#224; la communication no 
1172/2003 (Madani vs. Alg&#233;rie). Dans cette d&#233;cision, le Comit&#233; a stipul&#233; qu&#8217; &#171; Il incombe &#224; 
l&#8217;Etat partie poursuivant des civils devant des tribunaux militaires de justifier une telle 
pratique. Le Comit&#233; estime que l&#8217;Etat partie doit d&#233;montrer, relativement &#224; la cat&#233;gorie 
sp&#233;cifique des personnes en question, que les tribunaux civils ordinaires ne sont pas en 
mesure d&#8217;entreprendre ces proc&#232;s, que d&#8217;autres formes alternatives de tribunaux civils 
sp&#233;ciaux ou de haute s&#233;curit&#233; ne sont pas adapt&#233;es &#224; cette t&#226;che et que le recours &#224; des 
tribunaux militaires garantit la pleine protection des droits de l&#8217;accus&#233;, conform&#233;ment &#224; 
l&#8217;article 14.  [&#8230;] la simple invocation des dispositions juridiques internes pour le proc&#232;s par 
les tribunaux militaires de certaines cat&#233;gories de d&#233;lits graves ne peut justifier, aux termes 
du Pacte, le recours &#224; de tels tribunaux. &#187;  
</p>
<p>191. Dans son rapport sur sa visite en R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo, l&#8217;ancien 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial avait recommand&#233; que la justice civile devrait &#234;tre sensiblement 
renforc&#233;e, car c&#8217;est elle qui doit &#234;tre la seule comp&#233;tente pour juger des civils 
(A/HRC/8/4/Add.2, para. 77). </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Egypt has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 17 November 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.We would like to bring to 
the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information we have received concerning 
the death in custody of Mr Yusuf Hamdane Awad (Abu Zahri), aged 38, Palestinian 
national.  
</p>
<p><b> </b>According to information received  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>70  
</b></p>
<p> On 28 April 2008, Mr Yusuf Hamdane Awad (Abu Zahri) was arrested at the 
Egyptian-Palestine Border by the Egyptian State Security Intelligence (SSI). He was 
then held at the SSI headquarters in Al Arish for a period of two weeks before being 
transferred to the SSI headquarters in Nasr City, Cairo. Forty-five days later, he was 
moved to Burj al Arab Prison near Alexandria. During his detention he was 
frequently moved between the regional SSI building in Kom Dekka and the SSI 
headquarters in Nasr city for questioning. It is alleged that, while in custody, he was 
subjected to beatings, electrocution and sleep deprivation.  
</p>
<p> On 15 September 2009, he was taken to Kom Dekka for questioning and on 
19 September 2009, he was returned to Burj Al Arab prison. By this time his health 
had deteriorated, and he was sent to Alexandria University hospital for medical 
treatment. He was diagnosed with massive internal bleeding in his head and was 
kept at the intensive care unit for a period of two weeks. On 8 October 2009, he was 
taken back to Burj Al Arab Prison although he had not fully recovered.  
</p>
<p> On 10 October 2009 Mr Yusuf Hamdane Awad (Abu Zahri) was pronounced 
dead. The Egyptian authorities stated publicly that he had died of a heart and kidney 
failure due to a pre-existing condition. However, the permit for his burial issued by 
the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population indicated that the cause of death was 
under investigation. His body was sent to his family in Gaza, where an autopsy was 
conducted which indicated that the cause of death was a massive internal 
haemorrhage in the head.  
</p>
<p> It is alleged that the deceased was a brother of Mr Sami Abu Zahri, the 
spokesman for the Harakat al-Muq&#257;wamat al-Isl&#257;miya (HAMAS) and that he may 
have been detained because of his brother&#8217;s political affiliation.  
</p>
<p>201. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles under 
international law applicable to this case. Article 6 of the International Covenant for Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Egypt is a party, states that no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. Article 7 of the same Covenant provides that &#8220;[n]o one 
shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>202. When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  When an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this 
respect we would like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a 
custodial death case (Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 
(21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2): 
</p>
<p>203. While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo 
Dermit committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; 
yet, the inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities 
either by act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect 
his life, as required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>204. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting 
from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the 
&#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>71 
</b></p>
<p>4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>205. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring 
to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to 
the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to 
justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which Egypt is a Party. 
</p>
<p>206. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to carry out inquiries into the circumstances

</p>
<p>207. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con en relaci&#243;n con los 
asesinatos del Sr. Ramiro Rivera y de la Sra. Dora Alicia Recinos Sorto, las amenazas de 
muerte contra el Sr. Jos&#233; Santos Rodriguez, el esposo de la Sra. Recinos Sorto, y los actos 
de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas de muerte contra la Sra. Isabel G&#225;mez y los dem&#225;s miembros 
del personal de Radio Victoria. El Sr. Rivera era vicepresidente del Comit&#233; Ambiental de 
Caba&#241;as (CEC), una organizaci&#243;n que realiza actividades de informaci&#243;n sobre las 
consecuencias negativas de la miner&#237;a de oro tanto para la salud como para el medio 
ambiente, y en particular sobre el impacto de la contaminaci&#243;n con cianuro. La Sra. 
Recinos Sorto era integrante de la misma organizaci&#243;n. El Sr. Santos Rodr&#237;guez es 
miembro de la junta directiva del CEC. La Sra. G&#225;mez es periodista con Radio Victoria, 
una estaci&#243;n de radio del municipio de Victoria en Caba&#241;as que ha denunciado 
p&#250;blicamente a la empresa minera canadiense Pacific Rim por da&#241;o medioambiental y que 
tambi&#233;n ha denunciado el secuestro, tortura y asesinato del defensor del medio ambiente, el 
Sr. Marcelo Rivera, en junio de 2009. El Sr. Marcelo Rivera tambi&#233;n realizaba actividades 
de protesta contra la miner&#237;a.  
</p>
<p>208. La empresa minera canadiense Pacific Rim actualmente no est&#225; operando en la mina 
El Dorado en Caba&#241;as aunque busca su reapertura. Muchos opositores a la miner&#237;a han 
realizado manifestaciones protestando contra dicha reapertura por varias razones, entre 
ellas, la contaminaci&#243;n de los r&#237;os y la enorme extracci&#243;n de agua para el uso de la mina la 
cual genera una escasez de agua para el uso de la gente de la regi&#243;n. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas:  
</p>
<p> El 26 de diciembre de 2009, aproximadamente a las 3:30 horas de la tarde, la 
Sra. Recinos Sorto habr&#237;a sido asesinada mientras caminaba a su casa con su hijo de 
dos a&#241;os en sus brazos. La Sra. Recinos Sorto habr&#237;a estado en su octavo mes de 
embarazo cuando la habr&#237;an asesinado. El ni&#241;o de dos a&#241;os habr&#237;a sido herido en el 
incidente.  
</p>
<p> Durante el a&#241;o 2009, la Sra. Recinos Sorto habr&#237;a denunciado el hecho de que 
su esposo, el Sr. Santos Rodr&#237;guez, habr&#237;a recibido varias amenazas de muerte y que 
en varias ocasiones hombres armados no identificados habr&#237;an llegado a su casa 
preguntando por el paradero de su esposo. Asimismo, en mayo de 2008, el Sr. 
Santos Rodr&#237;guez habr&#237;a sido atacado con un machete.  
</p>
<p> En otro incidente, el 20 de diciembre de 2009, el Sr. Ramiro Rivera habr&#237;a 
sido asesinado a tiros mientras conduc&#237;a en su camioneta con un colega y una 
adolescente. Los agresores se habr&#237;an acercado a la camioneta y habr&#237;an disparado 
varias veces matando al Sr. Rivera y a su colega. La adolescente habr&#237;a sido herida 
en el incidente.  </p>

<p> El Sr. Ramiro Rivera habr&#237;a sido beneficiario de medidas de protecci&#243;n 
brindadas por la polic&#237;a tras un incidente el 7 de agosto de 2009 cuando habr&#237;a sido 
v&#237;ctima de una tentativa de asesinato.  
</p>
<p>Asimismo, se inform&#243; que, el 23 de diciembre de 2009, se habr&#237;a enviado una 
amenaza de muerte por correo electr&#243;nico a diecis&#233;is miembros del personal de 
Radio Victoria que dec&#237;a: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Bueno, ya mandamos al hoyo a dos, la pregunta es qui&#233;n va ser el tercero, 
ser&#225; acaso el Padre Quintanilla o alguno de los de la radio, no es mala idea seguir 
mejor con alguno de los bocones de la Radio Victoria&#8230; No importa que anden un 
batall&#243;n de polic&#237;as cuid&#225;ndolos detr&#225;s como perros, cuando lo queremos, las 
muertes van a seguir y nadie detiene la venganza iniciada, preferimos que el tercero 
de los muertos sea un locutor, o un corresponsal&#8230;, el blanco m&#225;s seguro es un 
locutor, cuidasen que no estamos jugando esta es la nueva ola de advertencias que 
estamos iniciando luego de quebrarnos a Ramiro&#8221; 
</p>
<p> El 24 de diciembre de 2009, ocho de las personas que habr&#237;an recibido la 
amenaza del d&#237;a anterior habr&#237;an recibido otro correo electr&#243;nico amenazante 
inform&#225;ndoles que ya habr&#237;an elegido a la persona que iban a asesinar. El 27 de 
diciembre de 2009, el d&#237;a despu&#233;s del asesinato de la Sra. Recinos Sorto, seis 
hombres armados no identificados habr&#237;an llegado a la casa de la Sra. G&#225;mez, una 
periodista de Radio Victoria. Los hombres se habr&#237;an asomado por las ventanas de la 
casa pero se habr&#237;an retirado cuando se dieron cuenta que la Sra. G&#225;mez no se 
encontraba en casa. 
</p>
<p>209. Se teme que los asesinatos de la Sra. Recinos Sorto y los Sres. Ramiro Rivera y 
Marcelo Rivera y las amenazas de muerte contra el Sr. Santos Rodr&#237;guez est&#233;n relacionados 
con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos, y en particular sus actividades de 
protesta contra la miner&#237;a en Caba&#241;as. Asimismo, se teme que las amenazas de muerte 
contra el personal de Radio Victoria est&#233;n relacionadas con el hecho de que han denunciado 
violaciones de derechos humanos, entre ellos, la tortura y asesinato del Sr. Marcelo Riveras. 
Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n que estos actos de agresi&#243;n y amenazas busquen intimidar a las 
organizaciones sociales en Caba&#241;as. Se expresa una profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la 
integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Sr. Santos Rodr&#237;guez y el personal de Radio Victoria.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed 
information provided by the Government of Ethiopia regarding the death sentences against 
Berhanu Nega, Melaku Teffera Tilahun, Andargachew Tsigie, Muluneh Iyoel Fage, and 
Mesfin Aman.  The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the provision in the 
Constitution requiring the death penalty to be imposed only as stipulated under law is 
inconsistent with the international law requirement that the death penalty can only be 
imposed for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur respectfully urges the 
Government to ensure the commutation of death sentences that do not meet the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221; requirement, and to take steps to prohibit the death sentence for crimes that 
do not meet the requirement.    
</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 11 March 2010</b>, sent with the Secial Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>224. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to 
information we have received regarding the death sentences imposed on Messrs. <b>Berhanu 
Nega, Melaku Teffera Tilahun, Andargachew Tsigie, Muluneh Iyoel Fage, and Mesfin 
Aman</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 22 December 2009, the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa sentenced to 
death Messrs. Berhanu Nega, Melaku Teffera Tilahun, Andargachew Tsigie, 
Muluneh Iyoel Fage, Mesfin Aman, on the charges of inter alia &#8220;conspiring to 
undermine the constitution and violently overthrow the government.&#8221; The five 
defendants used to be officials of the former opposition party, Coalition for Unity 
and Democracy. They are amongst the forty-six defendants who were tried for 
alleged links to what is known as the &#8220;May 14&#8221; (&#8220;Ginbot 7&#8221;) movement, which had 
the declared aim to overthrow the Ethiopian Government.   
</p>
<p> It is reported that thirteen of the defendants including Messrs. Berhanu Nega, 
Andargachew Tsigie, Muluneh Iyoel Fage, Mesfin Aman were tried in absentia.  
The court invoked as an aggravating circumstance their previous conviction of life 
imprisonment in relation to the 2005 post-election violence in Ethiopia for which 
they were later released on pardon. Of the total forty-six defendants who were tried 
in the case, forty were found guilty by the court on 18 November 2009, on all five 
counts as charged. Thirty-one defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment, while 
two others were sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment. Five defendants were 
acquitted of all charges and one other had been released earlier without having to 
defend his case.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>84  
</b></p>
<p> Most of the convicted defendants have reportedly appealed their sentences to 
the Federal Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>225. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully remind your Government that, although the death penalty is not 
prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life and as such, it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner 
and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes.  Article 6 (2) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that &#8220;In countries which have 
not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most 
serious crimes&#8230;&#8221; A thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the 
principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision 
indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that 
there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This 
would exclude charges of &#8220;conspiring to undermine the constitution and violently 
overthrow the government.&#8221; from those for which the death penalty can be imposed under 
international law.  
</p>
<p>226. The Human Rights Committee has pointed out that the expression &#8216;most serious 
crimes&#8217; must be read restrictively to mean that the death penalty should be a quite 
exceptional measure (HRC, General Comment 6 (1982)). Further the decision of the 
Committee in<i> Baboeram et al. v. Suriname</i> is instructive it was stated that &#8220;the deprivation 
of life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. This follows from the 
article as a whole and in particular is the reason why paragraph 2 of the article lays down 
that the death penalty may be imposed only for the most serious crimes. The requirements 
that the right shall be protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his 
life mean that the law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person 
may be deprived of his life by the authorities of a State&#8221; (Communication No. 146/1983 
and 148-154/1983 a/ Para 14)  
</p>
<p>227. With regard to the allegation that some of the defendants in the case were tried in 
absentia we would like to draw the attention of your Government to article 14 paragraph 3 
(d)  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that &#8220;in the 
determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the 
following minimum guarantees, in full equality to be tried in his presence, and to defend 
himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing.  
</p>
<p>228. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a 
summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge 
your Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law 
of Messer&#8217;s Berhanu Nega, Melaku Teffera Tilahun, Andargachew Tsigie and Muluneh 
Iyoel Fage, Mesfin Aman are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the 
death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns 
we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>229. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2.  In so far as your Excellency&#8217;s Government chooses to retain capital 
punishment, please explain the measures taken or planned to ensure that the 
convict&#8217;s due process rights are not violated during pre and post-conviction 
proceedings. </p>

<p><b>  Response of the Government of Ethiopia dated 29 April 2010  
</b></p>
<p><i>  General overview of the trial 
</i></p>
<p>230. A total of 46 defendants including Dr. Birhanu Nega (38th defendant), Mr. Melaku 
Tefera (24th defendant), Mr. Andargachew Tsige (39th defendant), Mr. Muluneh Iyoel (40th 
defendant) and Mr. Mesfine Aman(40th defendant) were charged with five different counts 
involving the commission of grave and specific offences in violation of the criminal code of 
the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (Federal Police Investigation File No. 
662/2009, Federal High Court Prosecutor File No. 03636/2009 and Federal High Court 
Criminal File No. 81406).  
</p>
<p>231. These offences include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; organizing or leading, as members of Ginbot 7, a revolt, mutiny or armed rebellion 
against government  officials and its institution (Federal Criminal Code Articles 
32(1), (a) (b), 38(1) and 240(1)(a)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; outrage against the constitutional order or the constitution by overthrowing, 
modifying or suspending the Federal Constitution or overthrowing or changing the 
constitutional order established through violence, threats, conspiracy or any other 
unlawful means (Articles 32(1), (a) (b), 38(1) 27(1) and 238(1)(a) and (b)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; publicly instigating or inciting refusal by members of the armed forces to serve in 
the military and commit desertion and mutiny (Articles 32(1), (a) (b), 38(1) (2), and 
247(c)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; recruiting, organizing or bringing into the country troops, guerillas, bandits or 
mercenaries, or importing, storing up or importing arms, munitions, provisions 
money or such material means (Articles 32(1), (a) (b), 38(1) (2), and 256(a) and (b)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; publicly promoting by a word of mouth, images or writing, or conspiring, planning 
or urging the formation of a band or a group; joins such a group, adheres to its 
schemes or obeys its instructions or enters into relations or establishes secrete 
communications with a foreign government, political party, organization or agent 
(Articles 32(1), (a) (b), 38(1) (2), and 257(a)(b)(c) and (d) of the Criminal Code of 
Ethiopia). 
</p>
<p>232. The trial of Mr. Melaku Tefera Tilahun and additional defendants was held in their 
presence, with due respect and observance of the federal constitution and the relevant 
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. On the other hand, the trial of Dr. Birhanu 
Nega, Mr. Andargachew Tsige, Mr. Muluneh Iyoel, Mr. Mesfin Aman and a few others 
were held in absentia owing to the fact that the aforementioned individuals were not present 
in the territory of Ethiopia during the period in which the trial was held.  All the defendants 
were adequately informed of the nature of the charges brought against them and were given 
the same in writing. Upon the fulfillments of the requirements stipulated under the Criminal 
Procedure Code, the Court then ordered the production of prosecution evidence. The 
Federal prosecutor summoned 89 witnesses and produced over 1500 pages of documentary 
evidence, 8 audio cassettes, one additional audio CD cassette and 8 minutes long video. It 
also produced additional exhibits including electronics and communication equipments. 
Moreover, statements of confession by the defendants as recorded in the police 
investigation report and the preliminary inquiry was introduced to the Court. These pieces 
of evidence showed how the defendants from the very beginning planned and organized a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>86  
</b></p>
<p>violent overthrow of the constitutional order by means of force, and were involved in 
executing the aforementioned crimes.  
</p>
<p>233. The Federal High Court, after examining the sufficiency of the various facet of the 
prosecution evidence, established that with the exception of one of the defendants, the 
evidence produced by the Prosecutor has provided a prima facie case against all other 
defendants. It therefore granted full trial and requested the defendants to respond to the 
charges leveled against them. The defendants did so by producing 95 witnesses and 
furnishing additional documentary evidence. Upon a scrupulous examination of the oral, 
documentary, audio, video and other evidences produced by the prosecutor and the defense 
counsel and pursuant with the relevant provisions of the Federal Criminal Code, the Federal 
High Court passed a verdict of conviction against all but six defendants. As regards the 
remaining six defendants, the Court rendered an acquittal order . 
</p>
<p>234. The ruling of the court gave due regard to the defendants&#8217; personal circumstances or 
the circumstances of the particular offence( Tompson v. St Vincent and the Grenadines. 
Communication No. 806/1998. CCPR/C/70/D/806/1998).  The defendants were offered the 
opportunity to submit their opinion to the court as to the individual circumstances that 
should be taken into consideration by the Court as mitigating conditions before rendering 
the final ruling on sentencing. Ensuring the fulfillments of all the procedural requirements 
and having examined the opinions submitted by both the prosecutor and the defense with 
regard to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the Court  rendered death sentence 
against Mr. Melaku Tefera Tilahun, Dr. Birhanu Nega Bonger, Mr. Andargachew Tsigae 
Hailemariam, Mr. Muluneh Euale Fagae and Mr. Mesfin Aman. It also sentenced the other 
defendants to imprisonment of various degrees. 
</p>
<p>235. The five defendants were sentenced to death in accordance with Article 117 of the 
Criminal Code, on the ground that the defendants were found to have committed four 
serious offenses, the dangerous and repeated criminal acts of the defendants and the 
absence of extenuating circumstance to mitigate the punishment. In the presence of these 
factual as well as evidentiary reasons the death sentence that was rendered by the Court was 
both legal and legitimate. The Federal High Court has considered and determined the 
existence of aggravating circumstances in its conviction ruling. The defendants had 
previously been charged with five counts and were found guilty and sentenced to 15 years 
rigorous imprisonment by a Federal High Court (File No. 42246 and 46990). Following this 
conviction, the defendants, through facilitation by traditional elders, requested the 
government and the people of Ethiopia for a pardon in June 2008 and were released on 
conditional pardon. Shortly after, however they were found to be involved in the 
commission of similar offences which triggered the revocation of the pardon pursuant to the 
federal proclamation governing the granting and revocation of pardon. Moreover, the 
manner in which the defendants executed the offense and the nature of the offense 
themselves aggravate the crime in line with Article 258 of the Federal Criminal Code which 
authorizes the Court  to pass a sentence of death &#8220; where the acts involve a conspiracy 
brought to fruits carried out by an organized armed band.&#8221; Moreover it is evident from the 
records of the Court that the defendants failed to provide to the Court any possible grounds 
as mitigating circumstances.  
</p>
<p>236. The trial process took place in a context which respected due process. The rights of 
the defendants to their human dignity, communication with and visit by their spouses, close 
relatives, friends, religious councilors, medical doctors and legal counselor and other basic 
right were respected in accordance with article 10(1) and (2) of the international covenant 
on civil and political rights(ICCPR), UN Standards Rules for the treatment of prisoners, 
article 21(1) and (2) of the Constitution and proclamation No.365/2003 which establishes 
the federal Prisons.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>87 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Death penalty under Ethiopian law  
</i></p>
<p>237. The joint letter also raises questions with regard to the sentencing of the 
aforementioned individuals with death penalty. It is stated that death penalty shall be 
imposed under extreme cases or circumstances and it should relate to crimes that has 
resulted in the loss of human life. The comprehensive list of the existing international and 
regional human rights instruments ratified by Ethiopia do not prohibit the application of 
death penalty (General Comment 6, CCPR , 1982, para6). And this has been correctly 
acknowledged in the letter. States have the sovereign authority to enact criminal laws that 
may provide for the application of death penalty as a punishment for criminal conviction by 
a competent court of law based on accepted international norms and standards.  Paragraph 2 
of Article 6 of the ICCPR clearly provides that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the 
time of the commission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present 
covenant--- This penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment 
rendered by a competent court.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>238. In addition, sub-article 4 of the above mentioned Article further stipulates that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of 
the sentence, amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be 
granted in all cases.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>239. The Ethiopian legal system protects the fundamental right to life as provided for 
both under international and regional human rights instruments. According to Article 15 of 
the FDRE Constitution, every person has the right to life. Both the constitution and the 
revised criminal code provide a framework for a very restrictive interpretation of 
exceptions to this fundamental right. Article 15 of the Constitution stipulates: &#8220; No person 
may be deprived of his life except as a punishment for a <i>serious criminal offence 
determined by law.&#8221; </i>Accordingly, not only ought the crime be serious and grave, but its 
determination must also be made based on a clear stipulation in the law. Moreover, the 
2003 Criminal Law of the FDRE has prescribed death penalty as a punishment only for the 
most serious offences. As per to Article 117 of the Criminal Law, death penalty will be 
passed for the most serious crime which has exhausted all the possible legal routes.  For a 
sentence of death penalty to be implemented, the special part of the code which makes the 
act a crime should specifically stipulate that that the particular crime is punishable by death 
penalty. Therefore the law in Ethiopia guarantees the fundamental right to life, provide for 
the application of death penalty only for &#8220; the most serious crimes&#8221; and provides ample 
opportunities for commutations.  
</p>
<p>240. The defendants against whom capital punishment is imposed have committed very 
serious and grave crimes. They were found guilty on all the five counts. They instigated the 
army to commit mutinous crime. It has been proved beyond any doubt by oral testimonies, 
documents, video and audio evidence that the defendants along with three different anti-
peace organizations (democratic guard, military alliance and Genbot 7) formed an 
association and organizing member of the armed forces which were expelled on the 
grounds of discipline and other active members of the armed as well as police force with a 
motive of achieving their purpose and with premeditated intention to instigate armed revolt 
and mutiny. The close reading of the court's file vividly indicates that the court rendered the 
death penalty against the defendants in accordance with, the appropriate provisions of the 
Criminal Code of Ethiopia. The other defendants were found by the Court for trying to 
commit a crime against the Constitution and the constitutional order by means of violence 
and conspiracy and had been punished by the Court ranging from rigorous up to life 
imprisonment. Among these defendants some were granted pardon for previous crimes </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>88  
</b></p>
<p>based on their request but instead of learning from their mistakes they were found involved 
in the commission of other crimes. This shows the exceptional nature of the crime 
committed by the defendants and the absence of any serious extenuating circumstances.  
</p>
<p>241. With respect to the execution of the penalty, it should be noted that the death penalty 
passed by a court would only be executed where the president has given his or her approval. 
Furthermore, without investigating the possibility of non-execution of the death sentence 
through amnesty or pardon or any other forms of commutation, it cannot be executed. This 
has encouraged a development with respect to a practice in Ethiopia which may be likened, 
as acknowledged in the Human Rights Council&#8217;s report on Ethiopia&#8217;s report under the 
Universal Periodic Review to a <i>de facto</i> moratorium.  
</p>
<p><i>  Due process and trial in absentia 
</i></p>
<p>242. Four out of the five defendants who have been sentenced to death have been tried in 
absentia. The proceeding has been held pursuant to 161(2)(a) of the Criminal procedure 
Code of Ethiopia which states that a person who is charged  with an offence punishable 
with rigorous imprisonment for not less than twelve years can be tried in absence if he fails 
to appear before court.  The Government shares the position held by the special rapporteurs 
that international human rights instruments  particularly article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides guarantees to everyone charged with a 
crime &#8220; to be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal 
assistance of his own choosing.&#8217;  This notwithstanding this, it is the government&#8217;s view that 
trial in absentia is not inconsistent with applicable international human rights law which 
does not prescribe a blanket prohibition of trial in absentia (General Comment 13, CCPR, 
1984, para. 11). Human rights treaty bodies held that trial in absentia, if undertaken in 
keeping with certain minimum procedural guarantees, are not incompatible with article 14 
of ICCPR (Communication No. 16/79 (Mbenge v. Zaire; Ali Maleki v. Italy, 
Communication No. 699/1996).  
</p>
<p>243. Every effort has been made to guarantee the rights of all the defendants to appear 
before the court in line with article 14(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR).  FDRE Constitution and the Ethiopian criminal procedure code 
provide for due process protection, namely, fair hearing, presumption of innocence, 
minimum guarantee for the defense and the right to have a case reviewed by a higher 
courts. These procedural requirements are identified as prerequisites particularly in cases 
involving the imposition of the death penalty (General Comment 6, CCPR, 1982, para 7.) 
Summons has been communicated through the official gazette, radio and TV. 
</p>
<p>244. The cases of all the 46 defendants have been brought to a public trial and their cases 
have been heard by an ordinary court within a reasonable period of time in accordance with 
Article 14(3)(c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 
20(1) of the FDRE Constitution. In line with Article 3(a) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and Article 20(2) of the FDRE Constitution, the rights of the 
accused to be informed with sufficient particulars of the charge brought against them in a 
language they understand and be provided with the charges in writing have been respected.  
In accordance with Article 14(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and Article 20(3) of the FDRE Constitution, the rights of the accused to be presumed 
innocent until proven guilty according to the law they have been accused by and not to be 
compelled to testify against themselves have been duly respected. 
</p>
<p>245. All the accused who were present during the whole trail stage in person, have been 
able to examine by themselves or through their legal representatives all the human, 
documentary, audio and video evidences brought against themselves in accordance with 
Article 14(e) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 20(4) 
of the FDRE Constitution. In addition, they were allowed to defend all the charges and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>89 
</b></p>
<p>evidences brought against them and they were able to produce documentary and 
photographic evidences and heard before a court on their defense. 
</p>
<p>246. In accordance with Article 14(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and Article 20(5) of the FDRE Constitution, the accused have been informed of their 
right to be presented by legal counsel of their choice, and if they do not have sufficient 
means to pay for it due to the fact that there would be miscarriage of justice, they were 
informed of their right to be provided with legal representation at state expense. 
Accordingly, they declined the legal representation at the state expense and opted to be 
presented by legal counsel of their own choice.  Hence, the court provided them with a 
reasonable period of time until they find a legal counsel of their choice and all the accused 
who took part in the trial were represented by a total of 6 legal counsels and litigated up to 
the end. Furthermore, there was no accused, among those who took part during the trail in 
person, without a legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>247. During the conducting of the trail, from the beginning until the end, it was made 
possible for the accused to understand every process in the court in a language they 
understand. Starting from 24th April 2009 where the arrest of the 46 accused begun until 
22nd December 2009 where the final decision have been passed, works in relation with the 
investigation work by the police, the preparation of the charges and presentation of 
evidences and litigation by the Federal Public Prosecutor, hearing of the evidences 
produced by both sides and passing of decision after looking into all the evidences have 
been conducted. The finalizing of the trial in 8 months period of time when viewed from 
the large number of the accused, the variety and numerous nature of evidences produced by 
both sides and the complexity of the crimes, shows the fact that all the accused have got a 
speedy decision. 
</p>
<p><i>  Appeal process  
</i></p>
<p>248. An appeal has been lodged before the Federal Supreme Court against the judgment 
of the Federal High Court. The case is therefore currently pending before the federal 
Supreme Court. This is in full compliance with Human Rights Committee&#8217;s General 
Comment No. 13 wherein it is provided that any conviction with respect to capital crimes 
should be reviewed by an appellate court.  
</p>
<p><i>  Conclusion 
</i></p>
<p>249. After examining the evidence presented to it by the prosecutor and defense, the 
Federal High Court  has established that Dr.Birhanu Nega Bonger, Ato Melaku Tefera 
Tilahun, Ato Andargachew Tsege Haile Giorgis, Ato Mulunehe Eyuel and Ato Mesfin 
Aman along with other 41 defendants have committed a very serious crime under the 
Ethiopian federal criminal code. It has also shown that a stringent due process guarantees 
were ensured in keeping with domestic legislations and international standards as enshrined 
in the ICCPR. International human rights instruments and customary law do not provide a 
blanket prohibition of death penalty. Neither do they prohibit the trial of persons in 
absentia. The Ethiopian domestic legislation guarantees the fundamental right to life and 
provides protection from summary execution.  
</p>
<p>250.  It is the government&#8217;s sincere hope that this reply has sufficiently addressed 
your concerns. As the case is now pending before the federal Supreme Court, it is perhaps 
appropriate to let the domestic legal system take its course.  </p>

<p><b>Character of reply</b>: No response

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>:  The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of the Gambia has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given 
by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 29 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression . 
</p>
<p>251. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the recent speech of the President 
of the Gambia, Colonel A.J.J Jammeh, allegedly threatening human rights defenders and 
anyone who seeks to &#8220;destabilise&#8221; the country. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 21 September 2009, President Jammeh delivered a speech on the state-
owned Gambia Radio and Television Services (GRTS), where he allegedly 
threatened to kill human rights defenders in the Gambia, together with anyone who 
seeks to &#8220;destabilise&#8221; the country. Some excerpts of his speech read as follows: 
&#8220;What I want to make very clear to everybody and those so-called human rights 
campaigners is that I will never allow anyone to destabilise this country. [&#8230;] If you 
think that you can collaborate with so-called human rights defenders, and get away 
with it, you must be living in a dream world. I will kill you, and nothing will come 
out of it. If you are affiliated with any human rights group, be rest (<i>sic</i>) assured that 
your security is not guaranteed by my Government. We are ready to kill saboteurs.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Deep concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of all 
human rights defenders in the Gambia, including all personnel and persons working 
with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which has its 
headquarters in Banjul, and which will be holding its 46th ordinary session from 11 
to 25 November 2009. The content of the speech is of particular concern as it 
follows a recent case of six journalists who were arrested and sentenced to two years 
of imprisonment and fined 250,000 Dalasis (US$10,000) for criticizing the 
government regarding the lack of investigation into the murder of journalist Mr. 
Deydra Hydara, which was the subject of our urgent appeal sent to your 
Excellency&#8217;s government on 12 August 2009. While we welcome the fact that the 
journalists were later released on a presidential pardon, we remain concerned that 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression is being stifled in the Gambia and 
that all persons who voice criticism of the government are now exposed to heighted 
risk to their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>252. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to life, physical and 
mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>91 
</b></p>
<p>253. We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of all persons, including 
human rights defenders in the Gambia, in accordance with fundamental principles as set 
forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone 
shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, 
in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>254. We would further like to reiterate the principle enunciated in Resolution 2005/38 of 
the Commission on Human Rights, which, while noting that article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the exercise of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities, calls 
on States to refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with paragraph 3 of 
that article, including on (i) discussion of government policies and political debate; 
reporting on human rights, government activities and corruption in government; engaging 
in election campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or 
democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief, including by persons 
belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>255. Furthermore, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the 
Declaration which provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with 
others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, 
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of 
the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, 
individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in 
reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>256. Moreover, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
the following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in 
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and 
that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and 
implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such 
steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, 
political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all 
persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to 
enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 5 point a) which establishes that for the purpose of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, at the national and international levels, to meet or assemble 
peacefully. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 5 points b) and c) which provide that for the purpose of promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right to form, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

</p>

</b></p>
<p>join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups, and 
to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6 point a) which provides that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as 
to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or 
administrative systems. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6 points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in 
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other 
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 13  (b) and (c) which stipulate that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express 
purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedom, 
through peaceful means. 
</p>
<p>257. We would like to urge your Excellency's Government to take all necessary steps to 
protect the life, physical and psychological integrity of all Gambian human rights defenders 
as well as all personnel and persons working with the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; rights. We would welcome any clarification on this issue and we trust that your 
Excellency's Government will reaffirm its position to protect and promote fundamental 
rights and freedoms for all and the essential role human rights defenders play in this regard.

<p>258. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente de Su Gobierno la 
informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el asesinato del Sr. Fausto Leonel Otz&#237;n 
Poy&#243;n, abogado maya, ex-director ejecutivo de la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados Mayas y uno de 
los fundadores de la Asociaci&#243;n Juvenil en Solidaridad y Apoyo (AJESA). El Sr. Otz&#237;n

<p> El 18 de octubre de 2009, el Sr. Otz&#237;n Poy&#243;n habr&#237;a sido localizado en el 
fondo de un barranco en San Juan Comalapa, departamento de Chimaltenango, 
despu&#233;s de s&#243;lo un d&#237;a de haber desaparecido. Su cuerpo habr&#237;a presentado se&#241;ales 
visibles de tortura as&#237; como heridas de machete. El Sr. Otz&#237;n Poy&#243;n habr&#237;a muerto 
poco despu&#233;s de que se le hubiera encontrado.   
</p>
<p> Cabe a&#241;adir que el Sr. Otz&#237;n Poy&#243;n recientemente habr&#237;a recibido varios 
mensajes en su tel&#233;fono amenaz&#225;ndole de muerte. 
</p>
<p>259. Se teme que el asesinato del Sr. Otz&#237;n Poy&#243;n est&#233; relacionado con las actividades 
leg&#237;timas que realizaba en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular de los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas.  
</p>
<p>260. Asimismo, quisi&#233;ramos expresar nuestra profunda preocupaci&#243;n por el deterioro de 
la seguridad de los defensores de los derechos humanos y por la impunidad generalizada 
que prevalece en relaci&#243;n con los actos de agresi&#243;n y violencia cometidos contra ellos. 
Nosotros de acuerdo con lo dicho por la entonces Representante Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los defensores de derechos humanos en su informe al Consejo de Derechos Humano en 
febrero de 2009 quien consideraba dudoso que la situaci&#243;n de los defensores y de los 
derechos humanos en general pueda mejorar sin un claro punto de inflexi&#243;n en materia de 
impunidad. El Gobierno de su Excelencia tiene la responsabilidad de investigar de manera 
exhaustiva las violaciones cometidas contra los defensores de derechos humanos y enjuiciar 
a sus autores. Asimismo, el Gobierno de su Excelencia debe condenar firmemente cualquier 
ataque contra los defensores de derechos humanos, tomando la oportunidad para reconocer 
la importancia de su labor. 
</p>
<p>261. Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, en este contexto, 
deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales 
enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de Naciones Unidas sobre el derecho y el deber de los 
individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos humanos y 
las libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos y en particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. 
&#201;stos establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene derecho, individual o 
colectivamente, a promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y las libertades fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional y que es la 
responsabilidad primordial y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger, promover y hacer 
efectivos todos los derechos humanos, adoptando las medidas necesarias para crear las 
condiciones sociales, econ&#243;micas, pol&#237;ticas y de otra &#237;ndole, as&#237; como las garant&#237;as jur&#237;dicas 
requeridas para que toda persona sometida a su jurisdicci&#243;n, individual o colectivamente, 
pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p>262. Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, 
presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona 
tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes 
nacionales al reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con 
inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia 
perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>

de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient tir&#233; en l&#8217;air mais &#233;galement ouvert le feu en direction de la foule. 
Certaines sources font &#233;tat de la participation de mercenaires d&#8217;origine du Liberia 
parmi les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; lors la r&#233;pression de la manifestation. Plus de 150 
personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;es et plus d&#8217;un millier bless&#233;es. Plusieurs corps de 
manifestants porteraient des traces de blessures multiples, caus&#233;es par arme &#224; feu et 
par des armes blanches, notamment des couteaux et ba&#239;onnettes.  
</p>
<p> De nombreuses femmes participant &#224; la manifestation ou se trouvant dans la 
zone auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233;, d&#233;shabill&#233;es et soumises &#224; des 
violences sexuelles, notamment des attouchements, des viols, y compris collectifs, 
aussi bien dans le stade que plus tard dans des lieux de d&#233;tention.  
</p>
<p> Suite &#224; la manifestation, pendant plusieurs heures, de nombreuses personnes, 
y compris des bless&#233;s, auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es &#224; leur domicile, dans la rue ainsi que 
dans des h&#244;pitaux. Il a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que ces personnes risquent d&#8217;&#234;tre tortur&#233;es ou de 
dispara&#238;tre. Certaines familles n&#8217;auraient toujours aucune nouvelle de leurs proches 
qui auraient particip&#233; &#224; la manifestation.  
</p>
<p> Plusieurs dizaines de manifestants seraient encore d&#233;tenus, notamment dans 
les camps militaires de Alpha Yalla Diallo et Koundara, au quartier g&#233;n&#233;ral de la 
Compagnie mobile d&#8217;intervention et de s&#233;curit&#233; ainsi que dans un centre de 
d&#233;tention g&#233;r&#233; par la Gendarmerie, le PM-3.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, aucune 
de ces personnes d&#233;tenues depuis le 28 septembre n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e &#224; un juge. 
</p>
<p> Le 29 septembre 2009, dans la banlieue de Conakry, les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; 
auraient ouvert le feu sur des jeunes qui se trouvaient dans la rue causant la mort de 
trois adolescents, un &#224; Cosa et deux &#224; Wanidara.  
</p>
<p> Des membres des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;enl&#232;vement de 
cadavres des lieux de la manifestation ainsi que des h&#244;pitaux et les auraient 
emmen&#233;s dans des lieux inconnus. A l&#8217;h&#244;pital Ignace Deen de Conakry, plusieurs 
dizaines de corps auraient ainsi &#233;t&#233; emport&#233;s. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, ces 
enl&#232;vements de cadavres auraient pour objectif de dissimuler les corps des victimes.  
</p>
<p>271. Sans vouloir &#224; ce stade nous prononcer sur les faits qui nous ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, nous 
souhaiterions n&#233;anmoins intervenir aupr&#232;s de votre Excellence afin de tirer au clair les 
circonstances ayant provoqu&#233; les faits all&#233;gu&#233;s ci-dessus et ce, conform&#233;ment aux 
dispositions pertinentes de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;homme, du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits civils et politiques et de la Convention contre la torture et 
autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants. 
</p>
<p>272.  Nous aimerions rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence les principes 
fondamentaux &#233;nonc&#233;s par l&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;homme et </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>97 
</b></p>
<p>r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s par l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, o&#249; il est 
stipul&#233; que tout individu a le droit &#224; la vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit 
&#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par la loi, et que nul ne peut &#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. 
</p>
<p>273. Nous voudrions &#233;galement rappeler au Gouvernement de votre Excellence 
l&#8217;applicabilit&#233; dans de telles situations des Principes de base sur le recours &#224; la force et 
l'utilisation des armes &#224; feu par les responsables de l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 1989/65 
du 24 mai 1989 du Conseil &#233;conomique et social.  Ceux-ci pr&#233;voient que les responsables 
de l'application des lois, dans l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions, auront recours autant 
que possible &#224; des moyens non-violents, en d&#233;limitant le recours &#224; la force &#224; certains cas 
exceptionnels comme la l&#233;gitime d&#233;fense ou pour d&#233;fendre des tiers contre une menace 
imminente de mort ou de blessure grave. Nous souhaiterions &#233;galement attirer votre 
attention sur  le Code de conduite pour les responsables de l'application des lois, r&#233;solution 
34/169 du 17 d&#233;cembre 1979 de l'Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale qui stipule que les responsables de 
l'application des lois peuvent recourir &#224; la force seulement lorsque cela est strictement 
n&#233;cessaire et dans la mesure exig&#233;e par l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions.  
</p>
<p>274. Par ailleurs, nous prions le Gouvernement de votre Excellence de diligenter 
promptement une enqu&#234;te sur les violations des droits de l&#8217;homme, incluant les d&#233;c&#232;s qui 
ont eu lieu le 28 et le 29 septembre 2009, commises lors de la manifestation &#224; Conakry et 
au cours des op&#233;rations des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; qui ont eu lieu suite &#224; celle-ci, et de traduire 
les responsables en justice s&#8217;il est d&#233;termin&#233; que les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; ont eu recours &#224; un 
usage excessif de la force, conform&#233;ment aux principes relatifs &#224; la pr&#233;vention efficace des 
ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, r&#233;solution 1989/65 du 24 mai 1989 du Conseil &#233;conomique et 
social. En particulier les principes 9 &#224; 19 obligent les Gouvernements &#224; mener des enqu&#234;tes 
approfondies et impartiales dans tous les cas o&#249; l&#8217;on soup&#231;onnera des ex&#233;cutions 
extrajudiciaires, arbitraires ou sommaires; &#224; rendre publiques les conclusions d&#8217;enqu&#234;tes; et 
&#224; veiller &#224; ce que les personnes dont l&#8217;enqu&#234;te aura r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; qu&#8217;elles ont particip&#233; &#224; de telles 
ex&#233;cutions soient traduites en justice. Des proc&#233;dures et des services officiels d&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
doivent &#234;tre maintenus, et les plaignants, les t&#233;moins, les personnes charg&#233;es de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te et 
leurs familles doivent &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233;s contre les violences ou tout autre forme d&#8217;intimidation. 
Ces principes incluent aussi le devoir d&#8217;effectuer une autopsie ad&#233;quate, impartiale et 
ind&#233;pendante, afin de d&#233;terminer les causes de d&#233;c&#232;s des victimes potentielles. Tant qu&#8217;une 
telle autopsie n&#8217;a pas eu lieu aucune disposition ne peut &#234;tre prise au sujet de la d&#233;pouille 
mortelle. La famille du d&#233;funt a &#233;galement le droit d&#8217;&#234;tre avis&#233;e de la cause du d&#233;c&#232;s 
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;e par l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. 
</p>
<p>275. Concernant les all&#233;gations de violence faite aux femmes, nous souhaiterions rappeler 
au Gouvernement de votre Excellence l&#8217;article 4 (b) de la D&#233;claration sur l'&#233;limination de la 
violence &#224; l'&#233;gard des femmes qui pr&#233;cise que les Etats devraient mettre en &#339;uvre sans 
retard, par tous les moyens appropri&#233;s, une politique visant &#224; &#233;liminer la violence &#224; l'&#233;gard 
des femmes et, &#224; cet effet, s'abstenir de tout acte de violence &#224; l'&#233;gard des femmes.  De plus, 
l&#8217;article 4 (c et d) de cette m&#234;me D&#233;claration pr&#233;cise que les Etats ont le devoir d&#8217;agir avec 
la diligence voulue pour pr&#233;venir les actes de violence &#224; l'&#233;gard des femmes, enqu&#234;ter sur 
ces actes et les punir conform&#233;ment &#224; la l&#233;gislation nationale, qu'ils soient perp&#233;tr&#233;s par 
l'Etat ou par des personnes priv&#233;es. Les &#233;tats doivent aussi pr&#233;voir dans la l&#233;gislation 
nationale p&#233;nale, civile, du travail ou administrative les sanctions voulues pour punir et 
r&#233;parer les torts caus&#233;s aux femmes soumises &#224; la violence; les femmes victimes d'actes de 
violence devraient avoir acc&#232;s &#224; l'appareil judiciaire et la l&#233;gislation nationale devrait 
pr&#233;voir des r&#233;parations justes et efficaces du dommage subi; les Etats devraient en outre 
informer les femmes de leur droit &#224; obtenir r&#233;paration par le biais de ces m&#233;canismes. 
</p>
<p>276. Pour ce qui a trait aux all&#233;gations de la d&#233;tention continue de manifestants, nous 
faisons appel au Gouvernement de votre Excellence afin que les droits des personnes 
d&#233;tenues soient respect&#233;s et qu&#8217;elles ne soient pas priv&#233;es arbitrairement de leur libert&#233; et </p>

<p>284. Se ha informado que el Sr. Pedro Mandiel, uno de los simpatizantes del presidente 
Zelaya que trataba de llegar a la frontera con Nicaragua para expresarle su apoyo, habr&#237;a 
sido detenido la noche del 24 de julio de 2009 por agentes de la polic&#237;a por presunto 
incumplimiento del toque de queda. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, existir&#237;an testigos que 
habr&#237;an presenciado c&#243;mo el Sr. Mandiel era introducido en un autom&#243;vil de la polic&#237;a. 
Asimismo, se inform&#243; que, alrededor de las 9 horas del d&#237;a siguiente, su cuerpo fue 
encontrado sin vida a unos doscientos metros de un ret&#233;n policial y militar situado a la 
altura del desv&#237;o a Alacuca, en la carretera que conduce a la frontera de Las Manos. La 
informaci&#243;n recibida tambi&#233;n se&#241;ala que su cuerpo tendr&#237;a signos de tortura. 
</p>
<p>285. Adem&#225;s, se ha informado que el Sr. Vilches Almendares habr&#237;a sido detenido el 
mismo d&#237;a y bajo las mismas circunstancias. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en los registros 
policiales constar&#237;a que el Sr. Vilches Almendares habr&#237;a sido detenido y liberado esa 
misma noche. Sin embargo, su destino y paradero contin&#250;an desconocidos. 
</p>
<p>286. Sin que ello implique, en modo alguno, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, nos 
permitimos recordar al Gobierno de Su Excelencia los principios fundamentales 
consagrados en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos, el Pacto Internacional 
de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la Protecci&#243;n de todas las Personas

<p>287. En este contexto, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n de su Gobierno al p&#225;rrafo 1 de la 
Resoluci&#243;n del Consejo de Derechos Humanos 8/8, la cual &#8220;Condena todas las formas de 
tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, que est&#225;n y seguir&#225;n 
estando prohibidos en todo momento y en todo lugar y que, por lo tanto, no pueden 
justificarse nunca, y exhorta a todos los gobiernos a que respeten plenamente la prohibici&#243;n 
de la tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes. 
</p>
<p>288. Quisi&#233;ramos recordar al Gobierno de su Excelencia el art&#237;culo 13 de la Convenci&#243;n 
sobre la Tortura, el cual se&#241;ala que &#8220;todo Estado Parte velar&#225; por que toda persona que 
alegue haber sido sometida a tortura en  cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n tenga 
derecho a presentar una queja y a que su caso sea pronta e imparcialmente examinado por 
sus autoridades competentes. Se tomar&#225;n medidas para asegurar que quien presente la queja

Gobierno de su Excelencia el p&#225;rrafo 6 (b) y (e) de la Resoluci&#243;n 8/8 del Consejo de 
Derechos Humanos, aprobada en Junio de 2008, el cual insta a los Estados a que &#8220;adopten 
medidas constantes, decididas y eficaces para que toda denuncia de torturas o de otros 
tratos o penas crueles inhumanos o degradantes sea examinada r&#225;pida e imparcialmente por 
la autoridad nacional competente, para que las personas que fomente, ordenen, toleren o 
cometan actos de tortura sean declaradas responsables y sancionadas severamente, 
incluidos los funcionarios a cargo del lugar de detenci&#243;n en que haya tenido lugar el acto 
prohibido [&#8230;], y que &#8220;velen por que las v&#237;ctimas de la tortura o de otros tratos o penas 
crueles, inhumanos o degradantes obtengan reparaci&#243;n y reciban una indemnizaci&#243;n justa y 
adecuada, as&#237; como servicios sociales y m&#233;dicos apropiados de rehabilitaci&#243;n, y, a este 
respecto, alienta la creaci&#243;n de centros de rehabilitaci&#243;n para las v&#237;ctimas de la tortura&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>289. Deseamos tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las 
normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el 
Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Los art&#237;culos 3 y 6 de estos 
instrumentos garantizan a todo individuo los derechos a la vida y a la seguridad de su 
persona y disponen que este derecho sea protegido por la ley y que nadie sea 
arbitrariamente privado de su vida. Adem&#225;s, seg&#250;n los art&#237;culos 2 y 10, los Estados se 
comprometen a respetar y a garantizar el derecho de toda persona privada de libertad a ser 
tratada humanamente y con el respeto debido a la dignidad inherente al ser humano.  </p>

una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de todos los casos en que haya 
sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, incluyendo una autopsia 
adecuada; a publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por

<p>296. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n descrita a 
continuaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas: 
</p>
<p> Decenas de personas que se manifestaban ante la Embajada de Brasil en 
Tegucigalpa en favor de la restituci&#243;n en el poder del presidente destituido Manuel 
Zelaya, habr&#237;an sido detenidas desde que &#233;ste regres&#243; al pa&#237;s el 21 de septiembre de 
</p><p>2009. Se afirma que elementos policiales habr&#237;an recurrido a un uso excesivo de la 
fuerza en la disoluci&#243;n de las manifestaciones callejeras en favor del presidente 
Zelaya y en la detenci&#243;n a gran escala de los manifestantes. A algunos manifestantes 
los elementos policiales les habr&#237;an golpeado e incluso habr&#237;an sido v&#237;ctimas de 
disparos. Otros habr&#237;an sido conducidos a centros de detenci&#243;n no autorizados, sin 
contar con ning&#250;n registro de su detenci&#243;n. Aunque la mayor&#237;a habr&#237;an sido ya 
liberados, otros permanecen en detenci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p> Asimismo, se ha recibido informaci&#243;n de que cinco personas habr&#237;an 
resultado muertas en los disturbios pol&#237;ticos que han tenido lugar desde el 21 de 
septiembre. El 22 de septiembre Jos&#233; Jacobo Euceda Perdomo, de 18 a&#241;os resultaba </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>muerto por disparos de la polic&#237;a en San Pedro Sula. Las cuatro otras personas 
habr&#237;an muerto en Tegucigalpa, incluyendo al Sr. Francisco Alvarado, de 
aproximadamente 65 a&#241;os de edad, quien habr&#237;a muerto a consecuencia de heridas 
de bala recibidas durante una manifestaci&#243;n en favor del presidente Zelaya. 
</p>
<p> Se informa tambi&#233;n que el 22 de septiembre de 2009, agentes policiales 
arrojaron botes de gas lacrim&#243;geno al interior de la sede del Comit&#233; de Familiares de 
Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras (COFADEH) en el Barrio La Plazuela de 
Tegucigalpa, donde se encontraba un centenar de participantes en las 
manifestaciones dando su testimonio sobre la represi&#243;n de las manifestaciones frente 
a la Embajada.  
</p>
<p> Ante esta situaci&#243;n, se ha expresado seria preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad de 
los miembros de COFADEH y de otras organizaciones defensoras de los derechos 
humanos. 
</p>
<p> Asimismo, se ha tenido conocimiento del establecimiento del estado de sitio 
en todo el territorio nacional, suspendi&#233;ndose las garant&#237;as constitucionales de 
libertad de expresi&#243;n, libertad de circulaci&#243;n y el derecho a reuni&#243;n durante 45 d&#237;as 
(consagradas en los art&#237;culos 69, 72, 81 y 84 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica, 
respectivamente). La suspensi&#243;n de estos derechos fue aprobada por decreto 
ejecutivo de fecha 22 de septiembre de 2009, publicado el 26 de septiembre de 2009 
en el Diario Oficial La Gaceta. Seg&#250;n el texto de dicho decreto ejecutivo, la 
Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CONATEL), a trav&#233;s de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional y de las fuerzas armadas, queda autorizada a suspender cualquier 
radioemisora, canal de televisi&#243;n o sistema de cable que no ajuste su programaci&#243;n a 
sus  disposiciones.  
</p>
<p> Estas medidas habr&#237;an sido justificadas sobre la base de que &#8220;determinados 
medios de comunicaci&#243;n social, hablados y televisados, est&#225;n utilizando sus 
frecuencias autorizadas para generar odio y violencia contra el Estado, perturbando 
la tranquilidad nacional, llamando a la insurrecci&#243;n popular, y da&#241;ando 
sicol&#243;gicamente a su auditorio&#8221;. Es as&#237; que se ordena a las Fuerzas Armadas que 
apoyen &#8220;conjunta o separadamente, cuando la situaci&#243;n as&#237; lo requiera, a la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional, debiendo poner en ejecuci&#243;n los planes necesarios para el orden y la 
seguridad p&#250;blica&#8221;. El decreto ejecutivo autoriza la represi&#243;n de &#8220;toda reuni&#243;n 
p&#250;blica no autorizada por las autoridades policiales y militares&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Este decreto ejecutivo es especialmente preocupante, ya que varias estaciones 
de radio y televisi&#243;n han interrumpido sus transmisiones ordinarias desde el regreso 
de Zelaya.  Se ha tenido conocimiento del posible cierre de &#8220;Radio Progreso&#8221;, en el 
centro de la ciudad de El Progreso, al norte del pa&#237;s, la cual tiene una trayectoria de 
53 a&#241;os de funcionamiento. Adem&#225;s, Canal 36 y las se&#241;ales de Radio Globo han 
sido objeto de interrupci&#243;n casi constante.  
</p>
<p> En este contexto, se afirma que el 21 de septiembre de 2009, a alrededor de 
las 5:30 de la ma&#241;ana, la se&#241;al de Canal 36 habr&#237;a sido interrumpida mediante cortes 
de electricidad en sus instalaciones y en el sitio donde se ubican los transmisores. 
Tambi&#233;n, la se&#241;al de Radio Globo habr&#237;a sido interrumpida constantemente con 
interferencias el&#233;ctricas, en tanto que la se&#241;al del programa televisivo &#8220;Hable como 
Habla&#8221; habr&#237;a sido bloqueada en su emisi&#243;n del mediod&#237;a. El 28 de septiembre 
habr&#237;an sido cerradas Radio Globo y Canal 36.  
</p>
<p> Esta informaci&#243;n preocupa de manera particular, teniendo en cuenta el 
aumento de denuncias de ataques, agresiones e intimidaci&#243;n contra periodistas en 
Honduras, incluyendo la destrucci&#243;n de sus equipos de trabajo. La libertad de 
expresi&#243;n es un derecho fundamental que no permite excepciones ni restricciones, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p>por lo que se hace un llamado a las autoridades para que garanticen   el libre 
ejercicio del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, inst&#225;ndoles adem&#225;s a 
adoptar las medidas pertinentes para asegurar la integridad f&#237;sica y moral de las 
personas que, por su profesi&#243;n, est&#225;n particularmente vinculadas a la libertad de 
opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n y la libertad de reuni&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>297. Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, quisi&#233;ramos llamar la 
atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles

</p>
<p>298. Asimismo, nos gustar&#237;a llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre el 
C&#243;digo de conducta para funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, resoluci&#243;n 
34/169 de 17 de diciembre de 1979 de la Asamblea General. En particular, el art&#237;culo 3 
establece que los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley podr&#225;n usar la fuerza s&#243;lo 
cuando sea estrictamente necesario y en la medida en que lo requiera el desempe&#241;o de sus 
tareas. En este mismo sentido, nos gustar&#237;a referirnos tambi&#233;n a los Principios b&#225;sicos sobre 
el empleo de la fuerza y de armas de fuego por los funcionarios encargados de hacer 
cumplir la ley, adoptados por el Octavo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n 
del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, La Habana, 27 de agosto a 7 de septiembre de 
</p><p>1990. Dichos principios establecen que los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, 
en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, utilizar&#225;n en la medida de lo posible medios no violentos 
y delimitar&#225;n el empleo de la fuerza a determinados casos excepcionales, incluidos los de 
defensa propia o de otras personas en caso de peligro inminente de muerte o lesiones 
graves.   
</p>
<p>299. Nos gustar&#237;a referirnos tambi&#233;n a los Principios relativos a una eficaz prevenci&#243;n e 
investigaci&#243;n de las ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias, resoluci&#243;n 1989/65 de 
24 de mayo de 1989 del Consejo Econ&#243;mico y Social. En particular, los principios 9 a 19 
obligan a los Gobiernos a proceder a una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva, inmediata e imparcial de 
todos los casos en que haya sospecha de ejecuciones extralegales, arbitrarias o sumarias; a 
publicar en un informe las conclusiones de estas investigaciones; y a velar por que sean 
juzgadas las personas que la investigaci&#243;n haya identificado como participantes en tales 
ejecuciones, en cualquier territorio bajo su jurisdicci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>300. Adem&#225;s sin pretender pronunciarnos con antelaci&#243;n sobre el car&#225;cter arbitrario o no 
de las detenciones arriba mencionadas, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento a las 
autoridades para adoptar todas las medidas necesarias para asegurar que los derechos de 
estas personas a no ser arbitrariamente detenidas y a un juicio justo ante un tribunal 
independiente e imparcial sean protegidos, de conformidad con los art&#237;culos 9 y 10 de la 
Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y con los art&#237;culos 9 y 14 del Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. 
</p>
<p>301. En este contexto, deseamos llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre 
las normas fundamentales enunciadas en la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre el 
derecho y el deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger 
los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidas y en 
particular los art&#237;culos 1 y 2. &#201;stos establecen, respectivamente, que toda persona tiene 
derecho, individual o colectivamente, a promover y procurar la protecci&#243;n y realizaci&#243;n de 
los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en los planos nacional e internacional 
y que es la responsabilidad primordial y el deber de todos los Estados de proteger,

colectivamente, pueda disfrutar en la pr&#225;ctica todos esos derechos y libertades.  
</p>
<p>302. Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a los art&#237;culos siguientes:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; el art&#237;culo 9, p&#225;rrafo 3, apartado c), establece que toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, entre otras cosas, a ofrecer y prestar asistencia letrada 
profesional u otro asesoramiento y asistencia pertinentes para defender los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; el art&#237;culo 12, p&#225;rrafos 2 y 3, estipula que el Estado garantizar&#225; la protecci&#243;n, por las 
autoridades competentes, de toda persona, individual o colectivamente, frente a toda 
violencia, amenaza, represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, negativa de hecho o de derecho, 
presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del ejercicio leg&#237;timo de los 
derechos mencionados en la presente Declaraci&#243;n. A este respecto, toda persona 
tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de las leyes 
nacionales al reaccionar u oponerse, por medios pac&#237;ficos, a actividades y actos, con 
inclusi&#243;n de las omisiones, imputables a los Estados que causen violaciones de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, as&#237; como a actos de violencia 
perpetrados por grupos o particulares que afecten el disfrute de los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales. 
</p>
<p>303. Adem&#225;s, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de Su 
Excelencia para que adopte las medidas necesarias para asegurar que el derecho a la 
libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de acuerdo con los principios enunciados 
en el art&#237;culo 19 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y reiterados en el 
art&#237;culo 19 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Nadie podr&#225; ser 
molestado a causa de sus opiniones. Toda persona tiene derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n; 
este derecho comprende la libertad de buscar, recibir y difundir informaciones e ideas de 
toda &#237;ndole, sin consideraci&#243;n de fronteras, ya sea oralmente, por escrito o en forma 
impresa o art&#237;stica, o por cualquier otro procedimiento de su elecci&#243;n&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>304. Desear&#237;amos hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno de Su Excelencia para que adopte 
las medidas necesarias para el respeto del derecho de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica de acuerdo con los 
principios enunciados en el art&#237;culo 21 del Pacto Internacional de los Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos: &#8220;Se reconoce el derecho de reuni&#243;n pacifica. El ejercicio de tal derecho s&#243;lo 
podr&#225; estar sujeto a las restricciones previstas por la ley que sean necesarias en una 
sociedad democr&#225;tica, en inter&#233;s de la seguridad nacional, de la seguridad p&#250;blica o del 
orden p&#250;blico, o para proteger la salud o la moral p&#250;blicas o los derechos y libertades de los

</p>
<p>305. Asimismo, con relaci&#243;n a los ataques contra la COFADEH, nos gustar&#237;a hacer 
referencia a la resoluci&#243;n 2005/9 mediante la cual la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos inst&#243; 
a los gobiernos a que se abstuvieran de todo acto de intimidaci&#243;n o represalia contra: 
quienes traten de cooperar o hayan cooperado con representantes de los &#243;rganos de defensa 
de los derechos humanos de las Naciones Unidas y sus &#243;rganos de derechos humanos, 
hayan prestado testimonio ante ellos o les hayan proporcionado informaci&#243;n; quienes 
recurran o hayan recurrido a los procedimientos establecidos bajo los auspicios de las 
Naciones Unidas para la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades 
fundamentales, y todos los que les hayan prestado asistencia jur&#237;dica a tal fin; quienes 
presenten o hayan presentado comunicaciones con arreglo a los procedimientos 
establecidos en los instrumentos de derechos humanos y los familiares de v&#237;ctimas de 
violaciones a los derechos humanos. Adem&#225;s, la Comisi&#243;n pidi&#243; a todos los representantes 
de los &#243;rganos de derechos humanos de las Naciones Unidas y a los &#243;rganos creados en 
virtud de tratados encargados de supervisar la observancia de los derechos humanos que

</p>
<p>306. Adem&#225;s, quisi&#233;ramos referirnos a la resoluci&#243;n 7/12, aprobada sin votaci&#243;n, del 
Consejo de Derechos Humanos por la que &#233;ste inst&#243; a los Estados a que adopten medidas 
para proteger a los testigos de desapariciones forzadas o involuntarias, a los defensores de 
los derechos humanos que luchan contra las desapariciones forzadas y a los abogados y a 
las familias de las personas desaparecidas contra todo acto de intimidaci&#243;n o contra los 
malos tratos de que pudieran ser objeto.

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 April 2009</b>. 
</p>
<p>310. In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information 
I have received concerning the alleged killing of Ms. Khukuli Khatun and Mr. Tutul Seikh 
by members of the Border Security Forces (BSF) in West Bengal. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 19 November 2008, at about 3:30 p.m., Ms. Khukuli Khatun, a.k.a. 
Kakali, was shot in the stomach at point blank range by a BSF officer in front of her 
family&#8217;s home. She was trying to help her mother and sister, who were allegedly 
being beaten by two BSF officers of the 42nd Battalion, Company F, because they 
tried to stop two BSF officers from beating another young man (the names of these 
persons are on record with me). The BSF prevented the villagers from taking Ms. 
Khukuli Khatun to the hospital immediately. She was taken to Chapra Block 
Primary Health Centre after the BSF left and from there transferred to Shaktinagar 
District Hospita, but died of her injuries at 6:00 p.m. Kotwali Police Station 
(Krishnanagar) registered an unnatural death case (no. 613/2008) and on 20 
November 2008, a post-mortem examination was conducted. Ms. Khukuli Khatun&#8217;s 
family also lodged a complaint under section 302 of Indian Penal Code and 25/27 of 
the Arms Act. Chapra Police Station registered the case and a BSF officer (his name 
is on record with me) was reportedly suspended from his duties in connection with 
the investigation.  
</p>
<p> Mr. Tutul Seikh, aged about 18 and resident of Katlamary Ramnagar para, 
was found dead by Raninagar police station officers on 2 January 2009, at around 
5:00 a.m. in a paddy field. The previous evening, the police station had been 
informed that BSF had fired at 20-25 persons who were allegedly trying to smuggle 
cattle through the Indo-Bangladesh border. BSF reported that they were attacked by 
the smugglers. This version has been contested by witnesses of the events. 
Raninagar Police station opened an unnatural death case (no. 1/09). A post-mortem 
examination was conducted on 2 January 2009, but the results have not been 
disclosed. It is alleged that the bullet injury would show that the shot was fired at 
close range. 
</p>
<p>311. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to 
refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which India is a party, provides that 
every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be 
protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p>312. In its General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed 
&#8220;that States parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life 
by criminal acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The 
deprivation of life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore, 
the law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived 
of his life by such authorities.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>108  
</b></p>
<p>313. I would also note the relevance in these cases of the UN Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, 
&#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, 
(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and 
the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and 
preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured 
or affected persons at the earliest possible moment [&#8230;].&#8221; Besides, Article 3 of the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials provides that law enforcement officials may use 
force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their 
duty. 
</p>
<p>314. I would further like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of the principle 
whereby there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected 
cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints 
by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). 
</p>
<p>315. Finally, I would like to stress that families of the deceased should be informed about 
the investigation and the findings of the investigation should be made public (Prevention 
and Investigation Principles, Principles 16 and 17). Moreover, the families and dependents 
of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be entitled to fair and 
adequate compensation within a reasonable period of time (Prevention and Investigation 
Principles, Principle 20). 
</p>
<p>316. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all such cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council I would be grateful for your cooperation 
and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of the cases accurate? Please 
refer to the status or results of any police, medical, or military investigation, or 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the alleged incidents. 
</p>
<p>2.  Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and 
criminal prosecutions against, members of the Border Security Forces involved, as 
perpetrators or responsible commanders, in the deaths of Ms. Khukuli Khatun and 
Mr. Tutul Seikh. 
</p>
<p>3.  Please state whether any compensation has been, or is intended to be, 
provided to the families of Ms. Khukuli Khatun and Mr. Tutul Seikh. 
</p>
<p>4. I recall my communications dated 2 May 2008, 29 July 2008 and 16 
September 2008 seeking information on a total of ten cases of allegedly arbitrary 
killing by BSF officers. As of to date, they have regrettably remained without a 
reply.  I would like to express my continued interest in receiving a response to the 
questions posed in those letters and in being updated on the progress of the 
investigations into the killings alleged in them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government of India dated 31 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>317. The permanent mission of India to the office of the United Nations and other 
international organisations in Geneva presents its compliments to the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and with reference to communication IND 6/2009 dated 3 April 2009 
signed by Mr Philip Alston, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary </p>

<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>executions, has the honour to inform that the Government of India has examined 
communications and found the allegations to be inaccurate and unfounded.  
</p>
<p>318. Mr Tukul Seikh was part of a group of 20-25 cattle smugglers who were trying to 
smuggle some cattle at about 0430 hours on 2 January 2009 from India to Bangladesh. 
When challenged by BSF patrol that was in the area owing to a tip-off, the smugglers did 
not pay heed and kept hurrying toward porous international border. In fact, some of them 
encircled the small four person BSF patrol party and attacked it with local sharp edged 
weapons (like <i>dah</i>) and bamboo sticks. The subject died when the BSF patrol opened fire in 
self-defence at close range. As is mandatory under BSF rules, a departmental staff court of 
inquiry was conducted after the incident which found the opening of fire by the patrol party 
was justified. Further, contrary to what has been mentioned in the allegation, the police case 
(1/09) was registered with Raninangar police station by the BSF itself as part of normal 
legal requirement of handing over of the dead body to the police station. It may be noted 
that the international border in this areas is highly porous and prone to illegal cross border 
activities, including cattle smuggling. As a result, the authorities (District Magistrate 
Murshidabad) have imposed strict restrictions prohibiting any movement of cattle from 
dusk to dawn within a belt of three kilometres from the international border, apart from 
grazing of cattle within 300 metres of the border. The presence of the subject with the cattle 
within this prohibited zone before dawn is a clear indicator of the mala fide intentions of 
the subject.  
</p>
<p>319. Ms Khukhuli Khatun was part of a group of people who were trying to smuggle 
fertilizer by throwing fertilizer packets over the border fence (the border is fenced in the 
area where the incident occurred) and later, when a two-person BSF patrol chased and 
caught one person of this group, encircled the patrol while pelting it with stones and sticks. 
In self defence one of the BSF constables cocked his rifle to disperse the smugglers. 
However, the constable slipped and fell down in the scuffle and his weapon went off hitting 
Ms Khatun in the stomach. She was evacuated to the nearest rural hospital at Chapra and 
later to Krishannagar hospital were she succumbed to her injuries. One of the two 
constables too was badly injured in the assault by the smugglers and evacuated to the same 
hospital at Chapra. A part of normal legal procedure, the BSF itself registered a police case 
with police station Chapra the same day. The case is under further investigation.

<p>320. In this connection, I would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention information 
I have received concerning the alleged killing of two men, Mr. Abdus Samad and Mr. Jabed 
Ali Mahaldar, by members of the Border Security Force (BSF) in West Bengal. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: </p>

</b></p>
<p> Abdus Samad, a.k.a. Kalu Seikh, a 35 years old resident of Biswanathpur, 
Murshidabad district, was taken from his home at around 3.00 a.m. on 5 May 2009 
by members of the BSF. He was beaten with riffle butts and lathis, had his hands 
tied behind his back and was dragged out of his house to the adjacent premises of 
Manik Chawk Primary School. He was subsequently brought to BSF Camp at Diar 
Manick Chawk, where the beatings continued. He died at around 5.00 a.m., after 
members of the BSF had taken him to another camp, the Ramnagar Border Out-Post 
Camp (BOP), where basic medical assistance was available. 
</p>
<p> Without being aware of Mr. Samad&#8217;s death, his family lodged a complaint at 
about 7.00 a.m. on 5 May, at Lalgola Police Station, regarding his torture and 
disappearance, but the complaint was not accepted by the police. Nevertheless, at 
11.00 a.m., Abdus Samad&#8217;s family received a written communication from Lalgola 
Police saying that he was dead and that an inquest would be conducted at Ramnagar 
BOP camp of BSF. At the camp the family saw Mr. Abdus Samad&#8217;s body covered 
with injuries and blood. The inquest took place at 4.00 p.m. in the presence of the 
police personnel of Lalgola Police Station and an Executive Magistrate. They 
registered the case as an unnatural death (Case no. 4/2009 dated 5 May 2009) and 
sent the body to Lalbagh Sub-Divisional Hospital for a post mortem examination. 
After observing some abnormalities, the Superintendent of the Hospital decided to 
send the body to Berhampore New General Hospital on 6 May 2009, saying that he 
was not able to do the examination himself. 
</p>
<p> Abdus Samad&#8217;s wife, Ms. Rimi Bewa, filed several complaints regarding her 
husband&#8217;s death: one in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Berhampore, 
Murshidabad, on 6 May 2009; another one before the Deputy Inspector General, 
BSF, Roshanbagh, Compagny Officer, Lalbagh Camp, Murshibadad; and also a 
written complaint, a First Information Report, at the police of Lalgola Police Station, 
dated 7 May 2009 (Case no. 236/2009). 
</p>
<p> Jabed Ali Mahaldar, a bidi worker aged 27, and a friend were beaten with 
lathis and riffle butts by members of the 108 Battalion of BSF as they were fishing 
at the river Ganges (Padma). Mr. Mahaldar&#8217;s friend was able to escape, but he was 
unable to do so as a result of the beating. Members of the BSF tied his hands behind 
his back and brought him to Nimtita BOP camp, where he was beaten again and 
kicked until 9.00 p.m. According to witnesses, several swellings haematoma were 
visible on his body and his head bore a 2&#8221; deep cut. At 9.30 p.m., Mr. Mahaldar was 
brought to the Mahishadal Block Primary Healty Center, where BSF members tried 
to force the duty medical officer to certify him as having died even thought he was 
still alive. Despite the BSF demands, the doctor transferred him to the Jangipur 
Hospital for treatment. On his arrival at the hospital with BSF members, he was 
declared &#8220;brought dead&#8221; by the medical officers.

<p><b>  Response from the Government of India dated 4 December 2009: 
</b></p>
<p>327. [&#8230;] Mr. Abdus Samad was a member of a group of smugglers that was spotted 
through a night-vision device by a BSF patrol at about 04.10 hours on 5 May 2009 along 
India-Bangladesh border, trying to negotiate the barbed-wire border fence. When 
challenged, the group tried to flee under the cover of darkness. The subject, who had hidden 
himself in a nearby paddy field, was spotted again but tried to escape by trying to assault </p>

</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>112  
</b></p>
<p>one of the patrol constables with a sharp-edged weapon and flashing torch light on the eyes 
of the constable in order to blind him temporarily. The subject was, however, overpowered 
and brought to a nearby BSF post at about 05.05 hrs, along with 2.3 kgs of morphine that 
was recovered from him. When the subject was observed to be restless, he was taken 
initially to another nearby BSF post that had some medical facilities and later to the nearest 
civil hospital where the duty physician declared him dead. The BSF filed a report with the 
police on 5 May 2009 and a post-mortem was conducted on 6 May 2009. As required under 
the procedure, the case is under investigation by the police and a staff court of inquiry was 
ordered by the BSF. 
</p>
<p>328. Mr. Jabed Ali was a smuggler who, along with another miscreant, was spotted by 
some local fishermen at about 14.30 hours on 30 April 2009 moving suspiciously towards 
the border river between India and Bangladesh. While the local fishermen shouted to alert 
the BSF patrol that was nearby, the subject and his fellow accomplice jumped into the river 
to swim across to Bangladesh. However, the local fishermen and other civilians present 
nearby got hold of the subject and beat him mercilessly since they suspected these 
smugglers of having stolen their fishing net and three boats earlier. The BSF patrol soon 
reached the spot and rescued the subject from the scene. About 7.5 kg of cannabis was 
recovered from him. The subject was taken to a nearby primary health care center where he 
was declared dead. A police complaint was duly registered on 1 May 2009 and the 
investigation is in progress. While, <i>prima facie</i>, no BSF personnel have been found to be 
directly involved in the death of the subject, appropriate disciplinary proceedings will be 
initiated in case any BSF personnel is implicated in the police investigation.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 14 August 2009  
</b></p>
<p>330. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding two extrajudicial executions 
allegedly committed by Police Commandos in Manipur State.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Chungkam Sanjit and Ms. Thockchom Rebina, both of whom belonged 
to the Meitei indigenous community, were killed, and five others injured, on 23 July 
2009 when Manipur Police Commandoes opened fire at Khwairamband Bazaar in 
the heart of Imphal, Capital of Manipur State in India&#8217;s North East. These 
allegations are of particular concern to the extent that they are alleged to be part of a 
wider campaign of state violence against the people of Manipur. 
</p>
<p> Killing of Mr. Chungkam Sanjit: According to the allegations I have 
received, Mr. Shanjit left JN Hospital to search for medicines for his ailing father at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>113 
</b></p>
<p>Khwairamband Bazaar, Imphal.  Reports indicate that Mr. Sanjit was frisked and 
briefly interrogated by police in a public call office. Photographic evidence of the 
incident suggests that he was taken by the police from the public call office to a 
pharmacy further along the street, and soon after the police brought his body out and 
loaded it onto a truck. He had sustained a number of gunshot wounds to his 
abdomen. According to the Government of Manipur and the Manipur Police 
Commandoes, Mr. Chungkham Sanjit was killed in a retaliatory firing after he shot 
at them whilst fleeing, with the subsequent recovery of a 9mm pistol and 4 live 
rounds of ammunition from him. However, photographic evidence shows Mr. 
Chungkham Sanjit to be calm when arrested, and to be unarmed. The police also 
alleged that he was a member of People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA), one of the 
resistance groups launching armed struggle for the right to self determination of 
Manipur. Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh has since admitted that Mr. 
Sanjit was known to have retired from the PLA in 2006. 
</p>
<p> Killing of Ms. Thockchom Rebina: According to the information received, 
Ms. Thockchom Rebina was killed by a stray bullet to her head when police fired at 
a fleeing youth whilst pursuing him. She was reportedly shopping at Khwairamband 
Market with her three year old son. Five other people were seriously injured by stray 
bullets during the incident. 
</p>
<p>331. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that every individual has the right

General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed &#8220;that States 
parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal 
acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of 
life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore the law must 
strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by 
such authorities.&#8221; Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved.  The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials explain that intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made 
when strictly unavoidable (Para. 9). Additionally, para. 7 of the Basic Principles states that 
the abusive use of firearms by law enforcement officials must be punished as a criminal 
offence. Indeed, these rules are entailed by the legal duty to respect the right to life 
recognized in Article 6(1) of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-
legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions provides that there must be a &#8220;thorough, 
prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable 
reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221;. This principle was 
reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have 
&#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>332. I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to conduct an impartial and transparent 
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr. Chungkam Sanjit and Ms. 
Thockchom Rebina, with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial 
action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of unlawful killings, as well as to 
compensate the families of the victims.  </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 1 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>334. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the ongoing investigation and 
prosecution of persons suspected of involvement in the murder of Mr. Munir Said Thalib, 
who was killed by poisoning on a Garuda flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam on 7 September 
</p><p>2004. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
sent an urgent appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding the killing of Mr. Munir 
Said Thalib on 3 December 2004. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions sent an allegation letter regarding the investigation and judicial 
proceedings in this case on 30 November 2006. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government replied to 
the latter communication on 19 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>335. The communication by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions followed a decision of the Supreme Court of 3 October 2006. The 
Supreme Court had overturned the conviction on murder charges, in first and second 
instance, of Mr. Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, a Garuda pilot and agent of the State 
Intelligence Agency, as the person who materially poisoned Munir Said Thalib. According 
to information received since then, after the acquittal the Criminal Investigation 
Department gathered new evidence and interrogated new witnesses, including several staff 
members of the intelligence agency. This evidence and witness testimony were used in the 
Supreme Court's review of the acquittal of Mr. Priyanto. He was subsequently tried again, 
convicted on murder charges and is currently serving a 20-years prison sentence. Two 
Garuda employees have also been convicted for facilitating the presence of Mr. Priyanto on </p>

</p>
<p> <b>115 
</b></p>
<p>the flight and sentenced to one year imprisonment. We welcome the investigatory and 
prosecutorial efforts which made the successful prosecution of the above-mentioned three 
individuals possible.  
</p>
<p>336. In its communication to the Special Rapporteur of 19 January 2007, however, your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government also stated that &#8220;it has been the government&#8217;s task and focus for 
some time now to uncover the masterminds behind this murder [&#8230;] who have for so long 
[&#8230;] remained at large&#8221;. We share your Government&#8217;s view that the successful investigation 
and prosecution of those who have ordered, planned and otherwise been complicit in the 
murder of Mr. Munir Said Thalib is of the utmost importance. It is in respect of a recent 
serious setback in these efforts that we are now writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> Retired Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono, former Deputy Head of the 
State Intelligence Agency, was charged with plotting and ordering the killing of Mr. 
Munir Said Thalib. Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono was the first person 
charged for planning and ordering the killing. He was arrested on 19 June 2008, and 
in August 2008 the court proceedings started before the District Court in South 
Jakarta. On 31 December 2008, the District Court acquitted Major Muchdi on all 
charges and ordered his release.  
</p>
<p> Sworn statements to the Criminal Investigation Department by agents of the 
State Intelligence Agency (Badan Intelijen Negara, or BIN) were among the key 
evidence to the prosecution case against Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono. At 
trial, however, these witnesses from the State Intelligence Agency withdrew their 
previous sworn testimony to the Criminal Investigation Department. The District 
Court judges noted the difference between the prior statements and the current 
testimony. They warned that the discrepancies would be noted in the transcript of 
proceedings and reminded the witnesses of the maximum punishment if they give 
false testimony. However, the judges did not order the arrest of witnesses or 
recommend their prosecution under the laws relating to false testimony (Article 174 
paragraph (1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code). 
</p>
<p> In addition to the systematic retraction at trial of prior witness statements by 
State Intelligence Agency members, the investigation and prosecution continues to 
suffer from a lack of cooperation by the State Intelligence Agency. The Agency 
failed to make key witnesses available to the above-mentioned independent 
investigation team. The police was also not able to obtain the content of the more 
than 40 calls from the phone of Mr. Priyanto to Major General Muchdi. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, during the trial of Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono, 
organized groups of militia and thugs intimidated Ms. Suciwati, the widow of Munir 
Said Thalib, and other human rights defenders in the court room. 
</p>
<p> In its communication of 19 January 2007 to the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
stresses that under article 24 of the Indonesian Constitution and Law no. 14/1970 
judges are independent and free from all influence emanating from government 
authority. This principle is also reflected in the Basic Principles on the Independence 
of the Judiciary (adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention 
of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 
September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 
November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985) which, in  principle 1, second 
sentence,  prescribe the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and 
observe the independence of the judiciary. Only if this principle is met, one can 
ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>116  
</b></p>
<p>are respected (principle 6 of the Basic Principles). It is the Government&#8217;s duty to 
ensure adequate conditions which enable the judiciary to independently administer 
justice. This duty might also include taking proactive steps to protect the integrity of 
the judicial process against interference by third parties, including other institutions 
and services serving the State. 
</p>
<p>337. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports received, in the case of 
the trial of Major General Muchdi Purwopranjono, the reported systematic retraction of 
previous sworn statements by State Intelligence Agency staff suggests that there might have 
been interference with the integrity of the judicial process. This concern is compounded by 
the circumstance that State Intelligence Agency staff who testified to the police 
investigation had reportedly been accompanied by the State Intelligence Agency&#8217;s lawyer 
during the police interrogations, which reinforces the police&#8217;s assurances that these 
statements were genuine, made without intimidation or undue pressure. The alleged failure 
of the State Intelligence Agency to turn over to the investigators all the requested evidence 
and to facilitate interviews with all relevant staff similarly interferes with the integrity of 
the judicial process. Also the presence of organized groups in and around the court room 
threatening violence against participants in the judicial proceedings constitutes an 
interference with the judicial process which requires protective action on the side of the 
Government. We call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure that the further investigation and prosecution of those accused of involvement in the 
murder of Munir Said Thalib proceed without undue interference. 
</p>
<p>338. Mr. Munir Said Thalib was a prominent human rights defender whose activity in the 
struggle against enforced disappearance was publicly known. The attack on his life and the 
continuing impunity of those who planned and ordered his killing is not only a violation of 
his rights and those of his relatives, it also constitutes a general threat against all those 
struggling against enforced disappearances in Indonesia, individually or as an association. 
His Excellency President Yudhoyono has acknowledged the importance of this case by 
reportedly calling it a &#8220;test of our history&#8221;. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the 
circumstances surrounding Mr. Munir Said Thalib&#8217;s death are thoroughly and impartially 
elucidated and that all those responsible are brought to justice in fair proceedings free from 
any interference.  
</p>
<p>339. In this respect, we would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In particular, article 1 states that &#8220;everyone has 
the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the 
protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and 
international levels&#8221;. Of special relevance to the cases at hand, article 12 paras 2 and 3 of 
the Declaration provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the 
protection by the competent authorities of everyone against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>340. We would like to conclude by reiterating the words of the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders in the 
report on her visit to Indonesia from 5 to 12 June 2007: &#8220;&#8230; [h]uman rights defenders in 
Indonesia and the international community are expecting that the Government will ensure 
justice in the case of Munir and that the perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice&#8221; 
(A/HRC/7/28/Add.2, paragraph 85). 
</p>
<p>341. We would appreciate a response within sixty days. We undertake to ensure that your 
Government&#8217;s response to this communication is accurately reflected in the reports we will 
submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration.  </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 4 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>342. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning two cases of death resulting from 
injuries sustained in police custody. The victims in these two cases are named Mr. Bayu 
Putra Perdana and Mr. Susanto. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, 
</p>
<p> On 2 April 2009 at 2 p.m., Mr. Bayu Putra Perdana was arrested in the Galur 
area of Cempaka Putih by men introducing themselves as officers of the North 
Jakarta police force. In the evening of that day, police officers from the North 
Jakarta police force searched his home. Their affiliation with that police station is 
confirmed by the fact that they left a phone number belonging to an officer of the 
North Jakarta police force. In the afternoon and evening of that same day,  Mr. Bayu 
Putra Perdana&#8217;s family inquired with police officers at several police stations in the 
North Jakarta area. One witness reportedly heard Mr. Bayu Putra Perdana screaming 
in pain (at the North Jakarta police station) in the course of the afternoon. A senior 
detective at the North Jakarta police station (his name is on record with the Special 
Rapporteurs) told Mr. Perdana&#8217;s father that his son was being held in Bogor, in 
neighbouring West Java.  
</p>
<p> On 4 April 2009, Mr. Perdana&#8217;s father was informed that his son had been 
shot dead by the police as he tried to escape during a crime scene reconstruction. 
When he saw his son&#8217;s body at the hospital, however, Mr. Perdana&#8217;s father found his 
son&#8217;s corpse covered with other wounds, including on his wrists and hands, and 
more than ten stab wounds on his legs. 
</p>
<p> On 9 July 2009, police officers in Kreung Raya, Aceh, received a complaint 
accusing Mr. Susanto of having stolen a tire at a car workshop. They first tried to 
arrest him at a coffee shop in the Kreung Raya Market. Mr. Susanto managed to 
escape. The police then called for reinforcements, and Mr. Susanto was arrested in 
Lampoh Raya and taken to the Krueng Raya Police Station. Although three shots 
were reportedly fired by the police during the arrest, eyewitnesses state that at the 
time of his arrest Mr. Susanto was mostly unharmed. Three hours later, Mr. Susanto 
presented extensive injuries and was taken to the nearest clinic by the police. The 
medical personnel at the clinic declared his condition critical and ordered that he be 
immediately transferred to the Zainal Abidin Hospital. Mr. Susanto died at 10 p.m. 
When his family received his body, he had deep wounds on his right leg, a stab 
wound on his left toe, a roughly stitched wound on the back of his head and bruises 
around his eyes. 
</p>
<p>343. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations, we would like to 
draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable 
under international law to these cases. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>118  
</b></p>
<p>Political Rights, to which Indonesia is a party, provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to 
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the 
Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State 
detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility (<i>see</i>, for 
instance, the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s views in the case of Mr. Dermit Barbato v. 
Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2). 
</p>
<p>344. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting 
from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3, 
stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>345. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring 
to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to 
the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring and end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to 
justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>346. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to carry out expeditious, independent and 
transparent inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr. Bayu Putra 
Perdana and Mr. Susanto, also with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and 
prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations, as well as to compensate their families.  
</p>
<p>347. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of the cases accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any

<p>3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators?

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 2 October 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences.  
</p>
<p>348. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the adoption of the new Islamic 
Criminal Code (Qanun Jinayah) in Aceh. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, 
</p>
<p> On 14 September 2009, the Aceh Legislative Council adopted a new Islamic 
Criminal Code which imposes severe sentences for consensual extra-marital sexual 
relations, rape, homosexuality, alcohol consumption and gambling. Among other 
sanctions, the Code imposes the punishment of stoning to death for adultery; 100 
cane lashes for sexual intercourse outside marriage; between 100 and 300 cane 
lashes or imprisonment for rape; and 100 lashes for homosexuality.  
</p>
<p> In addition, the new Code legalizes marital rape and provides that a woman 
alleging that she is a victim of rape will be found guilty of sex outside marriage 
unless she can provide four male witnesses testifying to the lack of consent on her 
part; impunity will be given to those who commit rape at the command of superiors. 
</p>
<p> The National Commission against Violence on Women has called for a 
judicial review of Law No. 11/2006 of the Government of Aceh concerning the 
sources the Aceh Legislative Council has used to adopt the Aceh Islamic Criminal 
Code. Moreover, this Code applies to both Muslims and non Muslims.  
</p>
<p> It is furthermore alleged that although the Code is applicable to the 
population as a whole in practice women are far more likely to become victims of 
stoning due to patriarchal and discriminatory practices and policies, as well as 
biological differences such as pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>349. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we should like 
to recall that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>350. We would also like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council. It states that corporal punishment, including 
of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. We 
would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the report by the Special 
Rapporteur on torture to the 60th session of the General Assembly, in which he concluded, 
with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, that any form of corporal 
punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot invoke provisions of domestic 
law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under international law, including 
the prohibition of corporal punishment and called upon States to abolish all forms of 
judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (A/60/316, para. 28). Both 
the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called for the 
abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>120  
</b></p>
<p>(1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment 
must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as 
punishment for a crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure.   
</p>
<p>351. In the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture on his mission to Indonesia 
(A/HRC/7/3/Add.7), he expressed concern &#8220;about penalties provided for by Sharia law, 
such as public flogging, incorporated into the 2005 Aceh Criminal Code&#8230;&#8221;. He further 
added that &#8220;women are disproportionally affected by corporal punishment provided for by 
the Aceh Criminal Code, which is based on Sharia law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>352. With regard to the provision allegedly dictating that the death penalty by stoning 
shall be imposed on those found guilty of adultery, we recall that Article 6(2) of the 
Covenant provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the 
&#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision shows that a death sentence can only be 
imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in 
the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). The Human Rights Committee has expressly stated 
that the imposition of the death penalty for adultery is incompatible with the Covenant (see, 
e.g., CCPR/C/79/Add.25). 
</p>
<p>353. Furthermore, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to General Assembly resolution 63/181 in which the Assembly urges States &#8220;to ensure that 
no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person 
because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to 
bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221; (para. 9 b). We would also like 
to recall that the General Assembly in the same resolution urges States &#8220;to step up their 
efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, [...] devoting 
particular attention to practices that violate the human rights of women and discriminate 
against women&#8221; (para. 12 a). Furthermore, the General Assembly invites all actors to 
address &#8220;situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as other 
individuals on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief or in accordance with 
cultural and traditional practices&#8221; (para. 16 b). 
</p>
<p>354. Moreover, we would like to refer to para. 10 of General Comment No. 22 on 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion, in which the Human Rights Committee 
emphasized that &#8220;[i]f a set of beliefs is treated as official ideology in constitutions, statutes, 
proclamations of ruling parties, etc., or in actual practice, this shall not result in any 
impairment of the freedoms under article 18 or any other rights recognized under the 
Covenant nor in any discrimination against persons who do not accept the official ideology 
or who oppose it&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>355. We would also like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
Article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, which stipulates that States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all 
its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of 
eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the 
principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other 
appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other 
appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate

taken to abolish existing laws, customs, regulations and practices which are discriminatory 
against women, and to establish adequate legal protection for equal rights of men and 
women, in particular: (a) The principle of equality of rights shall be embodied in the

</p>
<p>360. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning the death in custody of Mr. Carmadi. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, 
</p>
<p> Mr. Carmadi was arrested on 14 April 2009 by Mr. Aiptu Sutrisno and 
another police officer dressed in civilian clothes. Mr. Carmadi was taken to the Tegal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>122  
</b></p>
<p>Police Station, were he had to give a statement concerning an attack on a village 
which had taken place several days before. The police then took Mr. Carmadi to the 
hospital to meet one of the victims of the attack. At the hospital, the victim&#8217;s brother 
allegedly indicated that Mr. Carmadi had not been involved. Nevertheless, Mr. 
Carmadi was allegedly beaten and was forced to confess under duress. He suffered 
injuries mainly on the left side of his body, on his tongue and ear. When his family 
visited him at the police station, they also noted that his head was bleeding and that 
he had injuries in his upper body. He received no medical treatment.  
</p>
<p> On the same day, the police delivered an arrest warrant for Mr. Carmadi to 
his parents. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Slawi Police Station. In the 
evening, Mr. Carmadi&#8217;s father was summoned to the police station. Once he arrived, 
he was informed that Mr. Carmadi had fainted during the investigation. He was then 
taken to the hospital, where he died. On 17 April, an autopsy was performed at the 
hospital and his body was released for burial. 
</p>
<p> After Mr. Carmadi&#8217;s death, his family lodged a complaint with the Head of 
the Criminal Investigation Division. On 4 May, the family went to the Internal 
Affairs Department, where they were informed that the autopsy concluded that Mr. 
Carmadi had committed suicide. After seeing the report, the family was able to 
witness that the results of the autopsy and the information provided by the police did 
not match. The family then filed complaints with the National Police Commission, 
the District Police in Tegal Central Java and the National Commission for Human 
Rights. No progress has been made in the investigation. 
</p>
<p>361. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s attention to Article 13 of the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention 
against Torture), which requires that &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who 
alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to 
complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent 
authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the complainant and witnesses are protected 
against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of his complaint or any evidence 
given&#8221;. In this context, we would also like to draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 6 (b) and (e) of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 adopted in 
June 2008 which urges States &#8220;to take persistent, determined and effective measures to 
have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold persons, 
who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them 
brought to justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of 
detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed [&#8230;] and &#8220;to ensure that 
victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain 
redress and are awarded fair and adequate compensation and receive appropriate socio-
medical rehabilitation [&#8230;]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>362. We however urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Carmadi are respected and that accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

</b></p>
<p>364. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding Mr. Abu Moslem Sohrabi, a man 
reportedly sentenced to death as qesas (retribution) for a killing committed in 2001, when 
he was aged 17. My previous communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding 
this case, dated 13 August 2008, remains unanswered.  
</p>
<p>365. My attention has now been drawn to reports indicating that the review of his 
sentence ordered by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court in July 2008 has recently resulted in 
the death sentence being affirmed. He would, as a consequence, be at risk of execution.  
</p>
<p>366. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, I reiterate 
that any further executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the 
international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments 
which we have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Party, 
expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of is a Party, provides that the 
death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years 
of age.  
</p>
<p>367. I therefore again urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to expeditiously lift or 
commute the death sentences imposed against Mr. Abu Moslem Sohrabi, as well as all 
other persons awaiting execution for offences committed before they reached age 18. All 
other efforts undertaken by your Government to prevent these executions are insufficient to 
meet its obligations under international treaties it is a Party to.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 28 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>369. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the execution of Mr. Mehdi 
Qasemzadeh, a follower of the Ahl-e Haqq religion, and the possibly imminent execution of 
another member of the group, Mr. Yunes Aghayan. Both men were reportedly convicted on 
charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; (&#8220;enmity against God&#8221;) on the basis of their participation in clashes 
between the police and Ahl-e Haqq followers in 2004. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> In September 2004, clashes between members of a group of Ahl-e Haqq and 
police resulted in the death of five Ahl-e Haqq members and at least three police. 
Apparently, the clashes were triggered by the refusal of Ahl-e Haqq followers to 
take down religious slogans at the entrance to their cattle farm in Uch Tepe, West 
Azerbaijan Province.  
</p>
<p> In the following months, members of Ahl-e Haqq were arrested and charged 
with &#8220;mohareb&#8221; (Yunes Aghayan was arrested around November 2004). Five men, 
Yunes Aghayan, Mehdi Qasemzadeh, Sehend Ali Mohammadi, Bakhshali 
Mohammadi, and Ebadollah Qasemzadeh were tried before Branch 2 of the 
Mahabad Revolutionary Court and sentenced to death. The death sentences against 
Yunes Aghayan and Mehdi Qasemzadeh were upheld by the Supreme Court in April 
</p><p>2005. The death sentences against Sehend Ali Mohammadi, Bakhshali Mohammadi, 
and Ebadollah Qasemzadeh were overturned by the Supreme Court in September 
2007. They are serving 13-year prison sentences in Yazd Province.  
</p>
<p> Mehdi Qasemzadeh was executed on, or around, 28 February 2009. Yunes 
Aghayan is held on death row in Oromieh Prison in West Azerbaijan Province. 
</p>
<p>370. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be 
interpreted in the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party, provides that the &#8220;sentence of death may 
be imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>371. As we have explained in previous communications to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government, the imposition of the death sentence on charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; is highly 
problematic. We are concerned that this charge, which according to our information in Iran 
is directed mainly against political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons 
accused of espionage, might not be sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict 
standards of legality set by Article 6(2) of the Covenant for the imposition and carrying out 
of the death penalty. In order for the sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with 
the law&#8221;, the law in question must be sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction 
between conduct punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so punishable. (See 
the communications of 31 August 2006 concerning the imposition of the death penalty 
against Ali Motirijejad and others (reproduced in A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 165f), of 26 
July 2007 concerning the imposition of the death penalty against Abdolwahed (Hiwa) 
Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour (reproduced in A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, pages 210f), and of 18 
July 2008 in the cases of Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili).  
</p>
<p>372. On the basis of these concerns, we have repeatedly sought from your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government a definition of mohareb under Iranian law. While your Government has 
provided substantial information on the factual allegations on which the mohareb charges 
against Adnan Hassanpour, Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were 
based, which is highly appreciated, it has regrettably not answered our query regarding the 
definition of mohareb.  
</p>
<p>373. This is particularly important because Article 6(2) of the Covenant not only requires 
strict respect for the principle of legality in capital punishment cases, but also limits the 
death penalty to the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. In interpreting this provision, the Human Rights 
Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do 
not result in the loss of life, finding only cases involving murder not to raise concerns under 
the most serious crimes provision. As observed in a report to the Human Rights Council, 
the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of 
all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes 
provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that 
there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  
Moreover, when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report presented by your 
Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations that it 
&#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of 
life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). 
</p>
<p>374. The information provided by your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding the charges 
against Adnan Hassanpour, Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili does not 
indicate that they were accused of any incidents of intentional taking of life (this is not to 
diminish in any way the seriousness of the charges of handling of explosives on behalf of 
an allegedly terrorist group leveled against Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad 
Vakili according to your Government&#8217;s communication of 8 April 2009). Similarly, while 
the clashes between Ahl-e Haqq followers and the police in September 2004 reportedly 
resulted in the death of several policemen, the charges of mohareb against Yunes Aghayan 
and Mehdi Qasemzadeh raise the concern that they could have been sentenced to death 
without being found guilty of any intentional killing. 
</p>
<p>375. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that Yunes Aghayan is not deprived of his life in violation of the obligations your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government has entered into under international law. Considering the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death 
sentence against him until the question whether the acts he was found guilty of satisfy 
international criteria for what constitutes &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; has been clarified. In view 
of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>126  
</b></p>
<p>your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Yunes Aghayan in compliance 
with your Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>376. We would also like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to ensure the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or 
Belief and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>377. In addition to the above, we would like to recall that religious minorities remain, by 
and large, the main victims of violations of the right of freedom of religion or belief and 
other acts of religious intolerance. In this regard, we would like to emphasize that States 
have an obligation under international human rights law to guarantee the right of minorities 
to profess and practice their own religion. 
</p>

Angooti, both apparently now aged 18, who are allegedly at risk of imminent execution for 
offences committed when they were minors. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On January 2007, during a fight, Amir Khaleghi, aged 16 at the time, fatally 
injured another boy, Ali Malekpour, under the influence of alcohol. Once sobered 
up, he turned himself in at the Jamkaran police station. In spite of the circumstances, 
he was convicted of a &#8220;qesas&#8221; crime (premeditated murder) by Branch 74 of Tehran 
province&#8217;s general criminal court and sentenced to death; the decision was 
subsequently confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. In February 2009, the 
head of judiciary postponed his execution for two months. 
</p>
<p> In 2008, at the age of 17, Safar Angooti was sentenced to death by a court in 
Tehran. The Court found him guilty of murdering a rival suitor, whom he stabbed 
for talking to the girl he cared about.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p>385. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, I reiterate 
that any executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal 
obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments which I have been

years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty 
shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.  
</p>
<p>386. I would further like to reiterate that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Merely taking gradual measures to decrease the carrying out of death sentences 
against offenders who were juveniles is an utterly inadequate approach to complying 
with your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s obligations under international law, which 
can only be fulfilled by immediately stopping all executions for crimes committed 
by persons who were not aged 18 at the time of the offence.  Laws permitting the 
death sentence to be imposed on juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent with 
the international legal obligations assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
should be promptly repealed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For the purposes of your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s obligation under international 
law to end the imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age, the distinction between the qesas claim of the victim&#8217;s 
family and the public interest to punish murder is immaterial. International law bans 
the imposition of the death penalty for offences committed by children in both cases. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; International law, in particular Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, guarantees the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence from the State authorities. Where the diyah pardon is available, it must be 
supplemented by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or 
commutation. 
</p>
<p>387. I have set forth the arguments underlying these rules of international law on a 
number of occasions, most recently in my communication to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government of 13 August 2008 regarding the cases of juvenile offenders Soghra Najafpoor, 
Behnood Shojaee, Mohammad Feda&#8217;i and seven others. 
</p>
<p>388. I would respectfully reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran to take all necessary steps to avoid executions that would be inconsistent with 
accepted standards of international human rights law and to take steps to bring its 
legislation in compliance with Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political, to which it is a party. In 
particular, I urge your Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death sentences 
imposed against Amir Khaleghi and Safar Angooti as well as all other persons awaiting 
executions for offences committed before they reached age 18. All other efforts undertaken 
by your Government to prevent these executions are insufficient to meet its obligations 
under international treaties it is a Party to. 
</p>
<p>389. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 18 June 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on arbitrary detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>390. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the killing of students Fatemeh 
Barati, Kasra Sharafi, Mobina Ehterami, Kambiz Sho'a'i and Mohsen Imani along with at 
least seven other protesters and the arbitrary detention of dozens of opposition activists 
following recent elections in Iran.    
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> Following the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on 13 June 
2009, tens of thousands of opposition supporters have taken to the streets of Tehran 
and other cities throughout the country to call for annulment of the election results.  
While protests have been largely peaceful, violent clashes with security forces have 
ensued resulting in the death of at least twelve people.  Agents of the Revolutionary 
Guards, paramilitary Bassij, and State Security Force (SSF) have reportedly been 
employing extreme force to suppress protesters by opening fire during 
demonstrations and using pepper spray and batons to disperse demonstrations. 
Reports also claim that plain-clothed security forces have been using batons to beat 
non-violent individuals.  
</p>
<p> On 15 June 2009, at least seven people were killed during demonstrations in 
Tehran. Shots were fired at opposition supporters who had defied an official ban to 
march through the city centre to Azadi (Freedom) Square. Shooting erupted after a 
group at the protest reportedly attempted to attack a military location in western 
Tehran.  Reports claim that Basij militiamen, linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, 
may have been responsible for the shooting which resulted in the death of seven 
protesters. 
</p>
<p> On 14 June, up to five students including Fatemeh Barati, Kasra Sharafi, 
Mobina Ehterami, Kambiz Sho'a'i and  Mohsen Imani were shot dead when security 
agents reportedly stormed a dormitory at Tehran University and opened fire.  
Numerous students were arrested and many others suffered serious injuries during </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>130  
</b></p>
<p>the raid.  In another incident on the same day, approximately 100 riot police pursued 
some 300 students on grounds belonging to the University of Tehran.  Pepper spray 
and tear gas was reportedly used to restrain the student protesters.   There are also 
reports of people arrested at demonstrations in provincial cities such as Zahedan, 
Tabriz, Mashhad, Babol, and Shiraz. 
</p>
<p> On 13 June, approximately 170 people were arrested during clashes between 
security forces and hundreds of demonstrators around the Ministry of the Interior 
and other areas in central Tehran. Those arrested reportedly included leading 
political figures who were accused by the authorities of having &#8216;orchestrated&#8217; the 
unrest. Some have since been released.  Police on motorcycles also reportedly beat 
opposition supporters who had staged a sit-in in Vanak Square, Tehran to protest the 
results of the elections. 
</p>
<p> Access to online news services, and internet sites including social networking 
internet sites, such as You Tube and Facebook, have reportedly been blocked since 
the election results were announced. 
</p>
<p>391. Concern is expressed that the arrests and the use of excessive police force against 
opposition supporters following the recent elections in Iran may be a direct attempt to stifle 
freedom of assembly and expression in the country. In view of the events outlined above, 
concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of demonstrators as well 
opposition activists. 
</p>
<p>392. We would like to refer your Government to the principles of international law 
governing the use of force when policing protests. The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Iran is a party, provides that every individual has the 
right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no 
person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).   
</p>
<p>393. We would also like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to Principle 4 of the UN 
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, 
&#8220;Law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-
violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 
provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement 
officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of 
the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to 
any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives 
or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible 
moment.&#8221; (Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and 
the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990). 
</p>
<p>394. Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we should 
like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances 
regarding the cases of the persons named above.  We would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>395. Furthermore, all States have &#8220;the obligation (&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as 
reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on 
&#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4). The Commission added that this 
obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, (&#8230;) to 
grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to (&#8230;) prevent 
the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. Also relevant for these cases is Principle 9 of the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions, according to which &#8220;Complainants, witnesses, those conducting the 
investigation and their families shall be protected from violence, threats of violence or any 
other form of intimidation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>396. Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts of the case and on whether 
the detention of the abovementioned persons is arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to 
your Excellency's Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee their right not to 
be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>397. We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned 
persons, in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that &#8220; Everyone shall have the right 
to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>398. In this context, we would further like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to 
take all necessary steps to ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 21 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;The right 
of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of 
this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a 
democratic society in the interest of national security of public safety, public order (ordre 
public), the protection of public health or morals of the protection of the rights and 
freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>399. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person(s) are respected and 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these 
acts.  
</p>
<p>400. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned persons in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>401. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why.

<p><b>132  
</b></p>
<p>right to freedom of opinion and expression and the related right to peaceful assembly 
and association. 
</p>
<p>4. In the event that it is found that the arrests and detention were unlawful, 
please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. 
Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged 
perpetrators?

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 23 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>402. I am writing to you in relation to new information we have received regarding the 
reportedly imminent execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Haddadi, who was sentenced to 
death on 6 January 2004 for the kidnapping and murder of <b>Mohammed Bagher Rahmat</b>, a 
taxi driver, in August 2003.  At the time of the alleged offense, Mr. Haddadi was said to be 
15 years old.  
</p>
<p>403. I would like to recall the communication regarding this matter addressed to your 
Government on 29 February 2008. It drew attention to serious concerns that the death 
sentence imposed on Mr. Mohammad Reza Haddadi was in violation of your Government&#8217;s 
obligations under Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 
6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Regrettably, your 
Government has so far failed to reply to this communication.  
</p>
<p> According to recent allegations brought to my attention: 
</p>
<p> Although the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence on 3 July 2005, 
the Head of the Judiciary postponed the execution in October 2008.  On 27 May 
2009, the Head of the Judiciary stayed the execution a second time and ordered 
Branch 17 of the Supreme Court to review the case. Despite the fact that no review 
has taken place, the execution has reportedly already been scheduled. 
</p>
<p>404. Although the death penalty is not, per se, prohibited under international law, I would 
like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that it must be regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner. It is crucial that all restrictions and fair trial standards pertaining to 
capital punishment contained in international human rights law are fully respected in 
proceedings relating to capital offences. As Article 14(5) of the ICCPR provides, 
&#8220;Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being 
reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.&#8221; Since the Head of the Judiciary has 
ordered a review of Mr. Haddadi&#8217;s case, no execution should be carried out before the 
completion of the review. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>405. Furthermore, since Mr. Haddadi was only 15 years old at the time of the alleged 
offense, I would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the execution of a 
juvenile offender would be incompatible with the international legal obligations of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the ICCPR provides that 
the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age.  
</p>
<p>406. I would therefore respectfully request Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to commute the sentence of execution in order to ensure compliance with 
the applicable standards of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>407. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Is it accurate that Mohammad Reza Haddadi execution has been scheduled 
and, if so, for what date?  
</p>
<p>2. Please explain how your Excellency&#8217;s Government considers Mr. Haddadi&#8217;s 
death sentence to be consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 8 August 2009  
</b></p>
<p>408. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding Mr. Hossein Haghi, apparently now 
aged 22, who is allegedly at risk of imminent execution for offences committed when he 
was a minor. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 12 August 2003, Hossein Haghi, aged 16 at the time, fatally wounded 
another boy, Mehdi Khalili. Hossein Haghi and a friend had intervened in order to 
stop a fight between two other boys. It is alleged that Hossein Haghi was being hit 
and retained when he grabbed a knife to defend himself. Mehdi Khalili was killed 
during the fight by a knife wound to the chest. When arrested, Hossein Haghi 
admitted to holding a knife and stabbing Mehdi Khalili. During the trial, however, 
he denied stabbing him to death.  
</p>
<p> On 8 February 2004, he was found guilty of premeditated murder by Branch 
74 of the Criminal Court, and sentenced to qesas. Following several petitions the 
verdict was quashed by the head of the Judiciary in September 2008, and the case 
was sent for retrial. Branch 71 of the Teharan Criminal Court, which retried the case, 
once again sentenced him to death. The sentence was approved by Branch 27 of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>134  
</b></p>
<p>Supreme Court and passed on to the Office for the Implementation of Sentences at 
the end of the month of August.  
</p>
<p>409. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, I reiterate 
that any executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the international legal 
obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments which I have been 
mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Party, expressly provides that 
capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen 
years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty 
shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.  
</p>
<p>410. I wish to thank your Excellency for your letter dated 15 July 2009 in response to my 
letter of 23 August 2007, in respect to another case in which the accused juvenile offender 
had been sentenced to qesas. Your letter indicates that through efforts of the Judiciary, the 
case had entered the reconciliation case and that as a result of the victim&#8217;s guardians giving 
their consent the execution had been stopped and the accused released. While I welcome 
this outcome, I remain concerned that such efforts to decrease the carrying out of death 
sentences against offenders who were juveniles is an utterly inadequate approach to 
complying with your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s obligations under international law. 
These can only be fulfilled by immediately stopping all executions for crimes committed by 
persons who were not aged 18 at the time of the offence.  Laws permitting the death 
sentence to be imposed on juvenile offenders are inherently inconsistent with the 
international legal obligations assumed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and should be 
promptly repealed. 
</p>
<p>411. I would further like to reiterate that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; For the purposes of your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s obligation under international 
law to end the imposition of capital punishment for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age, the distinction between the qesas claim of the victim&#8217;s 
family and the public interest to punish murder is immaterial. International law bans 
the imposition of the death penalty for offences committed by children in both cases. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; International law, in particular Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, guarantees the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence from the State authorities. Where the diyah pardon is available, it must be 
supplemented by a separate, public system for seeking an official pardon or 
commutation. 
</p>
<p>412. I have set forth the arguments underlying these rules of international law on a 
number of occasions, most recently in my communication to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government of 6 May 2009 regarding the cases of juvenile offenders Amir Khaleghi, and 
Safar Angooti. 
</p>
<p>413. I would respectfully reiterate my appeal to the Government of the Islamic Republic

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 1 October 2009</b>  
</p>
<p>415. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding the imminent execution of Mr. Abbas 
Hosseini. According to the information received the date for the execution of the death 
penalty has been set for 5 October 2009.  I have previously written to your Excellency`s 
Government on this matter in communications dated 21 April 2005, 17 September 2008 
and 6 March 2009. However, I have yet to receive any reply on issues raised therein.  
</p>
<p>416. I reiterate as in my previous communications that Mr Abbas Hosseini was a minor at 
the time of the commission of the offence of murder for which he was sentenced to death. 
Mr Hosseini was sentenced to death for the offence of murder on 3 June 2004 by verdict 
No.13/277 of Branch 43 of the Mashhad Special Court. On 28 October 2004, Branch 41 of 
the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Juvenile Court in Mashhad. The Supreme 
Court judgment issued on 29 December 2008, following a hearing, expressly recognized 
that Mr Hosseini was a minor at the time of committing the offence but nevertheless 
confirmed the death sentence.  
</p>
<p>417. There have been efforts to engage in a process of convincing the family of the victim 
to accept payment of compensation (diyeh) from the family of Mr Hossein. In this regard, 
on 7 May 2005, the Head of the Judiciary reportedly ordered that the execution should not 
proceed while the file was being reviewed by the central judiciary in Tehran. These 
discussions have not been successful as the family of the victim has refused to accept the 
payment of compensation (diyeh). Currently, the family of Mr Hosseini is unable to further 
engage with the family of the victim as it is reportedly in a mourning period for the death of 
one its sons.  
</p>
<p>418. In this connection, I wish to draw to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
that carrying out the execution of Mr Abbas Hosseini would be incompatible with the </p>

<p>419. I have in my previous communications acknowledged the efforts made by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to avoid the execution of Mr Hosseini by undertaking review of 
the case and repeatedly postponing the execution in order make provision for discussion 
between the families. Although this is commendable, your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
nevertheless retains the obligations it has undertaken under international law, especially the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. All efforts short of lifting or commuting the death sentence against Mr Hosseini are 
insufficient to meet its obligations under international treaties it is a Party to, specifically 
under Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6(5) of the 
Covenant.  
</p>
<p>420. I respectfully urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all measures necessary to 
comply with the commitments it has undertaken under international law. These measures 
were, in my view, accurately reflected in the recommendations issued by the United 
Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, which called on the Islamic Republic of Iran 
in January 2005 to &#8220;immediately suspend the execution of all death penalties imposed on 
persons for having committed a crime before the age of 18, to take the appropriate legal 
measures to convert them to penalties in conformity with the provisions of the Convention 
and to abolish the death penalty as a sentence imposed on persons for having committed 
crimes before the age of 18, as required by article 37 of the Convention.&#8221; (See 
CRC/C/15/Add. 254, 28 January 2005, at par. 30) 
</p>
<p>421. In view of the urgency of this matter and of the irreversibility of the punishment of 
the death penalty, it is imperative that your Excellency&#8217;s Government should take all steps 
necessary to prevent the execution of Mr Abbas Hosseini, which if carried out will be 
inconsistent with acceptable standards of international law. Further, the unsuccessful 
negotiations so far, for compensation (diyeh) to the victim&#8217;s family should not form the 
basis for carrying out the execution of the death penalty.  I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to lift or commute the death sentence imposed against Mr Abbas Hosseini.   
</p>
<p>422. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all such cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases 
to the Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations. I undertake 
to ensure that your Government&#8217;s response is accurately reflected in the reports I will 
submit to the Human Rights Council for its consideration.

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 8 October 2009</b>  
</p>
<p>423. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding the allegedly imminent execution of 
Mr <b>Behnood Shoojaee</b> and Mr<b> Safar Angooti</b> for offences they committed while they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>were still minors. According to information I have received, 11 October 2009 has been set 
as the execution date for Behnood Shoojaee and 21 October 2009 for Safar Angooti. I have 
previously written to your Excellency&#8217;s Government concerning Mr.  Behnood Shoojaee in 
two communications dated 27 December 2007 and 13 August 2008 and concerning Mr 
Safar Angooti in a communication dated 6 May 2009. I acknowledge receiving a response 
from your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding the case of Behnood Shoojaee on 15 July 
2009 
</p>
<p>424. As indicated in my previous communications and not denied in the response 
received from your Excellency&#8217;s Government, Mr Behnood Shoojaee was convicted by a 
court in Tehran of murdering another boy during a street fight when he was 17 years old. 
Mr Safar Angoti was sentenced to death in 2008 by a court in Tehran having been found 
guilty of a murder committed at the age of 17. 
</p>
<p>425. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, I reiterate 
that any further executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible with the 
international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various instruments 
which I have been mandated to bring to the attention your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Islamic Republic of 
Iran is a Party, expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Islamic Republic of Iran is a 
Party, provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age.  
</p>
<p>426. In view of the urgency of this matter and of the irreversibility of the punishment of 
the death penalty, it is imperative that your Excellency&#8217;s Government should take all steps 
necessary to prevent the execution of Mr Behnood Shoojaee and Mr Safar Angooti. I 
therefore again urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to suspend the executions reportedly 
already scheduled and expeditiously lift or commute the death sentences imposed against 
Mr Safar Angooti and Mr.  Behnood Shoojaee, as well as all other persons awaiting 
execution for offences committed before they reached age 18.  
</p>
<p>427. I acknowledge the assurances contained in the letter of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government dated 15 July 2009 to the effect that, in the case of Behnood Schoojaee as in 
other cases, the pertinent authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran have been doing their 
utmost to move the victim&#8217;s guardians to accept the payment of diyeh in place of execution. 
However, as I have pointed out both in previous letters to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
and in a recent report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/11/2, paras. 35-36), all efforts 
undertaken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to prevent executions of juvenile offenders 
short of lifting or commuting the death penalty are insufficient to meet its obligations under 
international treaties it is a Party to. 
</p>
<p>428. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council and reinforced by the appropriate resolutions of the General Assembly, to seek to 
clarify all such cases brought to my attention.  Since I am expected to report on these cases 
to the Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations. I undertake

</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 13 October 2009</b>  
</p>
<p>429. I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to information I 
have received regarding the allegedly imminent execution of three men convicted and 
sentenced to death on the charge of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; (enmity against God), Messrs. <b>Habibollah 
Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian</b> and<b> Sherko Moarefi</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to information received  
</p>
<p>Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian and Sherko Moarefi were convicted 
and sentenced to death for &#8220;mohareb&#8221; on charges believed to relate to their alleged 
membership of PJAK (the Free Life Party of Kurdistan), a forbidden armed group. 
They are reportedly currently held at a prison in Sanandaj, the capital of Kordestan 
province. A judge in Sanandaj has received instructions from the judicial authorities 
in Tehran to prepare for the executions. The three men have been moved to solitary 
confinement in preparation for the pending executions.  
</p>
<p>430. I have previously written to your Excellency&#8217;s Government (communications dated 
31 August 2006, 26 July 2007, 24 April 2008, 18 July 2008 and 28 April 2009) drawing 
attention to concerns regarding the compatibility of the imposition of the death penalty on 
the charge of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; with international law obligations accepted by the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>431. The concern in relation to the utilization of this charge, which reports indicate is 
directed mainly against political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused 
of espionage, is that it might not be sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict 
standards of legality set by article 6(2) of the of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party. This provision stipulates 
that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law&#8221;. Two issues relevant 
to the case of Messrs. Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian and Sherko Moarefi 
arise from this provision:  
</p>
<p>(a) For the sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law 
in question must be sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct 
punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so punishable. 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.1) and  
</p>
<p>(b) The death penalty is limited to the &#8220;most serious crimes.&#8221; As observed in a 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough 
and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations 
bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death 
sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an 
intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  Moreover, 
when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report presented by your 
Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations that it 
&#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in 
loss of life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). 
</p>
<p>432. On the basis of these principles, I have repeatedly sought from your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government a definition of mohareb under Iranian law. While your Government has </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>provided substantial information on the factual allegations on which the mohareb charges 
were based in some of the cases brought to its attention (Adnan Hassanpour, Farzad 
Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili), which is highly appreciated, it has 
regrettably not answered my query regarding the definition of mohareb.  
</p>
<p>433. The information provided by your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding the charges 
against Adnan Hassanpour, Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili does not 
indicate that they were accused of any incidents of intentional taking of life (this is not to 
diminish in any way the seriousness of the charges of handling of explosives on behalf of 
an allegedly terrorist group leveled against Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad 
Vakili according to your Government&#8217;s communication of 8 April 2009). Similarly, while 
PJAK has reportedly launched deadly attacks against security forces, the charges of 
mohareb against Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian and Sherko Moarefi raise the 
concern that they could have been sentenced to death without being found guilty of any 
intentional killing. 
</p>
<p>434. I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian and Sherko Moarefi are not 
deprived of their lives in violation of the obligations your Excellency&#8217;s Government has 
entered into under international law. Considering the irreversible nature of capital 
punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death sentence against them until the 
question whether the acts they were found guilty of satisfy the international criteria as to 
what constitutes &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; has been clarified. In view of the urgency of the 
matter, I would appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to safeguard the rights of Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian and 
Sherko Moarefi in compliance with your Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>435. Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please indicate the specific conduct that Habibollah Latifi, Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) 
Fattahian and Sherko Moarefi have been found guilty of and the legal basis of the 
death sentences imposed against them. Please indicate how these are compatible 
with international norms, specifically with the requirement in article 6(2) of the 
ICCPR, to which Iran is a party, that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for 
the most serious crimes in accordance with the law 
</p>
<p>3. Please indicate the definition of the charge of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; (enmity against 
God) and provide the requisite elements of the offence.

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 29 October 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>436. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the reportedly imminent execution 
of seven men belonging to the Ahwazi Arab community in Iran. Their names are Messrs. 
Ali Saedi, aged 25, Walid Naisi, aged 23, Majid Fardipour (name in Arabic: Majid 
Mahawi), aged 26, Doayr Mahawi, aged 50, Maher Mahawi, aged 21, Ahmad Saedi, aged 
28, and Yousuf Leftehpour, aged 25.  
</p>
<p> According to information received  
</p>
<p> The seven men were arrested on or around 12 August 2007. They were held 
in incommunicado detention at an unknown location by intelligence services 
between three to fifteen months. It is feared that during this period they may have 
been tortured in order to extract confessions from them. The accused were later 
transferred to Karoun Prison in Ahvaz city, where it is reported they are currently 
being held.  
</p>
<p> On or around 30 September 2009, they were tried, convicted and sentenced to 
death by a branch of the Revolutionary Court in Ahvaz for the offences of &#8220;acting 
against national security&#8221; and the killing of a Shi&#8217;a cleric, Sheikh Hesam al-Sameyri 
in June 2007. The seven men did not have access to counsel either before or during 
the trial. 
</p>
<p>437. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a 
party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this 
right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her 
life (article 6).   
</p>
<p>438. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be 
interpreted in the most restrictive manner. We would respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that in capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe 
rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in article 14 of the ICCPR admits of no 
exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to be assisted by 
a lawyer of one&#8217;s own choosing and the right not to be compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p>439. Article 14(3)(b) of the ICCPR enshrines the right to &#8220;have adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and to communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] 
own choosing&#8221;. The Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers (Adopted by the Eighth 
United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990) further elaborate that &#8220;[a]ll persons are 
entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their 
rights and to defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings&#8221; (Principle 1). With regard 
to criminal justice matters, Principle 5 on Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adds that  
Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by the competent 
authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice upon arrest or 
detention or when charged with a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>440. With regard to concerns that the seven men may have been tortured in order to 
extract confession whilst in incommunicado detention, we would like to draw the attention 
of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to article 14(3)(g) of the ICCPR, providing that no one 
shall &#8220;be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.&#8221; Paragraph 6c of Human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 similarly urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement 
established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>441. With regard to the alleged prolonged incommunicado detention of the seven men, 
we would recall that General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007 
(paragraph 12) &#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in 
secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment&#8221;. 
The General Assembly therefore &#8220;urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the 
liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. Prolonged incommunicado detention 
furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a fair trial, such as being 
assisted by a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>442. Only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which 
violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights under international 
law of Messrs Ali Saedi, Walid Naisi, Majid Fardipour (Majid Mahawi), Doayr Mahawi, 
Maher Mahawi, Ahmad Saedi, and Yousuf Leftehpour are respected. Considering the 
irreversible nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death 
sentence against the seven men until the question of whether fair trial guarantees were 
respected has been clarified and the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated 
and all doubts in this respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p>443. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the seven men 
mentioned herein in compliance with your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s international legal 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>444. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to the allegation that Messrs Ali Saedi, Walid Naisi,, Majid Fardipour 
(Majid Mahawi), Doayr Mahawi, Maher Mahawi, Ahmad Saedi, and Yousuf 
Leftehpour were subjected to torture while in incommunicado detention. If no 
inquiries have taken place or if they have been inconclusive please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. Please indicate whether and at what stage of the proceedings Messrs Ali 
Saedi, Walid Naisi, Majid Fardipour (Majid Mahawi), Doayr Mahawi, Maher 
Mahawi, Ahmad Saedi, and Yousuf Leftehpour had access to counsel and whether 
they were given the option of choosing their own counsel?

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 8 December 2009</b>  
</p>
<p>445. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to 
information I have received in relation to the case of Mr. Mohammad Reza Haddadi, a man 
reportedly sentenced to death for a killing committed when he was aged 15.  
</p>
<p>446. Information I have recently received indicates that Mr. Haddadi&#8217;s execution is 
scheduled for tomorrow, 9 December 2009. Reportedly, Mr. Haddadi has been moved to 
the &#8220;quarantine&#8221; section of Adelabad prison in preparation for his execution. Neither his 
lawyer nor his parents have, however, been informed of the new execution date. 
</p>
<p>447. I would like to recall the communications regarding this case addressed to your 
Government on 29 February 2008 and 23 July 2009. They drew attention to serious 
concerns that the death sentence imposed on Mr. Mohammad Reza Haddadi was in 
violation of your Government&#8217;s obligations under Article 37(a) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which provide that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed 
by persons below eighteen years of age at the time of the offence. Regrettably, your 
Government has so far failed to reply to these communications.  
</p>
<p>448. My communication of 23 July 2009 also drew the attention of your Government to 
the principle whereby in capital cases, because of the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty, it is particularly important that all fair trial standards contained in international 
human rights law are fully respected. This includes fullest respect for due process 
guarantees in post-conviction proceedings. It is my understanding that, as part of due 
process in post-conviction proceedings, the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran requires 
prior notification of the execution date to the lawyer and the family members of the 
prisoner. If indeed the execution of Mr. Haddadi has been scheduled for 9 December 2009, 
this requirement would appear to have been violated. 
</p>
<p>449. I would therefore respectfully request your Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure that Mr. Haddadi is not executed tomorrow. Moreover, in order to ensure 
compliance with the absolute ban of the death sentence against juvenile offenders in 
international human rights law, the death sentence will have to be commuted.

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 22 December 2009</b>  
</p>
<p>450. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Government to 
information I have received regarding several cases of men sentenced to death on charges 
of homosexuality. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>143 
</b></p>
<p> Articles 108 to 111 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran provide for the death 
penalty for sexual intercourse with penetration between &#8220;mature, sane and 
consenting&#8221; men (lavat). Article 114 requires that lavat be proven by the testimony 
of four male eyewitnesses. Under article 120 of the Code, however, if there are no 
four male eyewitnesses supporting a charge of lavat, the judge may issue a verdict 
and death sentence &#8220;on the basis of the knowledge which he has acquired through 
generally accepted methods&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Nemat Safavi was arrested on charges of lavat in June 2006, when he was 
aged 16. The Criminal Court of Ardabil found him guilty and sentenced him to 
death in 2008. In November 2009, the Supreme Court quashed the sentence and sent 
the case back to a different section of the Criminal Court of Ardabil.

Court of Ardabil found the two men guilty of lavat and sentenced them to death. 
Reportedly, the conviction was based on &#8220;the knowledge of the judge&#8221;. The current 
state of the proceedings against him is unknown. 
</p>
<p> In or briefly before February 2008, Hamze Chavoshi (aged 19 at the time) 
and Loghman Hemzepour (aged 18 at the time) were arrested on charges of lavat. 
The current state of the proceedings against them is unknown. 
</p>
<p> In July 2008, the Second District of the Criminal Court of Tabriz found 
Mahdi Pooran (reportedly aged 17), Hamid Taghi, Ebrahim Hamidi, and Mehdi 
Rezaii guilty of lavat and sentenced them to death. The four defendants are accused 
by a fifth man of having raped him. Reportedly, there is enmity between the alleged 
victim&#8217;s family and the family of Ebrahim Hamidi.  The alleged victim initially 
stated that there were no witnesses to the rape. At the trial, however, three male 
relatives of the alleged victim were introduced as witnesses to the rape. As that did 
not meet the requirement of four male witnesses, the judge convicted the four 
defendants on the basis of &#8220;the knowledge of the judge&#8221;. The case is currently 
pending before the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p> On an unspecified date the Criminal Court of Shiraz found Mohsen Ghabraii 
guilty of lavat and sentenced him to death. The judgment has been upheld on appeal 
by the Supreme Court and there is a risk that execution might be imminent. 
</p>
<p>451. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to 
recall that article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
Iran is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the 
&#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. In interpreting article 
6(2) of the Covenant, however, the Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the 
imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not result in the loss of life, finding only 
cases involving murder not to raise concerns under the most serious crimes provision. As I 
have observed in a report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a 
thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations 
bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence 
can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill 
which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Already in 1993, the Human 
Rights Committee (CCPR/C/79/Add.25) noted in its concluding observations on the 
periodic report under the Covenant of your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the imposition of 
the death penalty for crimes that do not result in the loss of life is incompatible with the 
Covenant. 
</p>
<p>452. With regard to the cases of Nemat Safavi and Mahdi Pooran, I would further like to 
draw your Government&#8217;s attention once again to the fact that any further judgments </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>144  
</b></p>
<p>imposing the death sentence and executions of juvenile offenders would be incompatible 
with the international legal obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under various 
instruments which I have been mandated to bring to the attention of Governments. Article 
37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran is a Party, expressly 
provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, to which Iran is a Party, provides that the death penalty shall not be 
imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p>453. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged above accurate?  Please provide detailed information on 
the current state of criminal proceedings on charges of lavat against Nemat Safavi, 
Ghaseem Bashkool and the man arrested together with him, Hamze Chavoshi and 
Loghman Hemzepour, Mahdi Pooran, Hamid Taghi, Ebrahim Hamidi, and Mehdi 
Rezaii, and Mohsen Ghabraii. 
</p>
<p>2. Is the information summarized above concerning the relevant provisions of 
the Islamic Penal Code of Iran accurate? Please explain the concept of a guilty 
finding based on &#8220;the knowledge of the judge&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide statistics as to the number of persons sentenced to death for 
the offence of lavat and the number of those executed in the past five years.

</p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 29 December 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on arbitrary 
detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>454. We write to your Government in relation to reports regarding the use of excessive 
force by the security forces and the Basij militia against demonstrators on 27 December 
2009, alleged arbitrary arrests and the suppression of (at least initially) peaceful assemblies. 
We urge your Government to ensure respect for international law guaranteeing the right to 
life, the right to physical and mental integrity, freedom of opinion and expression and 
freedom from arbitrary detention. We seize this opportunity also to follow up on our 
communication of 18 June 2009 concerning the use of excessive force against 
demonstrators and opposition supporters following the 13 June 2009 elections in Iran.  
</p>
<p> According to information received regarding the events of 27 December 2009: 
</p>
<p> Widespread protests broke out in Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, 
Qom and several other cities in Iran on 27 December 2009. Reports and videos </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>145 
</b></p>
<p>indicate that Basij militia and security forces attacked protesters using excessive 
force and live ammunition. Near Daneshjoo Park in Tehran, for instance, members 
of the Basij militia beat demonstrators with batons, wood sticks and metal pipes, 
killing at least one person. As this demonstrator&#8217;s dead body was moved through the 
crowd, other demonstrators started attacking the Basij members, brought several of 
them down from their motorcycles, and set vehicles of the security forces on fire. In 
an unspecified location, security forces tied a young protestor to the back of a van 
and dragged him on the asphalt. Other demonstrators attacked the van, took the 
passengers out and set the van on fire.  
</p>
<p> In Enqelab Street and at Pol-e College in Tehran security forces used live 
ammunition against protesters. Three persons were reportedly killed at Pol-e college. 
Mr. Seyd Ali Moussavi, aged 35 and nephew of Mr. Mir Hossein Moussavi, an 
opposition candidate for president in the recent elections, was shot in the back, 
apparently injuring his heart, and killed by security forces at around noon in Enqelab 
Square.  
</p>
<p> Reports further indicate that four protesters were killed in Tabriz. Reports 
vary as to the overall death toll on 27 December 2009, fifteen dead being the highest 
number indicated in reports we have received.  
</p>
<p> About 300 persons were arrested on 27 December 2009. They include three 
advisers to Mir Hossein Moussavi, namely Messrs. <b>Alireza Beheshti, Ghorban 
Behzadian-Nejad </b>and<b> Mohammad Bagherian</b>, and two aides to the former 
President Mr. Mohammad Khatami, Messrs. <b>Morteza Haji</b> and <b>Hasan Rasooli</b>. In 
the early morning hours of 28 December, Mr. <b>Ebrahim Yazdi</b>, aged 78, a former 
foreign minister and now leader of the Freedom Movement of Iran, was arrested. 
</p>
<p> According to information received regarding the events from 15 June to the 
end of August 2009 (the first two paragraphs restate information already contained 
in our communication of 18 June 2009, which has remained without a response): 
</p>
<p> On 13 June 2009, approximately 170 people were arrested during clashes 
between security forces and hundreds of demonstrators around the Ministry of the 
Interior and other areas in central Tehran. Those arrested reportedly included leading 
political figures who were accused by the authorities of having &#8216;orchestrated&#8217; the 
unrest. Some had been released by 18 June 2009.  Police on motorcycles also 
reportedly beat opposition supporters who had staged a sit-in in Vanak Square, 
Tehran, to protest the results of the elections. 
</p>
<p> On 14 June, up to five students including<b> Fatemeh Barati, Kasra Sharafi, 
Mobina Ehterami, Kambiz Sho'a'i </b>and <b>Mohsen Imani</b> were shot dead when 
security agents reportedly stormed a dormitory at Tehran University and opened fire.  
Numerous students were arrested and many others suffered serious injuries during 
the raid.  In another incident on the same day, approximately 100 riot police pursued 
some 300 students on grounds belonging to the University of Tehran.  Pepper spray 
and tear gas were reportedly used to restrain the student protesters.   Protestors were 
arrested also at demonstrations in provincial cities such as Zahedan, Tabriz, 
Mashhad, Babol, and Shiraz. 
</p>
<p> On 15 June, members of the Basij militia opened fire in the Velenjak, Jordan 
and Darous districts of Tehran. A video taken on 15 June 2009 shows a member of 
the Basij firing towards demonstrators from a building used by the Basij. At least 
seven persons were killed on that day. 
</p>
<p> On 20 June, Ms. Neda Agha Soltani was shot on Khosravi street in Tehran. 
The bullet hit her chest just below the collar bone, and she died within a minute. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>146  
</b></p>
<p>Although she was immediately taken to Shariati hospital, where her death was 
confirmed, no autopsy was carried out before she was buried at Behesht-e Zahra 
cemetery. A member of the Basij militia is reported to have exclaimed at the scene 
of the shooting &#8220;I did not mean to kill her!&#8221; His identity is known in Iran, as his ID 
card was grabbed by witnesses and a picture of it posted online. 
</p>
<p> Also on 20 June, opposite the Navvab metro station in Tehran, members of 
the Basij militia opened fire from the roof of the Lolagar mosque at persons in the 
street with Kalashnikovs and Heckler &amp; Koch G3 guns. A young boy was hit in the 
head and his brain spattered on the platform outside the metro station. A young man 
was hit in the throat by a tear gas bullet and died on the spot. 
</p>
<p> On 22 June, the Office of the Prosecutor General stated that it had started an 
investigation into the killings on 20 June. More than half a year later, no results of 
that investigation have been made public. 
</p>
<p> On 25 June, Basij militia on the roof of the Lolagar mosque shot and killed 
Mr. Ya&#8217;qoub Barvayeh, a student aged 27. The Basij militia removed the body. His 
family were told two days later where he was buried. 
</p>
<p> On 30 July 2009, Ali Reza Tavassoli, aged 12, was killed by blows in the 
head inflicted by Basij militia men at a demonstration to commemorate the 40th day 
since the death of Neda Agha Soltani. Members of the Basij militia removed his 
body from hospital. 
</p>
<p> The authorities reported that 36 persons died during the unrest following the 
elections, including members of the Basij militia, but family members of persons 
who went missing and who inquired with the authorities, report that they were 
shown albums containing photographs of hundreds of corpses in makeshift morgues. 
 According to one source, 200 demonstrators were killed in Tehran and 173 in 
other cities. 
</p>
<p> On 25 August 2009, a Member of the Article 90 Commission of the 
Parliament requested an official investigation into reports that 44 bodies of killed 
protesters had been buried secretly at night in anonymous graves in section 302 of 
the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran. The chief administrator of the cemetery 
stated that the bodies were those of unknown victims of car accidents and drug 
overdoses. He was subsequently removed from his post by the Tehran city 
administration. The outcome of the investigation into the reports of anonymous 
graves section 302 of the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery is not known. 
</p>
<p>455. Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts, we would like to draw the 
attention of your Government to the principles of international law relevant to the situation 
described in the reports we have received. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Iran is a party, provide that &#8220;[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;. Article 21 of the Covenant provides that 
&#8220;[t]he right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the 
exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are 
necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security of public safety, public 
order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals of the protection of the rights 
and freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>456. Regarding the use of force when policing protests, the Covenant provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, and that no person shall be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>147 
</b></p>
<p>arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). Article 7 of the Covenant and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical 
and mental integrity of all persons.  
</p>
<p>457. These norms are further elaborated in the United Nations Basic Principles on the 
Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, 
&#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, 
(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and 
the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and 
preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured 
or affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close 
friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>458. Furthermore, as stated in the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (in particular Principle 
9), there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of 
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions...&#8221; In Resolution 8/3, the Human Rights 
Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible &#8230;to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, 
in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>459. Finally, without expressing at this stage an opinion on whether the arrests of 
protestors on 27 December 2009 are arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your 
Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee their right not to be deprived 
arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial 
tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>460. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Government to safeguard the rights of the above-mentioned persons in 
compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>461. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. How many persons were killed during demonstrations and other protests 
from 14 June to 28 December 2009? Please provide a list containing their names, the 
place in which they died, and, if they were buried by the authorities, the location of 
their place of burial. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the deaths of 
Fatemeh Barati, Kasra Sharafi, Mobina Ehterami, Kambiz Sho'a'i and Mohsen

Moussavi, as well as of all other persons killed during demonstrations and other 
protests from 14 June to 28 December 2009. If no inquiries have taken place, or if 
they have been inconclusive, please explain why. </p>

<p>4. What were the instructions given to the security forces, including the Basij 
militia, before and during the demonstrations? How did the security forces ensure 
compliance with the requirements of necessity and proportionality? 
</p>
<p>5. It is our understanding that the Basij are a paramilitary force which is part of 
the Revolutionary Guard. Please explain the legal basis, institutional affiliation,

<p><b>  Iran: Concern about imposition of the death penalty against persons found guilty of

relating to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 37 unidentified and others  
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: No response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 14 January 2010</b>  
</p>
<p>462. I write to express my concern about reports concerning the imposition of the death 
penalty against persons found guilty of &#8220;moharebeh&#8221; (enmity against God). This matter has 
been the subject of previous communications between your Excellency&#8217;s Government and 
my mandate. Two recent executions of Kurdish Iranian activists reportedly sentenced to 
death on charges of moharebeh and calls from senior officials in your Government for the 
infliction of the death penalty against opposition politicians prompt me to once again raise 
my longstanding concerns in this respect, which have not been alleviated by the responses 
received from your Excellency&#8217;s Government in reply to previous communications. 
</p>
<p>463. I summarize the information received in five parts: first, the definition of moharebeh 
under the Islamic Penal Code of Iran; second, death sentences against and executions of 
Kurdish Iranian activists on charges of moharebeh; third, the infliction of death sentences in 
the trials regarding the protests that ensued after the announcement of the results of the 13 
June 2009 elections in Iran; fourth, the reported execution of three persons sentenced to 
death on charges of moharebeh in Khuzestan province; and, fifth, the calls for the use of the 
death penalty against the political opposition following the unrest on 27 December 2009. 
</p>
<p> According to information received  
</p>
<p>I. Article 186 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran defines the offence of 
moharebeh in the following terms:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Any person resorting to arms to cause terror or fear or to breach public 
security and freedom will be considered as a mohareb and to be corrupt on earth.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Article 190 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran establishes the sanctions that can be 
imposed on those guilty of moharebeh: execution, crucifixion for three days (not 
entailing death), amputation of the right hand first and then of the left foot, and 
exile.  
</p>
<p> According to Article 191, a judge can impose any of the above penalties 
regardless of whether the mohareb has killed or injured anyone, has taken 
somebody&#8217;s property or has done none of the above. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>II. In or around February 2008, Mr.<b> Fasih Yasamani</b>, aged 28, was arrested 
during clashes between security forces and PJAK (the Free Life Party of Kurdistan) 
in the village of Hendevan near Khoy, West Azerbaijan province. His family did not 
receive any news about him for two months following his arrest. It is assumed that 
he was detained in a facility of the Ministry of Intelligence in Khoy during that 
period. He was subsequently tried before the Khoy Revolutionary Court, found 
guilty of being a member of PJAK  and sentenced to death for moharebeh. It is 
believed that the death sentence was upheld by the Appeals Court for West 
Azerbeijan province and the Supreme Court. On 6 January 2010, he was executed by 
hanging in Khoy prison. PJAK denied Mr. Yasamani was a member of the group. 
Neither Mr. Yasamani nor his lawyer or family had been given advance notice of the 
scheduling of the execution. 
</p>
<p> Mr. <b>Ehsan (Esma&#8217;il) Fattahian</b>, a Kurdish prisoner convicted on charges of 
&#8220;moharebeh&#8221;, was executed on 11 November 2009. He had been accused of &#8220;armed 
struggle against the regime&#8221;, convicted and sentenced to ten years imprisonment by 
Branch I of the Revolutionary Court in Sanandaj, Kordestan province. On appeal, 
the Kordestan Appeal Court found him guilty of moharebeh on the ground of 
membership of an armed Kurdish opposition group (reports differ as to whether the 
group he was found to belong to is PJAK or Komala), and sentenced him to death. It 
is unclear whether Mr. Fattahian was allowed to appeal against the death sentence. 
Mr. Fattahian denied any involvement in armed struggle and maintained that he was 
only a political activist. Following the execution, the authorities took Mr. Fattahian&#8217;s 
mortal remains to Kermanshah and buried him there. His family was informed of the 
place of burial the following day. I had drawn the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to his case, specifically to the concerns raised by the imposition of the 
death sentence on charges of moharebeh, in an urgent communication less than a 
month before the execution, on 13 October 2009, which has regrettably remained 
without a reply.  
</p>
<p> In my communication of 13 October 2009, I also drew the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to information I received regarding the cases of Messrs. 
<b>Habibollah Latifi</b> and <b>Sherko Moaref</b>i, who were convicted and sentenced to death 
for &#8220;moharebeh&#8221; on charges believed to relate to their alleged membership of PJAK. 
I have now been informed that Mr. Moarefi, aged 30, who was tried before the 
Revolutionary Court in Saqqez, Kordestan province, was not allowed to receive any 
visits from his lawyer or his family since his arrest on 31 October 2008. He is 
reportedly currently held at a prison in Sanandaj, the capital of Kordestan province. 
Mr. Latifi, aged 27, a law student at Azad University in Ilam province, was detained 
and allegedly tortured at a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility after his arrest 
in October 2007. He was tried by the Sanandaj Revolutionary Court in July 2008. 
Allegedly neither his family nor his lawyer were allowed to attend the trial. He was 
sentenced to death on charges of moharebeh, which were reportedly based on 
accusation that he had been involved in planting bombs, in addition to being linked 
to PJAK.    
</p>
<p> Mr. <b>Ali Saremi</b> (or Sarami), aged 62, was arrested by Ministry of 
Intelligence officials in September 2007 after speaking at a ceremony on 29 August 
2007 at the Khavaran cemetery in Tehran commemorating the victims of the alleged 
execution of thousands of prisoners, mostly supporters of the People&#8217;s Mojahedin 
Organization of Iran (PMOI), in 1988. His arrest might also be related to a visit to 
Camp Ashraf in Iraq which he undertook in April 2007 (members of his family live 
in Camp Ashraf). He was subsequently detained in Ward 209 of Evin prison and is 
currently detained in Gohardasht prison. On 29 December 2009 he was sentenced to 
death for moharebeh after being convicted of membership of the PMOI. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>150  
</b></p>
<p> Ms. <b>Zeynab Jalaliyan</b>, aged 27 from Maku, West Azerbaijan province, was 
sentenced to death by the Kermanshah Revolutionary Court in or around January 
2009. At the time of her trial, she had been detained incommunicado at a Ministry of 
Intelligence detention facility for eight months. She had no access to her lawyer. Ms. 
Jalaliyan was found guilty of moharebeh, apparently on charges related to alleged 
membership of an illegal Kurdish group, possibly PJAK, and sentenced to death. 
The death sentence has been confirmed on appeal. 
</p>
<p> Messrs. <b>Farzad Kamangar</b>, <b>Ali Heydarian</b>, and <b>Farhad Vakili</b> were 
arrested in 2006 and sentenced to death on charges of moharebeh by the Tehran 
Revolutionary Court in 2008. The Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence 
against Mr. Kamangar on 11 July 2008. As your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s reply 
of 8 April 2009 to my communication of 18 July 2008 indicates, the factual 
allegations against the three men are that they handled explosives on behalf of the 
PKK in preparation of a bomb attack in Tehran. With regard to the allegations that 
Mr. Kamangar had been detained incommunicado and subjected to torture which 
required his hospitalization, your Excellency&#8217;s Government stated that the three 
defendants &#8220;enjoyed their right of fair trial as well as enough time for review and 
examination of their cases through legal proceedings. Any allegation on their torture 
of incommunicado detention is categorically baseless and a fabrication of lies&#8221;. 
Numerous reports I have received vigorously deny that Mr. Kamangar, who 
reportedly was a teacher and social worker, had any links to the PKK. 
</p>
<p> In a communication of 26 July 2007, I had drawn the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to information that Messrs.<b> Adnan Hassanpour</b> and 
<b>Abdolwahed Butimar</b> had been sentenced to death on charges of moharebeh. 
According to the information I had received, Mr Hassanpour is a Kurdish journalist 
and an advocate of cultural rights for members of the Kurdish Iranian community 
residing in Iran, while Mr Butimar is an environmental activist and director of the 
environmental organization, The Green Mountain Society. In its reply, your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government denied that the prosecution had any connection to 
journalistic activities and stated that the charges related to actions against national 
security through the purchase and possession of war arms, delivery of weapons to 
PJAK, and espionage.  
</p>
<p> Other Kurdish prisoners reportedly sentenced to death on charges of 
&#8220;moharebeh&#8221; and possibly at risk of execution include Messrs. <b>Rostam Arkiya, 
Rashim Akhkandi, Hossein Khaziri </b>(or Khezri), <b>Sayed Sami Hosseini, Sayed 
Jammal Mohammedi, Mostafa Salimi, Anwar Rostami, Mohammad Amin 
Agoushi, Ahmad Pouladkhani, Hassan Talai, Iraj Mohammadi, Farhad 
Chalesh</b> (a Turkish national) and <b>Ramezan Ahmad</b> (a Syrian national).

<p>III. Starting on 1 August 2009, about 150 persons, mostly arrested during the 
protests that followed the announcement of the results of the 13 June 2009 elections 
in Iran, were brought before a Revolutionary Court in Tehran and tried on charges of 
having &#8220;participated in riots, acting against national security, disturbing public order, 
vandalizing public and government property and having ties with counter-
revolutionary groups&#8221;. The defendants, who were dressed in prison pajamas and 
were in poor physical conditions, had, at least in most cases, not been given advance 
warning of the commencement of their trial. Most of the accused had no legal 
representation.  
</p>
<p> As confirmed by the judiciary on 17 November 2009, five death sentences 
were imposed during these trials.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>151 
</b></p>
<p> On 8 October 2009, <b>Mohammad-Reza Ali-Zamani</b>, aged 37, was convicted 
of &#8220;enmity against God for membership of and activities to further the aims of the 
terrorist grouplet Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran (API) [the Kingdom Assembly of 
Iran]&#8221; and sentenced to death. The API is a political movement advocating for the 
return of the monarchy in Iran which reportedly has carried out violent attacks. 
Another member of the API, identified by the authorities as <b>A.P.</b> and believed to be 
Arash Rahmanipour, was also sentenced to death. A third member of the API, 
<b>Hamed Rouhinejad</b>, who was already detained in Evin prison at the time of the 
elections, was also brought before the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on 1 August 
2009 and accused together with about 100 other detainees of having &#8220;participated in 
riots, acting against national security, disturbing public order, vandalizing public and 
government property and having ties with counter-revolutionary groups&#8221;. He was 
subsequently sentenced to death in connection with these charges. 
</p>
<p> A fourth man, identified as <b>N.A.</b> and believed to be Naser Abdolhasani, was 
sentenced to death for membership of the People&#8217;s Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI). 
Finally, <b>Reza Kazemi</b>, who was arrested on 13 June 2009, was also sentenced to 
death by the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on charges related to the unrest that 
broke out after the announcement of the election results. 
</p>
<p>IV. On 19 November 2009, Mr. Davoud Sadeghi, spokesman of the judicial 
authorities of Khuzestan province, reportedly stated that since 21 March 2009 (the 
beginning of the new year according to the Iranian calendar), 30 persons had been 
executed in Ahwaz, Khuzestan province. <b>Three of those executed in Ahwaz</b> (who 
remained unnamed) had been sentenced to death on charges of moharebeh. 
</p>
<p>V. Since the protests of 27 December 2009, the day of the Ashura festivities, 
there have been calls by senior officials in your Excellency&#8217;s Government and senior 
clerics calling, explicitly or implicitly, for the imposition of the death penalty on 
charges of moharebeh against the leaders of the protests. On 5 January 2010, the 
Interior Minister, H.E. Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, reportedly stated that &#8220;after 
Ashura, anyone who takes part in riots will be considered as mohareb and an 
opponent of national security.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> Previously, on 29 December 2009 Abbas Vaez-Tabasi, a representative of the 
Supreme Leader, stated on State television that &#8220;those who are behind the current 
sedition in the country ... are mohareb and the law is very clear about punishment of 
a mohareb&#8221;. On 30 December Ayatollah Alam ol-Hoda, a member of the Assembly 
of Experts, allegedly warned demonstrators that they would be considered mohareb 
if they did not give up their opposition.  Ayatollay Alam ol-Hoda reportedly stated 
that &#8220;today enmity with God&#8217;s prophet means enmity with his manifestation, the 
Supreme Theologian [the Leader of the Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei]&#8221; and 
exhorted the demonstrators to &#8220;come back to the side of the Supreme Leader,&#8221; 
otherwise they would &#8220;regret the punishments&#8221; waiting for them. The National 
Commander of the Police, Mr. Ahmadi Moghaddam, also stated on 30 December 
that the actions of the protesters amounted to moharebeh. 
</p>
<p> On 1 January 2010, during Friday Prayers in several major Iranian cities, 
such calls were reiterated. Ayatollah Sayed Yousef Tabataienejad, during Friday 
Prayers in Isfahan, stated that &#8220;the disruptive group fought with God by coming onto 
the streets &#8230; they are <i>mofsed felarz </i>[guilty of denying the Prophet and spreading 
debauchery] and the Judiciary should know that their actions are obvious 
debauchery and according to God and the Koran the punishment is execution.&#8221; In 
Tehran Ayatollah Janati, the Secretary of the Guardian Council, stated with regard to 
protesters that they &#8220;obviously are <i>mofsed felarz</i>&#8221; and called on the judiciary to act 
as swiftly in imposing punishment against opposition protesters as it did in the wake </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>152  
</b></p>
<p>of the 1979 Revolution. In Shiraz, Ayatollah Haj Sheikh Asadolah Imani, also a 
member of the Assembly of Experts, stated in the course of the Friday Prayers that 
&#8220;anarchists should know that if they cause anarchy or contribute to it, they are 
<i>mohareb </i>and <i>mortad</i>, and the Judiciary should punish them properly.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> On 4 January 2010, the Prosecutor for Tehran, Mr. Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, 
stated that five persons arrested on 27 December 2009 had been charged with 
moharebeh. Their names are <b>Ali Mehrnia</b>, aged 70, <b>Parviz Varmazyari</b>, aged 54, 
<b>Majid Rezai</b>i, <b>Alireza Nabavi</b> and <b>Ali Massoumi</b>. They are reportedly members of 
the People&#8217;s Mojahedin Organization (PMOI). Already on 30 December 2009, the 
national Prosecutor-General, Hojjatoleslam Mohseni Eje&#8217;i, had announced in a 
closed session of the Parliament that &#8220;the Judiciary is seriously determined to 
execute at least three detainees of the Ashura events who have been found to be 
moharebs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> On 4 January 2010, a group of 36 members of Parliament (the Majlis) 
proposed a motion to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure so that those convicted 
of moharebeh would be executed within five days of their conviction. 
</p>
<p>464. Without prejudging the accuracy of the reports received and summarized above, I 
note that these reports do corroborate the concerns I had previously expressed to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government (communications dated 31 August 2006, 26 July 2007, 24 April 
2008, 18 July 2008, 28 April 2009, and 12 October 2009) with regard to the compatibility 
of the imposition of the death penalty on the charge of moharebeh with international law 
obligations accepted by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>465. Article 6(2) of the of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party, stipulates that &#8220;in countries which have not 
abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious 
crimes in accordance with the law.&#8221; Two issues relevant to the imposition of the death 
penalty on charges of moharebeh arise from this provision:  
</p>
<p>(a) For the sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law 
in question must be sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct 
punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so punishable.   
</p>
<p>(b) The death penalty is limited to the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. As observed in a 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough 
and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations 
bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death 
sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an 
intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  Moreover, 
when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report presented by your 
Excellency's Government, it expressly stated in its concluding observations that it 
&#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in 
loss of life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.25, paragraph 9). 
</p>
<p>466. The definition of moharebeh in Article 186 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran would 
appear to require only that the accused resorted to arms for the purposes of causing &#8220;terror 
or fear or [breaching] public security and freedom.&#8221; Article 191, moreover, would appear to 
explicitly clarify that the death sentence on charges of moharebeh can be imposed even 
where the conduct did not result in any death or injury. The definition of the offence under 
the Islamic Penal Code would therefore appear not to be compatible with the &#8220;most serious 
crime&#8221; requirement for capital offences in international law. 
</p>
<p>467. The responses of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to some of the cases I brought to its 
attention in the past confirm this conclusion. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>153 
</b></p>
<p>communications regarding the cases of Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydarian, Farhad Vakili, 
Adnan Hassanpour and Abdolwahed Butimar, in particular, suggest that, even assuming 
they were guilty as charged, they were not convicted of participating in any killings.  
Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydarian and Farhad Vakili, for instance, were, according to the 
information provided by your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 8 April 2009, arrested before 
they carried out the bomb attack they were allegedly planning.  
</p>
<p>468. In this respect, I would further note that I am aware of reports indicating that 
organizations such as the People&#8217;s Mojahedin Organization (PMOI), the Free Life Party of 
Kurdistan (PJAK), and Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran (API) have engaged in armed attacks 
against security forces, officials and government facilities, including attacks resulting in the 
loss of life. As mentioned above, however, under the &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; requirement, the 
mere charge of affiliation with groups engaged in violent activities against governmental 
persons or institutions is not in itself sufficient to overcome the strict limitations the 
Covenant places on the use of capital punishment.  
</p>
<p>469. The reported recent statements by senior Government officials and clerics, 
moreover, appear clearly to indicate an intention on the part of the authorities to use the 
charge of moharebeh against any, peaceful or violent, activity expressing opposition to the 
Government. The imposition of the death penalty for activities constituting the peaceful 
exercise of the freedoms of opinion and expression, assembly and association, enshrined in 
articles 19, 21 and 22 of the Covenant, is under all circumstances incompatible with your 
Government&#8217;s obligations under international law. 
</p>
<p>470. The circumstance that many of the persons found guilty of moharebeh were 
allegedly sentenced to death following very secretive trials and with severe restrictions on 
the assistance of defence counsel, in violation of article 14 of the Covenant, further 
compounds these concerns regarding the use of moharebeh charges (in addition to being a 
violation of accused persons rights on its own terms). Adversarial proceedings and public 
scrutiny are essential to ensuring that penal sanctions are imposed &#8220;in accordance with the 
law&#8221;, particularly in the context of charges carrying a strong political connotation. 
</p>
<p>471. I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that no one is executed on the basis of a judgment finding him or her guilty of 
moharebeh, that all death sentences imposed on charges of moharebeh are reviewed, and 
that the death penalty is no longer imposed on charges of moharebeh.  
</p>
<p>472. Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of the cases accurate? Are the

Is it accurate that on 30 December 2009, at a time when the Tehran Prosecutor had 
not yet finalized the indictments against these men, the national Prosecutor-General, 
Hojjatoleslam Mohseni Eje&#8217;i, announced in a closed session of the Parliament that

correctly restated above? If not so, please provide the correct translation. Are there 
any jurisprudential statements which need to be taken into account to correctly

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 27 January 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its cause and consequences. 
</p>
<p>473. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding a woman and a man who have been 
sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> A criminal court in Oroomiyeh, West Azerbeijan Province, sentenced 
Sareimeh Ebadi and Bu-Ali Janfeshani to death on charges of adultery. The death 
sentence followed a trial in which they were allegedly denied the right to select their 
own defense attorneys. On 6 January 2010 (or 8 January, according to other reports 
received), Branch 12 of the West Azerbeijan Court of Appeals upheld the death 
sentence. Both defendants are held in Oroomiyeh central prison.  
</p>
<p>474. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
recall that article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
Iran is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the 
&#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. As observed in a 
report to the Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be 
imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>155 
</b></p>
<p>the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Already in 1993, the Human Rights Committee 
(CCPR/C/79/Add.25) noted in its concluding observations on your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s periodic report under the Covenant that the imposition of the death penalty 
for adultery is incompatible with the Covenant, and thus with Iran&#8217;s obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p>475. Turning to the alleged denial of the defendants&#8217; right to appoint attorneys of their 
own choosing, while we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, 
we would respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment 
cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial 
set out in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights admits of no 
exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to be assisted by 
a lawyer of one&#8217;s own choosing and to have adequate time and facilities to prepare one&#8217;s 
defence.  
</p>
<p>476. We would also like to recall that stoning constitutes an inhuman and degrading 
treatment. In this regard, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention 
to Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights, which reminded Governments 
that corporal punishment can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to 
torture. We would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the report 
of the Special Rapporteur on torture to the 60th session of the General Assembly, in which, 
with reference to the jurisprudence of UN treaty bodies, he concluded that any form of 
corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. He also noted that States cannot invoke provisions of 
domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under international law, 
including the prohibition of corporal punishment, and called upon States to abolish all 
forms of judicial and administrative corporal punishment without delay (A/60/316, 
para.28). Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have 
called for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General 
Comment No. 20 (1992), the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture 
and ill-treatment must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement 
ordered as punishment for a crime of as an educative or disciplinary measure.   
</p>
<p>477. We would moreover like to recall that, as a State Party to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, your Excellency&#8217;s Government has undertaken to ensure 
equality between men and women in the enjoyment of all civil and political rights, 
including the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment. While in this case it would appear that both the man and the woman 
involved in the alleged adultery have been sentenced to death by stoning, we continue to be 
concerned about the reported imbalance between the number of men and women sentenced 
to death on charges of adultery, which raises certain questions in terms of possible 
discrimination in relation to both criminal enforcement and sentencing in adultery cases 
(see our communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 30 July 2008). It would be 
important to have gender disaggregated data on the use of the death penalty for adultery in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>478. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to ensure 
that the rights under international law of Sareimeh Ebadi and Bu-Ali Janfeshani are 
respected. Considering the irremediable nature of capital punishment and the fact that the 
death sentence for adultery is incompatible with your Government&#8217;s obligations under 
international law, this can only mean suspension of the executions and eventually 
commutation of the death sentences.  
</p>
<p>479. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur notes the response of 
the Government of Iraq, and regrets that the response fails to address any of the issues 
raised in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication.  In particular, the Government&#8217;s 
response does not explain why it believes that the use of force that resulted in the deaths of 
11 Camp Ashraf residents and injuries to hundreds more comports with the requirements of 
strict necessity and proportionality in law enforcement operations.  Nor does the 
Government explain, as it was requested to do, what instructions were provided to its 
security forces for the operation, and how the choice of means and methods used met the 
requirements of applicable human rights law.  The response also does not address 
allegations that the Government&#8217;s security forces prevented medical care from reaching the 
injured during, and for several days after, the operation.  Finally, the Government&#8217;s 
response does not explain whether it undertook any investigation into the legality of, and 
responsibility for, the alleged killings.

</p>
<p>481. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
attention information we have received with regard to the<b> alleged excessive use of force by 
Iraqi security forces during an operation on 28 and 29 July 2009 in Camp Ashraf, 
resulting in the death of eleven residents of Camp Ashraf and the wounding of over 
200.  
</b></p>
<p> According to allegations received: 
</p>
<p> On 28 and 29 July, hundreds of Iraqi army soldiers and police officers 
conducted an operation in Camp Ashraf with the goal of establishing a police station </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>

<p> <b>157 
</b></p>
<p>within the camp. Humvees and bulldozers were used to destroy fences and walls 
surrounding the camp. It is reported that the Iraqi armed forces also drove recklessly 
at high speeds through gathered crowds running over some of the individuals. When 
the Iraqi security forces tried to enter the camp, they clashed with hundreds of 
unarmed residents who had formed a human chain. They subsequently clashed with 
camp residents within the camp. The Iraqi security forces made use of different 
means in order to disperse the crowd including water canons, batons, batons with 
nails, metal rods, cricket bats, chains, sickles, axes, teargas and sound grenades. It is 
reported that the Iraqi security forces also made use of firearms against the camp 
residents and that the shooting was targeted.  
</p>
<p> The operation resulted in the death of eleven camp residents including six by 
gunshot (details on the causes of death are provided in the Annex) and the wounding 
of several hundred, some of which sustained grave injuries. Those injured include 23 
individuals presenting gunshot wounds and 25 presenting injuries sustained from 
being hit or run over by vehicles. It is reported that some of the dead were 
intentionally killed having been struck by a single bullet to the head or chest.  
</p>
<p> The security forces allegedly prevented Iraqi doctors from entering Camp 
Ashraf during the operation and for several days afterwards. Multinational forces 
were only allowed to evacuate the wounded on the third day. The Camp Ashraf 
ambulance was also shot at several times during the attack as doctors present in the 
camp were trying to take wounded residents to Camp Ashraf hospital. It is reported 
that lack of timely access to medical treatment may have contributed to the death of 
some of the eleven camp residents.  
</p>
<p> Furthermore, Iraqi armed forces allegedly took a large number of goods 
belonging to the residents including generators, fans, tables, chairs and cars.  
</p>
<p> Some 800 to 1000 members of the Iraqi security forces participated in the 
operation. They reportedly originate from a number of units including army units 
based around Camp Ashraf and from Baghdad, police units from Diyala province 
and Iraqi army Special Forces. 
</p>
<p>482. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the principles of international law governing the use 
of force when policing rallies and protests.  The International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Iraq is a party, prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment (Article 7), which, as the Special Rapporteur on Torture has 
highlighted in one of his reports (E/CN.4/2006/6) includes the prohibition of excessive use 
of violence: &#8220;Disproportionate or excessive exercise of police powers amounts to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is always prohibited.&#8221; (para. 38) 
Furthermore, Article 6 of ICCPR provides that every individual has the right to life and 
security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p>483. In particular, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved.  As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms 
by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement 
officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of 
force (Basic Principles, Principle 4). Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the 
use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise 
restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve 
human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or </p>

</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>158  
</b></p>
<p>affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close 
friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; 
Besides, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials provides that law 
enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required 
for the performance of their duty. 
</p>
<p>484. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of the principle whereby all 
States have &#8220;the obligation (&#8230;) to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;, as recently reiterated by 
the Human Rights Council in Resolution 8/3 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4). The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, (&#8230;) to grant adequate compensation within a 
reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, 
including legal and judicial measures, in order to (&#8230;) prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. Also relevant for these cases is Principle 17 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
(&#8220;Prevention and Investigation Principles&#8221;) provides that &#8220;[a] written report shall be made 
within a reasonable period of time on the methods and findings of such investigations. The 
report shall be made public immediately and shall include the scope of the inquiry, 
procedures and methods used to evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and 
recommendations based on findings of fact and on applicable law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>485. Furthermore, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and 
Cultural Rights also provides for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health.  This includes an obligation on the part of 
all States parties to ensure that health facilities, goods, and services are accessible to 
everyone, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, 
without discrimination.   
</p>
<p>486. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request 
that your Excellency&#8217;s Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts.  
</p>
<p>487. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the allegations in the above summary of the events accurate? If not so, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. What were the instructions given to the security forces before and during the

<p><b>  Response from the Government of Iraq dated 14 October 2009 (translated from 
Arabic) 
</b></p>
<p>488. The following is the position of the Iraqi Government on the file pertaining to Camp 
New Iraq (formerly Camp Ashraf) since its assumption of responsibility for security: 
</p>
<p> 1. After assuming responsibility for security on 30 June 2009 and imposing its 
sovereignty over the whole territory of Iraq, including Camp New Iraq, the Iraqi 
Government informed representatives of the residents of the Camp at a number of meetings 
attended by representatives of the United States Embassy in Iraq of its decision to open a 
police station in the Camp. The response of the Organization&#8217;s leadership was to reject the 
decision and to deny entry to the security forces. 
</p>
<p> 2. The Committee held a number of meetings with relevant international 
organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to explain the Committee&#8217;s 
decision to open an Iraqi police station. The Committee&#8217;s decisions and the right of the 
Iraqi Government to impose its sovereignty over the whole territory of Iraq, including the 
opening of an Iraqi police station in Camp New Iraq, were endorsed. 
</p>
<p> 3. On 27 July 2009 the Iraqi Government&#8217;s decision to open a police station was 
implemented. Before the Camp was entered, negotiations were held for more than two 
hours, in the presence of the American side, with the leadership of the Organization in the 
Camp concerning the entry of the staff of the police station. The negotiations ended with 
the Camp leadership&#8217;s rejection of the decision to open the police station, and the security 
forces then proceeded to carry out their duty. The military leadership had ordered that 
weapons should not be loaded. The security forces met with opposition from the residents 
of the Camp, who used sticks, stones, sound grenades, swords and knives, and were sprayed 
with chlorine gas. The security forces achieved their aim of reaching the place within the 
Camp that had been selected for the police station. 
</p>
<p> 4. The results of the entry operation were as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Sixty-two members and 7 officers of the security forces were injured 
and more than 20 Iraqi vehicles were seriously damaged; 
</p>
<p> (b) Thirty-six Camp residents were arrested when they left the Camp and 
attacked the security forces; they are now subject to the jurisdiction of the Iraqi 
judicial authorities in Diyala and have been placed in an appropriate detention centre 
that complies with human rights principles; they have been examined daily by 
doctors but refuse to be transferred to government hospitals and are on hunger strike; 
</p>
<p> (c) The 36 detainees have been visited by the International Committee of 
the Red Cross and by a United Nations human rights delegation, which undertook a 
detailed examination of the services being provided by the Iraqi Government to the 
detainees and the residents of the Camp; 
</p>
<p> (d) The utility authorities within the Camp (water supply station, 
electricity supply station, New Iraq Hospital) continue to provide services to the 
residents of the Camp; 
</p>
<p> (e) Foodstuffs, humanitarian supplies and medicines continue to be 
delivered; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>160  
</b></p>
<p> (f) Vehicles and military equipment used by the residents of the Camp 
against the security forces have been seized; an inventory has been compiled and 
they have been impounded within the Camp pending investigations to identify the 
relevant official documents; 
</p>
<p> (g) Military equipment (Katyusha rocket launcher, artillery launcher, 
artillery platform, night vision goggles, etc.) was found at one of the sites used by 
the residents of the Camp in the place known as Karim Gate after it was evacuated. 
This fact was documented in the presence of the American side. 
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq: Use of the death penalty without adequate safeguards 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Deaths due to the use of force by law enforcement officials or persons 
acting in direct or indirect compliance with the State, when the use of force is inconsistent 
with the criteria of absolute necessity and proportionality 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: Group concern: 168 males, 1 female and 12 unknown   
</p>
<p><b>Character of repl</b>y: Translation awaited  
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Government of Iraq replied to the 
communication below on 22 December 2009. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response but unfortunately had not received a translation of it from the relevant services at 
the time this report was finalized. He is unable, therefore, to make observations, and 
expects they will be included in the next report. However, a copy of the original response 
letter is available online at the following address: 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/docs/Irak_22.12.09_6.2009.pdf. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 21 October 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>489. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the use of the death penalty in Iraq 
since May 2009. Reports that were made available to us indicate that on 3 May 2009, 12 
death row inmates were hanged and, again, on 10 June, 18 men and 1 woman, Qassima 
Hamid, were hanged in secret. We are also informed that currently as many as 1,000 
persons may be on death row in Iraq, of whom 150 are reported to have exhausted all 
judicial remedies and to be at imminent risk of execution. We have neither been informed 
of the names of these persons nor of the charges on which they were convicted, nor have 
we been made aware of any details of their trials.  
</p>
<p>490. Although international law does not prohibit the death penalty, it nonetheless 
mandates that it must be regarded as an exception to the fundamental right to life, and must 
as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. It is essential that capital punishment, 
whenever it is resorted to, should fully respect all fair trial standards contained in 
international human rights law in the relevant proceedings with the sentence being 
pronounced only following a regular judicial process.   
</p>
<p>491. We would also like to reiterate our concerns raised with your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government in a previous communication dated 23 December 2008, concerning Majeed 
Ibrahim Hamo and Saeed Khalil in relation to fair trial rights in capital punishment cases. 
As we have received no response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government, we have no reason 
to conclude that these concerns are no longer valid.  Based on what we consider to be 
reliable reports on pre-trial and trial procedures currently followed before the Central 
Criminal Court of Iraq and other criminal courts of Iraq, as well as appeals procedures 
before the Court of Cassation, we remain very concerned that minimum fair trial standards, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>especially in relation to capital offences, have not yet been met. We therefore note the 
following:   
</p>
<p> (1) It is of particular concern that the prohibition of the use of evidence - 
including confessions - gathered under duress or torture, and the right not to be compelled 
to testify against oneself or to confess guilt, are inadequately respected in Iraq, rendering 
the imposition of the death penalty arbitrary. We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human 
Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established 
to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except 
against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition to 
being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the non-
derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iraq is a party. 
</p>
<p> (2) Defendants are also reported to be frequently denied the right to an adequate 
defence. They are denied access to evidence against them, as well as to their counsel within 
a reasonable period of time that would enable them to mount an effective defence. These 
procedural defects amount to a violation of article 14(3)(b) of the ICCPR.  Trial 
observations indicate that there is a lack of adequate access to court-appointed counsel prior 
to the initial investigative hearings. Further access to privately employed defence counsel is 
not facilitated, notwithstanding article 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which 
provides for the right to be represented by legal counsel when being questioned during the 
pre-trial period.  In a great many cases the system allocating court appointed counsel works 
against defendants, since they are not represented by the same counsel at the investigative 
or trial stage, eroding further their chances of securing an effective defense.   
</p>
<p> (3) Finally, in relation to the reported recent secret executions, we are concerned 
that lack of prior notification may affect the rights of convicted prisoners awaiting 
executions. Indeed, as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions pointed out in out in a report to the Commission on Human Rights on 
Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3), a lack of 
transparency regarding the timetable for execution may undermine the due process rights of 
the accused, in particular the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence in a 
timely manner as guaranteed under article 6 of the ICCPR. In addition, it is argued in detail 
in the same report that &#8220;[r]efusing to provide convicted persons and family members 
advance notice of the date and time of execution is a clear human rights violation.&#8221; The 
practice of informing prisoners of their impending execution only moments before they die, 
and families only later, is &#8220;inhuman and degrading and undermine[s] the procedural 
safeguards surrounding the right to life.&#8221; (para. 32).  
</p>
<p>492. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as permitted under international law from a summary execution, which violates 
human rights standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of accused persons and 
prisoners are fully respected. Unless your Excellency&#8217;s Government is able to demonstrate 
respect for these essential procedural and substantive protections, which flow from the 
international obligations accepted by Iraq, the death sentences imposed must be commuted. 
</p>
<p>493. In order to carry out the mandates entrusted to us by the Human Rights Council, and 
to be able to effectively monitor the implementation of the relevant standards, we would be 
grateful if you would provide us with the following information: 
</p>

documents proving their inaccuracy, as well as information on any execution that 
may have taken place since 10 June 2009. </p>

<p>4.  Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Iraq to 
bring its practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital 
punishment, into line with the principles of prior notification and transparency, so 
that the right of due process in post-conviction proceedings is respected. 
</p>
<p>5. Please explain the measures adopted by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is 
invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made.

</p>
<p>494. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning <b>Mohammed al-Tanani, Sa'id Salah Battah, 
Ahmed Isma'il al-Buhdri, Ahmed Tubail, Omar 'Abdul Hafez al-Seelawi, Hani

mosque in Jabalya town in the northern Gaza strip.  
</p>
<p> According to the allegations: 
</p>
<p> On 3 January 2009, at approximatively 5.20 p.m., while dozens of Palestinian 
civilians were doing their evening prayer, the Israeli army fired a missile at the 
entrance to the Ibrahim al-Maqadna mosque near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalya 
town in the northern Gaza strip. Reportedly, the Israeli army suspected that the 
mosque was housing militants.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>163 
</b></p>
<p> As a result, twelve Palestinian civilians, including four children and a man 
and his son, were killed and thirty others were wounded. Later, three of the wounded 
died of their wounds, so the number of deaths mounted to fifteen. The twelve 
victims who were killed instantly are Mohammed al-Tanani (aged 18), Sa'id Salah 
Battah (aged 22), Ahmed Isma'il al-Buhdri (aged 23), Ahmed Tubail (aged 16), 
Omar 'Abdul Hafez al-Seelawi (aged 35), Hani Mohammed al-Seelawi (aged 10), 
Abdul Rahman al-Masamha (aged 47), Ra'ed 'Abdul Rahman al-Masmha (aged 21), 
Rajeh Ziada (aged 18), Mohammed Mousa al-Seelawi (aged 10), Bahaa' al-Ashqar 
(aged 20) and Hassan Hijju (aged 14).  
</p>
<p> In addition to the above incident, many other mosques were allegedly 
completely or partially damaged in the governorates of Rafah, Gaza, Khan Younis, 
Dier El Balah during the recent conflict in the Gaza strip.  
</p>
<p>495. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to its treaty obligations under the Fourth Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and also 
the relevant rules applicable to all armed conflicts under international humanitarian law and 
human rights law. Both the treaty obligations of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government and  
applicable customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the conduct of 
hostilities include prohibitions on attacks against the civilian population and civilian 
objects, and require respect for the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack.   
</p>
<p>496. Civilians are all persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the 
conflict and are protected against attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part 
in hostilities. Civilian objects, including places of worship, are also immune from attack, 
unless their nature, location or use, make an effective contribution to military action and 
whose destruction offers a definite military advantage. In addition, during military 
operations, special care must be taken to avoid damage to buildings dedicated to religion. 
</p>
<p>497. In the event of a lawful attack on a military objective, the principle of 
proportionality prohibits such attacks when it can be expected to cause incidental loss of 
civilian life or injury to the civilians which would be excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage expected. Compliance with this rule should be assessed for 
each attack taken individually and not for an overall military operation. We would note that 
this approach is also reflected in the Judgment of the Israeli Supreme Court of 14 December 
2006 (<i>The Public Committee against Torture in Israel et al. v. The Government of Israel et 
al</i>.; HCJ 769/02), which observed that &#8220;when the damage to innocent civilians is not 
proportionate to the benefit of the attacking army, the attack is disproportionate and 
forbidden.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>498. The obligations to take all necessary precautions to spare the civilian population and 
to limit to the maximum extent any incidental civilian loss of life include taking all 
appropriate measures to ensure: that the target of the attack is indeed a military objective; 
that the chosen means and methods of warfare will avoid civilian loss of life or limit 
incidental civilian loss of life; and, that a careful assessment of the conformity of the attack 
to the principle of proportionality is made. The timing of an attack should also be taken into 
account when assessing the conformity of the attack with the principles of distinction and 
proportionality.  
</p>
<p>499. We would also like to appeal to Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the 
exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief is respected in accordance with the 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination based on Religion or Belief and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights as well as of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>164  
</b></p>
<p>500.  Further, we would like to recall that in its recently adopted resolution 63/181, 
the General Assembly urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom 
of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this end, [&#8230;] to exert the utmost efforts, in 
accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with international human rights 
law, to ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and 
protected.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>501. Further, we would like to refer to the report E.CN.4/2005/61 (see paras. 49-50) 
submitted to the Commission on Human Rights in which it was pointed out that members 
of religious or belief communities, whenever they find themselves in places of worship, are 
in a situation of special vulnerability given the nature of their activity. More generally, as 
mentioned, <i>inter alia</i>, in paragraph 4 of the Human Rights Committee's general comment 
No. 22 (1993), places of worship are an essential element of the manifestation of the right 
to freedom of religion or belief to the extent that the great majority of religious or belief 
communities need the existence of a place of worship where their members can manifest 
their faith. Moreover, unlike other forms of violations of the right to freedom of religion or 
belief, attacks or other forms of restriction on places of worship or other religious sites and 
shrines in many cases violate the right not only of a single individual, but the rights of a 
group of individuals forming the community that is attached to the place in question.  
</p>
<p>502. Finally, we would like to recall that there is &#8220;a duty on States to investigate alleged 
violations of the right to life &#8220;promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent 
and impartial bodies&#8221; (Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31, &#8220;Nature of the 
legal obligation on States Parties to the Covenant&#8221; (2004), (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13), 
para. 15.) This duty arises out of the general obligation of States to ensure the right to life 
of each individual, a right that is non-derogable regardless of circumstance (ICCPR, art. 
4(2)); armed conflict and occupation do not, therefore, discharge the State&#8217;s duty to 
investigate and prosecute alleged human rights abuses.   
</p>
<p>503. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we, in addition, urge Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures 
to guarantee that religious places and sites are fully respected and protected, and to prevent 
the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p>504. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your 
observations on the following matters:

<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged on behalf of the victims mentioned above with

</p>
<p>3. Please explain how the principle of precaution was respected in the case of 
the targeting of the Ibrahim al-Maqadna mosque, on 3 January 2009, in particular 
the launching of the attack during evening prayers and the assessment of conformity 
of the attack with the principles of distinction and proportionality.

have received concerning seven cases of death in custody in Italy. We list the information 
received in the order of the alleged date of death, starting with the most recent case: 
</p>
<p> Mr. <b>Stefano Cucchi,</b> aged 31, was arrested on suspicion of drugs possession 
in a park in Rome at 11.30 p.m. on 15 October 2009. The carabinieri who had 
arrested him took him to his parents&#8217; home, where they searched his room, and then 
to their holding cells. In the morning, the carabinieri took him to the Rome Tribunal, 
where around 12:00 noon he was subjected to a fast track trial (processo per 
direttissima). Mr. Cucchi had a weight of only around 40 kilograms and declared at 
the hearing that he was anorexic, epileptic and HIV-positive. According to members 
of his family, they noted at the hearing that he had a badly swollen face and bruises 
around his eyes. A visit at the tribunal&#8217;s medical service and another visit at Regina 
Coeli prison in Rome, where Mr. Cucchi was taken after the trial, confirmed that he 
had facial injuries and difficulties walking. On the same day, Mr. Cucchi was taken 
to Fatebenefratelli hospital, where he was found to have two broken vertebrae. The 
following day, 17 October 2007 (a Saturday), Mr. Cucchi was again taken from the 
prison to Fatebenefratelli hospital and from there, at around 1.15 p.m. to the 
custodial section of Pertini hospital in Rome. His parents were informed of his 
arrival at the hospital only at around 9:00 p.m. and, having immediately driven to 
hospital, were denied their request to see Mr. Cucchi and told to return on Monday 
19 October morning. On 19 October morning, Mr. Cucchi&#8217;s parents were denied the 
visit on the ground that the required permit from the prison authorities had not been 
received yet. The following day, they were told that a permit from the competent 
judge was required to visit their son or speak to the doctors treating him. The next 
day, Wednesday, 21 October 2009, Mr. Cucchi&#8217;s father had obtained a judicial 
permit to visit his son, but lacked the required endorsement from the prison 
authorities. On 22 October at 6.20 a.m. Mr. Cucchi died in hospital. The medical 
certificate speaks of a &#8220;presumed natural death&#8221;, but the public prosecution service 
has opened an investigation. 
</p>
<p> On 11 September 2008, a <b>detainee of Velletri prison</b>, aged 41; his name has 
not been reported to us; died at Velletri hospital. The man, who was taken to the 
hospital from the prison, had allegedly been beaten by police officers after having 
been arrested on suspicion of having stolen a bicycle. The autopsy report noted 
internal bleeding due to severe damage to the spleen and two broken ribs. The man 
reportedly accused the police of his state shortly before dying. 
</p>
<p> On 5 February 2008, a <b>detainee in the prison of Imperia</b> (his name has not 
been reported to us), aged 29, died in his cell. A natural cause of death has been </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>166  
</b></p>
<p>excluded and the public prosecution has opened an investigation, but no results are 
known. 
</p>
<p> In December 2007, a <b>man</b> was found dead in his cell <b>in Lecce prison</b> (his 
name has not been reported to us) three days after having been taken into custody 
there. The office of the prosecutor opened a homicide investigation, but the results 
are not known as of today. 
</p>
<p> Mr. <b>Aldo Bianzino</b> died in his cell in Capanne prison in Perugia on 14 
October 2007. He had been arrested at home two days earlier on charges of growing 
marijuana. The autopsy report found injury to the liver and internal bleeding &#8220;of 
traumatic origin&#8221;. A prison guard is currently on trial in Perugia on charges of 
having failed to alert medical services when Mr. Bianzino, in the night before his 
death, was calling for help. A second investigation against unknown perpetrators on 
charges of voluntary homicide is ongoing. 
</p>
<p> On 25 September 2005, 18-years-old Mr. <b>Federico Aldrovandi</b> died in 
Ferrara after an encounter with four police agents, who beat him with their batons 
(breaking two batons), and made him lie on the ground with his hands cuffed behind 
his back. The results of the medical forensic examination show bruises and 
haematoma all over Mr. Aldrovandi&#8217;s body, including a cut to the back of the head, 
squashed testicles, a deep wound to one buttock and scratches on the face. In July 
2009, the Ferrara Tribunal found the four police agents guilty of culpable homicide 
by excessive use of force and sentenced them to three years and six months 
imprisonment. The police officers were not detained during the proceedings and not 
imprisoned after being sentenced. They continue to be on duty (as they have been 
since the death of Mr. Aldrovandi), as appeals proceedings in their case are ongoing. 
Police regulations provide that they will be suspended from duty only after a 
possible confirmation of their conviction in appeals proceedings is upheld in third 
and final instance by the Cassation Court. Due to a general clemency measure 
applicable to their case and possibly to the statute of limitations, the four convicted 
police officers are highly unlikely to even partially serve the prison sentence. 
</p>
<p> Mr. <b>Marcello Lonzi</b>, aged 29, died in Livorno prison in July 2003, his face 
badly bruised and his body covered with blood.  While a first autopsy attributed his 
death to a cardiac arrest, a second autopsy excluded natural death and highlighted 
traces of ill-treatment on Mr. Lonzi&#8217;s body. Two prison guards and an inmate are 
charged with homicide, but six years after the homicide the first instance trial is still 
ongoing. 
</p>
<p>506. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable 
under international law to these cases. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Italy is a party, provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to 
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the 
Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State 
detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that 
individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries 
sustained while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this 
respect, we would like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a 
custodial death case (Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 
(21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo 
Dermit committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in 
custody; yet, the inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>Uruguayan authorities either by act or by omission were responsible for not taking 
adequate measures to protect his life, as required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>507. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting 
from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 
on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>508. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring 
to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to 
the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to 
justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which Italy is a party. 
</p>
<p>509. We further note that, more than twenty years after ratification of the Convention 
against Torture, Italy does not have specific provisions in its criminal law making torture 
and complicity in torture criminal offences and providing for &#8220;appropriate penalties which 
take into account their grave nature&#8221;, as required by article 4 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>510. We are aware of your Excellency&#8217;s Governments submissions to the Committee 
Against Torture, arguing that the &#8220;Italian legal system provides sanctions for all conducts 
that can be considered to fall within the definition of torture, as set forth in Article 1 of the 
said Convention, and that these sanctions are ensured, more extensively, even through a 
complex system of incriminating facts and aggravating circumstances: The Italian system 
considers the concept of torture within a wide range of conducts.&#8221; 
(CAT/C/ITA/Q/4/Rev.1/Add.1, para. 17) 
</p>
<p>511. As noted also by the Committee Against Torture in its concluding observations on 
Italy&#8217;s most recent periodic report, however, there remain considerable concerns that the 
provisions of Italian criminal law referred to (including battery, bodily injuries, threats) do 
not capture the full gravity of the crime of torture, that acts of torture are therefore subject 
to the statute of limitations (CAT/C/ITA/CO/4, para. 19), and that perpetrators of torture 
may benefit from general clemency measures.  
</p>
<p>512. With specific regard to the case of Mr. Aldrovandi, we accept that the presumption 
of innocence applies until a defendant has been found guilty by final judgment. We would 
observe, however, that the circumstance that the police officers sentenced in first instance 
to three-and-a-half years of imprisonment for the deadly ill-treatment of a person in their 
custody, should continue to serve in the police force also reflects insufficient consideration 
of the gravity of acts of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>513. Finally, we recall that, as also noted by the Committee Against Torture, &#8220;[i]n 
connection with a prima facie case of torture and ill-treatment, the suspect should as a rule 
be subject to suspension or reassignment during the process of investigation&#8221; 
(CAT/C/ITA/CO/4, para. 19(b)). Similarly, the United Nations Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions state that 
&#8220;[t]hose potentially implicated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be 
removed from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over </p>

<p>complainants, witnesses and their families, as well as over those conducting 
investigations.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>514. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the case summaries accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the 
investigations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to each of the 
cases.  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, and 
criminal prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as 
responsible commanding officers, in the cases summarized above. In this respect, 
please explain what disciplinary or other administrative measures the four police 
officers found guilty of homicide in the case of Mr. Aldrovandi, as well as the police 
and penitentiary officials suspected in the other cases summarized above, have been 
subjected to. If no such measures were adopted, please explain why this was not 
considered necessary or appropriate. 
</p>
<p>4. Please explain how the statute of limitations and general clemency measures 
adopted by the legislature affect the prosecution, the trial and the serving of any 
sentences of imprisonment imposed in the cases above, in particular in the case of 
the homicide of Mr. Aldrovandi.  
</p>
<p>5. Please explain how the adoption of the draft law on the &#8220;protection of citizens 
against the indeterminate duration of trials&#8221; (also known as the &#8220;expeditious trial&#8221; 
(&#8220;processo breve&#8221;) bill), currently before the Parliament, would affect prosecution 
and trial in the cases summarized above of alleged ill-treatment by police or prison 
officials resulting in death. The draft law, which (according to our understanding) 
provides that the judge has to declare the termination of an ongoing trial if it is not 
concluded within the time limits provided, contains a list of particularly serious 
offences excluded from its application.  It would appear that only few of the 
offences which according to the submission by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
Committee Against Torture would cover acts of torture, are among the particularly 
serious offences excluded from the application of the draft law. Trials against 
officials suspected of torture or inhuman treatment would thus be at risk of 
termination if they are not concluded with the strict deadlines provided by the bill. Is 
this understanding correct? 
</p>
<p>6. Please provide the details of any compensation payments made to the 
families or dependants of any of the victims in the cases summarized above.

</b></p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the general 
information provided by the Government of Japan.  The Special Rapporteur regrets, 
however, that no information is provided with respect to the specific cases of Yamaji 
Yukio, Shinozawa Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi, Maegami Hiroshi and Ogata Hikei, or the case of 
Makino Tadashi, who has now been executed.  To the extent that this reflects a concern 
about individual privacy, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not 
acknowledged or addressed his proposal to reproduce information about specific cases in an 
anonymised form in public reports.  The Government&#8217;s continuing refusal to discuss 
individual cases renders it exceedingly difficult to have a meaningful dialogue, let alone a 
constructive one, with the Government about violations of the right to life.  This would 
appear to be a concern for privacy that is warranted less by the rights of the individual 
concerned than of a Government that does not wish to be held to account. 
</p>
<p>515. The Special Rapporteur continues to be deeply concerned about the Government&#8217;s 
continuing refusal to implement the recommendations of both the Human Rights Council 
and the Committee Against Torture that it end the practice of telling prisoners of impending 
execution only on the day the execution takes place.  As these and other international 
bodies have repeatedly recognized and the Special Rapporteur has reiterated, the practice 
undermines is inhuman, degrading and does not accord with the necessary procedural 
safeguards for the right to life.   
</p>
<p>516. Finally, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not addressed the 
crux of his concern about other likely violations of the procedural safeguards of the right to 
life.  Specifically, with respect to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation that the 
Government establish a mandatory system of review in capital cases, the Government&#8217;s 
response that some defendants have exercised their appellate right does not address the 
concern that an increasing number of defendants, including five at issue in this 
communication, have chosen not to do so.  Similarly, the Government&#8217;s response that it is 
concerned about hypothetical repeated requests for retrial or review does not address the 
concern that requests are not in fact being made.  The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government, as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture have 
also done, to establish a mandatory system of review. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 19 March 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>517. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding five men allegedly at imminent risk 
of execution: Mr.<b> Yamaji Yukio</b>, born 1983, Mr. <b>Shinozawa Kazuo</b>, born 1952, Mr. <b>Zoda 
Hiroshi</b>, born 1976, Mr. <b>Maegami Hiroshi</b>, born 1971, and Mr. <b>Ogata Hikei</b>, born in 
1980. The five men were convicted of murder between 2002 and 2007 and sentenced to 
death. Mr. Shinozawa Kazuo never lodged an appeal against his sentence; the other four 
have abandoned their appeals. 
</p>
<p>518. We would also like to express our appreciation for the reply of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government dated 20 November 2008, to the communication of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions of 7 October 2008 regarding the case of Mr. 
<b>Makino Tadashi</b>. We regret, however, that your Government decided not to provide the 
information he sought with regard to the individual case of Mr. Tadashi. In the meantime, 
we have received reports that Makino Tadashi was hanged on 29 January 2009 together 
with three other men whose identities are not known to us.  
</p>
<p>519. While your Excellency&#8217;s Government did not discuss the specific case of Makino 
Tadashi in its reply, we take note of the general information regarding the secrecy 
surrounding executions contained in your communication of 20 November 2008. Your </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>170  
</b></p>
<p>Excellency&#8217;s Government explains that &#8220;[a]n inmate sentenced to death is notified of 
his/her execution on the day it is due to take place.&#8221; Family members are also not given 
advance notice of the execution date. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government explains that this 
practice is followed to avoid subjecting the death row prisoner and his family to serious 
emotional distress and the risk of becoming &#8220;emotionally unstable&#8221;. It concludes that &#8220;the 
current practice is unavoidable&#8221; and does not violate the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>520. In this respect, we draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the very 
recent Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee, on your Government&#8217;s 
fifth periodic report (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, adopted on 18 December 2008). The Human 
Rights Committee expressed its concern that prisoners sentenced to death &#8220;are executed 
without prior notice before the day of execution.&#8221; It therefore recommended that &#8220;[t]he 
State party should also ensure that inmates on death row and their families are given 
reasonable advance notice of the scheduled date and time of the execution, with a view to 
reducing the psychological suffering caused by the lack of opportunity to prepare 
themselves for this event.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>521. Previously, the Committee Against Torture had already expressed its &#8220;deep concern&#8221; 
about &#8220;[t]he unnecessary secrecy and arbitrariness surrounding the time of execution, 
allegedly in order to respect the privacy of inmates and their families. In particular, the 
Committee regrets the psychological strain imposed upon inmates and families by the 
constant uncertainty as to the date of execution, as prisoners are notified of their execution 
only hours before it is due to take place.&#8221; (Conclusions and recommendations of the 
Committee Against Torture on the initial report of Japan, 3 August 2007, 
CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 19). 
</p>
<p>522. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions argued 
in the communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 7 October 2008 in the case of 
Makino Tadashi, and in greater detail in a report to the Human Rights Council on 
Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 32), 
the practice of informing prisoners of their impending execution only moments before they 
die, and families only later, is not only inhuman and degrading treatment, it also 
undermines the procedural safeguards surrounding the right to life.  
</p>
<p>523. Both the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture have in fact 
expressed even broader concerns about the post-conviction proceedings in death penalty 
cases in Japan. Of particular relevance to the cases of Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa Kazuo, 
Zoda Hiroshi, Maegami Hiroshi and Ogata Hikei, who have all chosen not to pursue their 
right to appeal, the Human Rights Committee &#8220;note[d] with concern that an increasing 
number of defendants are convicted and sentenced to death without exercising their right of 
appeal&#8221; (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 17). Both the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee Against Torture have asked your Excellency&#8217;s Government to introduce a 
mandatory system of review in capital cases (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 17, and 
CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 20). 
</p>
<p>524. The two Committees also noted interference with the right to assistance by legal 
counsel in post-conviction proceedings in capital cases. The Human Rights Committee 
remarked that &#8220;meetings of death row inmates with their lawyer in charge of requesting a 
retrial are attended and monitored by prison officials until the court has decided to open the 
retrial&#8221; and asked your Excellency&#8217;s Government to &#8220;ensure the strict confidentiality of all 
meetings between death row inmates and their lawyers concerning retrial.&#8221; 
(CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 17). The Committee Against Torture expressed serious concern 
with respect to &#8220;[t]he limitations imposed on death row prisoners concerning confidential 
access to their legal representatives, including the impossibility to meet with them in 
private, while on appeal requesting retrial; the lack of alternative means of confidential </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>171 
</b></p>
<p>communication and the lack of access to state defence counsel after the final sentence is 
handed down&#8221; (CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 20(a)). In this regard, we would add that in 
General Comment no. 32, the Human Rights Committee observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving 
capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer 
at all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). Effective assistance by a 
lawyer in turn presupposes the possibility of private meetings between lawyer and client. 
</p>
<p>525. Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture 
have expressed the concern that the right to seek pardon or commutation of the death 
sentence are not genuinely available to death row prisoners in Japan. They highlighted that 
a retrial procedure or a request for pardon do not lead to suspension of the execution of the 
death sentence, which fundamentally undermines these remedies, particularly considering 
that executions are not announced in advance to those concerned (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 
16, and CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 20(c)). The Committee Against Torture noted the truly 
impressive statistical fact that there has been no case of commutation of a death sentence in 
the last 30 years (CAT/C/JPN/CO/1, para. 20(e)). 
</p>
<p>526. Each of the above concerns regarding the fairness of post-conviction proceedings in 
death penalty cases, and particularly their sum, suggests that there is a substantial risk of a 
violation of the procedural safeguards of the right to life of Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa 
Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi, Maegami Hiroshi and Mr. Ogata Hikei. We would therefore 
respectfully call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that 
their right to due process in post-conviction proceedings, including unrestricted access to 
legal counsel and access to a genuine and transparent procedure to seek pardon or 
commutation of sentence, is fully respected. A refusal to provide Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa 
Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi, Maegami Hiroshi and Mr. Ogata Hikei, their families and lawyers, 
with timely and reliable information on when any planned execution will take place is 
highly likely to lead to violations of due process rights. It would also constitute, as clearly 
stated by the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against torture, inhuman and 
degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>527. It is moreover our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged above regarding the cases of Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa 
Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi, Maegami Hiroshi and Mr. Ogata Hikei accurate? Is it correct 
that that Makino Tadashi was executed on 29 January 2009?  
</p>
<p>2. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government have information on the reasons 
underlying the decision of Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi and 
Maegami Hiroshi to abandon their appeals, and of Shinozawa Kazuo not to lodge an 
appeal? 
</p>
<p>3. Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Japan to 
bring its practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital 
punishment, into line with the principles and recommendations set forth in the 
Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee of 18 December 2008 
(CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5), the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committee 
Against Torture of 3 August 2007 (CAT/C/JPN/CO/1), and the report on 
Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3) of 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
</p>
<p>528. With regard to the first and second question above, we are aware of your 
Government&#8217;s policy, reiterated in its communication to the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions of 20 November 2008, not to discuss </p>

<p>individual cases of persons sentenced to death. We submit, however, that a meaningful and 
constructive dialogue on allegations of human rights violations, particularly violations of 
the right to life, cannot be completely detached from the analysis of individual cases. To 
protect the privacy of the persons concerned, information relating to their individual cases 
could be reproduced in anonymised form in our public reports.

that Makino Tadashi was executed on 29 January 2009  
</p>
<p> (Answer)  
</p>
<p> The Government of Japan refrains from referring to any individual inmate sentenced 
to death. As a matter of fact, Makino Takashi sentenced to death was executed on 29 
January 2009

<p> 2. Does your Excellency&#8217;s Government have information on the reasons 
underlying the decision of Yamaji Yukio, Shinozawa Kazuo, Zoda Hiroshi and Maegami 
Hiroshi to abandon their appeals, and of Shinozawa Kazuo not to lodge an appeal? 
</p>
<p> (Answer)  
</p>
<p> The government of Japan does not have any knowledge about the reasons behind the 
litigation acts of the defendants.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please explain the measures taken or planned by the Government of Japan to 
bring its practice of the death penalty, insofar as it chooses to retain capital punishment, 
into line with the principles and recommendations set forth in the Concluding Observations 
of the Human Rights Committee of 18 December 2008 (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5), the 
Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committee Against Torture of 3 August 2007 
(CAT/C/JPN/CO/1), and the report on Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3) of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions. 
</p>
<p> (Answer)  
</p>
<p> 1. In the Japanese criminal proceeding, the appeal to a higher court is broadly 
applicable to conviction and sentencing under three-tiered judicial system. The defense 
counsel, who shall be appointed in all the death penalty cases, is also given the right of 
appeal. Moreover, appeals to a higher court have been actually filed in many cases where a 
death penalty is sentenced. Bearing these circumstances in mind, we do not think that it is 
necessary to establish mandatory review system. 
</p>
<p> 2. In addition, when an execution order is issued, the circumstance is 
thoroughly examined in the request of retrial and appeal of pardon, paying regard to the 
graveness to the penalty. 
</p>
<p>529. On the other hand, suppose the execution order was not issued while the procedure 
of retrial request is pending, it would be impossible to execute the death penalty forever in 
so far as the inmate sentenced to death repeats retrial requests. We could not expect an 
achievement of appropriate criminal proceedings in such a scenario. 
</p>
<p>530. Thus the Government of Japan believes that it would be inappropriate should we 
decide not to issue an execution order to an inmate sentenced to death while the procedure 
of request of retrial or appeal of pardon is pending. 
</p>
<p> 3. An inmate sentenced to death is notified of his\her execution on the day it is 
due to take place. The reason behind this practice is because the Government of Japan is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>concerned that he\she could become emotionally unstable and suffer from serious 
emotional distress if he\she were notified in advance. In addition, the similar concern could 
be raised in the following scenarios: if his\her family members were to be notified in 
advance of the execution date, they could suffer from unnecessary mental distress. In 
addition, if an inmate were to learn of his\her execution date through a visit between an 
inmate and his\her family members who have been notified of the date, he\she could 
become emotionally unstable and suffer from serious emotional distress. For these reasons, 
the Government of Japan considers that the above-mentioned practice does not violate the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p> 4. Considering the treatment of inmates sentenced to death, they are 
appropriately treated under the Act on Penal Detention Facilities and Treatment of Inmates 
and Detainees. The Government of Japan will continue to make efforts to improve their 
treatment.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur notes the response of 
the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  In the absence of a copy of the psychiatric 
evaluation the Rapporteur is unable to conclude that the deceased was in fact suffering from 
a mental illness, as indicated by the Government but strongly denied by other sources. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 25 June 2009</b>, sent jointly with Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>531. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received concerning the death of Mr <b>Fathi El-Jahmi</b> 
while deprived of his liberty. Mr El-Jahmi was an activist advocating political reform in 
Libya.  
</p>
<p>532. Mr El-Jahmi was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment on 4 February 2008 and an urgent appeal sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 22 April 2004. To date, no reply to either these communications has been 
received. 
</p>
<p> According to the new information received:  
</p>
<p> On 21 May 2009, Mr. El-Jahmi reportedly died in a hospital in Amman, 
Jordan. He had allegedly been transferred by Libyan security agents from the Tripoli 
Medical Centre some weeks earlier for emergency medical care while he was 
allegedly in a comatose or semi-conscious state and his breathing reliant on a 
ventilator. Following his death, Libyan security agents reportedly supervised the 
repatriation of Mr. El-Jahmi&#8217;s body to Benghazi, Libya, where he is said to have 
been buried without an autopsy having taken place.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>174  
</b></p>
<p> Following a visit of a physician of the non-governmental organization 
Physicians for Human Rights in March 2008, a report on Mr. El-Jahmi in detention 
concluded, &#8220;[n]ot only was he inappropriately confined in hospital for many months 
&#8211; he was also placed in a psychiatric facility without cause, and the Libyan 
Government never provided any evidence to support such an intervention&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that the death of Mr Fathi El-Jahmi, while deprived of 
his liberty, might be related to a failure to provide adequate medical assistance 
because of his status as human rights defender. 
</p>
<p>533. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the 
Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 
and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in 
association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each 
State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to 
create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and other fields, as well as 
the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually 
and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>534. Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government the following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or 
individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>535. When the State deprives an individual of his/her liberty, it is held to a heightened 
level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when an 
individual dies in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this 
respect, we would like to recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a 
custodial death case (Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 
(21/10/1982), paragraph 9.2): 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo 
Dermit committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in 
custody; yet, the inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the 
Uruguayan authorities either by act or by omission were responsible for not taking 
adequate measures to protect his life, as required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>536. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for the death of a 
person who was deprived of his/her liberty, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and 
impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). The 61st </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), states that all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct 
exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Commission added that this obligation includes the obligation 
&#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation 
within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary 
measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to &#8230; prevent the recurrence of 
such executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring 
them to justice arise also under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya is a party. 
</p>
<p>537. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We 
also request that your Excellency&#8217;s Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>538. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have

<p>539. The following is our reply to the enquiries made regarding the legal situation of 
Fathi el-Jahmi: 
</p>
<p> Question: Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> Answer: The alleged facts are inaccurate inasmuch as the person in question 
received treatment at the Tripoli Medical Centre and he was admitted to the hospital at his 
own request. He received excellent care since the hospital is one of the best in the 
Jamahiriya. International human rights organizations praised the care that he was receiving 
in the hospital because they visited him while he was there. A delegation from Human 
Rights Watch was the last to visit him in the hospital on 26 April 2009. The organization 
issued a positive assessment of the health services that were being provided. 
</p>
<p> Question: Has a complaint been lodged? 
</p>
<p> Answer: The facts are inaccurate and no complaint has been lodged. </p>

investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been 
carried out in relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> Answer: As the alleged facts and the accompanying questions are inaccurate, there is 
no reason to carry out any inquiries. 
</p>
<p> Question: In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the 
full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> Answer: The alleged facts are inaccurate. 
</p>
<p> Question: Please share the medical records of Mr. El-Jahmi from the Tripoli Medical 
Centre where he was detained as well as the Medical Centre in Amman where he received 
medical care. 
</p>
<p> Answer: The medical records are regarded as personal data concerning the patient, 
and the law does not permit their disclosure to anyone apart from the patient or his family. 
</p>
<p> Question: Please indicate why Mr. El-Jahmi was moved to a psychiatric facility. 
</p>
<p> Answer: During the trial of the person in question, his lawyer requested that he be 
examined by a psychiatrist to assess his mental capacity, and the court ordered an 
examination. After examining him, the doctor issued a detailed report and concluded that 
the person concerned was criminally responsible for his acts and required long-term 
psychiatric treatment and constant observation. 
</p>
<p> The court decided, in response to a request by his lawyer and the public prosecutor&#8217;s 
office, to have his case reviewed by a panel composed of three doctors specializing in 
psychiatry and mental illness. The doctors carried out their assignment after swearing an 
oath before the court to perform their duties faithfully and in accordance with the law. The 
panel concluded that the person concerned was not criminally responsible. 
</p>
<p> On 17 September 2006 the court held that the criminal proceedings could not be 
pursued because the accused was not responsible for his acts and ordered that he be 
admitted to Al-Razi psychiatric hospital to receive the treatment required for his recovery. 
</p>
<p> He was transferred to the Tripoli Medical Centre to receive medical treatment for 
chronic illnesses from which he was suffering.

le cr&#226;ne fracass&#233; par une balle perdue, imputable &#224; des forces de l&#8217;ordre, le 24 avril 
2009, alors qu&#8217;elle tentait de fermer la librairie pour laquelle elle travaillait &#224; 
Ambohijatovo. L&#8217;incident serait survenu alors que les forces de l&#8217;ordre tiraient sur

la s&#251;ret&#233; de l&#8217;Etat. Les lieux de travail et domiciles de tous les membres de sa 
famille auraient &#233;galement fait l&#8217;objet de perquisition. Apr&#232;s son arrestation, il aurait

<p><b>Llamamiento urgente del 14 Octubre 2009</b>, enviado con el Relator Especial sobre los 
derechos humanos de los migrantes y el Relator Especial sobre la tortura y otros tratos o 
penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes 
</p>
<p>546. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia la informaci&#243;n que hemos recibido en relaci&#243;n con el <b>deceso de un migrante 
irregular y las lesiones personales ocasionadas a seis migrantes cerca de Comit&#225;n, en 
el estado de Chiapas. </b> 
</p>
<p> De conformidad con la informaci&#243;n recibida:  
</p>
<p> El 18 de Septiembre, las fuerzas de seguridad mexicanas dispararon contra 
una camioneta  pick-up que transportaba a siete migrantes irregulares de 
nacionalidades ecuatoriana y salvadore&#241;a cuando cruzaban la frontera cerca de 
Comit&#225;n, en el estado de Chiapas.  
</p>
<p> Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n proporcionada, el conductor de la camioneta pick-up en 
donde se transportaban los migrantes irregulares habr&#237;a aminorado la marcha al 
acercarse a un control de seguridad, pero habr&#237;a acelerado al ver la orden de alto de 
la Polic&#237;a. Los agentes de control de seguridad habr&#237;an salido tras ellos y 
presuntamente habr&#237;an abierto fuego contra el veh&#237;culo, que, alcanzado por 
reiterados disparos, habr&#237;a dejado de funcionar a los pocos minutos. 
</p>
<p> Como resultado, uno de los siete migrantes, el se&#241;or V&#237;ctor Alexander 
Melgar Lemus, nacional de El Salvador, habr&#237;a muerto y los seis restantes habr&#237;an 
resultado  heridos. Tres de los migrantes sobrevivientes habr&#237;an escapado de las 
autoridades mexicanas despu&#233;s de los disparos ocurridos en un control militar. Los 
tres migrantes que habr&#237;an quedado a disposici&#243;n de las autoridades mexicanas 
habr&#237;an sido interrogados por agentes de polic&#237;a y militares y presuntamente 
reportar&#237;an haber sido pateados y golpeados con las culatas de sus armas. Uno de los 
migrantes habr&#237;a sido golpeado directamente en una herida de bala. Dos de los 
migrantes se hallar&#237;an presuntamente bajo vigilancia policial en un hospital donde 
estar&#237;an siendo atendidos, y el otro, un ciudadano ecuatoriano, se hallar&#237;a recluido en 
espera de su repatriaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p> Se teme por la seguridad de los migrantes que est&#225;n recibiendo atenci&#243;n 
m&#233;dica, frente a posibles acciones encaminadas a impedir la denuncia de violencia 
de car&#225;cter policial ya que, aunque la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos de 
M&#233;xico habr&#237;a abierto una investigaci&#243;n sobre los hechos, no se habr&#237;an iniciado 
investigaciones sobre el uso desproporcionado de la fuerza por parte de las 
autoridades de control policial.  Se teme tambi&#233;n que los migrantes sobrevivientes 
puedan ser repatriados a sus pa&#237;ses de origen antes de que los hechos hayan sido 
completamente clarificados. 
</p>
<p>547. Sin que de alguna manera constituya prejuzgamiento sobre los hechos o el fondo del 
asunto, nos permitimos hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno de su Excelencia para buscar una 
clarificaci&#243;n de los hechos con miras a garantizar el respeto de los derechos humanos de los 
migrantes, de conformidad entre otros, con la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos 
Humanos y el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. &#201;ste &#250;ltimo instrumento 
jur&#237;dico fue ratificado por el Gobierno de su Excelencia en Junio de 1981 y reconoce entre 
otros los derechos a la vida y la seguridad personales de quienes se hallan bajo la 
jurisdicci&#243;n de los Estados, tal como lo se&#241;ala el Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos, en el 
p&#225;rrafo tercero de  su observaci&#243;n general No.31 sobre &#8220;La &#237;ndole de la obligaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica 
general impuesta a los Estados Partes en el Pacto&#8221;, en el que recuerda, entre otros, que &#8220;[a] 
los Estados Partes se les impone una obligaci&#243;n general de respetar los derechos del Pacto y 
de asegurar su aplicaci&#243;n a todos los individuos en su territorio y sometidos a su 
jurisdicci&#243;n&#8221;.  </p>

<p>548. Nos gustar&#237;a tambi&#233;n llamar la atenci&#243;n al Gobierno de su Excelencia sobre los 
principios 4 y 5 de los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre el Empleo de la Fuerza y de Armas de 
Fuego por los Funcionarios Encargados de Hacer Cumplir la Ley. Seg&#250;n el principio 4 
&#8220;[l]os funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, 
utilizar&#225;n en la medida de lo posible medios no violentos antes de recurrir al empleo de la 
fuerza y de armas de fuego&#8221;. En este mismo sentido, el principio 5 se&#241;ala que &#8220;Cuando el 
empleo de las armas de fuego sea inevitable, los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir 
la ley,  a) Ejercer&#225;n moderaci&#243;n y actuar&#225;n en proporci&#243;n a la gravedad del delito y al 
objetivo leg&#237;timo que se persiga; b) Reducir&#225;n al m&#237;nimo los da&#241;os y lesiones y respetar&#225;n 
y proteger&#225;n la vida humana; c) Proceder&#225;n de modo que se presten lo antes posible 
asistencia y servicios m&#233;dicos a las personas heridas o afectadas; d) Procurar&#225;n notificar lo 
sucedido, a la menor brevedad posible, a los parientes o amigos &#237;ntimos de las personas 
heridas o afectadas&#8221;. (Adoptados por el Octavo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre 
Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, celebrado en La Habana (Cuba) del 
27 de agosto al 7 de septiembre de 1990). 
</p>
<p>549. En relaci&#243;n a los malos tratos presuntamente infligidos a los migrantes por agentes 
de polic&#237;a y militares, perm&#237;tanos, Excelencia, solicitar igualmente una clarificaci&#243;n de los 
hechos en relaci&#243;n con el C&#243;digo de conducta para funcionarios encargados de hacer  
cumplir la ley adoptado por la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas en su resoluci&#243;n 
34/169, del 17 de diciembre de 1979, en particular, sus art&#237;culos 2 y 3 que se&#241;alan 
respectivamente que &#8220;en el desempe&#241;o de sus tareas, los funcionarios encargados de hacer 
cumplir la ley respetar&#225;n y proteger&#225;n la dignidad humana y mantendr&#225;n y defender&#225;n los 
derechos humanos de las personas&#8221; y que &#8220;podr&#225;n usar la fuerza s&#243;lo cuando sea 
estrictamente necesario y en la medida en que lo requiera el desempe&#241;o de sus tareas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>550. Quisi&#233;ramos recordar al Gobierno de su Excelencia el p&#225;rrafo 3 de la Resoluci&#243;n 8/8 
del Consejo de Derechos Humanos, el cual exhorta a los Estados a que &#8220;todas las denuncias 
de torturas u otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes deben ser examinadas 
sin dilaci&#243;n y de manera imparcial por las autoridades nacionales competentes y que 
quienes instigan, ordenan, toleran o perpetran actos de tortura, incluidos los funcionarios 
encargados del lugar de detenci&#243;n donde se determine que se ha cometido el acto prohibido, 
deben ser declarados responsables de sus actos y severamente castigados, y toma nota a este 
respecto de los Principios relativos a la investigaci&#243;n y documentaci&#243;n eficaces de la tortura

Durango, el Sr. Carlos Ortega Samper, que hab&#237;a sido secuestrado y asesinado el 3 
de mayo de 2009.

<p> El Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y 
de expresi&#243;n y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los

de su Excelencia el 15 de mayo de 2009. Lamentamos no haber recibido una

</p>
<p> El Sr. Mariano Abarca Roblero era integrante del Frente C&#237;vico de 
Chicomuselo y de la Red Mexicana de Afectados por la Miner&#237;a (REMA). Realizaba 
actividades de protesta contra la explotaci&#243;n minera en M&#233;xico y formaba parte del 
movimiento organizado por habitantes de Chicomuselo para oponerse a la 
explotaci&#243;n de la compa&#241;&#237;a minera canadiense Blackfire Exploration Ltd. 
</p>
<p> El 27 de noviembre de 2009, aproximadamente a las 20:00 horas de la tarde, 
el Sr. Abarca Roblero habr&#237;a sido asesinado por un hombre armado no identificado 
mientras hablaba con un colega afuera de su casa en Chicomuselo, Chiapas. El 
asesino se les habr&#237;a acercado en motocicleta y les habr&#237;a disparado varias veces. El 
Sr. Abarca Roblero habr&#237;a muerto inmediatamente y su colega habr&#237;a sido herido en 
el incidente.  
</p>
<p> Recientemente, el Sr. Abarca Roblero habr&#237;a recibido varias amenazas de 
muerte por parte de algunos empleados de la compa&#241;&#237;a minera Blackfire Exploration 
Ltd. Habr&#237;a denunciado estas amenazas ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico pero las 
autoridades no habr&#237;an adoptado las medidas de protecci&#243;n necesarias para 
garantizar su integridad f&#237;sica. 
</p>
<p> Varias organizaciones en Chiapas realizan actividades en protesta contra la 
explotaci&#243;n de recursos naturales alegando que &#233;sta afecta los derechos humanos de 
la poblaci&#243;n local. Se alega que los integrantes de estas organizaciones tambi&#233;n 
podr&#237;an estar en riesgo. Recientemente, miembros del Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos 
Oralia Morales en el Municipio de Frontera Comalapa y del Comit&#233; de Derechos 
Humanos 10 de Enero tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an recibido amenazas por parte de empleados 
de Blackfire Exploration Ltd.  
</p>
<p> Se teme que los asesinatos de los Sres. Jos&#233; Galindo Robles, Jos&#233; Bladimir 
Antuna Garc&#237;a y Mariano Abarca Roblero y las amenazas contra los integrantes de 
las organizaciones antimineras en Chiapas como Dos Valles Valientes, el Comit&#233; de 
Derechos Humanos 10 de Enero y el Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos Oralia Morales 
est&#233;n relacionados con su trabajo como periodistas y defensores de derechos 
humanos. Asimismo, se expresa una profunda preocupaci&#243;n de que los asesinatos de 
los Sres. Galindo Robles y Antuna Garc&#237;a formen parte de un patr&#243;n de asesinatos 
de periodistas que investigan e informan sobre temas pol&#237;ticamente susceptibles en 
M&#233;xico y que representen un intento de impedir y silenciar al periodismo 
independiente en el pa&#237;s.  
</p>
<p>555. Sin implicar, de antemano, una conclusi&#243;n sobre los hechos, nos permitimos hacer 
un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de su Excelencia para que tome las medidas necesarias 
para asegurar que el derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n sea respetado, de </p>

<p>556. En este contexto, quisi&#233;ramos recordarle al Gobierno de su Excelencia que el asunto 
de los asesinatos y las amenazas contra periodistas y defensores de derechos humanos en

recomendaciones espec&#237;ficamente relacionadas con la protecci&#243;n de los periodistas, el 
personal de los medios de comunicaci&#243;n y los defensores de derechos humanos. Se 
recomend&#243; que el Gobierno de su Excelencia garantice que los cr&#237;menes y las violaciones 
cometidas en contra de los periodistas, el personal de los medios de comunicaci&#243;n y los 
defensores de derechos humanos sean investigados y procesados, que los responsables sean 
castigados, que las denuncias de amenazas, acoso e intimidaci&#243;n a los defensores de 
derechos humanos, periodistas y abogados reciban una pronta respuesta, que se tomen las 
medidas adecuadas para su protecci&#243;n, que aumente la eficacia de las &#8220;medidas cautelares&#8221;

medios adecuados.

represalia, discriminaci&#243;n, presi&#243;n o cualquier otra acci&#243;n arbitraria resultante del

toda persona tiene derecho, individual o colectivamente, a una protecci&#243;n eficaz de

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
Government of Mongolia&#8217;s acknowledgement of his communication.  The Special 
Rapporteur also appreciates the information provided by the Government about the status 
of Mr. Buuveibaatar&#8217;s case, and looks forward to a full response to the questions raised in 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication. </p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 4 August 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on arbitrary detention 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>561. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding Mr. Buuveibaatar, aged 33. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>185 
</b></p>
<p> Mr. Buuveibaatar was sentenced to death by the Bayangol District Court in 
Ulaanbaatar. The day after the murder he allegedly committed, he was arrested and 
taken to Bayangol District police station, where he was interrogated overnight 
without the presence of a lawyer. He was beaten in custody, and confessed to the 
crime during the interrogation.  
</p>
<p> Mr. Buuveibaatar&#8217;s death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court, and his 
family has applied for a presidential pardon. So far, there has been no response to 
the petition. It was alleged that executions in Mongolia are carried out in secret and 
neither the families nor the lawyers of those on death row receive prior notification.  
</p>
<p>562. Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts of the case and on whether 
the detention of Mr. Buuveibaatar is arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee Mr. Buuveibaatar&#8217;s 
right not to be deprived arbitrarily of his liberty and to fair proceedings before an 
independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>563. Furthermore, we would like to recall that although international law does not 
prohibit the death penalty, it mandates that it must be regarded as an extreme exception to 
the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. 
Capital punishment cases must thoroughly respect all due process guarantees as set out in 
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Mongolia is 
a State party. This obligation admits no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, the right to 
a fair trial includes the right not to be compelled to confess guilt and the right to be assisted 
by legal counsel.  
</p>
<p>564. A central element of the right to a fair hearing is the right to be assisted by legal 
counsel. In this respect, we would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress 
on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 
September 1990, in particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call 
upon the assistance of a lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to 
defend them in all stages of criminal proceedings&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>565. We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification 
of the circumstances regarding the case of Mr. Buuveibaatar. We would like to stress that 
each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of 
all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>566. We would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to article 15 of the Convention 
against Torture provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; We also recall that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 
urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of 
torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial 
guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical 
and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>567. To sum up only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes 
capital punishment as permitted under international law from a summary execution, which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>186  
</b></p>
<p>violates human rights standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take 
all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Mr. Buuveibaatar are 
fully respected. Unless your Excellency&#8217;s Government is able to demonstrate respect for 
these essential procedural and substantive protections, which flow from the international 
obligations accepted by Mongolia, in the cases involving Mr. Buuveibaatar, the death 
sentence imposed must be commuted. 
</p>
<p>568. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Buuveibaatar are respected and accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>569. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned person in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>570. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Buuveibaatar other than 
the reported application for presidential pardon?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on 
the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government of Mongolia dated 1 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>571. As stated in the letter of appeal sent by the Special Rapporteurs, the case of Mr. O. 
Buuveibaatar was ruled by the court of Bayangol District, and the defendant has appealed 
to the Supreme Court of Mongolia and sought the Presidential Pardon on which no 
response has yet been received.  
</p>
<p>572. The case materials on Mr. O. Buuveibaatar are yet to be reviewed by the Prosecutors 
Office. Furthermore, hitherto no decision has yet been taken by the relevant authorities in 
relation to the petition made by him. Therefore, for the time being it is not possible to

</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: Cooperative but incomplete response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>:  The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Mongolia, but notes the response provides no explanation of 
the circumstances that justified or led to the deaths of Saw Win Thein and Doung Nyo 
beyond describing them as killed in &#8220;an engagement&#8221; with state forces.  The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided the information requested by the 
Special Rapporteur concerning whether any investigation was conducted into the two 
deaths, and if not, the reason for the lack of any inquiry.   
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 13 January 2010</b>  
</p>
<p>573. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the deaths of Mr. <b>Saw Win Thein</b>, 
aged 40, and Mr. <b>Doung Nyo</b>, aged 26 years. 
</p>
<p>574. According to information received, on 26 September 2009 Myanmar Army soldiers 
from the Military Operations Command 11, Light Infantry Battalion 220, from Mae Pray 
Kee, fired for unknown reasons into a villager&#8217;s farm hut outside of Baw Kee village. 
During the attack two men were killed namely, Saw Win Thein, from Ta U Kee village, and 
Doung Nyo, from Noh Ber Baw village. It is reported that Doung Nyo was a member of the 
&#8220;Free Burma Rangers&#8221; in Thaton District from 2004 to 2006, when he was called to head 
his township administration office.  
</p>
<p>575. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
request your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances regarding 
the deaths of Mr. Saw Win Thein and Mr. Doung Nyo.  In this connection, we would like to 
refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case.  The United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary executions, in particular Principle 
9, stipulate that there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions...&#8221; This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating 
that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected 
cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this 
obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible &#8230;to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an 
end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>576. We therefore, urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
ensure that the deaths of Mr. Saw Win Thein and Mr. Doung Nyo are promptly, 
independently and thoroughly investigated and further to ensure the accountability of any 
person responsible for their deaths.  
</p>
<p>577. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries of the case accurate?

<p><b>  Response from the Government of Myanmar dated 5 March 2010

<p>578. The Permanent Mission of the Union of Myanmar to the United Nations Office and 
other International Organisations in Geneva presents its compliments to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and with reference to the 
latter&#8217;s Note dated 13 January 2010 regarding the deaths of Mr Saw Win Thein, aged 40, 
and Mr. Doung Nyo, aged 26 years, has the honour to inform the reply received from the 
authorities concerned as follows;  
</p>
<p>(a) The incident mentioned in the letter of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is in fact a skirmish which took place in 
Kayin State to conduct military operation and safeguard order in that territory. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Kayin State where insurgents still exist are designated as grey areas. On 26 
September 2009, performing the duties of operation and territorial safeguarding in 
Ta U Kee and Baw Kee areas a company from Light Infantry Battalion 220 had an 
engagement with five insurgents. After the skirmish two bodies of persons whose 
name were listed in the insurgent structure were seized along with a mobile radio 
transreceiver and accessories to make improvised control mines.

</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: No response (recent communication)  
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving a response concerning these allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 22 February 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  
</p>
<p>579. We write in relation to reports regarding continued impunity for the torture and 
killing of Ms. Maina Sunuwar, a fifteen-year-old student, by the (then Royal) Nepalese 
Army, and in particular regarding the situation of Major Niranjan Basnet. We and other 
Special Procedure mandate holders have addressed previous communications to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government on this matter on 2 March 2004, 7 July 2004, 14 October 2004, 3 
November 2005 and 22 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>580. The facts of Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s death were established in the report of a Nepalese 
Army (NA) Court of Inquiry Board as follows: 
</p>
<p>581. On the morning of 17 February 2004 a &#8220;12-person covert team&#8221; of the NA, led by 
(then Captain) Major Niranjan Basnet, went to the home of Ms. Devi Sunuwar, who they 
suspected of being a Maoist cadre, in Kharelthok Village Development Committee, Kavre 
district. Not having found Devi Sunuwar, they arrested her daughter Maina, aged 15, and 
took her to the Shri Birendra Peace Operations Training Centre in Panchakhal.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>189 
</b></p>
<p>582. As further established in detail in the report of the Court of Inquiry Board, at the 
Birendra Peace Operations Training Centre, Maina Sunuwar was subjected to torture in 
order to extract information on Maoist activities. She was submerged in a large pot of water 
six or seven times, each time for about a minute (para. 11 of the Court of Inquiry Board 
report). Subsequently, she was given electrical shocks to her wet feet and wrists. This was 
done by two soldiers on the orders of Colonel (then Lt. Colonel) Bobby Khatri, Captain 
Sunil Adhikari and Captain Amit Pun, in the presence of Major (then Captain) Niranjan 
Basnet (paras 10 and 13 of the Court of Inquiry Board report). When the soldier who was 
materially &#8220;administering electrical current&#8221; to Maina Sunuwar refused to continue because 
she started bleeding from her wrists, Captain Sunil Adhikari and Captain Amit Pun ordered 
a non-commissioned officer to continue (para. 15 of the Court of Inquiry Board report).   
</p>
<p>583. After an hour and a half, the torture was stopped. Maina Sunuwar was blindfolded 
and her hands tied. When she started vomiting and foaming at the mouth, the sentries 
informed Major Niranjan Basnet, who in turn informed Colonel Bobby Khatri. A medical 
orderly was called, but when he arrived Maina Sunuwar was already dead (para. 16 of the 
Court of Inquiry Board report). 
</p>
<p>584. Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s body was then taken to a location approximately 50 meters from 
the fence of the barracks, where a pit was dug to bury her secretly. Before burial her dead 
body was shot in the back and pictures taken of it, in order to fabricate evidence of a 
shooting upon flight. The police were called and drafted a report of the incident as told by 
the military officers without visiting the place where the alleged shooting took place and 
without inspecting Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s body (paras. 17-20 of the Court of Inquiry Board 
report). 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, thereafter:  
</p>
<p> Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari and Captain Amit Pun were 
brought to trial before a Court Martial as recommended by the Court of Inquiry 
Board. On 8 September 2005, the Court Martial found the three officers guilty of 
negligence, concluding that Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s death was not the &#8220;result of 
intentional torture but [that she] died unfortunately and accidentally due to wrongful 
techniques used out of carelessness, fickleness and irrationality during the 
interrogation and due to her own physical weakness.&#8221; The Court Martial sentenced 
them to six months detention, imposed a total fine of 100,000 rupees on the three 
officers and declared them ineligible for promotion for one to two years. The three 
officers were released immediately following the Court Martial decision because of 
the time spent confined to the barracks while awaiting trial.  
</p>
<p> In November 2005, the family of Maina Sunuwar filed a First Information 
Report with the police naming Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari, 
Captain Amit Pun, and Major Niranjan Basnet. The Nepalese Army refused any 
cooperation with the police investigation. 
</p>
<p> The family of Maina Sunuwar also brought a writ of mandamus to the 
Supreme Court, which in September 2007 ordered that the case must be investigated 
and brought before the Kavre District Court. In January 2008, the District Court 
issued arrest warrants for the four officers. In September 2009, the District Court 
ordered the Nepalese Army to produce the witness statements it gathered during the 
Court Martial procedure and to suspend Major Niranjan Basnet, and ordered the 
District Attorney to produce the defendants and witnesses. The Nepalese Army 
continued to refuse cooperation. Instead, it deployed Major Basnet with the UN 
Peacekeeping Operation in Chad.  
</p>
<p> Major Basnet was, however, repatriated by the UN when his involvement in 
the case was revealed. Upon his arrival in Tribhuwan Airport on 12 December 2009, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>190  
</b></p>
<p>he was taken under control of the Nepalese Army and accompanied to barracks 
instead of being handed over to the police or judicial authorities. On 13 December 
2009, the Nepal Police requested the Army to hand him over, but he remains in army 
barracks as of today. Senior Government officials, notably the Minister of Defence, 
have publicly stated that the Army should not comply with the order of the District 
Court to hand over Major Niranjan Basnet into police custody. 
</p>
<p>585. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that every individual has the right 
to life, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In its 
General Comment on Article 6, the Human Rights Committee has observed &#8220;that States 
parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal 
acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of 
life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore the law must 
strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by 
such authorities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>586. We note that States Parties to the ICCPR are under an obligation to fully investigate 
and bring to justice the perpetrators of torture and arbitrary executions (ICCPR Arts. 2, 6 
and 7; Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31 (2004), para. 18). Principle 9 of the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions provides that there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221;. This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on 
Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; 
(OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions observed in his 
communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 22 August 2006 (which remains 
without a response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government), &#8220;the obligation to prosecute and 
punish is not a mere formality. Inadequate punishment for grave human rights violations 
does an injustice to the victims and contributes to a culture of impunity that leads to further 
violations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>587. The Nepalese Army Court of Inquiry Board, which established the facts regarding 
the torture and death of Maina Sunuwar as described above, the Supreme Court decision of 
September 2007, and the arrest warrants issued by the Kavre District Court are important 
steps by Nepalese authorities to live up to these obligations under international human 
rights law. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that the Nepalese Army hands 
Major Basnet over to the civilian authorities and that Colonel Khatri, Captain Adhikari and 
Captain Pun are arrested, and that they are brought to trial on charges of torture resulting in 
the killing of Maina Sunuwar. 
</p>
<p>588. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and that 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that 
your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>589. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters:

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 7 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief  
</p>
<p>590. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding a number of extrajudicial 
executions allegedly committed by the, including the killing of Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, Mr. 
Alhaji Buji Fai, and eight unidentified persons in security force custody.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> From 26 July 2009, members of a group called <i>Boko Haram</i> rioted and 
attacked police stations and other Government buildings as well as places of worship 
in the Northern Nigerian states of Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, and especially Borno.  
Reports suggest that <i>Boko Haram </i>sought to impose their interpretation of Shari&#8217;a 
law in Nigeria, and that they intended to threaten or attack individuals who did not 
agree with or observe <i>Boko Haram's </i>interpretation of Shari'a. 
</p>
<p> Government security forces launched an operation to stop the group&#8217;s violent 
activities, and fighting between <i>Boko Haram </i>members and Government forces 
ensued for five days.  By 3 August 2009, at least 780 bodies had been picked up 
from the streets of Maiduguri (Borno state) alone.  Another 98 deaths were reported 
from Yobe and Bauchi states.  The total number of dead is to date unclear, as is the 
number of dead who were <i>Boko Haram </i>members, police, military, or civilians.   
</p>
<p><i> Killing of Mr. Mohammed Yusuf:  </i>Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, the leader of the 
<i>Boko Haram </i>group, was apprehended by the military on 30 July 2009.  He was 
captured by Col. Ben Ahanotu, commander of the military operations against <i>Boko 
Haram</i>, and transferred over to police in Maiduguri (Borno state) that same day.  
Photographic evidence of Mr. Yusuf&#8217;s capture by the military indicates that he was 
alive and did not have any injuries at that time, except for a wound in his arm which 
had been treated.  After his transfer to police custody, Mr. Yusuf was stripped 
naked, interrogated, and then shot at close range numerous times by police.  A few 
hours later, the body was shown to journalists.  According to some police accounts </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>192  
</b></p>
<p>of the death, including by the Police Commissioner of Borno state, Mr. Christopher 
Dega, Mr. Yusuf was not shot by police, but sustained injuries during his capture by 
the military, and subsequently died from those wounds.  However, Regional Police 
Assistant Inspector-General stated that Mr. Yusuf was killed by police while trying 
to escape from custody.    
</p>
<p><i> Killing of Mr. Alhaji Buji Fai</i>:  On 31 July 2009, a former Commissioner of 
Religious Affairs in Borno state, Mr. Alhaji Buji Fai, was killed by police.  He was 
accused of having close ties to, or being a supporter of, the <i>Boko Haram </i>group.  He 
was arrested on 31 July 2009 in a joint military-police operation (&#8220;Operation 
Flush&#8221;), and taken to Police Force Headquarters in Maiduguri.  According to 
information received, he was there stripped of his shirt, interrogated, and executed at 
the entrance to the police station.     
</p>
<p><i> Killing of three individuals</i>: On 28 July 2009 three unidentified individuals &#8211; 
suspected <i>Boko Haram </i>members &#8211; were arrested by members of the security forces 
in Maiduguri.  They were taken to an area just outside the police headquarters in 
Maiduguri, and ordered to kneel on the ground.  They were asked questions by the 
security forces.  Each of the three were then reportedly shot at close range, while 
unarmed and kneeling.  
</p>
<p><i> Killing of five individuals</i>: On 29 July 2009, members of the security forces 
disarmed and detained five alleged members of <i>Boko Haram </i>in a suburb of 
Maiduguri called Customs Bridge<i>.  </i>The detained individuals were ordered to lie 
down.  One of the security force members yelled &#8220;fire&#8221;, and the soldiers shot and 
killed the five men.  
</p>
<p>591. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that every individual has the right 
to life, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). Article 6 
of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when strictly 
necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved 
(see, e.g., Principles 4 and 9 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials).  Under no circumstances does the law permit the use of lethal force 
against unarmed individuals detained by a state&#8217;s security forces.   
</p>
<p>592. Moreover, when the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of 
diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies 
while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In order to overcome 
the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in 
custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected 
cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints 
by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; 
(Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions).  This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission 
on Human Rights in Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and 
impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>593. We also would like to recall your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/37 urges States to &#8220;take all necessary and appropriate action, in 
conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and 
acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or 
belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence&#8221;.  </p>

<p>594. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to conduct an impartial and transparent 
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of all those killed during the fighting, 
including Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, Mr. Buji Fai, and the eight unidentified individuals, with 
a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring 
accountability of any person guilty of unlawful killings, as well as to compensate the 
families of the victims.

your observations on the following questions: 
</p>
<p>1. How many individuals have been killed in the fighting that broke out in 
Northern Nigeria on 26 July 2009?  How many members of the <i>Boko Haram </i>group 
were killed by Government security forces?  How many members were arrested?  
How many members died in police or military custody?   
</p>
<p>2. What steps have been taken to investigate whether the killings that occurred 
during the fighting were carried out lawfully or otherwise?  How many, if any, 
civilians were killed by Government security forces?  
</p>
<p>3. Are the allegations with respect to the deaths of Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, Mr. 
Buji Fai, and the eight unidentified individuals accurate?  Please provide

individuals in question 3?  Please provide the results of any forensic, medical, police 
or other inquiries into the deaths.  What steps have or will be taken to ensure that the 
alleged perpetrators of the killings are properly investigated, prosecuted, and 
punished?

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 22 January 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>596. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding <b>continued violent clashes 
between Christians and Muslims communities in Jos, Plateau State</b>, specifically clashes 
which occurred on 7 March 2010, which reportedly resulted in the killing of at least 200 
persons.  
</p>
<p>597. We have previously written to your Excellency&#8217;s government in a communication 
dated 22 January 2010, concerning violent clashes that have occurred in Plateau State 
between 2001 and 2010. In that communication we sought from your government </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>194  
</b></p>
<p>information on the inquiries into the inter-communal clashes and their outcomes, on the 
measures taken to hold those responsible for killings accountable, and on the measures 
taken to prevent further outbreaks of deadly inter-communal violence in Plateau State. We 
are yet to receive a reply from your Excellency&#8217;s Government.  
</p>
<p> According to new information received: 
</p>
<p> On 7 March 2010, men armed with guns, machetes, and knives attacked 
residents of the villages of Dogo Nahawa, Zot, and Ratsat, 10 kilometers south of 
Jos, the capital of Plateau State. The attackers hunted down and attacked Christian 
residents, killing and burning them as they fled. It is reported that at least  200 
people have been killed including women and children.  
</p>
<p> The present attack appears to be in retaliation for the violent clashes that 
occurred in the town of Kura Karama on 19 January 2010, against Muslim 
communities in which more than 150 people were killed. It is believed that some of 
the attackers had previously lived in the same villages but had re-located due to 
inter-communal tensions.  
</p>
<p> We are informed that communal clashes in Jos are a recurring phenomenon. 
In September 2001, a major outbreak of violence claimed as many as 1,000 lives; in 
May 2004, about 700 were killed in the town of Yelwa in the southern part of 
Plateau State and in November 2008, about 700 people were killed in Jos.  
</p>
<p> We are informed that your Excellency&#8217;s Government had responded to the 
January 2010 clashes by deploying additional troops to the areas of Jos and 
surrounding communities. However, the troops have been largely limited to the 
major towns and not deployed in the smaller communities.  
</p>
<p>598. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports received, we would 
like to recall the relevant international human rights obligations that your Excellency&#8217;s has 
undertaken. In particular, we would refer to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Nigeria is a party, which provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by 
law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6).   
</p>
<p>599. We recognize that some important measures were taken to provide security in the 
area of Jos.  It appears, however, from the information received that these measures were 
not adequate. As noted by the Special Rapporteur on summary executions in his mission 
report on Nigeria, there remains a problem of failure by the security forces to react quickly, 
let alone pre-emptively, to situations of inter-communal tension, thereby allowing the 
violence to escalate (para 75 (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4). We wish to bring to the attention of 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government the responsibility that States have to protect persons from 
human rights violations committed by non-state actors. In this regard the Human Rights 
Committee has pointed out that the positive obligations on States Parties to ensure 
Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not 
just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by 
private persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights in so far as 
they are amenable to application between private persons or entities. There are 
circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant rights as required by article 2 would 
give rise to violations by States Parties of those rights.  This applies when a State Party 
permits or fails to take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, 
investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities. <i>(para 8) 
General Comment No. 31 [80] the Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on 
States Parties to the Covenant </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>195 
</b></p>
<p>600. We remain concerned over the lack of investigation and prosecution of those 
responsible for the communal clashes.  In general, it appears that after such communal 
clashes a few arrests are made and prosecutions of minor players follow.  In some cases,  an 
inquiry is also held, but the resulting report remains confidential and without meaningful 
follow up. In this regard, we wish to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions which stipulate that &#8220;There shall be thorough, prompt 
and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances. Governments shall maintain investigative 
offices and procedures to undertake such inquiries. The purpose of the investigation shall 
be to determine the cause, manner and time of death, the person responsible, and any 
pattern or practice which may have brought about that death. It shall include an adequate 
autopsy, collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence and statements 
from witnesses&#8221;. (Principle 9)  Further it is provided that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that 
persons identified by the investigation as having participated in extra-legal, arbitrary or 
summary executions in any territory under their jurisdiction are brought to justice&#8221;. 
(Principle 18). The Human Rights Committee has observed that failure to investigate and 
failure to bring to justice perpetrators of such violations could in and of itself give rise to a 
separate breach of the Covenant. Such failures lead to impunity which can encourage a 
repetition of the crimes by others in subsequent incidents. <i>(Para 15) General Comment No. 
31 [80] The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the 
Covenant 
</i></p>
<p>601. The Special Rapporteur on summary executions has submitted in his report to the 
Human Rights Council that crimes, including murder, carried out by individuals can also 
give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all 
appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators as well as to address any 
attitudes or conditions within society which encourage or facilitate such crimes. Once a 
pattern becomes clear in which the response of the Government is clearly inadequate, its 
responsibility under international human rights law becomes applicable. Through its 
inaction the Government confers a degree of impunity upon the killers (E/CN.4/2005/7,  
Para 71/ 72) 
</p>
<p>602. We would further like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/37 urges States to &#8220;take all necessary and appropriate action, in 
conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and 
acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or 
belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>In this context, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief recommended in her 
mission report (E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.2, paras. 113-115):  
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The Government should also abide by its basic obligation to ensure the protection 
and security of religious groups which may be targeted and which should be entitled 
to practise their religions freely and without any obstacles, including those created 
by non-State actors. The Government should reassess the efficiency of its 
mechanisms in order to be able to intervene in a timely and proper manner when 
such violence occurs. Early warning mechanisms should also be strengthened. The 
mechanisms created by the Government to promote interreligious dialogue should 
be strengthened and extended. In particular, they should ensure that religious leaders 
of all communities can participate and involve the civil society. Mechanisms at the 
local level should be created in as many places as may require them because of the 
composition of the population, past experience, or any other indication of possible 
religious tensions. The Government should also increase its support for such </p>

reforms and long term preventive measures targeted to address the root causes of communal 
clashes and preventing future recurrences.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 November 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p>605. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the case of <b>Saleem Mohammed 
Saleem al-Nabahin</b>, who was recently sentenced to death by a military court in Gaza. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem al-Nabahin, aged 27, is a resident of al-
Boreij refugee camp in Central Gaza governorate. Hamas security forces took Mr. 
Saleem al-Nabahin into custody at an unspecified date in mid-2008. In detention, he 
was subjected to torture at the hands of members of the Gaza Internal Security 
Forces and of the Izz al-Din al Qassam Brigades. A confession to the charges of 
collaboration with the enemy was extracted under torture. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was put on trial before the Permanent Military Court 
in Gaza on charges of &#8220;collaboration with hostile parties&#8221; under article 131 of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization&#8217;s Revolutionary Penal Code of 1979. On 8 
October 2009, the Military Court found him guilty and sentenced him to death by 
hanging. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>197 
</b></p>
<p> On 13 October 2009, Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin filed an appeal against the 
judgment and sentence. Under the Revolutionary Penal Code which was applied by 
the court in this case the appeal lies not to a higher court but to the Head of the 
Militant Judiciary in his personal capacity.  
</p>
<p>606. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to this case under international law.  
</p>
<p>607. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  
</p>
<p>608. According to the information we have received, article 131 of the Revolutionary 
Penal Code provides that the death penalty shall apply to anyone who  
</p>
<p>(a) Approaches a state or party hostile to the revolution, or collaborates with it, or 
with any one working for it, with the goal of carrying out hostile acts against the 
revolution. 
</p>
<p>(b) Approaches a foreign hostile state, or collaborates with it or with any one 
working for and helping it in carrying out its warfare operations to harm the 
Palestinian revolution's warfare operations.&#8221; (This is an unofficial translation). 
</p>
<p>609. We are concerned that this provision, which appears to allow the death penalty to be 
imposed against anyone who approaches any entity hostile to &#8220;the revolution&#8221; with the 
&#8220;goal of carrying out hostile acts against the revolution&#8221;, permits the imposition of the 
death sentence for conduct which does not involve intentional killing, as required by 
international law restricting the death penalty to the most serious crimes.  
</p>
<p>610. Moreover, the description of the conduct punishable by death appears to be overly 
broad and vague, falling significantly short of the standards of strict legality required by 
international law. A further concern brought to our attention is that the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization&#8217;s Revolutionary Penal Code of 1979 allegedly cannot constitute a 
valid basis for a conviction and death sentence as it was never put before and adopted as 
law by the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. 
</p>
<p>611. With regard to the trial of Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem al-Nabahinby by a 
military court, we wish to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government that 
international law also requires that in capital punishment cases the defendants&#8217; right to &#8220;a 
fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (article 10 of the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights) is scrupulously respected. The Human Rights 
Committee, in its general comment no. 32 to article 14 International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, gives valuable guidelines in this respect. It notes that &#8220;[w]hile the 
Covenant does not prohibit the trial of civilians in military or special courts, it requires that 
such trials are in full conformity with the requirements of  article 14 and that its guarantees 
cannot be limited or modified because of the military or special character of the court 
concerned.&#8221; The Committee also notes that &#8220;the trial of civilians in military or special 
courts may raise serious problems as far as the equitable, impartial and independent 
administration of justice is concerned. Therefore, it is important to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that such trials take place under conditions which genuinely afford the 
full guarantees stipulated in article 14.&#8221;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>198  
</b></p>
<p>612. Furthermore, the former Commission on Human Rights has stated that &#8220;States that 
have military courts or special criminal tribunals for trying criminal offenders to ensure that 
such courts are an integral part of the general judicial system and that such courts apply due 
process procedures that are recognized according to international law as guarantees of a fair 
trial including the right to appeal a conviction and sentence&#8221; (Official records of the 
General Assembly, Fifty Sixth Session, Supplement 40 (A/56/40) para 76). In this 
connection, we would also like to refer to paragraph 51 of the general comment no. 32, in 
which the Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;[t]he right of appeal is of particular 
importance in death penalty cases.&#8221; As the appeal filed by Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem 
al-Nabahinby does not, according to the information received, lie to a higher court, but to 
the Head of the Militant Judiciary in his personal capacity, we would like to express our 
serious doubts as to the availability of an effective right of appeal. . 
</p>
<p>613. A further fundamental principle of the right to a fair trial is the right not to be 
compelled to confess guilt. Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; This provision reflects a principle of customary 
international law and was reiterated in paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 
8/8 of 2008. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter 
alia, in article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>614. To conclude, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes 
capital punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, 
which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of 
Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have 
raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>615. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?

<p>2. What is the alleged conduct Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was found guilty of 
which underlies the charges of &#8220;collaborating with the enemy&#8221;?

</p>

will the Head of the Militant Judiciary follow to reach his decision on the appeal? 
</p>

<p>We undertake to ensure that your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response to each of 
these questions is accurately reflected in the reports we will submit to the Human 
Rights Council for its consideration. Finally, we would like to inform your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that we have addressed a communication of the same 
contents to Dr Yousef, Gaza, Palestine.

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 16 November 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>616. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the case of Saleem Mohammed 
Saleem al-Nabahin, who was recently sentenced to death by a military court in Gaza. 
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem al-Nabahin, aged 27, is a resident of al-
Boreij refugee camp in Central Gaza governorate. Hamas security forces took Mr. 
Saleem al-Nabahin into custody at an unspecified date in mid-2008. In detention, he 
was subjected to torture at the hands of members of the Gaza Internal Security 
Forces and of the Izz al-Din al Qassam Brigades. A confession to the charges of 
collaboration with the enemy was extracted under torture. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was put on trial before the Permanent Military Court 
in Gaza on charges of &#8220;collaboration with hostile parties&#8221; under article 131 of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization&#8217;s Revolutionary Penal Code of 1979. On 8 
October 2009, the Military Court found him guilty and sentenced him to death by 
hanging. 
</p>
<p> On 13 October 2009, Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin filed an appeal against the 
judgment and sentence. Under the Revolutionary Penal Code which was applied by 
the court in this case the appeal lies not to a higher court but to the Head of the 
Militant Judiciary in his personal capacity.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>200  
</b></p>
<p>617. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported above, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to this case under international law.  
</p>
<p>618. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).  
</p>
<p>619. According to the information we have received, article 131 of the Revolutionary 
Penal Code provides that the death penalty shall apply to anyone who  
</p>
<p>(a) Approaches a state or party hostile to the revolution, or collaborates with it, or 
with any one working for it, with the goal of carrying out hostile acts against the 
revolution. 
</p>
<p>(b) Approaches a foreign hostile state, or collaborates with it or with any one 
working for and helping it in carrying out its warfare operations to harm the 
Palestinian revolution's warfare operations.&#8221; (This is an unofficial translation). 
</p>
<p>620. We are concerned that this provision, which appears to allow the death penalty to be 
imposed against anyone who approaches any entity hostile to &#8220;the revolution&#8221; with the 
&#8220;goal of carrying out hostile acts against the revolution&#8221;, permits the imposition of the 
death sentence for conduct which does not involve intentional killing, as required by 
international law restricting the death penalty to the most serious crimes.  
</p>
<p>621. Moreover, the description of the conduct punishable by death appears to be overly 
broad and vague, falling significantly short of the standards of strict legality required by 
international law. A further concern brought to our attention is that the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization&#8217;s Revolutionary Penal Code of 1979 allegedly cannot constitute a 
valid basis for a conviction and death sentence as it was never put before and adopted as 
law by the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. 
</p>
<p>622. With regard to the trial of Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem al-Nabahinby by a 
military court, we wish to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government that 
international law also requires that in capital punishment cases the defendants&#8217; right to &#8220;a 
fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (article 10 of the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights) is scrupulously respected. The Human Rights 
Committee, in its general comment no. 32 to article 14 International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, gives valuable guidelines in this respect. It notes that &#8220;[w]hile the 
Covenant does not prohibit the trial of civilians in military or special courts, it requires that 
such trials are in full conformity with the requirements of  article 14 and that its guarantees 
cannot be limited or modified because of the military or special character of the court 
concerned.&#8221; The Committee also notes that &#8220;the trial of civilians in military or special 
courts may raise serious problems as far as the equitable, impartial and independent 
administration of justice is concerned. Therefore, it is important to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that such trials take place under conditions which genuinely afford the 
full guarantees stipulated in article 14.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>623. Furthermore, the former Commission on Human Rights has stated that &#8220;States that 
have military courts or special criminal tribunals for trying criminal offenders to ensure that 
such courts are an integral part of the general judicial system and that such courts apply due 
process procedures that are recognized according to international law as guarantees of a fair </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>201 
</b></p>
<p>trial including the right to appeal a conviction and sentence&#8221; (Official records of the 
General Assembly, Fifty Sixth Session, Supplement 40 (A/56/40) para 76). In this 
connection, we would also like to refer to paragraph 51 of the general comment no. 32, in 
which the Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;[t]he right of appeal is of particular 
importance in death penalty cases.&#8221; As the appeal filed by Mr. Saleem Mohammed Saleem 
al-Nabahinby does not, according to the information received, lie to a higher court, but to 
the Head of the Militant Judiciary in his personal capacity, we would like to express our 
serious doubts as to the availability of an effective right of appeal. . 
</p>
<p>624. A further fundamental principle of the right to a fair trial is the right not to be 
compelled to confess guilt. Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; This provision reflects a principle of customary 
international law and was reiterated in paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 
8/8 of 2008. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter 
alia, in article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>625. To conclude, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes 
capital punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, 
which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of 
Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have 
raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>626. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. What is the alleged conduct Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was found guilty of 
which underlies the charges of &#8220;collaborating with the enemy&#8221;?

Revolutionary Penal Code of 1979? 
</p>
<p>4. Please explain the legal basis, composition, appointment procedures and 
guarantees of independence and impartiality governing Permanent Military Courts in 
Gaza such as the one which sentenced Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin to death. Please 
provide information as to why Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was tried by a military court. 
</p>
<p>5. What remedies remain available to Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin? Is it accurate that 
the only appeal available to Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin lies not to a higher court but to 
the Head of the Militant Judiciary &#8220;in his personal capacity&#8221;? If so, what procedures 
will the Head of the Militant Judiciary follow to reach his decision on the appeal? 
</p>
<p>6. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to the allegation that Mr. Saleem al-Nabahin was subjected to torture in 
order to compel him to confess. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Pakistan.  He notes that the Government does not specify 
whether it has opened an investigation into the death of Mr. Janullah Hashimzada, and 
looks forward to receiving that information, together with the details of any investigation 
and resulting prosecution.  The Special Rapporteur also looks forward to receiving the 
information he has requested about the investigations the Government describes as having 
opened into the killings of Mr. Sadiq Bacha, Mr Musa Khan Khel, Mr. Muhammad Imran, 
Mr. Saleem Tahir Awan, Mr. Abdul Razzak Johra, and Mr. Qari Muhammad Shoaib, and 
the attempted abduction of Mr. Sani Yousafzai and Ms. Motoki Yatsukura.  He also looks 
forward to receiving information about any resulting prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 2 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>628. We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information we have received in relation to the killings of Mr. Janullah Hashimzada, chief 
editor of Afghanistan&#8217;s Shamshad Television based in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, and 
Mr. Sadiq Bacha Khan, correspondent for Aaj TV and former president of the Mardan 
Press Club. These killings follow lethal attacks against three journalists in the North-West 
Frontier Province (NWFP) in the first two months of 2009: Mr. Muhammad Imran, trainee 
cameraman with Express TV, Mr. Saleem Tahir Awan, freelance reporter with the local 
dailies Eitedal and Apna Akhbar, and Mr. Musa Khankhel, reporter for Geo TV and the 
English-language newspaper The News.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 24 August 2009, Mr. Janullah Hashimzada was travelling from the 
Afghan border of Torkham to Peshawar in a minibus when the vehicle was 
intercepted by masked assailants, reportedly in a Toyota Corolla. They allegedly 
forced the minibus to stop and fired at Mr. Hashimzada with assault rifles at least six 
times. Another employee of Shamshad television, Mr. Ali Khan, was seriously 
injured in the attack. Both journalists were immediately taken to the Civil Hospital </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>203 
</b></p>
<p>in Jamrud, where the doctors declared Mr. Hashimzada dead on arrival. Mr. Khan is 
reportedly in Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. Reports claim that Mr. 
Hashimzada had told journalists in Peshawar that he had been receiving threatening 
phone calls and that he was being followed. It has been suggested that he was 
targeted for possessing too much information regarding the militants, the Taliban 
and the Pakistani intelligence agencies.  
</p>
<p> On 14 August 2009 at around 7:20 a.m., Mr. Sadiq Barcha Khan was 
ambushed and shot at least 15 times outside the Aaj TV office in Mardan, a town in 
NWFP. He reportedly died as a result of his injuries on the way to a hospital in 
Peshawar. Reports claim that Mr. Khan was assigned to cover the funeral of an army 
official who had been killed days earlier by drug traffickers in another region.  
</p>
<p> Previously, on 4 January 2009, Mr. Muhammad Imran and Mr. Saleem Tahir 
Awan were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the 
Government Polytechnic College in Dera Ismail Khan in NWFP.  
</p>
<p> On 18 February 2009, Mr. Musa Khankhel was shot dead by unidentified 
gunmen while on assignment covering a peace march led by Muslim cleric Sufi 
Muhammad in the Swat valley.  
</p>
<p>629. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
reiterate our concern regarding the safety of journalists working in the border area of 
Pakistan and Afghanistan, who are routinely exposed to violence and intimidation. 
According to reports, in the last two years alone 11 journalists have been killed in Pakistan, 
six of them in the NWFP. In this connection, we have previously expressed our concern 
regarding the killings of two journalists (Mr. Abdul Razzak Johra and Mr. Qari Muhammad 
Shoaib) and the attempted abduction of two others (Mr. Sami Yousafzai and Ms. Motoki 
Yatsukura) in our communication sent to your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 8 January 
</p><p>2009. As yet a response has not been received from your Excellency's Government. 
</p>
<p>630. We would once again like to urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take effective 
measures to prevent further killings of journalists. In this respect, it is very important that 
the persons responsible for the killings, both as material perpetrators and as instigators, are 
rapidly identified, arrested and brought to justice.  
</p>
<p>631. In this connection, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
relevant principles of international law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
provides that &#8220;everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person&#8221; (Article 3). As 
reiterated in Human Rights Council resolution 8/3 (OP 4), to protect and ensure this right 
all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. Where a State fails to take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and 
punish the perpetrators of a pattern of attacks against a group in society, such as journalists, 
criminal acts, including murder, can also give rise to State responsibility (Report of the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 
71.) 
</p>
<p>632. We would also like to recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and 
to prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a precondition to 
ensuring the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that: &#8220;Everyone shall have the 
right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; We are concerned that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>204  
</b></p>
<p>killings of journalists, particularly if they remain unpunished, create a climate of impunity 
and result in preventing independent reporting and stifling freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>633. In this context, we deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of 
the Commission on Human Rights which calls upon states to ensure that victims of 
violations of the right to freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate 
effectively threats and acts of violence, including terrorist acts, against journalists, 
including in situations of armed conflict, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat 
impunity.  
</p>
<p>634. It is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the cases accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the 
killings of Mr. Janullah Hashimzada, Mr. Sadiq Bacha Khan, Mr. Muhammad 
Imran, Mr. Saleem Tahir Awan and Mr. Musa Khankhel. We would also like to 
reiterate our request for information on the progress of criminal investigations and 
other inquiries into the attempted abduction and killing of persons mentioned in our 
previous communication dated 8 January 2009 (Mr. Abdul Razzak Johra, Mr. Qari 
Muhammad Shoaib, Mr. Sami Yousafzai and Ms. Motoki Yatsukura). In the event 
that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full details of any 
prosecutions which have been undertaken. If no inquiries have taken place or if they 
have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details of any other measures that have been implemented 
to ensure the safety of journalists in Pakistan, particularly in NWFP.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Pakistan dated 13 October 2009:  
</b></p>
<p>635. The matter of alleged killings of five journalists was referred to concerned law 
enforcement and administrative authorities in Pakistan. It is informed that these journalists 
were mainly killed in those areas where extremists challenged the writ of the government in 
the recent past. Accordingly, the government had to launch law enforcement operation on 
popular demand against these extremists. It is important to note that activities of the 
journalists supported state-run law enforcement operation, in particular in shaping public 
opinion against the extremists. 
</p>
<p>636. It is believed that these journalists namely Mr. Jan Ullah Hashimzada of AAJ TV, 
and Mr. Musa Khan Khel of GEO TV, were killed by the extremists as the journalists made 
an extra effort to expose their brutal actions among the local communities, while Mr. 
Muhammad Imran and Mr. Saleem Thair Awan were died in a suicide blast. Lastly, Mr. 
Sadiq Bacha was killed on the basis of previous enmity between the parties. Brief 
particulars of these cases are given below: 
</p>
<p>637. Jan Ullah Hashimzada: On 24th August 2009, some unknown persons fired at Jan 
Ullah Hashimzada in Jamrud (tribal territory), as a result of which Jan Ullah Hashimadza 
died. It is believed that Mr. Hashimadza was killed by the extremists. 
</p>
<p>638. Sadiq Bacha: On 14 August 2009 at 0700 hours, Changeez Khan and Babar Khan 
sons of Tahir Khan of Mohallah Bajauri Hoti, District Mardan killed Sadiq Bacha of &#8220;AAJ 
TV&#8221;. As per investigation, it was learnt that there was previous enmity on family issues 
between the parties and the accused party took revenge by killing Mr. Bacha. The accused 
made their escape from the spot after occurrence. As far as killing by drug traffickers is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>concerned, no evidence could be verified. A case vide FIR No. 623 dated 14th August 2009 
u/s 302/324/34 PPC has been registered at Police Station Hoti Mardan and 
efforts/investigtions are underway to apprehend the culprits. 
</p>
<p>639. Musa Khan Khel: On 18th February 2009, upon reaching agreement between the 
Provincial Government and Maulana Sofi Muhammad (TNSM Chief) to implement &#8220;Shari 
Nizam-i-Adal Regulations&#8221;, Maulana Sofi Muhammad led a procession to Matta Swat for 
restoration of peace in the areas. A large number of members of print and electronic media 
had assembled for coverage of the event including Musa Khan Khel. Mr. Khel was 
kidnapped by unidentified men who took him to Detpanai, where they shot him dead. At 
that time, the area was in de-facto control of extremists. A case FIR No. 17 dated 18 
February 2009 u/s 302 PPC was registered at Police Stations Matta. The case is still under 
investigation and the incident seems to be the misdeed of extremists and target killing. It 
has been learnt that altercations took place between Musa Khan Khel and Muslim Khan, the 
extremists&#8217; spokesman, several times on the phone for fair reporting of the former.  
</p>
<p>640. Muhammad Imran and Saleem Tahir Awan: On 14th January 2009, a heavy police 
contingent was staying in Poly-Technical College Dera Ismail Khan in connection with 
Muharram (religious procession) duty. A suicide blast took place in a hotel near the college. 
A number of Police men and public were killed and injured including Muhammad Imran of 
Muryali, Camera man &#8220;Express TV&#8221; and Muhammad Saleem Tahir (a columnist) of Basti 
Ustrana DI Khan. Muhammad Saleem Tahir was also serving as Senior Clerk in Naib 
Tehsildar office Pahar Pur DI Khan. A case vide FIR No. 6 dated 4th January 2009 u/s 
302/324/353/120-B/ 427 PPC/3 ESA/7ATA was registered at Police Station Cantonment 
DI Khan. The case is still under investigation.  
</p>
<p>641. Most of the cases, referred above, took place where the extremists attempted to 
challenge the government&#8217;s writ and, inter alia, tried to suppress voice of the local 
communities. Accordingly, the Government had to start full-fledged law enforcement 
operation in order to protect common civilians including journalists. 
</p>
<p>642. It is important to note that local communities of those areas hold the extremists 
responsible for such killings. However, at the same time, the relevant authorities are 
conducting comprehensive and impartial investigation into these cases in order to identify 
and bring to justice those responsible.  
</p>
<p>643. The Government of Pakistan reiterates its commitment to protecting journalists and 
prosecuting those responsible of killings or death threats against them in order to ensure the 
right of freedom of opinion and expression. We will continue our efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>644. Relevant authorities in Pakistan are in process of examining alleged abduction and 
killings of persons, as referred in your earlier communication dated 8 January 2009 (Mr. 
Abdul Razzak Johra, Mr.Qari Muhammad Shoaib, Mr. Sami Yousafzai and Ms. Matoki

<p>645. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning the death of Mr. Abid Javed Francis. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received:  
</p>
<p> Mr. Abid Javed Francis, member of the minority Christian community, was 
arrested by a Station House Officer and an Assistant Sub Inspector from Ferozabad 
police station (their names remain on record with the Special Rapporteurs), before 
Eid. He was publicly beaten during the arrest, and taken to the Ferozabad police 
station, where he was reportedly subjected to torture. At the station, the police 
reportedly requested Rs 10.000 in bribes from his family. On 24 November, as a 
result of the refusal by his family to pay the bribe, Mr. Francis was charged with 
harboring illegal arms and stealing a motorbike (FIR 273/2009 and FIR 1274/2009). 
He was later presented before a magistrate at the city court in Karachi, where the 
police was granted physical remand for two days. Mr. Fancis was subsequently 
transferred to the Aziz Bhati Park Police Station, where he was once again subjected 
to torture. He was once again asked to pay a bribe and upon refusal to pay, was 
charged with theft (FIR 673/2009). Mr. Francis was then transferred to the ACLC at 
Shrifabad Police Station, where he was tortured in front of his mother and his 
mother-in-law. On 26 November, he was presented before a magistrate&#8217;s court and, 
despite his visible injuries, was sent to Karachi central prison under judicial remand. 
</p>
<p> Mr. Francis&#8217; mother tried to visit him in prison over the Eid period, but her 
requests were denied when she refused to pay bribes to the prison staff. On 7 
December, she was able to visit him, and found him on a stretcher in an outside area, 
wearing only his underpants and hooked to a glucose drip. Mr. Francis was taken to 
the civil hospital in Karachi, where he was pronounced dead on 10 December. The 
post mortem indicated severe injuries to his head and upper body. The cause of death 
was a hematoma on the left side of his head. 
</p>
<p> The victim&#8217;s family filed a petition before the session and district judge in 
District East Karachi, but no investigation has been carried out. 
</p>
<p>646. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the fundamental principles applicable 
under international law to these cases. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Article 3 of the Declaration states that &#8220;everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and security of person.&#8221; When the State detains an individual, it is 
held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. When an 
individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility (see, for instance, the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s views 
in the case of Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), 
paragraph 9.2). 
</p>
<p>647. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting 
from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 8/3, stating that all States have &#8220;to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>648. The Council added that this includes the obligations &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
measures, in order to bring and end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;..  
</p>
<p>649. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to carry out an expeditious, independent 
and transparent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Abid Javed 
Francis, also with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and 
ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to 
compensate his family. In this respect we note that Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, 
paragraph 6 (b) and (e), urges States to hold responsible not only those who perpetrate 
torture, but also those &#8220;who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture [&#8230;], to 
have them brought to justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the 
place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>650. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on this case to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they 
have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p>4. Please indicate whether compensation has been provided to the family of Mr.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur looks forward to

</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 7 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders.   
</p>
<p>651. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the killing of Mr <b>Eliezer Billanes</b>, a human rights 
defender and anti-mining activist. Mr Billanes was among others the Chairman of 
Socsksargends &#8211; AGENDA, a regional anti-mining alliance in southern Mindanao; the 
Chairman of South Cotabato Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy (SOCPAND), the </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>208  
</b></p>
<p>Secretary-General and Program Director of Samahan ng Magsasaka sa Timog Kutabato 
(SAMATIKU). 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 9 March 2009, at approximately 4pm in the afternoon, Mr Eliezer 
Billanes was shot dead in the public market of Koronadal City, South Cotabato, 
Mindanao Island, by two unidentified masked gunmen riding a scooter.  
</p>
<p> On the day of the murder, Mr Billanes had attended a meeting with Lt. 
Eduardo Florentino, the commander of the 27th Infantry Batallion&#8217;s Charlie 
Company, based in Tupi, South Cotabato, and three other officials. The subject of 
the meeting had been the personal security of Mr Eliezer Billanes, who had received 
several threats, including allegedly from the military, due to his vocal stance against 
Sagittarius Mines Inc. During this meeting, Mr Billanes had voiced strong 
opposition to the presence of the 27th Infantry Batallion in his village.  
</p>
<p> The police chief of Koronadal City, Superintendent Froilan Quidilla has 
opened an investigation into the murder of Mr Billanes. South Cotabato Governor 
Daisy Avance-Fuentes declared that she would personally look into the murder of 
Mr Billanes. Lt Eduardo Florentino of the 27th Infantry Batallion denied any hand in 
the killing, in an interview for Radio Mindanao Network. He also said that the 
military had some leads in the case, but &#8220;could not reveal them for fear of 
jeopardizing the ongoing operation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>652. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we do express 
concern that the killing of Mr Eliezer Billanes may be in connection with his peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, especially his environmentalist and anti-mining 
advocacy.  
</p>
<p>653. In this respect, we would like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state 
that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>654. The murder of Mr Billanes is also of the greatest concern from the point of view of 
the right to freedom of expression. We should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right 
to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>655. We would further like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure the right to freedom of association, as recognized in article 22 of 
the Covenant, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association 
with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his 
interests&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>656. The Covenant also provides that every individual has the right to life and security of 
the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions noted in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>209 
</b></p>
<p>including murder, can also give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State 
has failed to take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council 
reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that 
this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, 
to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and 
to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring and 
end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation on the 
State is all the more pressing when there is a pattern of attacks against a group, here human 
rights defenders, which can be seen as being in a confrontational relationship with the 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>657. These principles are echoed in article 12 paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders, which provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure 
the protection by the competent authorities of everyone against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action 
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
Declaration. Everyone is entitled to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts attributable to States that 
result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence 
perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>658. Furthermore, we would like to note the recommendations adopted as a result of the 
review of the Philippines at the first session of the Universal Periodic Review, which the 
Government of the Philippines accepted: &#8220;[t]o ensure that members of the security forces 
are trained on human rights and on their responsibility to protect human rights and human 
rights defenders (Canada); [t]o completely eliminate extrajudicial killings (Holy See) and 
[t]o intensify its efforts to carry out investigations and prosecutions on extrajudicial killings 
and punish those responsible (Switzerland). (A/HRC/8/28, para 58).  
</p>
<p>659. Finally, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters:

<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
preliminary response of the Government of the Philippines.  He looks forward to receiving 
the details of the investigation into the death of Mr. Katog Sapalon, including an 
explanation of the discrepancy between the accounts of Philippine Army soldiers, who 
claim Mr. Sapalon died in cross-fire, and of Mr. Sapalon&#8217;s wife, who describes her husband 
being grabbed &#8220;for no apparent reason&#8221; by armed men while eating breakfast, and who then 
describes watching her husband killed by those armed men at the back of their home.  The 
Special Rapporteur also looks forward to receiving the details of any prosecution or other 
disciplinary proceeding resulting from the investigation, and information about any 
compensation provided to Mr. Sapalon&#8217;s family. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 August 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>662. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the death of Mr. <b>Katog Sapalon</b>. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> At around 7:30 a.m. on 3 June 2009, Mr. Katog Sapalon and his wife were 
preparing breakfast when soldiers arrived at their home. Five heavily-armed men, 
who later identified themselves as soldiers, approached them and began 
interrogating Mr. Sapalon. The soldiers allegedly wanted him to confess his 
involvement with a rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). During 
the questioning, they punched and kicked him with their fists, feet and the butts of 
their rifles. 
</p>
<p> Despite the fact that Mr. Sapalon pleaded with the soldiers, telling them that 
he was not a MILF member, he was shot at close range in front of his family. He was 
hit in several parts of his body, including his eye and head, and died instantly. 
</p>
<p> After several hours, Mr. Sapalon&#8217;s body was taken by the soldiers to the 6th 
Infantry Battalion, Philippine Army in Barangay Gubat Datu, Odin Sinsuat. A 
village chairperson later went to the camp to claim the body, and he was buried on 
the same day. 
</p>
<p>663. Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we should 
like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances 
regarding the case of Mr. Sapalon. We would like to stress that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is 
set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>211 
</b></p>
<p>664. In this context, we would like to draw your Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 
of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>665. We would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Articles 3 and 6 of these instruments, respectively, 
provide that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right 
shall be protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. 
Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement officials only when 
strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be 
achieved (see, e.g., Principles 4 and 9 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials).    
</p>
<p>666. We would also note the relevance in this case of the UN Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. Principle 4 provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, 
&#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) 
Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the 
legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve 
human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or 
affected persons at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; Besides, Article 3 of the Code of Conduct 
for Law Enforcement Officials provides that law enforcement officials may use force only 
when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. 
</p>
<p>667. We would also like to draw the attention of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions, in particular Principle 9 which states that there must be a &#8220;thorough, 
prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports 
suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221;. This principle was reiterated by the 
Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating 
that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected 
cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this 
obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to 
grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an 
end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>668. Therefore, we urge your Government to take all necessary measures to ensure the 
accountability of any person responsible for the death and alleged torture of  Mr. Katog 
Sapalon an. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>669. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged?  </p>

<p>unidentified gunman then reportedly shot Mr. Liano four times after he parked his 
motorcycle and crossed the road to the restaurant.  Whilst the motive of the killing 
remains unclear, some reports suggest that Mr. Linao was targeted for his broadcasts 
which often focused on alleged corruption within the local government.  
</p>
<p> On 28 July 2009, Mr. Mario Alviso, manager of Radyo Nitin, received a text 
message from an unidentified sender the day after Mr. Linao&#8217;s murder, stating that 
the killing was &#8220;just a sample&#8221; of what could be done, and that &#8220;he would be next&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct 
attempt to prevent independent reporting in the Philippines thus stifling freedom of 
expression in the country. Further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological security of media professionals in the Philippines.   
</p>
<p>679. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her life (Article 6). As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions noted in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including 
murder, can also give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to 
take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council 
reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that 
this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, 
to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and 
to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring and 
end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. This obligation on the 
State is all the more pressing when there is a pattern of attacks against a group, in this case 
journalists, which can be seen as being in a confrontational relationship with some 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>680. With respect to the alleged threats against Mr. Mario Alviso we would like to bring 
to your attention that Article 6(1) of the ICCPR requires States to provide effective 
protection to those whose lives are in danger. As expressed in Principle 4 of the UN 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions, this requires that individuals in danger of such executions, including 
those who receive death threats, be guaranteed effective protection through judicial or other 
means.  
</p>
<p>681. We would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that 
&#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive 
for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national 
and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, 
promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting 
such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, 
political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons 
under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those 
rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>215 
</b></p>
<p>682. Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government the following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in 
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other 
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or 
individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>683. We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned 
persons, in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the ICCPR which 
provides that &#8220; Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>684. We also deem it appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the 
Commission on Human Rights which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations 
of the right to freedom of expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively 
threats and acts of violence, including terrorist acts, against journalists, including in 
situations of armed conflict, and to bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>685. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Mario Alviso are respected and accountability of any 
person responsible for the killings of Mr. Crispin Perez Jr., Mr. Antonio Castillo, Mr. 
Jonathan Petalvero, Mr. Godofredo Linao, is ensured. We also request that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>686. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned persons in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>687. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?

<p> According to reports, Mr. Perez was shot by an unidentified male who posed as a 
client at the victim&#8217;s residence in Poblacion 7, San Jose, Mindoro Occidental on 09 June

Department of Justice (DOJ) against a police officer - PO2 Darwin Quimoyog on 02 July 
2009. The case is now submitted for resolution. Two possible motives for the killing were 
explored during the course of investigation: 1) political motive &#8211; in relation to the 
profession of Mr. Perez as a lawyer and media practitioner; and 2) the involvement of his 
wife in several estafa cases. Authorities ruled that political motive could be the primary 
reason for the killing. 
</p>
<p> 2)  Mr. Antonio Castillo 
</p>
<p> According to reports, Mr. Castillo was on his home when he was shot by suspects

</p>
<p>693. We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to reports we 
have received regarding several cases of alleged killings in Northern Samar. The names of 
the alleged victims are Mr <b>Romulo Mendova</b> and Father <b>Cecilo Pelito Lucero</b>.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p>(a) On 5 September 2009, Mr Romulo Mendova, a peasant activist, was shot 
dead in Base, Samar by two unidentified men riding a motorcycle.  
</p>
<p>(b) On 6 September 2009, Father Cecilo Pelito Lucero, aged 48, was traveling 
with two companions in the direction to Catarman. At the highway near the 
cemetery of Barangay Layuhan in San Jose town, approximately 30 unidentified 
armed men ambushed the car. Father Cecilo Pelito Lucero sustained multiple 
gunshots that caused his immediate death. Father Cecilo Pelito Lucero was the </p>

Catholic Diocese of Catarman, a member of the Promotion of Church People&#8217;s 
Response and Chairman of the Task Force Peace and Order of the Diocese of 
Catarman. He had received a number of threats from the military and was under 
surveillance for his role in reporting on human rights violations by the military in 
Northern Samar.  
</p>
<p>694. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we should like 
to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances 
regarding the deaths of Father Cecilo Pelito Lucero and Mr Romulo Mendova. We would 
like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons. We would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
fundamental principles applicable under international law to this case. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the 
right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no 
person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). 
</p>
<p>695. We would also like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions. Principle 4 provides that &#8220;effective protection through judicial or 
other means shall be guaranteed to individuals and groups who are in danger of extra-legal, 
arbitrary or summary executions, including those who receive death threats&#8221;. Further 
Principle 9 states that there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions...&#8221; This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating 
that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected 
cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this 
obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible &#8230;to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an 
end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>696. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted 
in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give 
rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate 
measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71).  
</p>
<p>697. Furthermore, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state 
that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to 
protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by 
adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, 
economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that 
all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to 
enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>698. Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government article 12, paras 2 and 3, of the Declaration which provide that the State shall 
take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action 
as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the </p>

States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of 
violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and

</p>
<p>699. We therefore, urge your Government to take all necessary measures to ensure the

Cecilo Pelito Lucero. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to 
prevent the recurrence of these acts.

<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> In the morning of 23 November 2009, a convoy of supporters of Mr. Esmael 
Mangundadatu, the vice-mayor of Buluan town in Maguindanao province, was 
travelling on the road to Shariff Aguak, one of the main towns of Maguindanao, on 
the way to an electoral office to register Esmael Mangundadatu as a candidate in the 
elections for governor of Maguindanao province next year. The convoy, which did 
not include the candidate himself, was led by his wife and formed of local 
politicians, lawyers and journalists.  
</p>
<p> At around 9 a.m., in a rural area near the villages of Salman and Malating, the 
convoy was abducted by a group of more than 100 gunmen, suspected to be 
members of a militia at the services of the family of the Governor of Maguindanao 
province. Some reports indicate that among the abductors there were members of the 
police and of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The gunmen took the entire 
convoy to a location around ten kilometres from the main road, where they killed at 
least 57 persons, including 24 women (the reports we have received do not indicate 
clearly how many survivors there were). Some reports indicate that the abductors 
tortured the victims before executing them, including subjecting the female victims 
to sexual violence. The bodies were buried in mass graves on a hilltop in Sitio 
Masalay, Barangay Salman, in Ampatuan, Maguindanao province. 
</p>
<p> The victims include the wife of Esmael Mangundadatu, Genalyn, and two of 
his sisters, Eden and Farida Sabdula. There are also at least two lawyers among the 
victims, Concepcion Brizuela and Cynthia Oquendo.

<p> One of the journalists who survived the attack had allegedly been receiving 
threats to his life since 2004. The threats reportedly began after he wrote a 
newspaper article which exposed details of summary executions in Maguindanao 
that were allegedly linked to the family of the Governor of the Province. He 
allegedly received information of a plot to kill him, involving policemen, and 
attempts were made on his life. However, no investigation into his allegations was 
undertaken and he was not offered any protection by the authorities.  
</p>
<p> On 27 November 2009, Andal Ampatuan Jr, mayor of the town Datu Unsay 
and son of the Governor of Maguindanao Province, was arrested as a suspect. 
Reports indicate that his father, Andal Ampatuan Sr, who is currently serving his 
third term as Governor, had been grooming Andal Ampatuan Jr to succeed him in 
office as a result of the 2010 elections.

<p> The National Police Director has suspended from or relieved of their 
positions several of the commanding officers of the police in Maguindanao 
province, while other members of Maguindanao police have been arrested. The 
Armed Forces of the Philippines have announced that the Ampatuan family&#8217;s private 
militia will be disbanded.  
</p>
<p> The Acting Secretary of Justice in your Excellency&#8217;s Government has 
announced that prosecutors are processing the admission to the witness protection 
program of 20 or more witnesses to the killings.  
</p>
<p>Without prejudging the accuracy of these reports, we would like to welcome the 
initial steps taken by your Government to bring those responsible for the killings to 
justice.  
</p>
<p> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to 
which the Philippines is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life 
and security of the person (article 6) and the right to physical and mental integrity 
(article 7). In Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council 
reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into 
all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council 
added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice 
those responsible &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of 
such executions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>704. While the reports summarized above indicate that holders of public office are 
suspected of being responsible for the killings and that members of the police or the armed 
forces might have been among the perpetrators, we would primarily like to draw the 
attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to its due diligence obligations under 
international law. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions noted in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including 
murder, can also give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to 
take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) The same principle was set forth by the Human Rights 
Committee with regard to torture: &#8220;It is the duty of the State party to afford everyone 
protection through legislative and other measures as may be necessary against the acts 
prohibited by article 7 [of the Covenant, i.e. torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment or punishment], whether inflicted by people acting in their official capacity, 
outside their official capacity or in a private capacity.&#8221; (paragraph 2 of General Comment 
No. 20, adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>222  
</b></p>
<p>705. We note in this respect reports indicating that national and local elections in the 
Philippines have, in recent years, always been accompanied by a considerable number of 
killings related to the election campaigns. Reports we have reviewed state that, in 2007, 100 
persons were killed from the beginning of the election campaign in January to 9 May 2007. 
53 of them were candidates. According to information we have received, 189 persons were 
killed and 279 wounded in violence related to the 2004 elections for President of the 
Philippines.  The campaign for the 2001 elections for Congress and local offices saw 98 
persons killed, the 1998 elections 77, the 1995 elections 108, the 1992 elections 89, the 
1988 local elections 188, and the 1986 presidential elections 153. Reports state that only 
very few of these more than 1,000 killings were successfully investigated and prosecuted. 
This pattern of lethal violence and impunity makes it all the more urgent for your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to expeditiously bring to justice those responsible and to prevent 
the recurrence of such executions. 
</p>
<p>706. We also note that the killing of 30 journalists on 23 November 2009 took place 
against a more general background in which &#8220;journalists are killed with increasing 
frequency&#8221; and their killers enjoy &#8220;a lamentable degree of impunity&#8221;, as the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions stated in the report on his 
visit to the Philippines (A/HRC/8/3/Add.2, para.38). 
</p>
<p>707. In this regard, we recall that taking effective measures to protect journalists and to 
prosecute those responsible of killings or death threats against them is a precondition to 
ensuring the right to freedom of opinion and expression as set forth in article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>708. We would also like to bring the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
General Comment No. 25 adopted by the Human Rights Committee on the right to 
participate in public affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access to public service, 
which stresses that freedom of expression, assembly and association are essential 
conditions for the effective exercise of the right to vote and must be fully protected 
(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7, para.12).  
</p>
<p>709. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case and the statistics 
regarding killings during previous election campaigns accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the 
killings on 23 November 2009, and, in due course, the results of any prosecutions 
undertaken. Insofar as compatible with the needs of their protection, please describe 
the measures taken to ensure that witnesses and family members of the victims are 
not subject to any intimidation or retaliation. 
</p>
<p>3. With respect to the private militia of the family of the Governor of 
Maguindanao Province, which the Armed Forces of the Philippines have reportedly 
announced would be disbanded, please explain the legal status of that militia and the 
measures adopted by the competent authorities in its regard, both before 23 
November 2009 and thereafter. Please describe the relationship between the </p>

prevent further killings in the course of the 2010 local and national election 
campaigns.

<p><b>  Government Actions on the Maguindanao Massacre 
</b></p>
<p>710. On November 24, 2009, Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo 
declared a state of emergency in the provinces of Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat and 
Cotabato City through Proclamation Order No. 1946. PGMA also ordered the Philippine 
National Police (PNP), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the National Bureau of 
Investigation (NBI) to investigate the incident. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) 
has also been asked to join in the inquiry to ensure transparency and impartiality. 
</p>
<p><b>  Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 
</b></p>
<p>711. In compliance with the President&#8217;s orders, Acting Military Chief of Staff Maclang, 
directed the establishment of checkpoints and chokepoints and the deployment of troops 
from the 601st Infantry Brigade to the crime scene. The AFP also helped in the exhumation 
of the bodies in the grave sites. 
</p>
<p>712. The AFP has taken over the provincial capitol of Maguindanao and the municipal 
halls of Shariff Aguak and Ampatuan towns to prevent possible escalation of violence. On 
November 26, 2009, at least 600 troops deployed about 4:30 in the morning to the 
provincial capitol and municipal halls disarmed all detailed forces there, mostly members of 
the CAFGU. Two high ranking military officials were relieved as part of the investigation 
on the alleged involvement of government troops in the massacre. They are MGen. Alfedo 
Cayton, the 6th ID Chief and Col. Medardo Geslani, 601st IB.  
</p>
<p>713. On December 3, 2009, the AFP deployed more troops in Shariff Aguak town to 
guard the members of the Ampatuan clan, whose members are said to be under threat, and 
to secure the peace and order in the province. The deployment of the 33rd IB from Lanao 
Del Sur is part of the preparations for the service of warrants against members of the 
Ampatuan family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Department of Justice (DOJ) 
</b></p>
<p>714. Justice Secretary Agnes VST Devanadera ordered the National Bureau of 
Investigation (NBI) to conduct its own investigation into the massacre. She created a 
special panel of prosecutors that would handle cases arising from the investigation. She also 
ordered prosecutors in the area and nearby provinces to coordinate with the families of 
victims and the law enforcement agencies for the prosecution of those responsible in the 
incident.  
</p>
<p>715. On November 26, 2009, Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. was subjected to an 
inquest held at the General Santos Airport. The inquest was presided by Secretary 
Devanadera together with Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuno.  
</p>
<p>716. On December 1, 2009, Andal Ampatuan Jr. was charged with Twenty Five (25)

incident following an order issued by the Secretary of Justice. After the first inquest last 
Thursday, Nov 26, Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr was brought to Manila and he is currently 
detained at the NBI Headquarters. The forensic experts of the NBI have conducted autopsy 
on the bodies of the victims for a total of 20. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bureau of Immigration (BI)

</p>
<p><b>  Summary report of the Department of Justice on the Muguindanao massacre  
</b></p>
<p>729. When the Manguindanao incident happened on 23 November 2009, Her Excellency 
Gloria Macapangal-Arroyo mobilized the different agencies/offices of the government to 
ensure that an immediate and proficient investigation of the case will be completed.  
</p>
<p>730. On the part of the Department of Justice, the Secretary of Justice immediately 
ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct its own investigations of the 
massacre. NBI experts were sent to the crime scene. The forensic experts of the NBI have 
conducted autopsy on the bodies of the victims. 
</p>
<p>731. A few hours after the incident, Task Force 211 (TF211) immediately communicated 
with the lawyers of the Mungudadatus to get their cooperation in gathering witnesses for 
the crime. Undersecretary Ricardo R. Blancaflor, Chairman of the TF211, conferred with 
the lawyer of the Mungudadatus, who promised to obtain the cooperation of the eye 
witnesses and other relevant witnesses. The following day, TF211 coordinated with the 
Philippines National Police (PNP), Scene of the Crime Operatives (SOCO) units and

<p><b> Allegation letter dated 25 June 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>745. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning Ms. Aza Gazgireyeva, late deputy head of the 
Supreme Court of the Republic of Ingushetia. 
</p>
<p> On 10 June 2009, Ms. Aza Gazgireyeva was shot dead in the town of Nazran 
while taking her children to school.  
</p>
<p> It is reported that the killing of Ms. Gazgireyeva may be linked to her 
peaceful activities in defence of human rights, i.e. her professional activities as a 
judge. Ms. Gazgireyeva, who has worked for 25 years as a judge, was member of a 
panel examining civil and criminal cases at the Supreme Court. While she did not 
handle criminal cases involving illegal armed forces herself, she examined related 
appeals and made some procedural decisions in that regard. She was also involved in 
cases related to corruption. Reports indicate that Ms. Gazgireyeva&#8217;s had received 
threats before. 
</p>
<p> In April 2008, Ms. Gazgireyeva&#8217;s predecessor, Khasan Yandiyev, who 
handled cases of large-scale corruption, was shot and killed.  
</p>
<p> Information received indicates that an investigation has been commenced by 
the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>746. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we do express 
our concern that the killing of Ms. Gazgireyeva may be linked to her professional activities 
as a judge and points to insufficient guarantees and preventive measures to ensure the 
security of judges in the Republic of Ingushetia.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>228  
</b></p>
<p>747. As the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers indicated in 
his most recent report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/11/41, para. 78), the security 
of judges is a subject too often neglected in the face of multiple and multifaceted attacks 
against members of the judiciary in a number of countries. The Human Rights Committee, 
in paragraph 19 of its General Comment No. 32, stated that it is necessary to protect judges 
against conflicts of interest and intimidation. To this end, the security of judges should be 
adequately guaranteed by law, as it is also enshrined in the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary.   
</p>
<p>748. Pointing to the killing of Ms. Gazgireyeva&#8217;s predecessor, Khasan Yandiyev, which 
occurred in April 2008, the Special Rapporteur recommended in his mission report to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to consider the adoption of preventive security measures for 
increased protection of judges (report on his mission to the Russian Federation, 
A/HRC/11/41/Add.2, para. 83 and 99). This was also reiterated in his most recent thematic 
report where he said that special attention be paid to adopting preventive security measures 
for judges handling cases of large-scale corruption, organized crime, terrorism, crimes 
against humanity, or any other cases exposing them to higher risk (A/HRC/11/41, para. 99). 
</p>
<p>749. In this report, the Special Rapporteur also pointed to Recommendation No. R (94) 
12, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, to which the Russian 
Federation is a member. The recommendation gives specific examples of security measures, 
such as providing for security guards on court premises or police protection for judges who 
may become or are victims of serious threats.  
</p>
<p>750. Furthermore, as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions noted in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including 
murder, can also give rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to 
take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council 
reiterates that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that 
this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, 
to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>230  
</b></p>
<p>755. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning the killing of Ms Natalia Estemirova. Ms 
Estemirova was a prominent human rights defender and researcher working with the 
Russian NGO Memorial. Ms Natalia Estemirova received several prizes for her outstanding 
work, including the &#8220;Right to Life&#8221; award from the Swedish Parliament; the Robert 
Schuman Medal of the European Parliament and the Anna Politkovskaya prize.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On the morning of 15 July 2009, Ms Natalia Estemirova was kidnapped in 
front of her house in Grozny. According to eyewitness reports, Ms Estemirova was 
dragged into a white vehicle and driven away by unknown individuals. 
</p>
<p> Her body was later found in the woods near the city of Nazran, in Ingushetia. 
She had sustained two gunshots to her head and chest. 
</p>
<p> We wish to express our concern that the kidnapping and subsequent murder 
of Ms Natalia Estemirova may be directly related to her activities in the defense of 
human rights, in particular her fact-finding carried out into human rights abuses, 
such as summary executions, enforced disappearances and torture committed in the 
Chechen Republic. We acknowledge the expressions of outrage and assurances by 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government that all necessary steps will be taken to apprehend 
and punish Mrs. Estemirova&#8217;s killers. However, we remain concerned that the 
killing of Ms Natalia Estemirova forms part of a pattern of similar cases, including 
the murder of Ms Anna Politkovskaya, Mr Stanislav Markelov and Ms Anastasia 
Baburova, which, coupled with the prevailing impunity, has the potential of gravely 
stifling independent human rights work and freedom of expression in the country.  
</p>
<p>756. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p>757. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted 
in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give 
rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate 
measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council reiterates that all States have &#8220;to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this obligation includes the 
obligation &#8220;to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to bring and end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions as stated in the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions&#8221;. In particular, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to principles 4 which obliges Governments to guarantee effective protection through 
judicial or other means to individuals and groups who are in danger of extra-legal, arbitrary 
or summary executions. 
</p>
<p>758. In this connection, we would also like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 
its duty under article 2 paragraph 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights to conduct independent and impartial investigations into serious human rights 
violations and to ensure that effective domestic remedies be made available in this regard. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>231 
</b></p>
<p>759. Furthermore, we would like to recall article 4 (c &amp; d) of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility 
of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national 
legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. 
</p>
<p>760. We would also like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that 
&#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive 
for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national 
and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, 
promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting 
such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, 
political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons

</p>
<p>761. We would also like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or 
individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>762. On the basis of the above, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to 
prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>763. We also request the Russian Federation to extend an invitation to us, in order to 
enable those Special Procedures mandate holders who have requested invitations to conduct 
country visits with a view to making independent and impartial assessments of the human 
rights situation in Russia, including Chechnya and other Republics of Northern Caucasus, 
and to assisting the authorities in their endeavours to bring the perpetrators of human rights 
violations to justice.  
</p>
<p>764. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human

</p>
<p>768. The preliminary investigation established that on 15 July 2009, Ms. Estemirova, a

<p>777. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received in relation to the killing of Mr. Abdulmalik Akhmedilov, 
newspaper editor of Hakikat (the Truth) and Sogratl.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 11 August 2009 at around 13:00, Mr. Akhmedilov was found dead in his 
car near Dagestan&#8217;s capital, Makhachkala, with bullet wounds to the stomach. 
Although the details surrounding the killing are still unclear, reports suggest that Mr. 
Akhmedilov&#8217;s murder was linked to his work as a journalist. As deputy-editor of the 
Avar-language weekly Hakikat, Mr. Akhmedilov was known for his critical 
reporting on attempts by the local and federal authorities to suppress political and 
religious &#8220;extremism&#8221;, as well as his investigative articles about the unsolved 
assassinations of high-ranking officials in Dagestan. Reports claim that on the day of 
his murder, Mr. Akhmedilov took his car to a local shop to buy an item for his wife. 
A suspicious vehicle without a number plate was allegedly seen driving in the area 
prior to the shooting.  
</p>
<p> Concern is expressed that Mr. Akhmedilov may have been targeted as a result 
of exercising his right to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern is 
expressed regarding the safety of journalists in the Russian Federation and Dagestan 
in particular. Most recently, the killings of two journalists from Dagestan, Mr. 
Gadzhi Abashilov and Mr. Ilyas Shurpayev, were the subject of an allegation letter 
sent to your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 3 April 2008. We appreciate the response 
from your Excellency&#8217;s Government received on 30 April 2008, but we would like 
to seek further clarification regarding concrete measures taken to ensure the physical 
and psychological integrity of journalists. 
</p>
<p>778. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we  deem it 
appropriate to make reference to Resolution 2005/38 of the Commission on Human Rights 
which calls upon states to ensure that victims of violations of the right to freedom of 
expression have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of violence, 
including terrorist acts, against journalists, including in situations of armed conflict, and to 
bring to justice those responsible to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>779. The Special Rapporteur would like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
take all necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in 
accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>780. We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression are respected and that accountability of any person 
guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopts 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

Generation, and ordered Ms. Sadulayeva and Mr. Dzhabrailov to accompany them. 
Shortly afterwards, the men returned to the offices and took  Mr. Dzhabrailov&#180;s 
mobile phone and his car.  
</p>
<p> On 11 August 2009, at approximately 4 a.m., the bodies of Ms. Sadulayeva 
and her husband, Mr. Dzhabrailov, were discovered in the boot of a car on Mansurov 
Street, near Grozny. They had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest.  
</p>
<p> An investigation into the murder has reportedly been opened.  
</p>
<p> Grave concern is expressed that the assassination of Ms. Sadulayeva and her 
husband Mr. Dzhabrailov are directly related to the work Ms. Sadulayeva carried out 
in defense of human rights. Further concern is reiterated that these murders are part 
of an ongoing pattern of attacks and intimidation of human rights defenders in the 
country. These murders are the latest in a series of attacks on human rights 
defenders, journalists and lawyers in Chechnya which have a seriously intimidating 
and detrimental effect on the work of human rights defenders in the country. Just 
over a month ago, Ms. Natalia Estemirova, a member of the non-governmental 
organization Memorial was abducted and murdered. Over the last twelve months, 
human rights defenders Ms. Anna Politkovskaya, Mr. Stanislav Markelov and Ms. 
Anastasia Baburova were also assassinated. 
</p>
<p>790. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under 
international law to this case. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;) provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, 
that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p>791. As the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted 
in a report to the Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;crimes, including murder, can also give 
rise to State responsibility in instances in which the State has failed to take all appropriate 
measures to deter, prevent and punish the perpetrators.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) In 
Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), the Human Rights Council reiterates that all States have &#8220;to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this obligation includes the 
obligation &#8220;to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order 
to bring and end to impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions as stated in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>237 
</b></p>
<p>Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions&#8221;. In particular, we would like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to principle 4 which obliges Governments to guarantee effective protection through judicial 
or other means to individuals and groups who are in danger of extra-legal, arbitrary or 
summary executions. 
</p>
<p>792. We would also like to refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental 
principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that 
&#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive 
for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by 
adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, 
economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that 
all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to 
enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>793. Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government the following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 5, points b) and c) which provide that for the purpose of promoting and 
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right to form, 
join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups, and 
to communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, point a) which provides that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as 
to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or 
administrative systems. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in 
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other 
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or 
individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>794. We would further like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that 
&#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>238  
</b></p>
<p>seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>795. We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that 
accountability of any person guilty of the killings of Ms. Sadulayeva and Mr. Dzhabrailov 
is ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>796. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Has a complaint been lodged on behalf of Ms. Sadulayeva and Mr. 
Dzhabrailov?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examination and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>4.  In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been or will be undertaken. Have or will 
penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been/be imposed on the alleged 
perpetrators?

(translated from Russian) 
</b></p>
<p>797. Information from the Russian Federation in connection with the joint inquiry from 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of the United 
Nations Human Rights Council regarding the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Z.A. 
Sadulayeva and A.L. Dzhabrailov 
</p>
<p>798. Reference: AL G/SO 214 (67-17) G/SO 214 (107-9) G/SO 214 (53-24) RUS

</p>
<p>799. On 10 August 2009, a local resident, L.K. Dzhabrailov, contacted the Lenin district 
duty section of the Department of Internal Affairs in Grozny and reported that at 2 p.m. his 
son A.L. Dzhabrailov and his daughter-in-law Z.A. Sadulayeva had been abducted from the 
office of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) (86, Mayakovsky Road, Grozny) 
by five unknown persons armed with automatic firearms. 
</p>
<p>800. The unknown persons drove the couple away in a VAZ 2110, but one of the 
assailants drove off in A.L. Dzhabrailov&#8217;s VAZ 2107, which was parked near the office. 
</p>
<p>801. On 11 August 2009, the Lenin inter-district investigative section of the Grozny 
investigative department of the Investigative Committee attached to the Procurator&#8217;s Office 
of the Russian Federation responsible for the Chechen Republic instituted criminal 
proceedings in connection with this incident on the basis of the crime defined in article 126, 
paragraph 2 (a) and (g) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>239 
</b></p>
<p>802. On the same day, when the car was examined at the entrance to the grounds of the 
Republic&#8217;s rehabilitation centre in Grozny, the corpses of Z.A. Sadulayeva and A.L. 
Dzhabrailov were found displaying signs of a violent death from gunshot wounds. 
</p>
<p>803. In connection therewith the Zavodsk inter-district investigative section of the 
Grozny investigative department of the Investigative Committee attached to the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Russian Federation responsible for the Chechen Republic 
instituted criminal proceedings on the grounds of the crimes defined in article 105, 
paragraph 2 (a) and (g) and article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>804. On 12 August 2009 the above-mentioned criminal cases were joined and referred for 
further investigation to the department for the investigation of especially important cases of 
the investigative department of the Investigative Committee attached to the Procurator&#8217;s 
Office of the Russian Federation responsible for the Chechen Republic. 
</p>
<p>805. The investigation established that A.L. Dzhabrailov had previously belonged to an 
illegal armed gang and that in 2006 he had been sentenced to four years&#8217; imprisonment for 
membership of an illegal armed gang and for unlawful possession of firearms. He had been 
released early on 8 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>806. Given whom the victims were and the circumstances of the crime, the investigation 
is working on various leads. The version that the killing of A.L. Dzhabrailov and Z.A. 
Sadulayeva was linked to her recent professional activity has, however, been deemed 
improbable insofar as the organization which she headed was a charity that operated in 
accordance with its rules and political issues were not part of its remit. The version 
connected with A.L. Dzhabrailov&#8217;s past (the crime was committed by unknown persons out 
of revenge) is more probable. 
</p>
<p>807. The requisite investigations and inquiries are being conducted in order to establish 
who committed this crime.

</p>
<p>808. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding Mr Muhammad Basheer al-
Ramaly. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly was recently sentenced to death by 
beheading, and subsequent crucifixion of his body, by the General Court of Hail, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>240  
</b></p>
<p>after he was convicted of the kidnapping and rape of four people in February 2009. 
The Court of Cassation is currently reviewing his sentence. 
</p>
<p> According to reports, Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly did not enjoy a fair 
trial, nor did he have access to a lawyer. It is further reported that he is mentally ill. 
</p>
<p> Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly is currently detained in Hail prison. 
</p>
<p>809. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer your Excellency's Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. Articles 3 and 6 of these instruments, respectively, provide 
that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be 
protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  
</p>
<p>810. We would also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights, in particular its articles 10 and 11, which provide for the 
right to a fair trial, including the right to legal assistance and prohibit the retroactive 
creation of criminal offences. 
</p>
<p>811. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
attention to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United 
Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in particular:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 5. Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by 
the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 7. Governments shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, 
with or without criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any 
case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.  
</p>
<p>812. These principles are further stated in the Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the 
Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, Economic and Social Council resolution 
1989/64 of 24 May 1989. In particular, paragraph 1(a) recommends that States afford 
special protection to persons facing charges for which the death penalty is provided, 
allowing time and facilities for the preparation of their defence. Paragraphs 4 to 8 of 
Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, 
Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984 further provide that 
capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based 
upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the 
facts, that it may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent 
court after a legal process which provides all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, 
including the right to adequate legal assistance at all stages, the right to appeal and to seek 
pardon or commutation of sentence. 
</p>
<p>813. With regard to the mental health of Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly, we would 
also like to refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the following norms and principles:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death 
Penalty, Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984.  In 
particular, paragraph 3 provides that the death penalty shall not be carried out on 
persons who have become insane. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death 
Penalty, Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/64 of 24 May 1989.  In 
particular, paragraph 1(d) recommends that States further strengthen the protection 
of the rights of those facing the death penalty, eliminating the death penalty for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>241 
</b></p>
<p>persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, 
whether at the stage of sentence or execution. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, General Assembly 
resolution 2865 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971.   In particular, article 6 provides that, 
if prosecuted for any offence, a mentally retarded person shall have the right to due 
process of law with recognition of their degree of mental responsibility. 
</p>
<p>814. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a 
summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights and 
freedoms under international law of Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly are fully respected. 
Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death 
penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>815. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Mr Muhammad 
Basheer al-Ramaly in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>816. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the legal basis for his death sentence and how these measures 
are compatible with international human rights norms and standards as contained, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration for Human Rights and the Basic Principles on 
the Role of Lawyers.  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide details regarding the trials of Mr Muhammad Basheer al-
Ramaly, including responses to the following: what are the offences charged; how 
many hearings took place and on what dates; were the hearings open to the public; 
was he assisted by legal counsel, if so, at what stages of the proceedings? 
</p>
<p>4. Has the family of Mr Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly,been informed of his 
current place of detention and of his procedural position? Have family members 
been allowed to visit him?

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 23 November 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the   
independence of judges and lawyers.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>242  
</b></p>
<p>817. In this connection, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government information we have received regarding the allegedly imminent execution of 
Mr. Ali Agirdas, aged 29, of Turkish nationality. 
</p>
<p> According to information received 
</p>
<p> Mr Ali Agirdas was arrested in Riyadh on 24 February 2007, for drug 
smuggling. He was convicted and sentenced to death on 18 June 2008, by a General 
Court in Riyadh. The sentence was upheld on appeal and his case is now being 
considered by the Supreme Judicial Council.  
</p>
<p> Mr Agirdas speaks limited Arabic, however during interrogation he was not 
provided with an interpreter and it is alleged that the interrogator presented him with 
a document which he said would help him in his case but it was, allegedly, a written 
confession.  During his trial, Mr Agirdas was informed by the presiding judge that 
he had signed a confession in Arabic which stated that at the time of arrest, he knew 
that he was carrying drugs. He was convicted on the basis on this confession. During 
his trial Mr Agirdas was not represented by counsel but was provided with an 
interpreter. On appeal he was represented by counsel. He is currently being held at 
Al-Hair prison in the capital city of Riyadh.  
</p>
<p> We are further informed that in Saudi Arabia prisoners are executed without 
prior notification to them or their families.  
</p>
<p>818. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to the present case under international law. 
</p>
<p>819. With regard to the imposition of the death penalty on charges of drug smuggling we 
would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death penalty is not 
prohibited by provisions of international law enshrining the right to life, such as Article 3 of 
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). This would exclude charges of drug smuggling 
from those for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law.  
</p>
<p>820. We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment 
cases the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an 
independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights) admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, the right to a fair trial includes 
the right to be assisted by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. In this respect, we 
would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on the Role 
of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in 
particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a 
lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>821. In relation to the allegation that Mr Agirdas did not have an interpreter during 
interrogation and that he subsequently signed a confession that became the basis of his 
conviction, we would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on 
the Independence of the Judiciary, adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>243 
</b></p>
<p>September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 
1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985 in particular principle 6 which provides that the 
principle of the independence of the judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary to ensure 
that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected. 
Further the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, adopted by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 
August to 7 September 1990, and in particular principle 16 which provides &#8220;When 
prosecutors come into possession of evidence against suspects that they know or believe on 
reasonable grounds was obtained through recourse to unlawful methods, which constitute a 
grave violation of the suspect's human rights, especially involving torture or cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, or other abuses of human rights, they shall refuse to 
use such evidence against anyone other than those who used such methods, or inform the 
Court accordingly, and shall take all necessary steps to ensure that those responsible for 
using such methods are brought to justice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>822. With regard to lack of prior notification in implementing the death penalty, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions stated in a report to 
the Human Rights Council on Transparency and the imposition of the death penalty that 
&#8220;There is no justification for post-conviction secrecy, and [&#8230;] a lack of transparency both 
undermines due process rights and constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment. Persons sentenced to death, their families, and their lawyers should be 
provided with timely and reliable information on the procedures and timing of appeals, 
clemency petitions, and executions.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 37). He further 
indicated that &#8220;[r]efusing to provide convicted persons and family members advance notice 
of the date and time of execution is a clear human rights violation.&#8221; (para. 32). 
</p>
<p>823. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a 
summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under 
international law of Mr Ali Agirdas are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature 
of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all 
concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>824. Finally we would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of a previous 
communication dated 28 January 2009, regarding the cases of 16 Iraqi men allegedly at risk 
of execution, to which we are yet to receive a reply. Concerns had been raised in that 
communication that the accused had reportedly been sentenced to death following trials in 
which they did not enjoy the fundamental fair trial guarantees, such as access to a lawyer, 
and statements extorted under torture were allegedly used against them. 
</p>
<p>825. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged above accurate?  If not so, please provide all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy.  
</p>
<p>2. Please indicate whether Mr Agirdas was given the option of choosing counsel 
and please explain the steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that 
his due process rights continue to be protected.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Saudi Arabia has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been 
given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 6 January 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers.  
</p>
<p>826. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding We have the honour to address you 
in our capacities as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers &#8230; .  
</p>
<p>827. We would like to draw the attention of your Government to information we have 
received regarding several cases of persons sentenced to death on charges of witchcraft or 
charlatanism.  
</p>
<p> According to the information we have received: 
</p>
<p> Mr. Ali Sibat is a citizen of Lebanon and father of five children. On 7 May 
2008, while he was on a pilgrimage in Medina, agents of the Mutawa&#8217;een (religious 
police) arrested Mr. Sibat in his hotel room. It would appear that the arrest was 
related to the circumstance that Mr. Sibat had in the past presented a TV show on the 
Lebanese satellite station Sheherazade, where he gave advice and predictions about 
the future. In detention, Mr. Sibat was asked to write down what he did for a living 
in Lebanon. This document was then presented to first instance criminal court in 
Medina as Mr. Sibat&#8217;s confession to charges of witchcraft. At no time during pre-
trail detention or at trial was Mr. Sibat assisted by a lawyer. On 9 November 2009, 
the first instance criminal court in Medina found Mr. Sibat guilty of witchcraft and 
sentenced him to death. It would appear that appeals proceedings in his case are still 
pending. 
</p>
<p> The trial of Mr. Sibat is not an isolated case. On 15 November 2009, the trial 
of a citizen of Saudi Arabia (his name was not reported to us) on charges of sorcery 
started before a court in Jeddah. The man is accused of having smuggled a book on 
witchcraft into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is alleged to have confessed to the 
charges of witchcraft. The outcome of the trial is not yet known to us. 
</p>
<p> In a less recent case, a female Saudi citizen, Ms. <b>Fawza Falih</b>, was sentenced 
to death by beheading on charges of witchcraft. The religious police arrested her on 
4 May 2005, repeatedly beat her in detention so that she had to be hospitalized, and 
forced her to sign by finger print a confession which she, being illiterate, could not 
read. Among her accusers was a man who alleged that she had rendered him 
impotent by means of witchcraft. In a second incident imputed to her, a divorced 
woman reportedly returned to her husband at the time predicted by Ms. Falih.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>245 
</b></p>
<p> During the pre-trial phase, Ms. Fawza Falih was denied access by the legal 
counsel hired by her family and was not brought before any judicial body. She was 
not allowed to attend most of the sessions in her trial and specifically excluded from 
the trial sessions in which witnesses against her testified. A relative who had been 
acting as her representative was also excluded from the trial. At trial, Ms. Fawza 
Falih informed the judges of the ill-treatment she had been subjected to and retracted 
her confession. She was nonetheless sentenced to death by the first instance court. 
An appeals court quashed the death sentence for witchcraft as a hadd (offence 
against God), which carries a mandatory death sentence, on the ground that this 
conviction could not be upheld in the absence of a confession. On 6 June 2007, 
however, the first instance court sentenced her to death again, qualifying the offence 
not as a hadd, but as an offence against the public interest. Ms. Falih is detained 
awaiting execution in Quraiyat prison. 
</p>
<p> Persons suspected of and initially charged with sorcery are sometimes tried 
on charges of apostasy, which also carries the death sentence. As we indicated in a 
communication to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 18 November 2008, to which 
regrettably no reply was received to date, Mr.<b> Mustafa Ibrahim</b>, a citizen of Egypt, 
was arrested in May 2007 in Arar, where he worked as a pharmacist. The charges 
against him appear to include that he separated a married couple through sorcery and 
that he committed apostasy by degrading a copy of the Qur&#8217;an. It is not known when 
his trial took place, whether he was assisted by a lawyer, whether he appealed 
against his first instance sentence. On 2 November 2007, Mustafa Ibrahim was 
executed in Riyadh. According to the announcement of the execution by the 
Ministry of the Interior, he was convicted of practicing sorcery and witchcraft.  
</p>
<p>In July 2009, a <b>man known as &#8220;the magician of female TV presenters</b>&#8221; (his real 
name is not known to us) was tried in a court in Hail on charges related to alleged 
sorcery. Members of the Mutawa&#8217;een had raided his dwelling on 22 February 2009 
and found it covered in some 100,000 words of graffiti, including names of TV 
presenters and distorted verses from the Qur&#8217;an. Very little is known about his trial, 
but the court reportedly convicted him on apostasy rather than sorcery charges 
because he was considered &#8220;a beginner in the work of sorcery.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>828. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to these cases under international law. 
</p>
<p>829. With regard to the charges of apostasy, sorcery and witchcraft, we would like to 
remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the 
fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most restrictive manner and 
can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the 
most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases 
where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). According to the information we have received, the charges 
brought against Ali Sibat, Fawza Falih, Mustafa Ibrahim and the other persons sentenced to 
death on charges related to accusations of sorcery did not involve any loss of life. 
</p>
<p>830. Moreover, international law requires that &#8220;capital punishment may be imposed only 
for a crime for which the death penalty is prescribed by law at the time of its commission&#8221; 
(Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty approved 
by Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984). We understand that 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not have a written criminal law and that there is no 
binding definition of the offence of witchcraft. The absence of a clear definition of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>246  
</b></p>
<p>offences charged undermines the accused&#8217;s ability to effectively defend him- or herself 
against the charges and makes it exceedingly difficult to assess whether the death penalty 
has in fact been imposed for a crime for which it is prescribed by law. 
</p>
<p>831. We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital punishment 
cases the obligation to provide criminal defendants &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an 
independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; (Article 10 of the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights) admits of no exception. Relevant to the cases at hand, the right to a fair trial 
includes the right to be assisted by legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. In this respect, 
we would also like to refer your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on the 
Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in 
particular Principle 1, which reads: &#8220;All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a 
lawyer of their choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>832. The right to a fair hearing further requires that the defendants not be forced to make 
confessions by violence or the threat of violence, and that the defendant be given the 
opportunity to examine the witnesses against him or her. These guarantees would appear to 
have been violated in some of the cases summarized above, particularly in the case of Ms. 
Falih.  
</p>
<p>833. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law from a summary execution, which 
violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of 
Ali Sibat, Fawza Falih, Mustafa Ibrahim and the other persons sentenced to death on 
charges related to accusations of sorcery are fully respected. This can only mean that the 
death penalty against them is lifted and that they are given the possibility to defend 
themselves (assuming the authorities decide to pursue the charges) in a fair and public trial, 
including with the assistance of legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>834. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the cases accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Is it accurate that there is no binding definition of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;, &#8220;sorcery&#8221; or 
&#8220;charlatanism&#8221; under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? If not so, please 
provide the definition. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide details regarding the trials of Ali Sibat, Fawza Falih, Mustafa 
Ibrahim, the man known as &#8220;the magician of female TV presenters&#8221;, and the man 
tried on charges of sorcery before a court in Jeddah on 15 November 2009: how 
many hearings took place and on what dates; were the hearings open to the public; 
where the defendants present when witnesses against them testified and were they 
allowed to examine those witnesses; were the defendants assisted by legal counsel, if 
so, at what stages of the proceedings? 
</p>
<p>4. How many persons have been sentenced to death on charges of &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;, 
&#8220;sorcery&#8221; or &#8220;charlatanism&#8221; in Saudi Arabia in the course of the last five years? 
How many of those sentenced to death on such charges have been executed? </p>

circonstances ayant provoqu&#233; les faits all&#233;gu&#233;s ci-dessus. Nous aimerions rappeler au 
Gouvernement de votre Excellence les principes fondamentaux applicables &#224; ces cas. 
L&#8217;article 3 de la D&#233;claration universelle des droits de l&#8217;Homme et l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, stipulent que tout individu a le droit &#224; la 
vie et &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de sa personne, que ce droit doit &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; par la loi, et que nul ne peut 
&#234;tre arbitrairement priv&#233; de la vie. En outre, l&#8217;article 7 du Pacte stipule que &#8220;nul ne sera 
soumis &#224; la torture ni &#224; des peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants&#8221;, une </p>

</b></p>
<p>prohibition stipul&#233;e &#233;galement par la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou 
traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants.  
</p>
<p>837. De plus, nous voudrions attirer l&#8217;attention de votre Gouvernement sur le principe 
&#233;tablit en droit international des droits de l&#8217;homme d&#8217;une pr&#233;somption irr&#233;fragable de 
responsabilit&#233; de l&#8217;Etat pour les violations du droit &#224; la vie et le droit &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique 
et morale, survenus dans les cas de d&#233;tention (voir aussi le r&#233;cent rapport du Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur les ex&#233;cutions extrajudiciaires, sommaires ou arbitraires &#224; l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale, 
A/61/311, paragraphe 49 &#224; 54). La raison de cette pr&#233;somption a &#233;t&#233; &#233;nonc&#233;e par le Comit&#233; 
des droits de l&#8217;homme dans l&#8217;affaire Dermit Barbato c. Uruguay (communication no. 
84/1981 du 21/10/1982, paragraphe 9.2). La conclusion du Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8217;homme 
se lisait comme suit : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#171; Le Comit&#233; ne peut se prononcer de fa&#231;on d&#233;finitive sur la question de savoir si 
Hugo Dermit s&#8217;est suicid&#233;, s&#8217;il a &#233;t&#233; pouss&#233; au suicide ou s&#8217;il a &#233;t&#233; tu&#233; par des tiers 
pendant sa d&#233;tention, mais il est oblig&#233; de conclure qu&#8217;en tout &#233;tat de cause, les 
autorit&#233;s uruguayennes sont responsables, soit par action, soit par omission, de 
n&#8217;avoir pas pris les mesures voulues pour prot&#233;ger la vie de l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;, comme le 
paragraphe 1 de l&#8217;article 6 du Pacte leur en fait l&#8217;obligation. &#187;

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Serbia has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>840. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received concerning progress in the investigation of the killing of Mr, 
a very well-known journalist and newspaper editor, ten years ago. On 11 April 1999, two 
masked men approached Slavko &#262;uruvija from behind on the street in front of his home in 
Belgrade and fired 17 bullets into his back and head. A communication of the then Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government seeking information on this case (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1, para 95) has 
regrettably remained without response.  
</p>
<p>841. According to the information we have received, the murder was preceded by 
significant public tension between Slavko &#262;uruvija and the then President of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milo&#353;evi&#263;. At the time, the NATO bombing campaign 
against Serbia in connection with the Kosovo crisis was ongoing. Mr. &#262;uruvija had 
criticized President Milo&#353;evi&#263;&#8217;s policies and called upon him to resign. He reportedly also 
was in open conflict with Mirjana Markovi&#263;, a senior politician and the wife of the 
President.  
</p>
<p> Five weeks before his murder, on 8 March 1999, Mr. &#262;uruvija was sentenced 
to five months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;disturbing the public&#8221; through a text published in 
his daily newspaper, in which he accused President Milo&#353;evi&#263; of repressive policies. 
One week before the murder, Ms. Markovi&#263; reportedly accused Mr. &#262;uruvija of 
being the &#8220;main state enemy who was responsible for NATO&#8217;s bombing campaign,&#8221; 
and concluded that he would be &#8220;tried by the people&#8221; for his betrayal of the national 
cause. Five days before the assassination, on 6 April 1999, a state-owned paper 
published an article calling Slavko &#262;uruvija a traitor who called for, and supported, 
NATO&#8217;s bombing of Serbia. The article announced that his treason would not be 
forgotten. 
</p>
<p> Although the case has been under investigation for ten years, it is alleged that 
nobody has been brought to trial for the murder. Witnesses have reportedly identified 
L.P. (full name on record with us), a criminal gang member who was allegedly also 
working for State Security, as one of the two assassins. He was killed with a gun 
shot in the back of his head in 2000. Another element reportedly revealed in the 
course of criminal investigation into the case was that, in the months leading up to 
his murder, Slavko &#262;uruvija and his spouse had been under round-the-clock 
surveillance conducted by a detachment of 27 members of the State Security service. 
A State Security document detailing his movements on the day of assassination 
reportedly shows that (for reasons that remain to be explained) the surveillance team 
was withdrawn 30 minutes before the assassination was carried out. Several State 
Security officials are suspected by journalists and civil society of involvement in the 
murder, but none of them was ever charged. </p>

<p>842. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to 
highlight the continuing importance, notwithstanding the ten years that have passed since 
April 1999, of fully investigating this murder and ending impunity for those responsible. 
Slavko &#262;uruvija&#8217;s killing was, according to many observers, the highest-profile attack on 
freedom of expression in Serbia&#8217;s recent history. 
</p>
<p>843. The violation of Slavko &#262;uruvija&#8217;s right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his life 
protected by Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights implies a 
duty of the State &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations&#8221; into this suspected 
case of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution (Resolution 8/3 on the &#8220;Mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4)).  
</p>
<p>844. Impunity for the murder of Slavko &#262;uruvija is also of great and ongoing concern 
from the point of view of the right to freedom of expression. Impunity for attacks against 
journalists, particularly in cases where there are elements justifying allegations of State 
involvement in the killing of a journalist, may discourage independent reporting. We would 
therefore appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to bring to 
justice those responsible for the death of Slavko &#262;uruvija.  This would be an important 
measure to strengthen the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. They provide that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>845. The tenth anniversary of the killing of Slavko &#262;uruvija on 11 April 2009, offers an 
opportunity for your Excellency&#8217;s Government to reiterate its commitment to the right to 
life, to the fight against impunity, and to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>846. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your observations on 
the results of the criminal investigations or other inquiries which have been carried out in 
relation to the killing of Slavko &#262;uruvija.

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 5 June 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences.  
</p>
<p>847. We are writing to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information we have received regarding the death sentence issued in two cases, respectively 
against Ms. <b>Ifraah Ali Aden</b>, who is reportedly pregnant and incarcerated in Bossaso </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>251 
</b></p>
<p>central prison, and against Messrs. <b>Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud</b> and <b>Bashir Mohamed 
Isse</b>. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> The Court of First Instance in the City of Bossaso sentenced Ms. Ifraah Ali 
Aden to death on 27 April 2009, for the murder of Ms. Suad Mohamed Aware, 
another of her husband&#8217;s wives. The victim was the daughter of the President of that 
same court. However, he did not sit on the bench during the trial. Ms. Aden is 
reported to be four or five months pregnant.  
</p>
<p> Ms. Aden was sentenced to death within 24 hours after the alleged killing and 
did not have the necessary time to consult with a lawyer and prepare her defence. In 
this regard, it is unclear whether Ms. Aden had access to adequate legal 
representation.  Ms. Aden&#8217;s relatives report that she may have acted in self-defence. 
</p>
<p> Messrs. Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud and Bashir Mohamed Isse were 
sentenced to death on 29 April 2009 by a temporary Islamic Shari&#8217;a Court 
appointed, by virtue of decree No: MW/DPS/27/09 dated 28/04/09 of the President 
of Puntland, State of Somalia, to hear and reach a verdict on the case that caused the 
death of the Governor of Karkar Yasin Said Hussein and the injury of Mohamud 
Abdi Mohamed that took place in Dudhub village in Karkar Region on 26/04/09. As 
such, the Islamic Shari&#8217;a Court is not part of the ordinary judicial structure of 
Somalia. In addition, two of the persons appointed were not judges, but religious 
scholars.  
</p>
<p> Messrs Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud and Bashir Mohamed Isse were only 
appointed a lawyer during the hearing and did not allegedly have enough time to 
consult with him. 
</p>
<p> In its sentence, the court only referred to the possibility that &#8220;The President 
has the right to alleviate the death sentence to imprisonment and thereafter the heirs 
have the right to present their request for compensation.&#8221; It did not, however, inform 
the accused of their right to appeal.  
</p>
<p>848. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p>849. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious criminal provisions indicates that a death sentence can 
only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which 
resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Based on the reports we have received 
about Ms. Aden&#8217;s case, in which there are claims that she may have acted in self-defence 
(claims that are unlikely to have been adequately explored in the 24 hours between the 
alleged killing and the imposition of the death sentence), there is reason to believe she may 
not have acted with the requisite intent.  
</p>
<p>850. We would further remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that under Articles 6 and 
14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Somalia 
is a party, death sentences may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by 
a competent, independent and impartial court, established by the law, in accordance with 
the requirements of due process.  Due process requirements include, at a minimum, the 
accused&#8217;s right: to be informed of the charges; to be given adequate time and facilities for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>252  
</b></p>
<p>the preparation of a defence; to be assisted by legal counsel of her own choosing; and, to 
obtain review of any conviction and sentence by a higher court.  Effective exercise of the 
right to an appeal also requires that the defendant be provided with legal counsel and time 
to prepare adequately for the appeal.  The right to be assisted by a legal counsel is also set 
forth in the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 
August to 7 September 1990, in particular: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Principle 1: 1. All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their 
choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Principle 5: Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by 
the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>851. We would also like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles 
on the Independence of the Judiciary, Adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on 
the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 
September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 
1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985. In particular principles 2, 5, 6 and 10 which 
prescribe that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and 
in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, 
inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter 
or for any reason. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Everyone shall have the right to be tried by ordinary courts or tribunals using 
established legal procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established 
procedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction 
belonging to the ordinary courts or judicial tribunals. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The principle of the independence of the judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary 
to ensure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly and that the rights of the 
parties are respected.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Persons selected for judicial office shall be individuals of integrity and ability with 
appropriate training or qualification in law. Any method of judicial selection shall 
safeguard against judicial appointments for improper motives. (&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>852. The reports we have received indicate that Ms. Aden was not afforded any of the 
rights mentioned above. Moreover, it appears that she was judged by colleagues of the 
victim&#8217;s father, who is the President of the Court of First Instance.  
</p>
<p>853. We would also like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government article 
2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
which provides that  States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, 
agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating 
discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake to, inter alia:  (f) take all 
appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, 
customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; and (g ) to  repeal all 
national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women. Further to the 
above, the same Convention also provides in article 15 that &#8220;States Parties shall accord to 
women equality with men before the law&#8221;. We are concerned that in Ms. Aden&#8217;s case these 
and other human rights provisions may not have been fully respected.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>253 
</b></p>
<p>854. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as permitted under international law from a summary execution, which violates 
human rights standards. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights of Ms. Aden under international law are fully 
respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this would mean that the 
death penalty is not carried out unless, and until, Ms. Aden is provided a fair trial and full 
appeal rights in accordance with the requirements of due process. 
</p>
<p>855. We also remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Article 6(5) of the ICCPR 
provides that the death penalty shall not be carried out against pregnant women and that 
anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence. 
</p>
<p>856. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on this case to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and

</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details of any investigation into Ms. Aden&#8217;s alleged

she was charged with and found guilty of; whether she was represented by legal 
counsel; the amount of time she was afforded to prepare a defence and the resources 
available to ensure the adequacy of the defence; whether she was afforded the 
opportunity to present evidence and witnesses; whether she was afforded the right to

</p>
<p>3.  Please provide the details of any investigation into Messrs. Ahmed Mohamed

</b></p>
<p>857. I write to your Excellency&#8217;s Government with regard to the <b>number of civilian 
casualties of the ongoing military offensive by the Sri Lankan armed forces in the so-
called No Fire Zone in Mullaitivu district.  
</b></p>
<p> According to information I have received: 
</p>
<p> From 20 January to 21 April 2009, an estimated 6432 civilians were killed, of 
whom 5580 were killed in the so-called No Fire Zone in Mullaitivu district, 
including an estimated 454 children.  Approximately 85% of those killed died as a 
result of shelling of the No Fire Zone. On 24 February 2009, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government announced that it would no longer fire heavy weapons into the No Fire 
Zone. The average number of civilians in the No Fire Zone killed each day by 
shelling, however, did not decrease after this announcement. 
</p>
<p> On 7 April 2009, for instance, at 7:30 a.m. four or five artillery shells 
reportedly hit the area near Pokkanai primary health center, where hundreds of 
civilians were waiting in line near a food distribution center, killing at least 13 
civilians immediately and wounding over 50 others. The shells were 120mm rounds 
and were apparently fired from positions of the Sri Lankan Army to the south. The 
make-shift hospital in Putumattalan received 133 wounded civilians and the dead 
bodies of 20 persons on that day. On the morning of 8 April 2009, two further 
shelling attacks hit Pokkanai. The Putumattalan hospital received 296 wounded and 
46 dead bodies on 8 April 2009, and 300 wounded and 62 dead bodies on 9 April 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p> On 27 April 2009, the Presidential Secretariat released a statement declaring 
that &#8220;Our security forces have been instructed to end the use of heavy caliber guns, 
combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian casualties.&#8221; On the 
same day, however, gun fire and shells endangered civilians Mullivaikkal and 
Puthukkudirruppu in the No Fire Zone from 3:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Around 12:.40 
p.m. and again at 1:10 p.m. the Sri Lankan air force carried out two strikes in the 
Mullivaikkal South area. Artillery shells were fired into the Mullivaikkal North area 
at around 5:40 p.m. At 6:50 p.m. heavy shelling of the Mullivaikkal area started. On 
that day, 27 April 2009, 139 injured civilians were admitted to Mullivaikkal 
hospital, 19 of whom died after admission. 
</p>
<p>858. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer 
Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental legal rules applicable to all armed 
conflicts under international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>859. Specifically, your Government is under an obligation to distinguish between 
combatants and civilians and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1, 6 and 7 of 
the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified in the study of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (&#8220;Customary Rules&#8221;)).  Indiscriminate attacks are 
prohibited (Rule 11 of the Customary Rules).  Further, launching an attack which may be 
expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, or damage to civilian 
objects, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage 
anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14 of the Customary Rules).  All feasible precautions must 
be taken to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life (Rule 15 of the Customary 
Rules).   
</p>
<p>860. There are credible reports that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have 
been holding civilians as human shields in the No Fire Zone, and that LTTE cadres have 
shot at civilians trying to leave the area. This conduct by the LTTE would constitute a most 
serious violation of its obligations under customary humanitarian law. I would, however, 
draw your Government&#8217;s attention to the principle whereby a violation of the obligation to 
take precautionary measures vis-&#224;-vis the civilian population or their use as human shields </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>255 
</b></p>
<p>by one side to a conflict does not change the obligations incumbent on the other party to the 
conflict to evaluate what constitutes an excessive attack in relation to concrete and direct 
military advantage (see A/HRC/10/22, para. 17). 
</p>
<p>861. I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to immediately take all necessary steps to 
ensure full respect for the 27 April 2009 announcement by the Presidential Secretariat that 
&#8220;the use of heavy caliber guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause 
civilian casualties&#8221; would be ended. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
safeguard the rights of the civilians in the so-called No Fire Zone in compliance with your 
Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>862. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on the killings of civilians resulting from the military operations your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government is conducting against the so-called No Fire Zone since February 2009, I would 
be grateful for your cooperation and observations on the following four matters: 
</p>
<p>1.  Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please refer to the 
results of any police or military investigation, or judicial or other inquiries carried 
out in relation to the killings of civilians resulting from the military operations 
against the so-called No Fire Zone since 20 January 2009. 
</p>
<p>2. What assessment was made to ensure that the attacks against the so-called No 
Fire Zone since 20 January 2009 complied with the rules of international 
humanitarian law and human rights law? Specifically, what safeguards, if any, were 
employed to verify that only legitimate military targets were attacked?  What 
methods were adopted to distinguish between military and civilian objects?  What 
precautions were taken to minimize loss of civilian life?  What means and methods 
of warfare were adopted to avoid incidental loss of civilian life, and to ensure that 
incidental loss of life was not excessive in relation to the anticipated military 
advantage?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, or 
criminal prosecutions against, members of the armed forces responsible for the 
alleged the killings of civilians in the so-called No Fire Zone since 20 January 2009.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>:  The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
willingness of the Government of Sri Lanka to engage in detailed dialogue on the issue of 
alleged summary executions of a significant number of men by the Sri Lankan Army, as 
depicted in a video tape aired in August 2009.  The Special Rapporteur looks forward to an 
independent and impartial investigation of the underlying events.   </p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 28 August 2009</b> 
</p>
<p>863. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to reports I have received concerning the alleged summary execution of a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>256  
</b></p>
<p>significant number of men by the Sri Lankan army. While the exact circumstances of the 
killings remain unclear it is alleged that they took place during military operations in or 
around Kilinochchi in January 2009. Video footage allegedly documenting the incident 
shows two naked men, bound and blindfolded being shot at point-blank range by men 
wearing Sri Lankan army uniforms, as well as the bodies of eight other men all but one 
naked.  
</p>
<p>864. Following the release of this video footage in the media, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government publicly responded by strongly and unequivocally denying the allegations 
contained in the video footage. In a statement reproduced by several media outlets, the Sri 
Lankan High Commission in the United Kingdom declared that it categorically denied, 
&#8220;that the Sri Lankan armed forces engaged in atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamil 
community. They were only engaged in a military offensive against the LTTE.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>865.  While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the relevant principles of international humanitarian 
law and international human rights law applicable in situations of non-international armed 
conflicts.  
</p>
<p>866. In particular, I would like to refer to Common Article 3 to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions which prohibits &#8220;violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds&#8221; 
of persons taking no active part in the hostilities or who have been placed <i>hors de combat</i>, 
including by detention. I would also like to refer to the obligations arising under human 
rights law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which 
Sri Lanka is a party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the 
person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6). 
</p>
<p>867. While I take note of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s denial of these allegations, I 
wish to recall that international law provides that states have the obligation to conduct a 
thorough investigation of all alleged violations of the right to life.  (E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 
33-43, 60.) When such violations occur in a the context of an armed conflict, States must 
investigate war crimes allegedly committed by their nationals or armed forces or on their 
territory and if appropriate prosecute the suspects.  I note with interest that Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government denies that its armed forces were engaged in atrocities against the 
Sri Lankan Tamil community.  I am not, however, aware of any more specific statement 
indicating that the events depicted in the video either did not take place, were fabricated, or 
did not involve the Sri Lankan army.  In any event it is incumbent upon the Government to 
respect the obligation to conduct an independent and impartial investigation into alleged 
war crimes committed on its territory or by its nationals. Under the circumstances, and in 
order to ensure that any investigation that might clear Your Excellency&#8217;s Government of 
any responsibility is considered to be credible, and thus affirms the position expressed by 
the Government, it would seem indispensable for an independent investigation to be 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>868. I would also wish to reiterate my previously expressed request to undertake an 
official visit to Sri Lanka in order to undertake further inquiries into the issues raised in this 
and previous communications.  I would be most grateful if you could indicate dates on 
which such a visit might be convenient. 
</p>
<p>869. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on this case to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters:

</p>
<p>3. Please provide details on the rules of engagement provided to the members of

</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 31 August 2009 
</b></p>
<p>870. Thank you for your letter of 28 August faxed to our Mission in Geneva at 14:45. 
This is well after our offices close in Sri Lanka, so I was able to read the letter only the next 
morning, a Saturday, on which I went to the office specifically for the purpose.  
</p>
<p>871. I remember you complaining once, in explaining why you could not answer letters 
promptly, that your position was unpaid. Please note that we are not paid extra for working 
outside hours. While answering your letters can be undertaken as a labour of love, it would 
be kind if you tried, if you needed to write to us, to do so well before late on Friday 
afternoons.  
</p>
<p>872. This seems the more desirable in that we have also been sent a press release which 
you had dispatched to our Mission in Geneva at 15:37 on that same Friday afternoon, a 
release which seems to make your letter redundant. I recall that, on the last time you and 
your colleagues launched such a press release, it was claimed that this followed on letters to 
which we had not responded. Those letters had been sent a week earlier, and a week which 
included holidays scarcely seemed an undue delay, given also the continuing failure of the 
UN system to respond promptly to letters from us.  
</p>
<p>873. It was also claimed that the release had been sent to us in time for a response, and it 
was because we had not responded that the release was issued as it stood. When I pointed 
out that the letter accompanying the release did not indicate that discussion would serve any 
purpose, you asserted when we met that you did take responses into account and that you 
had indeed once altered a press release on the strength of a response you had received.  
</p>
<p>874. I should note that you must have been well aware that your release would be made 
prompt use of by terrorist elements. It was highlighted within a few hours by TamilNet. The 
article was entitled &#8216;Horrendous video images indicate violation of international law - UN 
expert&#8217;, available at http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=30104, also makes 
reference to a previous effusion on your part.  
</p>
<p>875. In addition to the suspicious timing of your two pronouncements on the 28th, there 
are several points about the letter specifically addressed to our Mission which are not clear. 
I would be grateful for immediate clarification to enable us to respond. Please note that I 
am writing this on a Sunday and, though I normally do such work as a matter of course, I 
hope that you too will, despite not receiving any remuneration, respond swiftly.  
</p>
<p>876. Firstly, your letter begins with the words &#8220;in this connection&#8221; was this strange 
locution simply a mistake, arising from haste, or were we intended to trace the connection 
ourselves? I could only surmise that we were supposed to read this in conjunction with 
previous demands from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to have 
what is termed an independent investigation into events in Sri Lanka. You are probably 
aware that one of your peers declared  that &#8216;All is Disaster&#8217; when attempts to place Sri </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>258  
</b></p>
<p>Lanka in the dock at a special session of the United Nations Human Rights Council failed. 
Do you share this view?  
</p>
<p>877. Your letter refers to reports you have received &#8216;concerning the alleged summary 
execution of a significant number of men by the Sri Lankan army&#8217;. Have you received 
reports of such an alleged incident, or are they simply reports of video footage allegedly 
documenting this alleged incident? Any independent report should be conveyed to us at 
once but, if your report is only of the video footage, it would be best if you first sought 
further details about this, to help establish whether an investigation of the alleged incident 
would serve any purpose.  
</p>
<p>878. You note that the exact circumstances of these alleged killings remain unclear, but 
say that it is alleged that they took place in January 2009. Since the video footage gives no 
clue about the time or place, presumably this attribution of a particular period was by 
sources you are unwilling to share with us. That is of no great consequence, but you need to 
tell us whether these sources have communicated with you only what the television 
presented said, or whether they have been able to ascertain the reasons for the attribution of 
this period.  
</p>
<p>879. You do not mention what reports referring to the footage claimed, that the video had 
been made by a soldier on a mobile phone. Have you checked on this claim, and also found 
out why this footage only emerged in the public domain seven months later? Have you also 
found out from experts whether the footage, which seemed of high resolution, is consistent 
with this story? Are your sources still in contact with the alleged soldier, or can they 
confirm that the television channel authorities or those from whom they received the 
material are in possession of further information or in a position to provide it at a later 
stage?  
</p>
<p>880. Reports also claimed that the footage had been provided by an organization calling 
itself Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka. This organization seems to have been set up 
very recently, and its provenance and purpose remain unclear. Have you checked on the 
credentials of this organization and its members, or ascertained whether the television 
channel authorities have done so? 
</p>
<p>881. Though the first paragraph of your letter, beginning &#8216;in this connection&#8217; deals with 
the video footage, the second and subsequent one lay stress on what you claim is a 
statement issued by our High Commission in the United Kingdom that was reproduced by 
several media outlets. In your press statement you assert that, on the basis of the awareness 
&#8216;that the Sri Lankan Government has categorically denied the veracity of the allegations&#8217;, 
there is no justification for not moving forward with an investigation.  
</p>
<p>882. I am aware that you are a professor of law, and therefore you must realize that 
&#8216;moving ahead with an investigation&#8217; requires positive justification in the form of credible 
basic evidence. You are not appointed to an exalted position, albeit without remuneration 
(as you have so often told me, though I trust your expenses are met in accordance with 
generous UN guidelines), to score debating points and make public pronouncements to 
harass member states, but rather to look carefully through evidence to draw attention to 
situations that require the attention of member states.  
</p>
<p>883. Did you check further on the provenance of the footage before rushing in where the 
angels we believe the UN system should nurture might have been cautious about treading? 
Did you note the previous history &#8216;in this connection&#8217; (ie coverage of Sri Lanka) of the 
television channel concerned? Is it your business to base a case on the reproduction in 
media outlets of a statement of our High Commission, while ignoring the response of the 
Secretary to the Foreign Ministry who pointed out that evidence presented to us would be 
investigated?  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>259 
</b></p>
<p>With regard to your specific questions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; (a) Your letter mentions an allegation but no summary of events. It is true that there 
was an allegation, and that video footage was telecast, but there is no incident about 
which details can be provided. It is up to you to seek further details about the 
allegation, and if possible summarize an incident which you may then legitimately 
ask us to investigate if you are of the view that there was indeed an incident as 
opposed to an allegation alone.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (b) Your second request in this para is in fact a leading question, inasmuch as there 
is no incident with regard to which it is possible to explain how standard procedures 
were followed. If you require a general answer to the actual question here, I can ask 
the Ministry of Defense to supply it, but in view of your subsequent press release 
that suggests you have prejudged the issue, I need your assurance, before I worry 
others, that you are seeking in good faith, in terms of your mandate to assist member 
states, and not in pursuit of a different sort of agenda.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (c) The forces that went into battle were equipped with training and information 
leaflets about international law. Again, I can send you copies of material if you are 
indeed serious, and once again I shall be happy to accept a personal assurance, even 
though I was deceived with regard to your assurances as to how you issue press 
releases.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (d) Please provide details of the incident which you want to be investigated or 
inquired into.  
</p>
<p>884. I would be grateful for an acknowledgement of this letter and would advise 
withdrawing your press release until you can establish that there was an incident to 
investigate and that the Government of Sri Lanka failed to investigate any such incident. I 
hope the sixty days you have suggested for our response will suffice for your response, and 
you may deduct from these the days that have passed since I was able to see your letter.  
</p>
<p>885. I would also be happy to meet with you when I am in Geneva next month, in the 
hope that we can work together to improve both our situations and yours. I am aware that 
you were warned not to respond to me, and I can only assume that this was done by the 
only official in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights who knew us both 
at the time we spoke, back in December 2007. I would of course welcome your assurance 
that it was not Rory Mungoven who advised you not to respond to me, since my suspicions 
of his bona fides date from that time, and it is possible that I have been doing the man an 
injustice and we should seek to work together more productively.  
</p>
<p>886. I would also welcome, as I have often written, working with you in terms of your 
mandate, and indeed I thought after our last meeting, and your assurances, that this would 
be possible. I was sorry therefore that once again you failed to respond to my previous 
letter, and you have returned to the subject of Sri Lanka only in order to issue yet another 
tendentious press release.  
</p>
<p> Yours sincerely  
 Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha

 Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Special Rapporteur dated 4 September 2009  
</b></p>
<p>887. Dear Professor Wijesinha, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>260  
</b></p>
<p>888. I am replying to your letter dated 31 August 2009 in response to my statement about 
the need to investigate the authenticity of what has become known as the Channel 4 
videotape. 
</p>
<p>889. Permit me first of all to apologize for the inadvertent omission by the Secretariat 
when conveying the allegation letter which I had drafted.  I understand that its apologies 
were conveyed to the Permanent Mission as soon as the error was recognized. 
</p>
<p>890. Your letter raises a significant number of questions in relation to both the 
authenticity of the video, and the circumstances surrounding its making and release.  I fully 
agree with you that answers are needed to these questions, which is why I have attached 
major importance to the need for an independent investigation to get to the bottom of the 
matter.   
</p>
<p>891. As I read it, the essence of your response is that the video itself and the information 
alleged to me by the various sources that brought it to my attention in my capacity as 
Special Rapporteur, do not warrant any attention on the part of the Sri Lankan Government 
until and unless definitive evidence is able to be provided.  As you put it in your newspaper 
article earlier this week:  
</p>
<p>892. [I]t is really too much to expect that an investigation be set in motion on the strength 
of a video clip shown on a television channel that had previously engaged in bizarre 
inaccuracies. (Source: Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha, &#8216;Arbitrary Execution by Prof Philip Alston&#8217;, 
Daily News, Sept 2, 2009, available at http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/09/02/fea03.asp ) 
</p>
<p>893. This is the same article in which you claimed that my statement on the issue of the 
videotape sets me &#8216;at the heart of a terrorist media campaign against the Sri Lankan 
Government.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>894. In my view, however, the standard that your response implies is clearly too 
demanding if the Human Rights Council and its special procedures are to be able to respond 
effectively to alleged human rights violations.  The onus placed upon a Special Rapporteur 
in a situation such as this is to form the view, in light of all of the information available to 
him as well as his own professional expertise and judgment, that the allegations made are 
sufficiently credible as to warrant investigation by the Government.  Only the Government, 
or others acting with the support or permission of the Government, would be in a position 
to undertake the type of investigation required.  It is an inappropriate standard to expect that 
those making allegations in relation to complex human rights situations should bear such a 
strong burden of proof before the Government itself should take any action.  It strikes me as 
equivalent to a police officer telling an alleged victim that no investigation will take place 
until the victim can definitively prove to the officer&#8217;s satisfaction that the alleged crime 
took place.  The standard that you suggest would result in very few allegations ever being 
considered sufficiently credible as to warrant investigation by the Government in 
accordance with its responsibilities under international law. 
</p>
<p>895. The applicable standard is reflected in paragraph 9 of the United Nations, Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions, adopted on 24 May 1989, which requires that &#8216;[t]here shall be thorough, 
prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and 
summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports 
suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances.&#8217;   
</p>
<p>896. There will always be legitimate room for debate as to what constitutes a &#8216;reliable&#8217; 
report in a given situation.  While it is clear that a video tape can be fabricated, so too can 
almost all other sources of alleged evidence.  In this instance, taking account of various 
characteristics of the video, it does not seem to me that the video on its face is patently fake 
or staged.  In my view it constitutes a sufficiently prima facie reliable source as to warrant </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>261 
</b></p>
<p>investigation.  If it can be convincingly shown to be a fake, so that the scenes of killing 
depicted in the video were staged or contrived, as your Government apparently believes, I 
will be immensely relieved and the allegations submitted to me by various sources will be 
shown to have been unreliable.  I do not accept, however, that a video of this nature can be 
dismissed as self-evidently unreliable in the absence of any detailed investigation or 
analysis undertaken either by the Government or by independent experts. 
</p>
<p>897. Given the extremely serious nature of the killings depicted in the video, and your 
Government&#8217;s stated commitment to respecting human rights and promoting reconciliation 
within the country, it is my hope that serious consideration will be given to establishing an 
independent investigation into the alleged incident. 
</p>
<p>898. Since it is my responsibility, under the mandates provided to me by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention, I look forward to 
receiving a response which addresses the facts alleged in the letter sent to your 
Government. As you know, my responsibility is to report on all such cases to the Human 
Rights Council and I undertake to ensure that our correspondence on these matters will be 
duly reflected in my report to the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 7 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>899. Dear Prof Alston  
</p>
<p>900. Thank you for your letter dated September 4th. I am honoured to have received a 
reply from you at last, and pleased that it came so promptly. I hope that this will be the 
beginning of a proper dialogue on record, that will help us in our joint aim of promoting 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>901. I am happy too to accept you apology with regard to the omission, by the Secretariat 
in the letter that you signed and sent to us, of part of your original draft. Careful attention to 
the work of the Secretariat may be useful in future. In this context I note that you have not 
responded to the query at the end of my last letter.  
</p>
<p>902. May I take it then that the warning you receive about responding to me in writing 
indeed came from Mr Mungoven? You will recall that the beginning of the problems in 
your relationship with Sri Lanka came from the leak of your original, to my mind generally 
very helpful, report on Sri Lanka. As noted previously I fully accept your assurance that 
you were not responsible for the leak, but I still believe it would be helpful if you tried to 
find out how exactly it took place from the Secretariat.  
</p>
<p>903. With regard to the actual substance of your letter, I am sorry that you have confined 
yourself to a single issue, and not responded to the detailed questions I asked. I am also 
sorry that, in the interim, you have spoken loosely to the press, though I presume I should 
deal with these infelicities separately, since your letter indicates that you will find the time 
to look at any releases I might issue, for which I am again grateful.  
</p>
<p>904. The most important question you have avoided is that of whether you received any 
reports of an incident taking place in Sri Lanka on the lines of that shown in the video or 
whether it was simply a report of the video itself that prompted your letter, The whole of 
your letter suggests that you are indeed relying simply on a report or reports of the video, 
save for one line, in which you refer to &#8216;allegations submitted to me by various sources&#8217;.  
</p>
<p>905. If you are referring to allegations with regard to any other incident, it is incumbent 
on you to tell us what those allegations are. You may recall that we have been inundated 
with assertions by UN experts and others demanding international investigations on the 
strength of generalizations. The government has committed itself to investigating specific 
allegations, but all we have thus far is &#8216;a series of allegations&#8217; (as you are alleged to have 
mentioned in a Radio Australia report) which range from the London Times claim of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>262  
</b></p>
<p>20,000 civilians killed to the Guardian assertion of 11 crop haired women with slit throats. I 
have dissected the former claim, and will send you the relevant article if you have not 
already seen it. With regard to the latter, I checked with all agencies involved in Protection 
issues in terms of the mandate of this Ministry, and received universal denials that there 
were any grounds for suspecting that anything of the sort had taken place.  
</p>
<p>906. Please therefore let me know if there are any specific allegations that you feel 
require investigation. If however the phrase in your letter that I cite refers simply to the 
incident shown in the video, I can only repeat that you must give us more details of what 
specifically we should investigate, by indicating date or place or both, in line with the 
details you usually supply in queries you send to us.  
</p>
<p>907. Your analogy in this instance, that the request I am making is &#8216;equivalent to a police 
officer telling an alleged victim that no investigation will take place until the victim can 
definitely prove to the officer&#8217;s satisfaction that the alleged crime took place&#8217; is 
nonsensical, and a Professor at least should be able to see this straight away, with or 
without a moment&#8217;s reflection. A victim who reports a crime can be asked as to when and 
where it took place, or at least when and where it was discovered that a crime seemed to 
have happened. In this instance we are told by you that you have reports of a video in which 
an alleged incident took place, with no indication of when and where it happened.  
</p>
<p>908. Surely you must realize that, if for instance a lawyer were to bring an incident to the 
attention of the authorities, that lawyer would be expected to provide details of the incident. 
A victim or even a witness who went to a lawyer and said that an incident had taken place 
but they could give no details of the time or place could not expect the lawyer to take the 
case further, though of course one would expect a good lawyer to ask questions in an effort 
to find at least some details that could be investigated  
</p>
<p>909. The situation is compounded in this instance by the previous allegations by Channel 
4, which has a history of trying to denigrate the Sri Lankan government. We are also 
worried by the claim in the presentation of the allegation by Channel 4 that the video was 
supplied by a group called Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka. This is a new grouping, 
and may include individuals who you may have known previously as involved in the 
hounding out from the Centre for Policy of Alternatives of Kethesh Loganathan. As you 
may recall, he was later murdered when he was proving a doughty opponent of the LTTE 
whilst functioning as Deputy Secretary General of the Peace Secretariat in Colombo.  
</p>
<p>910. I would be happy to discuss this with you further when I am in Geneva for the 12th 
session of the Human Rights Council, if you could spare the time to see me. Meanwhile if 
you are able to provide us with any further information, or even a copy of the original video 
supplied to Channel 4, we can try to pursue the matter further. It would however be counter 
productive for us to seek such information from Channel 4 since, apart from the bias that 
we have seen previously, it would lay us open to even more outrageous charges if there 
were further allegations and we did not continue to seek such information from those who 
obviously have no qualms about making things up.  
</p>
<p>911. Meanwhile my Minister has headed a press conference at which our reasons for 
doubting the authenticity of the video were explained. I hope this is reported in a manner 
that will enable you take the issues up with your informants.   
</p>
<p> I look forward to hearing from you, and also to meeting you as soon as possible.  
 Yours sincerely

<p><b>  Response from the Government of Sri Lanka dated 8 September 2009</b>4<b>  
</b></p>
<p>912. The permanent mission of Sri Lanka to the UN office and other International 
Organisations in Geneva presents its compliments to Prof. Philip Alston, Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and with reference to the 
latter&#8217;s communication and press release dated 28 September 2009, has the honour to 
forward herewith a copy of the press media release dated 3 September 2009 issued by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka on the issue of an unauthenticated video footage 
telecast on channel 4 television in the UK on 25 August 2009 to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>Media Release  
</p>
<p>913. The Government of Sri Lanka is concerned over an increasing number of comments 
from some sections of the international community, on an unauthenticated video footage 
telecast on Channel 4 Television in the UK on 25th August 2009, which contains alleged 
atrocities being committed against Tamils by the Sri Lankan Forces.  
</p>
<p>914. The Government of Sri Lanka reiterates its strong and unequivocal rejection of the 
contents of the video footage telecast on Channel 4 on the grounds that there is absolutely 
no truth in it&#8217;s concocted story. It is also a deliberate and sinister attempt to cause 
embarrassment and bring disrepute to the Government of Sri Lanka. It is indeed deeply 
regretted that despite the Government of Sri Lanka refuting these allegations, some sections 
of the international community are repeating these allegations which appear to be an 
orchestrated campaign against Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>915. This diabolical video footage is reported to have been filmed in January in an 
unidentified location. In Sri Lanka during that time, there was a substantial presence of the 
international community, especially in the areas of conflict. At that time, the LTTE was 
also an active, fighting force. If such atrocities had taken place as claimed, then it is highly 
unlikely that the international community would have remained silent and continued to 
remain so, for over eight months. Considering the fact that the LTTE was finally eliminated 
only during the latter part of May, it is surprising that no attempt was made by the LTTE or 
its front organisations to bring these alleged atrocities or this video to light at the time they 
remained active.  
</p>
<p>916. The authenticity of the Channel 4 news report being in question is evident, as the 
presenter himself has stated that the footage &#8220;claimed to show Sri Lankan Forces executing 
Tamils&#8221; and that it &#8220;appears to show number of men being shot in the head by forces 
speaking Sinhala&#8221;. The presenter further stated that the &#8220;video footage has emerged 
apparently showing Government troops summarily executing Tamils&#8221;.  The news reporter 
categorically pointed out that it was not possible to &#8220;verify the authenticity of the pictures&#8221;. 
This commentary in the Channel 4 telecast in itself clearly demonstrates the fact that the 
footage is of a dubious nature.  
</p>
<p>917. In this context, attention is drawn to a subsequent BBC World News report telecast 
on 26th August 2009 at 1730 hrs. BST where Thirumalai Manivannan from the BBC Tamil 
Service responding to a question on the assessment of the genuineness of the pictures stated 
that &#8220;the video footage does not give the dates when it was shot though the people who 
have distributed it to the media say the footage was taken in January this year. The pictures 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Press releases relevant to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate that are issued either by States or by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur are not ordinarily included in the Communications Addendum.  An exception is 
being made here given the public nature of the communications arising out of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s original allegation letter to Sri Lanka. </p>

</p>
<p><b>264  
</b></p>
<p>themselves don&#8217;t tell you anything nor do the pictures tell you anything about the location 
where it was shot&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>918. Doctoring of videos in this day and age of modern technology is a common 
occurrence. The credentials of the group, &#8216;Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka&#8217; which 
supplied the video footage are also in question, by the fact that Manivannan in the same 
BBC World News Report stated that he &#8220;spoke to one of their organizers in Germany, and 
he would not go on record though he gave some background in full which cannot be used&#8221;. 
Manivannan had also made the point that until recently, there was no awareness of the 
existence of this group that had supplied the footage except that it had been established in 
July.  
</p>
<p>919. Despite the telecast of this video by Channel 4 and various other media thereafter, 
those who produced this video have also so far failed to answer many of the queries which 
have emerged on the genuineness of this video from various quarters.  
</p>
<p>920. The Government of Sri Lanka in carrying out its military offensive against the 
terrorists adhered to a policy of zero casualties among civilians. The fact that thousands of 
civilians sought refuge in the safety of the Sri Lankan Security Forces is a testimony of the 
confidence the civilians had on the Security Forces.  
</p>
<p>921. In manifestations of its genuine intentions, the Sri Lanka Army, on its own accord, 
has sought the assistance of an expert in order to verify the authenticity of this video. In 
spite of Channel 4 on its own accord being unable to confirm the authenticity of the 
footage, it is a matter of grave concern that it continues to repeat these allegations and that 
some sections of the international community seem to be giving undue credence to this 
doctored video thereby attempting to bring discredit to Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>922. The international community should not be misled by these fabricated stories which 
could culminate in erroneous judgments thereby sullying relations. Instead, they must 
recognize the efforts taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure durable peace for its 
people in all parts of the country.  
</p>
<p>923. What Sri Lanka requires at this juncture in its post conflict phase, is the 
understanding and support of the international community.

<p>Executions in Sri Lanka &#8211; <i>As communicated to the local and international media on 07 
September and to the Diplomatic Community and Multilateral Agency Heads on 08 
September 2009 
</i></p>
<p><i>  Background and Introduction 
</i></p>
<p>927. The Channel 4 video purports to show the execution of two persons by supposed 
armed forces personnel. This incident was said to have taken place in the north of Sri Lanka 
in January 2009. Channel 4&#8217;s website on 25 August also carried an article by Jonathan 
Miller entitled &#8220;Execution video: is this evidence of &#8216;war crimes&#8217; in Sri Lanka?&#8221;; (see 
http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/asia_pacific/execution%20video%20is%20t
his%20evidence %20of%20war%20crimes%20in%20sri%20lanka/3321087). This states 
&#8220;Channel 4 News shows footage claimed to show Sri Lankan forces executing Tamils 
earlier this year.&#8221; Although the broadcast story states that the video was not verified for 
authenticity, the web article, significantly, does not note this except for one statement in 
passing towards the end of the piece viz., &#8220;If the killing field footage is authenticated, it will 
do little to reassure Tamil civilians.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>928. Reporting on the video on 26 August, the UK Timesonline website stated: &#8220;Channel 
4, which broadcast the video, says that it was recorded by a Sri Lankan soldier on his 
mobile phone in January, when government forces overwhelmed the stronghold of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Kilinochchi.&#8221; (see http://www.timesonline. 
co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6809968.ece). Many other international media outlets 
carried the story and rebroadcast the video in the ensuing days.  
</p>
<p>929. Thereafter, several international personalities expressed their concern regarding the 
contents of the video. These included Norway&#8217;s international development and environment 
Minister Erik Solheim on 27 August 2009 (see http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/ 
article3237855.ece), the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary 
Executions, Professor Philip Alston on 2 September (see http://edition.cnn.com/ 
2009/WORLD/asiapcf/09/02/sri.lanka.united.nations/), US Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Susan Rice on 02 September 2009, (see http://www.reuters.com/article/ 
worldNews/idUSTRE5816IP20090902) and the Secretary General of the United Nations, 
Ban Ki-moon when he met Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, Mahinda 
Samarasinghe, in Geneva on Thursday 03 September 2009 (see http://news.yahoo.com/ 
s/nm/20090903/wl_nm/us_srilanka_un). 
</p>
<p>930. Minister Samarasinghe assured UN Secretary-General Ban that the Government 
would ensure that a thorough investigation into the video was conducted and that the 
findings of that investigation would be shared with the Secretary-General and others. This 
communication would include an explanation of what steps the Government had taken to 
clarify the position in relation to the video. The Minister also intimated to the Secretary-
General that it was remarkable that such a video, if it was indeed recorded in January, 
should only now come to light several months later.  
</p>
<p><i>  The Source 
</i></p>
<p>931. Channel 4 states that the source of the video is &#8220;Journalists for Democracy in Sri 
Lanka (JSD), which obtained the material and said it was filmed in January [2009].&#8221; A web 
based search for this organization reveals that JSD does not seem to have issued any 
statements prior to 22 July 2009 and it may be reasonably inferred that it did not exist prior 
to that date. Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka established its web presence by 
launching a blog: jdsrilanka.blogspot.com on or around 01 August 2009. They have no 
material older than 01 August except for the 22 July 2009 statement which was posted on 
01 August. There are other stories carried on the blog which mostly relate to media and 
freedom of expression-related issues and all are dated post-01 August 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>266  
</b></p>
<p>932. Surprisingly the video carried on the JDS blog &#8211; that of the organization that is 
supposed to have distributed the original &#8211; is sourced from CNN. To give JDS credibility as 
a source, the Timesonline states that the video is from: &#8220;a group called Journalists for 
Democracy in Sri Lanka, which has previously issued statements through the Asian Human 
Rights Commission.&#8221; However a search of that organization&#8217;s website www.ahrchk.net 
reveals only one such statement on 10 August. It is also extremely difficult to verify if the 
address given by the organization in Berlin is genuine. When the video of the so-called 
&#8220;execution&#8221; was released on or about 26 August 2009 it was given wide coverage by many, 
obviously without any inquiry as to the standing of the source.  
</p>
<p>933. Given that the organization JDS probably did not exist prior to 22 July, the GoSL 
finds it worrying that Channel 4 and the international media gave the video so much 
credence and carried it as truth without further verification. The GoSL is of the view that 
there are legitimate questions as to the provenance of the video coming as it did through a 
mushroom organization when there are other institutions with credible track records that 
could have been used to distribute it. 
</p>
<p><i>  Investigation and Analysis 
</i></p>
<p>934. As Minister Samarasinghe explained to the media and the representatives of the 
international community on 07 and 08 September respectively, the GoSL condemns and 
dismisses in its entirety the video and its contents as being false and fabricated. This 
conclusion is based on the consolidated findings of four separate investigations initiated by 
the Government.  
</p>
<p>935. Minister Samarasinghe recalled that such attempts at publishing fabricated video 
evidence of so-called &#8220;atrocities&#8221;  were common during the final phases of the 
humanitarian operation which was successfully concluded in May 2009. A video was 
played at the briefing which showed Al Jazeera television carrying a story about the 
aftermath of Sri Lankan armed forces supposedly bombing a makeshift hospital in the 
conflict area. As supporting evidence, a recorded telephone call from a Doctor working in 
the area was played. However, the Sri Lankan army had conducted an analysis of the 
footage and pointed out numerous discrepancies which Al Jazeera was professional enough 
to carry in a subsequent news bulletin. After active operations were concluded, the doctor 
who was rescued admitted publicly that he was coached and threatened by the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to utter the false statements that he made to the media. 
Three other doctors used by various international media outlets to support allegations of 
atrocities and supposed shortages of medical supplies during the final stages of the 
humanitarian operation, also publicly stated that they had been similarly coached or 
threatened by the LTTE. 
</p>
<p>936. The Minister explained that as a matter of course the Sri Lanka Army had conducted 
an initial internal inquiry into the alleged incident and had found that the video had no 
factual basis.  
</p>
<p>937. Four separate investigations had been initiated by GoSL into the Channel 4 video 
and four presentations were made to the media and to the international representatives. 
They were a report by expert on video technology Mr Siri Hewawitharana of Australia (Mr 
Hewawitharana&amp;rsquo;s extensive experience, qualifications and credentials are carried on 
http://www.linkedin.com/pub/siri-hewa/5/494/5a8). Mr Hewawitharana&#8217;s report was read 
out by the Minister. Dr Chathura De Silva, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and 
Engineering and Director, Centre for Instructional Technology, University of Moratuwa, 
Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe, Chief of the Sri Lanka Army&#8217;s Signals Corps and Major 
A.P. Bandara of the Media Centre for National Security were the others who reported.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>267 
</b></p>
<p>938. The Minister pointed out that, while all four reports were fully consistent with one 
another, three main points of convergence was apparent on matters of great significance. 
These are to the effect that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the images were not captured by a mobile telephone but by a digital camcorder or 
similar equipment because the video is of high quality unattainable on a mobile 
phone (Channel 4 and several other outlets who carried the story such as 
Timesonline and www.Tamilnet.com, were categorical that the video was shot by a 
soldier using a mobile phone); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; there has been editing of the video and that the audio track has been dubbed and 
there is evidence that the format of the original video has been converted to make it 
appear that it was captured on a mobile telephone; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; if the video is an accurate depiction of an actual event, the gap in time evident on the 
video between the shot being fired and the sound thereof being recorded means that 
there would have to be a distance of over 100 metres between the discharged 
weapon and the recording device for the first shot and 38 metres for the second (at 
which distance a mobile telephone with a camera could not have recorded the 
images shown in the video). 
</p>
<p><i>  Conclusions Drawn 
</i></p>
<p>939. The GoSL finds it remarkable that the obvious distortions in the video were not 
noticed by Channel 4 and that they did not seek further authentication of the video given 
the consequences of its telecast. Coupled with the fact that Channel 4 was unable or 
unwilling to substantiate the <i>bona fides</i> of JDS, and given that the story was one that was 
potentially damaging to Sri Lanka and inimical to its reputation, the organization&#8217;s conduct 
was unprofessional and unseemly.  
</p>
<p>940. The Minister concluded that crude attempts such as that represented by the telecast 
of the video was a malicious attempt to play out a political agenda aimed at besmirching the 
name of Sri Lanka and denigrating the armed forces. It was also an attempt to impair the 
concluding of a thirty-year armed conflict under President Mahinda Rajapakse&#8217;s leadership, 
which has created conditions for an era of political stability and economic development. He 
urged any Sri Lankan elements involved in this effort to put country before self and to 
refrain from seeking to gain political mileage by such activity. 
</p>
<p><i>  Technical/Expert Analysis 
</i></p>
<p>941. Maj. A.P. Bandara of the Media Centre for National Security then made a short 
presentation wherein he noted that when the video was slowed by 50%, several remarkable 
discrepancies and distortions became evident. For instance the leg of a dead person lying 
prone on the ground rises in the air when the first &#8220;victim&#8221; is shot. Thereafter the leg slowly 
drops to its former position. The second &#8220;victim&#8221;, though shot in the head, continues to 
have stiff leg muscles and reclines on his arms bound behind his back. Then he gradually 
leans back until he lies flat on the ground. One of the other victims who lies dead in muddy 
ground wears a remarkably clean white shirt. The &#8220;soldier&#8221; who supposedly kills the first 
&#8220;victim&#8221; is wearing a white T-shirt (vest) when the standard issue for Sri Lankan Army is 
of a different colour altogether. The second &#8220;soldier&#8221; has a very unmilitary growth of hair. 
Even though the bodies are lying in waterlogged or muddy ground, not all the &#8220;bloodstains&#8221; 
from the fatal injuries have spread in a manner consistent with one another. These were just 
some of the distortions and discrepancies that were noted to indicate that the video was 
staged. 
</p>
<p>942. Dr. De Silva, who presented next, made the following observations: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>268  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The granularity of motion vectors and other inter-frame features indicate that the 
footage had been originally captured using a high-end camera (at least a digital 
camcorder) and not by an average mobile phone. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An analysis of the colour levels and saturation shows that the bloodstains in the film 
are unusually strong in colour and have texture mismatches - this is usually the 
result of post-recording modifications and the use of digital effects. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no recoil or movement of the weapon discharged. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Texture analysis of image and possible over-lays shows evidence of 
tampering/digital effects in relation to enhanced bloodstains and one blindfold 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Evidence of audio dubbing 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of audio synchronization - audio is delayed for more than 1.5 seconds - 
this is not due to video compression or processing. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Audio indicates presence of strong wind-noise. However, this is not evident 
in the video footage. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Transcript of the Sinhala dialogue has no relation to the images in the footage. There 
is no audio of victims screaming or any other related noise. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There was no indication that a zoomed view was used.  
</p>
<p>943. Minister Samarasinghe then read out Mr Siri Hewawitharana&#8217;s analysis which could 
be summarised as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The total length of the video clip is 1:02.781 (min) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The edited video stopped at 01:02.312 (min). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The audio editing stopped at 01:02.125. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; This indicates that the original video is edited since original layer stopped at 
1:02.781 and video editing stopped at 01:02.312 and audio dub stopped at 1:02.152. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If it is the original audio, it should have played all the way to 1:02.781 and should 
not have 2 video layers indicating an original and an edited version. The audio is 
added later in a clumsy fashion. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is said that the video came from a mobile phone video source. There are only two 
formats in mobile video formats. One is the old 3GPP format and the new one is the 
Mpeg4, H-264 part 10 which is a MP4 format that is highly processor intensive 
encoding. Because of this, mobile phones in today&#8217;s market do not have high quality 
video capability since the processors in high end mobile phones like iPhones or 
smartphones are not powerful enough to capture good quality video. The Channel 4 
video is much higher in quality than an existing smartphone can create today. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Within H-264 coding there is also an extra component called Motion Vectors 
(VMC) which are used to predict motion on the temporal and spatial domain. 
Channel 4&#8217;s video has quite high quality VMC and it appears that this VMC came 
from a video camera and not from a mobile phone source. Moreover, video from a 
mobile source also tends to be blocky in nature when it comes to motion. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Since the original video was originally in AVI and QuickTime format, the whole 
video indicates that the original video is of high quality that originated from a video 
camera source since mobile formats does not use AVI or QuickTime which are high 
quality video formats. If a change of mobile format to AVI or QT format is 
attempted, then the resulting video is likely to be of very bad quality. However, in 
this case the video is of very high quality. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>269 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The foregoing indicates that someone transferred the camcorder video to a computer 
for editing and sound was dubbed later. One can see that the gun shot was not in 
synchronization with the video. Normally audio is always ahead of the video since 
video processing takes more time and in this case audio is very late indicating very 
amateurish video and audio editing. 
</p>
<p>944. Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe of the Army&#8217;s Signals Corps who conducted both a 
technical study and field tests agreed with the preceding presentations and made the 
following observations:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The video has been edited to include additional details that have been added or some 
details deleted. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A wide angle camera was used to capture the &#8220;incident&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 30 frames at the end of the video stream only contained a letter &#8220;A&#8221; against a blank 
background. This is not consistent with an original video from a mobile telephone 
source. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The video and audio streams were analyzed concurrently for consistency and several 
discrepancies were noticed which leads to the conclusion that the distance of the 
mobile telephone&#8217;s microphone from the weapon was 102 metres in respect of the 
first shot and 38 metres from the second. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A field simulation test using several mobile telephone brands revealed that, in order 
to maintain the size of image in the Channel 4 video, the mobile telephone camera 
should have been at a distance of approximately 3 to 5 metres from the discharged 
weapon.  
</p>
<p>Concluding Remarks 
</p>
<p>945. Minister Samarasinghe in conclusion said that, on the basis of this investigation, the 
GoSL demands a retraction of the story and the video by Channel 4. He stated that he 
would also inform the UN Secretary- General, Norwegian Minister Solheim and others who 
had made statements in this regard of the true nature of this video. He said that Channel 4 
and others will be challenged to prove that the technical and scientific analysis initiated by 
the Government was flawed and the scientifically arrived at conclusions are inaccurate. He 
concluded by stating that the Attorney-General of Sri Lanka would study all aspects of this 
matter with a view to taking appropriate measures, if deemed necessary, in the future.

</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Special Rapporteur dated 17 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>946. Thank you for your reply dated 7 September 2009 to my earlier response.  In your 
letter you take issue with the analogy that I offered and suggest that it is nonsensical.  
Permit me to go a little further with the analogy and suggest that if an individual was beaten 
up or raped and reported the matter to the police, but because of the trauma suffered, was 
unable to identify either when or where the alleged assault took place, it would not be 
justified for the police to throw up their hands and say &#8220;well, if you can&#8217;t give us the 
details, there is nothing we can do in terms of investigating the incident&#8221;.  There is still an 
obligation of due diligence upon the authorities to do whatever they can to locate the 
alleged incident and to pursue those responsible.  My contention is, simply, that this is the 
nature of the obligation incumbent upon the Government of Sri Lanka in relation to this 
case. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>270  
</b></p>
<p>947. In your response you have asked if there are any specific allegations that require 
investigation.  This request has subsequently been elaborated upon in the various public 
statements that have been made on behalf of the Government and in the comments relayed 
to me at your request by the officials of the OHCHR subsequent to their meeting with the 
Government delegation.  In particular, I have been requested to issue a public statement in 
response to the various briefings and statements made by the Minister for Disaster 
Management and Human Rights.  These are contained in the &#8220;Consolidated Response&#8221; 
issued by the Government to the local and international media on 7 September 2009 and to 
the diplomatic community the following day.  The Government&#8217;s response was summarized 
in the Minister&#8217;s statement on 15 September 2009 to the Human Rights Council in which 
he stated that &#8220;four separate investigations have now scientifically established beyond any 
doubt that this video is a fake.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>948. I welcome the fact that the Government is now devoting considerable attention to 
this issue.  The legal obligation incumbent upon a Government in a situation such as this, as 
I recalled in greater detail in my previous letter to you, is to undertake a &#8220;thorough, prompt 
and impartial investigation.&#8221;  My role as Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions is 
to evaluate whether the investigations undertaken have met the relevant criteria established 
under international law, and to advise the Human Rights Council accordingly. 
</p>
<p>949. I can attest to the fact that the investigation has been &#8220;prompt&#8221; since it was 
completed within two weeks of the information becoming available. 
</p>
<p>950. I am not, however, in a position to conclude that it was &#8220;thorough.&#8221;  I have not seen 
the original version of three of the four expert investigations.  The fourth of the 
investigations seems to have originated as an Opinion piece in <i>The Island</i> newspaper, and 
was subsequently elaborated upon.  It is not clear whether or not this was at the 
Government&#8217;s request.  The statement provided by the Minister summarizes &#8220;observations&#8221; 
made by the remaining three experts in presentations made at a meeting convened by the 
Government for this purpose.  I would welcome the publication of the full text of the 
analyses undertaken and reports presented by each of the four experts. 
</p>
<p>951. The third and most important question is whether the &#8220;four separate investigations&#8221; 
meet the criteria of impartiality.  I would note that two of the experts are members of the Sri 
Lankan Army, the body whose actions have been called into question.  A third report is by 
Dr. Chathura De Silva, BSc Eng Hons (Moratuwa), MEng (NTU), PhD (NUS), Senior 
Lecturer, Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, who has 
apparently advised the Government in relation to a number of other similar issues in the 
past.  And the fourth is by Siri Hewawitharana, a broadcast media specialist who is said to 
be the former head of Cisco&#8217;s global broadcast and digital video practice.  No other 
information has been provided by the government on Mr Hewawitharana, but it would 
appear that he is based in Australia, and is a member of a network of Sri Lankan 
Professionals.  I would welcome more information on how he was identified and selected 
by the government as an independent expert. 
</p>
<p>952. Based on the limited information available to me, it is impossible to conclude that 
these four individuals, given their relationship to the Government, meet the criteria for 
impartiality in this context.  When the actions of a Government are called into question in a 
matter of this gravity, what is required is to undertake an investigation by demonstrated 
experts who can be shown to be fully independent of the Government concerned.  Two of 
these individuals are full-time Government employees, one has previously acted on behalf 
of the Government, and the basis on which the fourth was identified and selected as an 
expert remains unclear.  I must conclude therefore, on the basis of the information made 
available by the Government, that the investigations undertaken cannot be characterized as 
&#8220;impartial&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>271 
</b></p>
<p>953. The final question that remains is whether the information provided by the 
Government raises significant doubts as to the authenticity of the video.  On this question, 
my conclusion is that the views expressed do indeed raise several issues which warrant 
further investigation before it could reasonably be concluded that the video is authentic.  
The only way to do this is for an independent and impartial investigation to take place.  
This is all that I have called for.  Such an investigation might well conclude that the 
position adopted by the Government is fully warranted.  I would welcome that outcome 
very warmly, and I hope that the Government would do likewise.

<p>954. GENEVA -- Professor Philip Alston, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial

following statement: 
</p>
<p>955. I have been requested by the Government of Sri Lanka to issue a public statement in 
response to the latest information provided by the Government in relation to the Channel 4 
video which purports to show extrajudicial executions being carried out by the Sri Lankan 
Army. I have carefully reviewed the various briefings and statements made by the Minister

Lecturer, Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, who has 
advised the Government in relation to a number of other similar issues in the past. And the 
fourth is by Siri Hewawitharana, a broadcast media specialist based in Australia, who is 
said to be the former head of Cisco&#8217;s global broadcast and digital video practice. No other </p>

<p>information has been provided by the government on Mr Hewawitharana, but it would 
appear that he is a member of a network of Sri Lankan Professionals. I would welcome 
more information on how he was identified and selected by the government as an 
independent expert. 
</p>
<p>960. Based on the limited information available to me, it is impossible to conclude that 
these four individuals, given their relationship to the Government, meet the criteria for 
impartiality in this context. When the actions of a Government are called into question in a 
matter of this gravity, what is required is to undertake an investigation by demonstrated 
experts who can be shown to be fully independent of the Government concerned. Two of 
these individuals are full-time Government employees, one has previously acted on behalf 
of the Government, and the basis on which the fourth was identified and selected as an 
expert remains unclear. I must conclude therefore, on the basis of the information made 
available by the Government, that the investigations undertaken cannot be characterized as 
&#8220;impartial&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>961. The final question that remains is whether the information provided by the 
Government raises significant doubts as to the authenticity of the video. On this question, 
my conclusion is that the views expressed do indeed raise several issues which warrant 
further investigation before it could reasonably be concluded that the video is authentic. 
The only way to do this is for an independent and impartial investigation to take place. This 
is all that I have called for. Such an investigation might well conclude that the position 
adopted by the Government is fully warranted. I would welcome that outcome very 
warmly, and I hope that the Government would do likewise.

</p>
<p><b>  Press Release by the Government of Sri Lanka dated 17 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Government of Sri Lanka Responds to Prof Philip Alston on Channel 4 Video 
</b></p>
<p>964. The Government of Sri Lanka welcomes the media statement issued today (17) by 
Prof. Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
in which he now acknowledges that the report which was shared with him by the 
Government leads him to the conclusion that &#8220;the views expressed do indeed raise several 
issues which warrant further investigation before it could reasonably be concluded that the 
video is authentic&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>965. The Government of Sri Lanka also welcomes Prof. Alston acknowledgement that 
the government&#8217;s investigation has been prompt. The government regrets however, that 
Prof. Alston has characterized the professional investigation as not independent merely 
because the experts concerned were Sri Lankan.  
</p>
<p>966. Prof. Alston does not appear to have carefully perused the Government&#8217;s 
Consolidated Response of 09 September in which a URL to Mr Siri Hewawitharana&#8217;s 
experience and qualifications was included on page 4.  
</p>
<p>967. Contrary to Prof Alton&#8217;s assertion, the Minister of Disaster Management and Human 
Rights, Mahinda Samarasinghe, contacted Mr Hewawitharana on 05 September, several 
days after the short op-ed opinion piece in <i>The Island</i> newspaper appeared and requested 
him to provide the Minister with a more detailed analysis of the video in the form of a short 
report. The said report was received on 06 September.  
</p>
<p>968. With regard to Dr De Silva, the sole reason for Prof. Alston&#8217;s characterization of his 
analysis as partial is that he appears to have been consulted by the Government of Sri </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>273 
</b></p>
<p>Lanka on previous occasions. The Government is of the view that it is quite legitimate to 
consult acknowledged experts from autonomous academic institutions and this in no way 
makes the expert part of the Government nor does it render the view tainted by bias. 
</p>
<p>969. Moreover, the fact that Prof. Alston now acknowledges that the video needs further 
investigation to prove its authenticity is sufficient to establish that the work of the experts 
consulted by the government of Sri Lanka is credible.  This also confirms the governments 
concern that Prof. Alston was unduly hasty in issuing his original press statement 
concerning the contents of the video in the absence of any credible material. 
</p>
<p>970. It would be pertinent to note that the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
welcomed the Sri Lankan delegation&#8217;s communication that a prompt investigation had been 
carried out into this matter. She also mentioned that, being a lawyer herself, she had 
thought it fit not to make a pronouncement on this issue until the authenticity of the 
contents of the video in question was established.  
</p>
<p>971. The Government is of the view that any further comment on this issue by Prof. 
Alston should only be consequent to the receipt of fresh and cogent evidence that will 
enable him to conclude that the video in question is genuine.    
</p>

</p>
<p>972. Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights  17 September 2009 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 18 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>973. Thank you for your letter dated 17th September sent in reply to mine of 7th 
September. I note that it contains much the same material as was used in your press release 
of 17th September, issued as you suggest after a request by the Sri Lankan Government, 
which had sent you on September 11th, its response to the Channel 4 telecast. I am glad that 
the meeting of the Hon Minister with your staff on the 16th precipitated these belated 
responses.  
</p>
<p>974. I find very strange your argument as to why you did not see fit yourself to look 
further into the Channel 4 video. You now go further with your analogy and claim that &#8220;if 
an individual was beaten up or raped and reported the matter to the police, but because of 
the trauma suffered was unable to identify when or where the alleged assault took place, it 
would not be justified for the police to throw their hands and say &#8220;well, if you can&#8217;t give us 
the details, then there is nothing we can do in terms of investigating the incident.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>975. I am duly entertained by your moving on now from your initial claim that our 
requests for details of the incident were &#8216;equivalent to a police officer telling an alleged 
victim that no investigation will take place until the victim can definitely prove  to the 
officer&#8217;s satisfaction that the alleged crime took place&#8216;. It is surely sleight of hand now to 
introduce trauma, but can you seriously claim that Channel 4 or those who supplied it with 
the video are in a state of trauma and cannot supply you with further details? Channel 4 
informed me that you had made no attempt when you spoke to them to seek information 
about the video, which suggests a lack of seriousness on your part about the incident you 
wish investigated.  
</p>
<p>976. Thus your second paragraph skilfully dodges my question about &#8216;the allegations 
submitted to me by various sources&#8216; and dwells again on the video, suggesting that all your 
allegations are in fact the video and nothing but the video. If you do have any other 
allegations, please mention them.  
</p>
<p>977. With regard to the video itself, the authenticity of which now seems your sole 
concern, you now challenge the Government investigation. Earlier you had written that you 
had formed the view &#8216;that the allegations made are sufficiently credible as to warrant </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>274  
</b></p>
<p>investigation by the Government. Only the Government, or others acting with the support 
or permission of the Government, would be in a position to undertake the type of 
investigation required. . . If it can convincingly be shown to be a fake, so that scenes of 
killing depicted in the video were staged or contrived, as your Government apparently 
believes, I will be immensely relieved and the allegations submitted to me by various 
sources will be shown to have been unreliable&#8216; 
</p>
<p>978. We still believe that, since you seem to be relying on the video alone, you should at 
least have tried to check on its authenticity yourself. However while you continued to do 
nothing, the Government did investigate. Happily the Commissioner for Human Rights, 
who had also been sent the government response, welcomed it and also mentioned that, as a 
lawyer she had not thought it fit to pronounce simply on the strength of the video, the 
Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict agreed that, if a similar video had 
been brought to her notice, she would have checked on it first before making any public 
pronouncements. We are immensely sorry that you seem to have a different code of 
conduct.  
</p>
<p>979. It is however a development to be welcomed that, unlike your initial 
pronouncements, you have publicly acknowledged that the video needs investigation, not 
any alleged incident about which you have failed to seek details from those who first raised 
the allegation.  
</p>
<p>980. Meanwhile you challenge the Government investigation on the grounds that it was 
conducted by Sri Lankas. You are categorical in your distaste for army experts, though 
obviously, given your prejudices, you will not be able to understand that experts in 
computer technology who have produced clear arguments should be challenged in terms of 
those arguments rather than through personal denigration. Sri Lanka is however used now 
to shooting of messengers without any concern for the content of the message.  
</p>
<p>981. You go further, in denigrating a Sri Lankan University don, simply because &#8216;he has 
advised the Government in relation to a number of other similar issues in the past&#8216;. You 
may not understand, given the circles in which you move, that established experts are not so 
many in Sri Lanka &#8211; though your general approach makes clear that even someone who had 
not advised previously would have been suspected if he were Sri Lankan.  
</p>
<p>982. Finally you also engage in denigration of a Sri Lankan now resident in Australia 
who had not previously advised the Sri Lankan government. With your customary 
circumspection where Sri Lankans are concerned, a circumspection you do not extend to 
Channel 4, you say that while he &#8216;is said to be the former head of Cisco&#8217;s global broadcast 
and digital video practice&#8216;. Obviously you have not bothered to check this yourself, even 
though a link to his credentials was given in the report, and you could, if you had doubts 
since he is a Sri Lankan, have checked with Cisco direct.  
</p>
<p>983. But that too would probably not have made a difference to your approach since Mr. 
Hewavithatana&#8216;s main crime is that &#8216;it would appear that he is a member of a network of Sri 
Lankan Professionals&#8217;. You seem to live in an Orwellian world in which Sri Lankans seem 
generally bad and untrustworthy, but anyone who attacks the Sri Lankan Government, 
Channel 4, Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka, is good and trustworthy.  
</p>
<p>984. This is sad since, as I have told you in the past, your initial report on Sri Lanka was 
helpful. You then explained to me why you had decided to adopt an aggressive approach to 
Sri Lanka, but I pointed out that our lady ambassador&#8216;s initial response to you was because 
your report had been leaked. I accepted your assurance that you had not leaked the material 
yourself, but I still believe that you should at least have checked on how the leak occurred, 
and reported to us as to how this type of incident could be prevented in future. I am the 
more concerned about this now because other representatives in Geneva have informed us 
of what seems further bad faith with what should be strictly professional dealings.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>275 
</b></p>
<p>985. Leaving asides the larger question of your general approach to Sri Lankans, I must 
question what seems to be a strange inconsistency in this particular instance. Why ask the 
government to conduct an investigation and then say that it must be by foreigners? If you 
are determined to denigrate anything we do, you surely should, as we told you initially, 
conduct your own investigation, and you could have made a start by at least asking a few 
questions of Channel 4, instead of dancing to their tune.  
</p>
<p>986. Your performance however is slightly redeemed in that, at the end of your release, 
you say that, following our report &#8216;my conclusion is that the views expressed do indeed 
raise several issues which warrant further investigation before it could reasonably be 
concluded that the video is authentic&#8216;. We can only hope then that now, instead of 
introducing hypothetical traumatized victims to justify your initial less restricted critique, 
and contradicting yourself continuously, you actually check on the points made in the 
analysis, carefully analyzing the video yourself, and then point out what precisely you find 
inaccurate  in our presentation,. Any explanation you can offer for the moving leg of a 
purportedly dead person would be particularly welcome, and would I am sure provide 
immense relief.  
</p>

</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Special Rapporteur dated 30 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>987. Dear Professor Wijesinha, 
</p>
<p>988. I am responding to your letter dated 18 September 2009, which was received by the 
OHCHR on 22 September 2009, and by me on 23 September 2009.  I shall keep my reply 
brief since I would prefer to focus on the facts which are under dispute rather than to 
engage in a heated rhetorical exchange. 
</p>
<p>989. You suggest that my position is that it is only &#8220;the video that needs investigation, not 
any alleged incident.&#8221;  This is not correct.  I still believe that the Government of Sri Lanka 
has an international legal obligation to do all it can to ensure that, to the best of its 
knowledge and based on credible investigations, the killings depicted on the video did not 
take place. 
</p>
<p>990. In terms of the expert opinions adduced by the Government, I note that you do not 
respond to my request that the text of those opinions be made available, rather than a 
summary presented by the Government itself. 
</p>
<p>991. You go on to accuse me of impugning the Government investigation &#8220;on the 
grounds that it was conducted by Sri Lankans&#8221;, and of having denigrated the individual 
experts.  You conclude by suggesting that I &#8220;live in an Orwellian world in which Sri 
Lankans are generally bad and untrustworthy&#8221;.  Such statements are unbecoming and 
unjustified by the facts.  A careful reading of my statement indicates clearly that my 
concern was not that of nationality, but of independence and impartiality.  The importance 
of ensuring that experts or judges are not only independent, but are objectively seen to be 
so, has long been recognized in all legal systems, and is appropriately reflected in 
international law standards.  Two of the Government's experts were members of the 
military which stands accused.   Another wrote a strong opinion piece in a Sri Lankan 
newspaper calling the authenticity of the video into question, and seems to have 
subsequently been called upon by the Government to act as an independent expert on the 
basis of these views already expressed.   The fourth expert had been consulted on several 
previous occasions by the government, which at least raises a question about his 
independence. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>276  
</b></p>
<p>992. I would conclude by repeating that I would welcome an independent and impartial 
review of the videotape and very much hope that one shall be undertaken. 
</p>
<p> Yours sincerely, 
 Philip Alston 
</p>
<p><b>  Press release by the Special Rapporteur dated 31 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>993. <b>An Independent Investigation into Sri Lankan Executions is Urgent, says UN 
Expert </b> GENEVA - The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions called for the urgent establishment of an independent investigation into the 
authenticity of a video alleged to show the extrajudicial execution of two naked and 
helpless men by the Sri Lankan army and the presumed prior execution of a number of 
others.  
</p>
<p>994. &#8220;These images are horrendous and, if authentic, would indicate a serious violation of 
international law&#8221;, said Professor Philip Alston. &#8220;I am aware that the Sri Lankan 
Government has categorically denied the veracity of the allegations. This makes it all the 
more important for an independent investigation to be set up. 
</p>
<p>995. For the independent expert, &#8220;if the Government&#8217;s position is validated as a result of 
an inquiry, the international community can rest easy and the Government will have been 
vindicated. There is no justification for not moving ahead with such an investigation in 
view of the Government&#8217;s confidence that such atrocities were never perpetrated by its 
armed forces&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>996. Professor Alston stated that no Government today can simply dismiss such 
allegations without undertaking a thorough investigation that meets international standards. 
He also recalled that he has, on a number of occasions over recent years, requested to 
undertake a visit to Sri Lanka in order to review the situation. He regretted that, to date, he 
has not yet received an invitation to do so from the Government of Sri Lanka, but indicated 
that he was hopeful that such an invitation might be forthcoming in light of the most recent 
allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 2 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>997. Dear Prof Alston  
</p>
<p>998. Thank you for your letter of 30 September, sent in response to mine of the 18th. It is 
always a pleasure to hear from you, and I am only sorry your reply is so brief, and does not 
address some of the points I made. Apart from enjoying your prose style, I find that the 
more you write the more there is that makes clear your mindset. I am pleased however that 
you have now decided to ignore the warning from the Office of the High Commissioner 
that you should not respond to my letters in case I were to use those replies. I can assure 
you that you need not worry, and I also have no intention of engaging in heated rhetorical 
exchanges, or in any way risking your bulldog mode.  
</p>
<p>It is sad however that in your previous letter you did engage in a rhetorical flourish, in 
denigrating Mr Siri Hewa by claiming that &#8216;It would appear that he is a member of a 
network of Sri Lankan Professionals&#8217;. If as you now declare your concern was &#8216;not that of 
nationality, but of independence and impartiality&#8217;, the previous claim seems a cheap 
debating point.  
</p>
<p>999. I should add that none of your colleagues has expressed doubts about the provenance 
of the investigation conducted by the Government, so the lack of objectivity seems to me to 
be more yours than that of the experts who were consulted. Indeed, though very properly 
none expressed criticism of your haste, the general view amongst your colleagues seemed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>277 
</b></p>
<p>to be that rushing into action on the basis of such a video was not something they would 
have engaged in.  
</p>
<p>1000. Finally, you continue to ignore the facts raised in the report. I am surprised that you 
did not yourself seek out the fuller report through accessing the website of the Ministry of 
Defence (www.defence.lk) but if here too your distaste for the messenger precludes 
attention to the message, you may ask for this from our representatives at the Mission 
which sent you the summary. I believe that you have not as yet replied to their letter, except 
through your second press release, which was then cut and pasted into your previous 
response to me. It would be proper I believe to respond to them, and with a little more 
cutting and pasting you could ask for any more material that you needed to continue to 
justify your original letter and immediate press release.

<p>1001. Dear Professor Wijesinha, 
</p>
<p>1002. I am following up on our previous correspondence in relation to the so-called 
Channel 4 videotape to request access to the original reports by the four experts 
commissioned by the Sri Lankan Government to provide advice as to the apparent 
authenticity or otherwise of the videotape. I have, of course, read carefully the excerpts 
from the various reports posted on the relevant official websites, but I would very much 
appreciate being able to read the complete report submitted by each of the experts. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government of Sri Lanka dated 13 November 2009

<p>1003. Dear Prof Alston 
</p>
<p>1004. Thank you for your letter of 9th November. I was awaiting a response to my 
previous letter of October 2nd, which may not have reached you since your present letter 
reiterates a request to which I responded then, in suggesting that you &#8216;ask for this from the 
representatives at the Mission which sent you the summary&#8216;. In fact I noted that it seemed 
&#8216;you have not as yet replied to their letter&#8217; except through a press release, which did not 
strike me as entirely proper.  
</p>
<p>1005. I will however forward your letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo, 
though I should add that the current request would have been made more appropriately to 
those who initially wrote to you in this regard, in place of the peremptory press release 
which has done little to convince us of your objectivity.  
</p>
<p>1006. I will however be happy to engine with you further on the issues of principle I have 
raised, since I continue perhaps unusually to believe, on the strength of your original report 
which was so unfortunately leaked, that you are not irredeemably prejudiced. I still think 
you should inquire into the circumstances of that leak, which has contributed so much to 
you current bulldog approach, to use your own term, to interactions with Sri Lanka, even 
our ambassador who was so hurt by what seemed double-dealing retired many years ago.

<p><b>  Response of the Special Rapporteur dated 5 January 2010  
</b></p>
<p>1007. By way of follow-up to the several communications that I have exchanged with your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government in relation to the so-called &#8220;Channel 4 Videotape&#8221; (including my 
communications of 28 August and 17 September 2009 and your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s communications of 7 and 17 September 2009), and by way of responding to 
the various requests made that further examination of the video be undertaken, I attach a 
Technical Note which describes the outcome of the further inquiries that I have made in this 
regard.  An Appendix to the Technical Note contains the full text of the original opinions 
provided by each of three independent experts I have retained to carry out analysis of the 
video tape.   
</p>
<p>1008. In view of the very public nature of the comments already exchanged on this matter, 
I plan to make this Technical Note available by means of a public statement in New York 
on 7 January 2010.   
</p>
<p><b>  Technical Note prepared by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston, in relation to the authenticity of the &#8220;Channel 
4 videotape&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Overview 
</i></p>
<p> 1. On 25 August 2009, a United Kingdom television station released video 
footage which appears to show the summary execution of Tamils by Sri Lankan soldiers.  A 
group named Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka claimed that the killings had been 
filmed in January 2009 by a Sri Lankan soldier with a mobile phone.  This was at a time 
when the international media did not have access to the conflict zone. 
</p>
<p> 2. Since the video&#8217;s release, the Government of Sri Lanka has claimed that the 
video is a fake.  Over the past four months, I have been engaged in a series of 
communications with the Government about this video, in which I requested it to conduct 
an independent investigation.  While the Government initially refused to do so, on 7 
September 2009, it issued a response stating that it had commissioned four separate 
investigations, and that they &#8220;have now scientifically established beyond any doubt that this 
video is a fake&#8221;.  At the time, I expressed concern about the objectivity of the 
investigations, in part because two of the &#8220;independent experts&#8221; worked for the Sri Lankan 
armed forces.  Some of the reports seemed more impressionistic than scientific, and I have 
never been provided the full version of the reports. 
</p>
<p> 3. I decided that it was incumbent upon me to commission independent and 
impartial evaluations of the videotape.  I retained three experts: in forensic pathology (Dr 
Spitz), forensic video analysis (Mr Spivack), and firearm evidence (Mr Diaczuk).  
Together, the reports by these experts strongly suggest that the video is authentic. 
</p>
<p> 4. Mr Diaczuk concluded that the recoil, movement of the weapon and the 
shooter, and the gases expelled from the muzzle in both apparent shootings were consistent 
with firing live ammunition, and not with shooting blank cartridges.  
</p>
<p> 5. Dr Spitz found that the footage appeared authentic, especially with respect to 
the two individuals who are shown being shot in the head at close range.  He found that the 
body reaction, movement, and blood evidence was entirely consistent with what would be 
expected in such shootings. 
</p>
<p> 6. Mr Spivack&#8217;s forensic video analysis found no evidence of breaks in 
continuity in the video, no additional video layers, and no evidence of image manipulation.   
</p>
<p> 7. There are a small number of characteristics of the video which the experts 
were not able to explain.  This included the movement of certain victims in the video, 17 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>279 
</b></p>
<p>frames at the end of the video, and the date of 17 July 2009 encoded in the video.  Each of 
these characteristics can, however, be explained in a manner which is entirely consistent 
with the conclusion that the videotape appears to be authentic. 
</p>
<p> 8. Moreover, the independent experts&#8217; analyses also systematically rebutted 
most of the arguments relied upon by Sri Lanka&#8217;s experts in support of their contention that 
the video was faked.  For example: 
</p>
<p> (a) A Sri Lankan expert stated that there was no recoil or movement of 
the weapon discharged.  However, Mr Spivack and Mr Diaczuk described the recoil 
visible on the video, and the way in which the movement was consistent with firing 
live ammunition.   
</p>
<p> (b) A Sri Lankan expert stated that the lack of audio synchronization with 
the video indicated manipulation.  However, Mr Spivack stated that the video/audio 
synchronization in the video was well within acceptable limits, and that audio can be 
ahead or behind video, subject to various variables.    
</p>
<p> (c) A Sri Lankan expert stated that the movement of the second victim 
after being shot was not consistent with the normal expected reaction.  However, Mr 
Spitz stated that the movement was entirely consistent with the manner in which the 
individual was apparently shot.  
</p>
<p> (d) A Sri Lankan expert stated that while wind could be heard on the 
audio, it was not evident in the video.  Mr Spivack however described multiple 
places in the video where there is clear evidence of wind.   
</p>
<p> (e) Sri Lanka&#8217;s experts argued that the footage was likely recorded on a 
digital camcorder, and not a mobile phone.  Mr Spivack concluded that the metadata 
he retrieved from the video was entirely consistent with multimedia files produced 
by mobile phones with video recording capability, and that it would have been very 
difficult to alter the metadata.  
</p>
<p> 9. In sum, while there are some unexplained elements in the video, there are 
strong indications of its authenticity.  In addition, most of the arguments relied upon by the 
Government of Sri Lanka to impugn the video have been shown to be flawed. 
</p>
<p> 10. In light of these conclusions, and of the persistent flow of other allegations 
concerning alleged extrajudicial executions committed by both sides during the closing 
phases of the war against the LTTE, I call for an independent inquiry to be established to 
carry out an impartial investigation into war crimes and other grave violations of 
international humanitarian and human rights law allegedly committed in Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p> 11. The detailed report below provides a summary of the background to this 
issue, as well as a detailed summary of: (i) evaluations undertaken in September 2009 at the 
request of the Sri Lankan Government; (ii) evaluations undertaken by two other sources 
unrelated to either the Government or the Special Rapporteur; and (iii) evaluations prepared 
by the three independent experts commissioned by the Special Rapporteur.  In addition, the 
full text of the latter three reports are reproduced as a separate Appendix to this Technical 
Note. 
</p>
<p><i>  1. Introduction 
</i></p>
<p> 12. On 25 August 2009, a United Kingdom television station, Channel 4, 
released video footage which appears to show the summary execution of Tamils by Sri 
Lankan soldiers. There is no indication in the video itself of the ethnicity of the dead men, 
but the group which obtained the pictures, Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka, claimed 
the victims are Tamils. The group claimed that the killings had been filmed in January by a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>280  
</b></p>
<p>Sri Lankan soldier with a mobile phone.  This was at a time when the international media 
did not have access to the conflict zone. 
</p>
<p> 13. The footage first shows a young man who is naked, bound and blindfolded. A 
man approaches him wearing what appears to be a Sri Lankan army uniform and appears to 
shoot him at point-blank range.5 The video, taken in daylight, then pans out to show what 
appears to be eight bound corpses, all who appear to have been shot and killed.  All but one 
are naked. Towards the end of the footage, a ninth bound victim is shown apparently being 
shot. 
</p>
<p> 14. The day after the broadcast the Government of Sri Lanka issued a statement 
saying that it &#8220;strongly and unequivocally denies the allegations contained in the video 
footage telecast on Channel 4. This footage is diabolical and there is absolutely no truth in 
its concocted story . . .&#8221;.6 On 28 August 2009, in a letter sent to the Government of Sri 
Lanka and in a press statement, I called for the urgent establishment of an independent 
investigation into the authenticity of the video, adding that, if authentic, the images would 
indicate a serious violation of international law. I observed that no Government today can 
simply dismiss such allegations without undertaking a thorough investigation that meets 
international standards, and expressed hope that an invitation to conduct an official visit, 
which I had previously requested on a number of occasions, might be forthcoming in the 
light of these most recent allegations.  In addition, I noted that my call did not prejudge any 
question as to the authenticity or otherwise of the video.7 
</p>
<p> 15. The matter of the videotape was also raised by the United Nations Secretary-
General, Ban Ki-moon, in talks in Geneva on 2 September 2009, with Mahinda 
Samarasinghe, Sri Lanka's Minister for Disaster Management and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> 16. The Government of Sri Lanka responded to the Special Rapporteur by means 
of a letter signed by Professor Rajiva Wijesinha, Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster 
Management and Human Rights.  The letter rejected the video as inauthentic and indicated 
that the allegations made did not warrant Government attention until and unless definitive 
evidence was able to be provided.  In subsequent commentary, it was suggested that the fact 
that the video had first been aired on Channel 4, which had previously had disagreements 
with the Sri Lankan Government, made an investigation even less appropriate.  &#8220;[I]t is 
really too much to expect that an investigation be set in motion on the strength of a video 
clip shown on a television channel that had previously engaged in bizarre inaccuracies&#8221;.  
Professor Wijesinha also indicated that my earlier statement about the videotape had set me 
&#8220;at the heart of a terrorist media campaign against the Sri Lankan Government&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p> 17. In my response to the Government I indicated that, in my view, international 
law established a clear standard which should be followed in such cases: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;[t]here shall be thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases 
of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints

circumstances.&#8221;9 
</p>
<p>1009. I acknowledged that there would always be legitimate room for debate as to what 
constitutes a &#8216;reliable&#8217; report in any such situation, and that a videotape, like most other 
sources of alleged evidence, can be fabricated.  I concluded, however, that in this instance it 
did &#8220;not seem to me that the video [was] patently fake or staged&#8221; and that it constituted &#8220;a 
sufficiently reliable source as to warrant investigation&#8221;.  I added that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;If it can be convincingly shown to be a fake, as your Government apparently 
believes, I will be immensely relieved and the allegations submitted to me by 
various sources will be shown to have been unreliable.  I do not accept, however, 
that a video of this nature can be dismissed as self-evidently unreliable in the 
absence of any detailed investigation or analysis undertaken either by the 
Government or by independent experts. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Given the extremely serious nature of the killings depicted in the video, and your 
Government&#8217;s stated commitment to respecting human rights and promoting 
reconciliation within the country, it is my hope that serious consideration will be 
given to establishing an independent investigation into the alleged incident.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>  2.  Evaluations commissioned by the Government 
</i></p>
<p> 18. The Government of Sri Lanka subsequently decided to commission several 
expert opinions in relation to the videotape.  On 7 September 2009 it publicly issued a 
&#8220;Consolidated Response of the Government of Sri Lanka to the Telecast by Channel 4 
News of the United Kingdom on 25 August 2009 of a Video of Supposed Extra-Judicial 
Executions in Sri Lanka&#8221;.  This document strenuously denied the video&#8217;s authenticity and 
set out the findings of four separate investigations that had been commissioned. 
</p>
<p> 19. Sri Lanka also disputed the reliability of the source of the video &#8211; Journalists 
for Democracy in Sri Lanka &#8211; noting that they did not have any web presence until early 
August 2009, implying that they had been set up as a Tamil front group. Minister 
Samarasinghe also stated that attempts at publishing fabricated video evidence of atrocities 
had been common during the final phases of the war, citing in particular a video and 
telephone call which purported to document the bombing of a makeshift hospital by Sri 
Lankan armed forces (aired on Al Jazeera) which, according to the Sri Lankan army 
analysis which followed, was fabricated. 
</p>
<p> 20. The Consolidated Response summarizes &#8220;observations&#8221; made by three 
experts in presentations made at a meeting convened by the Government for this purpose. 
The analysis of a fourth expert was read by Minister Samarasinghe and is also summarised 
in the Response. The full text of the analyses undertaken and reports presented by each of 
the four experts has not been made public.  On 9 November 2009 I wrote to the 
Government noting that while I had &#8220;read carefully the excerpts from the various reports 
posted on the relevant official websites, &#8230; I would very much appreciate being able to read 
the complete report submitted by each of the experts.&#8221;  No substantive response to this 
request has yet been received. 
</p>
<p> 21. Expert statement one:  The report first documents the presentation of Dr. De 
Silva, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering and director of the Centre for

<p>  
 9  Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary

<p>Executions, adopted by Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/65, of 24 May 1989, Annex,

<p>Instructional Technology at the University of Moratuwa (Sri Lanka). According to the 
report, he made the following observations: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;The granularity of motion vectors and other inter-frame features 
indicate that the footage had been originally captured using a high-end camera (at 
least a digital camcorder) and not by an average mobile phone. 
</p>
<p> (b) An analysis of the colour levels and saturation shows that the 
bloodstains in the film are unusually strong in colour and have texture mismatches &#8211; 
this is usually the result of post-recording modifications and the use of digital 
effects. 
</p>
<p> (c) There is no recoil or movement of the weapon discharged. 
</p>
<p> (d) Texture analysis of image and possible over-lays shows evidence of 
tampering / digital effects in relation to enhanced bloodstains and one blindfold. 
</p>
<p> (e) Evidence of audio dubbing  
</p>
<p> (f) Lack of audio synchronization &#8211; audio is delayed for more than 1.5 
seconds &#8211; this is not due to video compression or processing. 
</p>
<p> (g) Audio indicates presence of strong wind-noise. However, this is not 
evident in the video footage. 
</p>
<p> (h) Transcript of the Sinhala dialogue has no relation to the images in the 
footage. There is no audio of victims screaming or any other related noise. 
</p>
<p> (i) There was no indication that a zoomed view was used.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p> 22. Expert statement two:  Minister Samarasinghe read the views of Mr. Siri 
Hewawitharana who, according to the Sri Lankan Government, was an expert on video 
technology.  This assessment also focused on a technical analysis of the authenticity of the 
video. His findings were summarized as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;There are indications that the original video is edited since original layer stopped at 
1:02.781, video editing stopped at 01:02.312 and audio dub stopped at 1:02.152. If it 
is the original audio, it should have played all the way to 1:02.781 and should not 
have 2 video layers indicating an original and an edited version. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is said that the video came from a mobile phone video source, but there are only 
two formats in mobile video formats (the old 3GPP format and the new MP4 
format).  However, the Channel 4 video is much higher in quality than either format 
can create today. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Within H-264 coding (used for MP4 format) there is also an extra component called 
Motion Vectors (VMC) which are used to predict motion on the temporal and spatial 
domain. Channel 4&#8217;s video has quite high quality VMC and it appears that this VMC 
came from a video camera and not from a mobile phone source. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Since the original video was originally in AVI and QuickTime format, this indicates 
that the original video is of high quality that originated from a video camera source, 
as mobile formats does not use AVI or QuickTime. If a change of mobile format to 
AVI or QT format is attempted, then the resulting video is likely to be of very bad 
quality. However, in this case the video is of very high quality.

<p>&#8226; The gun shot was not in synchronization with the video. Normally audio is always 
ahead of the video since video processing takes more time.  In this case, the audio is 
very late indicating video and audio editing.&#8221;11 
</p>
<p> 23. Expert statement three:  Major A.P Bandara of the Media Centre for National 
Security, which comes within the purview of the Ministry of Defence and is based in 
Colombo, presented his findings to the Government, summarised in the Report. He noted a 
number of discrepancies in the video: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The leg of a dead person lying prone on the ground rises in the air when the first 
victim is shot. Thereafter the leg slowly drops to its former position. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The second victim, though shot in the head, continues to have stiff leg muscles and 
reclines on his arms bound behind his back. Then he gradually leans back until he 
lies flat on the ground. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; One of the other victims who appears to lie dead in muddy ground wears a clean 
white shirt. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The soldier who is shown killing the first victim is wearing a white T-shirt but the 
standard issue for Sri Lankan Army is of a different colour altogether. The second 
soldier has a very unmilitary growth of hair. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Even though the bodies are lying in waterlogged or muddy ground, not all the 
bloodstains from the fatal injuries have spread in a manner consistent with one 
another.&#8221;12 
</p>
<p>24. Expert statement four:  Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe of the Army&#8217;s Signals Corps 
gave the final presentation. It was reported that he had conducted both a technical study and 
field tests which confirmed the conclusions of the preceding presentations. His further 
observations were summarized in the report as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;30 frames at the end of the video stream only contained a letter &#8220;A&#8221; against a blank 
background. This is not consistent with an original video from a mobile telephone 
source. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The video and audio streams were analyzed concurrently for consistency and several 
discrepancies were noticed which leads to the conclusion that the distance of the 
mobile telephone&#8217;s microphone from the weapon was 102 metres in respect of the 
first shot and 38 metres from the second. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A field simulation test using several mobile telephone brands revealed that, in order 
to maintain the size of image in the Channel 4 video, the mobile telephone camera 
should have been at a distance of approximately 3 to 5 metres from the discharged 
weapon.&#8221;13 
</p>
<p> 25. On the basis of the presentations, the report detailed the conclusions of 
Minister Samarasinghe, who stated that the telecast of the video represented a &#8220;malicious 
attempt to play out a political agenda aimed at besmirching the name of Sri Lanka and

<p>denigrating the armed forces&#8221;14. He demanded a retraction of the video and story by 
Channel 4.15 
</p>
<p>26. On 15 September 2009, the Sri Lankan Government made a statement to the UN 
Human Rights Council that &#8220;four separate investigations have now scientifically 
established beyond any doubt that this video is a fake&#8221;.  On 16 September 2009, Secretary 
Wijesinha told BBC Radio that one reason for restricting the access of journalists to camps 
for internally displaced persons was that parts of the media had acted irresponsibly.  In 
particular, he cited the &#8220;video shown on Channel 4 which showed what was meant to be an 
execution, it turned out that they had not even bothered to check it. It showed purportedly a 
dead person with a leg that gradually went down. I'm afraid when people tell lies, all of you 
get tarred with the same brush&#8221;.16  On 18 September 2009, Sri Lanka&#8217;s Daily News 
newspaper reported that the Sri Lankan High Commission in London had lodged a 
complaint against Channel 4 with the Press Complaints Commission. Attorney General 
Mohan Peiris was also reported to have consulted with a London-based legal firm with a 
view to filing a lawsuit against Channel 4.17 
</p>
<p><i>  3. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s response to the reports  
</i></p>
<p>27. In acknowledging the Sri Lankan investigations and report, I concluded that &#8220;the 
views expressed do indeed raise several issues which warrant further investigation before it 
could reasonably be concluded that the video is authentic&#8221; and I noted that &#8220;the only way to 
do this is for an independent and impartial investigations to take place&#8221;.  While recognizing 
the promptness of the investigation, I observed that two of the four Government experts 
were full-time Government employees, that the third had previously acted on behalf of the 
Government, and that &#8220;the basis on which the fourth was identified and selected as an 
expert remains unclear&#8221;.  Accordingly, the studies could not objectively be characterized as 
meeting the requirement laid out in international law that such studies must be impartial.  
Nor was it possible for me to conclude that the investigations had been &#8220;thorough&#8221;, since I 
had not seen the original version of three of the four expert investigations, and the fourth of 
the investigations appeared to have originated as an Opinion piece in The Island 
newspaper,18 which had then been elaborated upon at the Government&#8217;s request.19 
</p>
<p>28. On 17 September 2009, the Sri Lankan Government responded by refuting my 
characterisation of the investigation as lacking in impartiality.  This led to press reports 
such as that of 19 September 2009 in the <i>Daily News</i> which suggested that &#8220;Prof. Alston 
has now eaten most of his harsh, ill-thought out and damaging comments about Sri 
Lanka&#8221;.20  The following day, the Ministry of Defence published a statement by one of the 
Government&#8217;s experts, Mr Siri Hewawitharana, who &#8220;challenged the UN to disprove his 
analysis into the fake video clip of Channel 4&#8221;.  He was quoted as saying: &#8220;I can tell the 
good Professor that if he is to put his experts against my conclusion I am happy to see any 
of them do any rebuttal of my analysis. &#8230; [If Channel 4 had asked experts to look at the 
video, they] would have seen the forgery of the editing parts within a few seconds.  &#8216;So

only the Sri Lankan nation with lies and innuendoes, but is also questioning science and 
engineering&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p>29. The Government stated that the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, 
had welcomed their report,22 although I am not aware of any public statement on the matter 
by the High Commissioner.  She did, however, subsequently call for a full investigation 
into violations of human rights and international law that occurred during the civil war in 
Sri Lanka.  In elaborating upon her comments, the Spokesperson for the UN Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, told reporters that &#8220;something like 
the Gaza fact-finding mission is certainly warranted given the widespread concerns about 
the conduct of the war in Sri Lanka&#8221;.23  The Sri Lankan Ministry for Disaster Management 
and Human Rights responded on 27 October 2009 to that suggestion, describing the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s approach as &#8220;unwarranted and uncalled for&#8221; and noted that although the 
statement followed the issuance of a US State Department report into abuses in Sri Lanka, 
it did not appear to take account of the fact that the US report did not purport to reach legal 
conclusions.24 The Ministry reiterated that &#8220;the President has appointed a Committee of 
persons of proven integrity and independence to look into the incidents mentioned in the 
report&#8221; and that the President will &#8220;make known its position once this Committee has 
fulfilled its mandate and reported its conclusions.&#8221; 25 
</p>
<p><i>  4. Further forensic study commissioned by a Tamil group 
</i></p>
<p>30. Subsequently, in response to the Sri Lankan Government&#8217;s investigations into the 
video, a US-based pressure group &#8211; Tamils Against Genocide &#8211; commissioned a technical 
study of the video.  Preliminary findings were released on 18 October 2009.  The report 
was said to have been made by a  US-based forensic company that took nearly three weeks 
to analyse the recording.  They said: &#8220;[t]he video and audio of the events depicted in the 
Video, were continuous without any evidence of start/stops, insertions, deletions, over 
recordings, editing or tampering of any king.&#8221;26  Although the group stated that it would 
release the final report on the video in early November, this has not yet happened. The key 
preliminary findings cited were as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;No evidence of tampering or editing was discovered with either the video or audio 
portions of Video. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The blood pooled around the previous victim with the white shirt and with the 
victim of the second shooting appears to be consistent with blood from the brain, 
which would contain high amounts of oxygen giving the blood its bright color.  The 
fact that it is still bright in color appears to be consistent with it being very recent. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The audio delay with respect to both gun shots&#8217; audio compared with each 
corresponding rifle recoil is consistent for some, if not most, camera cell phones that 
are capable of video recording.

<p>&#8226; Preliminary field test with a typical camera cell phone of similar audio qualities &#8230; 
was able to record a MAK-90 (AK variant w/16&#8221; barrel) gun shot w/7.62x39mm 
ammo, with the camera cell phone being positioned in a similar camera field of view 
of the second gun shot, or 12 feet away from the muzzle, without any distortion of 
the audio. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The leg of an apparent previous shooting victim lying prone on the ground, down 
range and at the feet of the first victim, rises in the air when the first victim is shot, 
and then slowly drops to its former position. This reaction appears to be from the 
bullet that passed through the first victim and then striking the down range victim 
and would be consistent with a victim that was very recently shot that has not died 
yet.&#8221; 27 
</p>
<p><i>  5.  Investigation commissioned by The Times (London) 
</i></p>
<p> 31. On 15 December 2009, <i>The Times</i> of London published the results of an 
evaluation of the videotape undertaken by Grant Fredericks, an independent forensic video 
specialist who was said to be an instructor at the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] 
National Academy, and to have previously been head of the Vancouver Police forensic 
video unit.  While I endeavoured to obtain a copy of the full report prepared by Mr. 
Fredericks, my efforts were unsuccessful.  I have thus seen only the press coverage of the 
analysis, the principal reported elements of which are as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;He found no evidence of digital manipulation, editing or any other special effects. 
However, subtle details consistent with a real shooting, such as a discharge of gas 
from the barrel of the weapon used, were visible. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8216;This level of subtle detail cannot be virtually reproduced. This is clearly an original 
recording&#8217; . . .  . 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There was also strong evidence to rule out the use of actors. &#8216;Even if the weapons 
fired blanks, the barrel is so close to the head of the &#8220;actors&#8221; that the gas discharge 
alone leaves the weapon with such force it would likely cause serious injury or 
death&#8217; . . .  . 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reactions of those executed was consistent with reality . . .  . &#8216;The victims do not 
lunge forward . . . [they] fall backward in a very realistic reaction, unlike what is 
normally depicted in the movies.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; . . . &#8216;[T]he injury to the head of the second victim and the oozing liquid from that 
injury cannot be reproduced realistically without editing cuts, camera angle changes 
and special effects. No [errors] exist anywhere in any of the images that support a 
technical fabrication of the events depicted&#8217; . . .  . 
</p>
<p>&#8226; . . . &#8216;[C]ode embedded in the footage appeared to match with software used in Nokia 
mobile phones.&#8217; . . .  &#8216;The recording is completely consistent with a cell phone video 
recording and there are no signs of editing or alterations.&#8217;&#8221;28

<p>and impartial evaluations of the videotape, I decided that it was incumbent upon me to do 
so in my capacity as Special Rapporteur.  Indeed, the Government of Sri Lanka had 
suggested such a course of action on several occasions. 
</p>
<p> 33. On the basis of advice received from independent experts working in the 
relevant fields, I approached three experts to provide me with their expert opinions on the 
authenticity or otherwise of the videotape.  Each of these experts agreed to undertake the 
work on a pro bono basis, and each declared his full independence and impartiality in 
relation to this matter.  The full text of the report provided by each expert is appended to 
this Note. 
</p>
<p>  Expert 1: Jeff S. Spivack 
</p>
<p> 34. Mr Spivack was formerly a Forensic Multimedia Analyst with the Las Vegas 
Metropolitan Police Department, and a calibration laboratory specialist for the US Air 
Force.  He is a member of the American College of Forensic Examiners Institute, is a 
Certified Forensic Consultant, and has been qualified as an expert witness on forensic video 
analysis in courts throughout the US.  He is now in private practice. 
</p>
<p> 35. Mr Spivack&#8217;s main findings were as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The video and audio formats, codecs, bit rates, and video width, height, aspect 
ratio, and format profile (motion vector) properties are entirely consistent with 
multimedia files produced by a wide variety of mobile phones with video recording 
capability.&#8221;  Mr Spivack noted that while it is &#8220;theoretically possible to alter or 
delete metadata in a multimedia file, he was &#8220;unable to locate any commercially 
available software capable of deleting or altering meaningful file attributes.&#8221;  He 
stated that &#8220;altering the class of metadata recovered in this analysis &#8230; requires a 
high degree of technical proficiency.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Content analysis revealed no breaks in continuity, no additional video layers, and 
no evidence of image manipulation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 36. Mr Spivack reviewed each of the Sri Lanka expert arguments and found most 
of them to be inaccurate or faulty.  For example: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sri Lanka expert Dr De Silva stated that the colours of the bloodstains in the video 
suggested that the video was faked.  Mr Spivack stated, &#8220;color reproduction 
accuracy is inherently unreliable for any photographic or video recording, regardless 
of domain or medium. Color levels, saturation, and related properties do not provide 
conclusive evidence of image manipulation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sri Lanka experts Dr De Silva and Mr Hewawitharana stated that the lack of audio 
synchronization with the video indicated manipulation.  However, Mr Spivack 
stated, &#8220;video/audio synchronization for both events ranges from an audio delay of 
0.068 to 0.122 seconds, well within acceptable limits. Again, as previously noted, 
audio and video quantization processes occur independently and the two tracks are 
synchronized and multiplexed in a separate process. Audio may be &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the 
video or it may be delayed, subject to a number of variables.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sri Lanka expert Dr De Silva stated that there was no evidence of wind in the video 
footage, but it was present on the audio.  Mr Spivack stated that there &#8220;is compelling 
visible evidence of wind activity corresponding to wind noise in the audio track, 
particularly at frame 333 as the individual operating the camera changed the position 
of the camera radically as a gust of wind was audible. Further, a cloud of what 
appears to be aerosolized biological material is visible  drifting back toward the 
second shooter as wind gusts are also audible.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>288  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Sri Lanka expert Major Bandara stated that the bloodstains did not spread in a 
consistent manner.  Mr Spivack stated, &#8220;Both the surface topography and level of 
water saturation appear to be highly variable in the area where bodies are present. It 
is quite true that the bloodstains would have individual characteristics. This is to be 
expected; in fact, it would be far more suspect if all the bloodstains appeared to be 
identical. Such a condition would be suggestive of effects inserted in a &#8220;copy and 
paste&#8221; manner.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>37. Mr Spivack noted two elements that he could not explain on the basis of the video 
he reviewed: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; He noted that the metadata retrieved from the video indicated that the encoded date 
was set at 17 July 2009.  This date is not determinative, however, as the Philips 
mobile phone devices sold in Sri Lanka permit the user to set the date and time on 
the phone. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; At the end of the recording, there are 17 frames consisting of a red background with 
a white uppercase &#8220;A&#8221;.  Mr Spivack stated that, &#8220;Without access to the specific 
device that generated this recording, it is not possible to determine if this text or title 
feature is consistent with the normal operation of the device using default settings, 
user defined settings, as a consequence of device malfunction, or as a characteristic 
of proprietary transfer and/or conversion software.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>  Expert 2: Daniel Spitz 
</p>
<p> 38. Dr Spitz, MD, is a specialist in forensic pathology and toxicology.  He is the 
Chief Medical Examiner for Macomb County and St Claire County in Michigan, and 
Clinical Assistant Professor of Pathology, Wayne State University School of Medicine.  He 
is also an Adjunct Instructor at Macomb Community College, a Clinical Educator at 
Michigan State University School of Medicine, and a Staff Physician at Port Huron 
Hospital.  He is Board-certified in Anatomic, Clinical and Forensic Pathology by the 
American Board of Pathology, is on the Board of Editors of the American Journal of 
Forensic Medicine and Pathology, and has authored several book chapters, numerous 
original articles and abstracts. He is the co-author of <i>Medicolegal Investigation of Death 
</i>(4th edition, 2006), and <i>Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology</i> (2nd edition, 2009). 
</p>
<p> 39. Dr Spitz summarizes his findings as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;[T]he footage shown in this video appears authentic, especially with respect to the 
two individuals who are shown being shot in the head at close range by assailants 
using high powered assault rifles.  The body reaction, movement and blood evidence 
of both victims are entirely consistent with what you would expect with execution 
type shootings. Furthermore, it appears that the other 8 apparently deceased 
individuals are also victims of homicidal violence . . . &#8220;. 
</p>
<p> 40. While the testimony of Sri Lanka&#8217;s expert, Major A.P. Bandara stated that the 
physical response of the second gunshot victim was an indication that the video was fake, 
Dr Spitz stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;As the victim is shot, he immediately collapses backwards, but appears to tense his 
body with contraction of his torso and lower extremity musculature. A large gush of 
blood pours from the back of his head and onto the ground behind his body.  Over 
the next several seconds, his muscles relax and his back and head then come in 
complete contact with the ground. Blood continues to saturate the area under and 
around his head. This reaction is quite typical is an individual who sustains a 
gunshot wound to the head. The initial response to such trauma is often intense </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>289 
</b></p>
<p>contraction of the skeletal muscles followed by relaxation over the next several 
seconds.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 41. In addition, Dr Spitz notes two questions which his inquiries were not able to 
resolve.  These relate to body movements by two of the other apparently deceased victims, 
which he could not explain on the basis of the information shown on the video.  
</p>
<p>  Expert 3: Peter Diaczuk 
</p>
<p> 42. Mr Diaczuk is an expert in the scientific examination of firearm evidence and 
crime scene reconstruction.  He is the Director of Forensic Science Training at the Center 
for Modern Forensic Practice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of 
New York.  He is qualified as an expert witness on firearms, trace evidence, and crime 
scene reconstruction for courts in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  He is a 
Certified Firearms Instructor, and is the current President of the New York Microscopical 
Society, on the Board of Directors of the Northeastern Association of Forensic Scientists, 
and a member of the American Society of Testing and Materials and the American 
Academy of Forensic Sciences.   
</p>
<p> 43. Mr Diaczuk concluded that, &#8220;from the videos that I took of an AK-47 class 
rifle being fired from both hip and shoulder, I am convinced that the minimal recoil seen in 
the video submitted was accurate for an adult male holding and firing a Kalashnikov class 
firearm.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 44. Mr Diaczuk&#8217;s findings with respect to the first apparent shooting in the video 
were: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;At the moment of discharge of the firearm, at frame #41, it moves rearward, as do 
the shooter&#8217;s arms, as seen clearly by both of the elbows suddenly jerking rearward 
and then forward again in the next frame, #42. When the firearm moves rearward as 
a result of the recoil from discharge, it appears to move in-line with how it was held, 
and then forward again in the same linear fashion.  This is consistent with how a 
shooter anticipates recoil and recovers after firing the shot. Accompanying the 
discharge is the plume of high-pressure gases that is expelled from the muzzle, 
visible to the left and lower left of frame # 41.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The recoil and the high-pressure gases (muzzle blast) &#8220;are indicative of firing live 
ammunition.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>&#8226; In frame # 41, the apparent victim&#8217;s head &#8220;lurches forward (away from the muzzle)&#8221; 
at the moment of discharge.  &#8220;This lurching forward is so sudden that the excess 
cloth used to tie the blindfold is seen to move from what was merely gravity-
positioned, to an airborne position.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Coinciding with the firearm discharge and forward head movement of the person 
seated in the foreground is the sudden body movement by the person lying directly 
in front of him.&#8221;  This movement could be due to the bullet passing through the 
body of the first person and hitting the second, as &#8220;the energy and ability of the 
bullet from the Kalashnikov class of firearms to pass through considerable obstacles 
is well known&#8230; I can state from experience that bullets fired from an AK-47 
firearm, using 7.62 x 39 mm full metal jacket ammunition, have gone through 6 
inches of wood consistently.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 45. With respect to the second apparent shooting, Mr Diaczuk found that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;At the moment of discharge of the firearm, both excess cloth &#8220;tails&#8221; of the blindfold 
on the victim move suddenly to the side&#8230; The sudden movement of the blindfold is 
consistent with the turbulence generated from high-pressure gases that are expelled </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>290  
</b></p>
<p>from the muzzle at discharge.  The firearm (and the sling attached to its fore end) 
clearly moves rearward and slightly upward in the same frame that shows the 
blindfold movement (i.e. when the shot was fired).  In this shooting, the shooter is 
apparently holding the firearm to his shoulder, which provides the pivot point 
causing the muzzle to rise slightly in addition to its rearward movement. This is 
fully consistent with the discharge of a live cartridge and not a blank cartridge.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is a visible defect that develops in the victim&#8217;s head on the left side above his 
ear.  This occurs in the same frame as the firearm is discharged, and appears to 
worsen in the following frame.&#8221; 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Sri Lanka dated 6 January 2010  
</b></p>
<p>1011. I write with reference to your letter dated 05th January 2010 addressed to H.E. Mrs 
Kshenuka Senewiratne, the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the 
UN at Geneva, conveying your intent to make the &#8220;Technical Note&#8221; on the examination of 
the so-called &#8220;Channel 4 Video tape&#8221; by &#8220;three independent experts&#8221; available by means of 
a public statement in New York on 07th January 2010.  Let me add that your letter though 
dated 05th January appears to have been transmitted only after the end of working hours on 
that day to our Mission, so that the document reached Colombo in turn only late this 
evening.  
</p>
<p>1012. The justification cited by you for your proposed statement, is the public nature of the 
comments exchanged on this matter. I wish to observe in this regard that the very nature of 
the material required the Government of Sri Lanka should also make known its stance 
through the public domain.  Had the so called &#8220;Channel 4 Video tape&#8221; been transmitted to 
the Sri Lankan Government through privileged and non public channels, my authorities 
would have surely have opted to share their findings on the authenticity of the material in 
the same manner. However, as it so happened, Channel 4 telecast the material, leaving the 
Government no choice other than that of also going before the public with its refutation.  
</p>
<p>1013. It is therefore submitted that the &#8220;public nature of the comments already exchanged&#8221; 
cannot be a justification for a public statement. Rather, fair practice and the unbiased 
assessment of allegations would require that whatever determinations have been reached by 
the &#8220;three independent experts&#8221;, should first be shared with the Government of Sri Lanka. 
Thereafter, the Government needs to be afforded adequate time to review any fresh material 
that may have come up, with a view to then responding in respect of the same. The space 
between the receipt of the &#8220;Technical Note&#8221; at 1800 hrs. in Colombo on 06th January and 
the scheduling of the public statement in New York on 07th January, hardly constitutes any 
yardstick, a reasonable amount of time for a response with a considered position from our 
side.  
</p>
<p>1014. In view of the above, I request that you kindly defer whatever public statement you 
propose to make, so that the Government is enabled to communicate its views on the 
&#8220;Technical Note&#8221;. It would be proper we believe for you to take these views into account, 
prior to deciding on any further course of action.   
</p>
<p>1015. While I do look forward to your positive response to this letter, I must also mention 
my concern in the event of what is a palpably fair and reasonable request being turned 
down, such a course of action would be perceived as yet another example of biased pre-
judgement.  
</p>
<p>1016. Please accept Mr Special Rapporteur, the assurance of my high consideration.

<p><b>  Press Release by the Special Rapporteur dated 7 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>  UN expert concludes that Sri Lankan video is authentic, calls for an independent war 
crimes investigation <b> 
</b></p>
<p>1017. GENEVA -- Reports by three independent experts strongly point to the authenticity 
of a videotape released by Channel 4 in Britain which appears to show the summary 
execution of bound, blindfolded, and naked Tamils by Sri Lankan soldiers. This was 
announced today by the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Philip Alston, on the basis of detailed analyses conducted by recognized experts 
in forensic pathology, forensic video analysis, and firearm evidence. 
</p>
<p>1018. Alston commissioned the three reports following the publication of four opinions by 
Sri Lankan experts, all of which concluded that the video was a fake. The Government of 
Sri Lanka informed the UN Human Rights Council that it would therefore not be 
undertaking any investigation of the allegations made. &#8220;Senior Government officials called 
upon me to apologize and to withdraw the allegations,&#8221; said Alston. &#8220;They also criticized 
me for not having undertaken my own technical analysis. In response to that criticism and 
to what seemed to me the patent inadequacies of the reports commissioned by the 
Government (two of which were prepared by officials of the Sri Lankan army), I requested 
highly qualified and totally independent experts to undertake evaluations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1019. Alston released the full text of the expert opinions in a &#8220;Technical Note&#8221; made 
public in New York today. &#8220;Together, the reports by these experts strongly suggest that the 
video is authentic,&#8221; Alston stated. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Given these conclusions, and in light of the persistent flow of other allegations of 
extrajudicial executions by both sides during the closing phases of the war against 
the LTTE, I call for the establishment of an independent inquiry to carry out an 
impartial investigation into war crimes and other grave violations of international 
humanitarian and human rights law allegedly committed in Sri Lanka.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1020. Alston summarized the key findings of the experts: 
</p>
<p>1021. Mr Peter Diaczuk, an expert in firearms evidence, concluded that the recoil, 
movement of the weapon and the shooter, and the gases expelled from the muzzle in both 
apparent shootings were consistent with firing live ammunition, and not with shooting 
blank cartridges.  
</p>
<p>1022. Dr Daniel Spitz, a prominent forensic pathologist, found that the footage appeared 
authentic, especially with respect to the two individuals who are shown being shot in the 
head at close range. He found that the body reaction, movement, and blood evidence was 
entirely consistent with what would be expected in such shootings. 
</p>
<p>1023. Mr Jeff Spivack, an expert in forensic video analysis, found no evidence of breaks in 
continuity in the video, no additional video layers, and no evidence of image manipulation. 
</p>
<p>1024. Alston added that the independent experts&#8217; analyses also systematically rebutted 
most of the arguments relied upon by Sri Lanka&#8217;s experts in support of their contention that 
the video was faked. He gave the following examples: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; (a) A Sri Lankan expert stated that there was no recoil or movement of the weapon 
discharged. However, Mr Spivack and Mr Diaczuk described the recoil visible on 
the video, and the way in which the movement was consistent with firing live 
ammunition.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>292  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; (b) A Sri Lankan expert stated that the lack of audio synchronization with the video 
indicated manipulation. However, Mr Spivack stated that the video/audio 
synchronization in the video was well within acceptable limits, and that audio can be 
ahead or behind video, subject to various variables.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (c) A Sri Lankan expert stated that the movement of the second victim after being 
shot was not consistent with the normal expected reaction. However, Mr Spitz stated 
that the movement was entirely consistent with the manner in which the individual 
was apparently shot.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (d) A Sri Lankan expert stated that while wind could be heard on the audio, it was 
not evident in the video. Mr Spivack however described multiple places in the video 
where there is clear evidence of wind.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; (e) Sri Lanka&#8217;s experts argued that the footage was likely to have been recorded on a 
digital camcorder, and not a mobile phone. Mr Spivack concluded that the metadata 
he retrieved from the video was entirely consistent with multimedia files produced 
by mobile phones with video recording capability, and that it would have been very 
difficult to alter the metadata.  
</p>
<p>1025. There are a small number of characteristics of the video which the experts were 
unable to explain. These included the movement of certain victims in the video, 17 frames 
at the end of the video, and the date of 17 July 2009 encoded in the video. Each of these 
characteristics can, however, be explained in a manner entirely consistent with the 
conclusion that the videotape appears to be authentic. 
</p>
<p>1026. In sum, while there are some unexplained elements in the video, there are strong 
indications of its authenticity. In addition, most of the arguments relied upon by the 
Government of Sri Lanka to impugn the video have been shown to be flawed.

<p>1027. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the situation of Ms. Frederica 
Jansz, and Ms. Munza Mushataq and staff members of the Sunday Leader weekly 
newspaper, an investigative newspaper which often reports on cases of alleged corruption

<p> <b>293 
</b></p>
<p>January 2009, a letter of allegation on the killing of Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga, founder 
and former Editor-in-Chief of the Sunday Leader. We acknowledge receipt of the responses 
of your Excellency&#8217;s Government dated 11 February 2009 and 9 July 2009. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received:  
</p>
<p> On 22 October 2009, Ms. Jansz and Ms. Mushataq reportedly received death 
threat letters. The letters, handwritten in red ink, stated the following: &#8220;if you write 
anymore, we will kill you, slice you into pieces&#8221;. Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga was 
killed in January 2009 after having received a similar red ink handwritten death 
threat letter. 
</p>
<p> These new threats occurred following the publication on 18 October 2009, of 
an article by the Sunday Leader in relation to a video allegedly showing Sri Lankan 
soldiers executing Tamil prisoners and denounced as a fake by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government.  
</p>
<p> Ms. Jansz and Ms. Mushataq reported the threats to the Inspector General of 
Police and to the police in Colombo.  
</p>
<p> It is further reported that staff members of the Sunday Leader have been 
threatened on many occasions and the premises of the newspaper burnt down and 
bombed several times.  
</p>
<p> Grave concern is expressed that these new threats may be directly related to 
the legitimate work of Ms. Jansz and Ms. Mushataq and the staff members of the 
<i>Sunday Leader</i> in defense of human rights. Given the content of the letters and the 
killing of Mr. Wickrematunga, further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Jansz and Ms. Mushataq and all staff of the <i>Sunday 
Leader</i>.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, we would like to reiterate our concern regarding the number of 
abductions, physical attacks, death threats, killings and acts of intimidation against 
journalists, and the ensuing lack of prosecutions of alleged perpetrators, which has 
previously been conveyed to your Excellency&#8217;s Government, including the most 
recent urgent appeal sent on 15 October 2009 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>1029. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the relevant principles of international law.  Article 
6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that every 
individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by 
law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. 
</p>
<p>1030. With respect to the death threats received by Ms. Jansz and Ms. Mushataq, we 
would like to recall that your Excellency&#8217;s Government has an obligation under Art 2(1) of 
the ICCPR to &#8220;ensure to all individuals within its territory&#8221; the right to life.  As explained 
by the Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31, Nature of the General Legal 
Obligation on States Parties to the Covenant, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13 (2004), 
this positive obligation to ensure the right to life: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just 
against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed 
by private persons ...  There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure 
Covenant rights as required by article 2 would give rise to violations by States 
Parties of those rights, as a result of States Parties' permitting or failing to take </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>294  
</b></p>
<p>appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or 
redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1031. These due diligence obligations to take all appropriate measures to deter and prevent 
extrajudicial executions may be breached where, for example, state authorities do not react 
promptly to reliable reports, the relevant legal remedies are ineffective or non-existent, 
authorities do not act to clarify a situation in the face of reliable evidence, or it takes no 
action to establish individual responsibility (See Vel&#225;squez Rodriguez v. Honduras, Annual 
Report of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, OAS/Ser. l./V./III.19, doc. 13 
(1988), 28 ILM (1989) 291; Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, E/CN.4/2005/7, paras 71-73).   
</p>
<p>1032. In this connection, we would like to refer your Excellency's Government to the 
fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state 
that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to 
protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by 
adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, 
economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that 
all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to 
enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1033. Furthermore, we would like to bring to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government the following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, point a) which provides that everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as 
to how those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or 
administrative systems. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to 
study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in 
practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other 
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of 
everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary 
action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting 
against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by 
omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or 
individuals that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>1034. We should also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the above mentioned 
persons, in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>295 
</b></p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reiterated in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right 
to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in 
print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1035. We also deem it appropriate to make reference to paragraph 3 of Human Rights 
Resolution 12/16, which states that the Council is deeply concerned that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; (a) violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression continue to occur, 
often with impunity, including extrajudicial killings, intimidation, persecution and 
harassment, threats and acts of violence against persons who exercise, seek to 
promote or defend these rights, including journalists, writers, and human rights 
defenders; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; (c) threats and acts of violence, including killings and attacks, particularly directed 
against journalists, have increased and are not adequately punished, in particular in 
those circumstances where public authorities are involved in committing those acts.  
</p>
<p>1036. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>1037. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned persons in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>1038. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to these cases. If 
no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been or will be 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been or will be 
imposed on the alleged perpetrators?

</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 31 December 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>1039. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning Mr. <b>Wanni Athapaththu 
Mudiyanselage</b> <b>Nilantha Saman Kumara</b>, aged 31. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> On 26 October 2009, Mr. Kumara joined several villagers outside a shop by 
the Nahettigkulama jam tree in Galgamuwa to search the jungle for some goods 
which had been stolen. A few hours later, he was stopped by the police and asked to 
accompany them to the Galgamuwa Police Station. Upon arrival at the station, he 
was detained without a warrant or formal charges against him.  
</p>
<p> Two hours later, he was taken to a room in what appeared to be the private 
wing of the police residential barracks behind the Crimes Division. Mr. Kumara was 
interrogated by Inspector Ataputtu, Police Constable Wijeratne and other officers, all 
dressed in civilian clothes. The police indicated that he had been detained on 
suspicion of theft at the shop and of a water pump, charges which Mr. Kumara 
denied. 
</p>
<p> Subsequently, Mr. Kumara was subjected to the &#8220;Palestinian hanging&#8221;, 
whereby his shirt was removed, his lower arms were wrapped in cloth, his hands 
were forced behind his back and tied with a rope which was attached to a nylon rope 
that hung from a bean in the ceiling. The other end of the nylon rope was secured to 
a steel bed. Mr. Kumara was then told to stand on a box; the rope was pulled tight 
and the box was then kicked from under his feet, leaving him hanging. Inspector 
Ataputtu gave orders to the other officers to leave Mr. Kumara hanging until he 
confessed to the crimes. He was taken down approximately two hours later, but the 
procedure was repeated that evening. The second time, he was released after 
approximately 30 minutes, but was then beaten and kicked for three hours. Although 
by this time the police had allegedly received information indicating that Mr. 
Kumara had not been involved in the theft at the shop, he was still accused of 
steeling a water pump.  
</p>
<p> The following day, Mr. Kumara was once again hung for approximately two 
hours. Although he needed medical attention, none was provided. That evening, 
Inspector Atapattu told Mr. Kumara that he could be released the following day if he 
confessed; otherwise, he would be presented before the court. When Mr. Kumara 
denied his involvement, he was grabbed by the hair and dragged to the same room 
where he was beaten and stripped, and his hands were tied. He was then subjected to 
the &#8220;Dharma Chakra&#8221; or wheel of enlightenment, by which he was forced to squat 
and wrap his hands over his knees, while a metal pipe was inserted through the 
space between his knees and elbows, and was balanced on two tables. While in this 
position, a bottle of petrol was poured in his anus. Water was also poured on him to 
relax the muscles.  
</p>
<p> On 28 October, Mr. Kumara&#8217;s cellmate was ordered to bathe and dress him, 
since he could not move his arms. They were both taken to the Criminal Division, 
but a statement was only taken from Mr. Kumara&#8217;s cellmate. They were then taken 
to the Out-Patient Department of Galgamuwa Hospital, where a physician, Dr. Roja, 
completed a Medico-Legal Examination Form without examining Mr. Kumara.  
</p>
<p> Afterwards, Mr. Kumara and his cellmate were taken to the Magistrate&#8217;s 
Court in Galgamuwa. They were not allowed to inform their families or contact a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>297 
</b></p>
<p>lawyer. Mr. Kumara was not questioned or addressed by the magistrate, but was 
remanded. He was then transferred to Wariyapola Prison, where he informed the 
guards about his torture and signed a statement indicating his experience. 
</p>
<p> The following day, Mr. Kumara was taken to Wariyapola Hospital. The 
accompanying officer informed the doctor of the torture, but the doctor reportedly 
accused Mr. Kumara of lying and refused to examine him.  
</p>
<p> On 6 November, Mr. Kumara was presented before the Galgamuwa 
Magistrate&#8217;s Court. He was released on bail. Three days after, Mr. Kumara went to 
the Galgamuwa Hospital, but Dr. Roja once again refused to examine him and 
indicated that he should go to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Mr. Kumara 
went there the following day, where he received adequate treatment and was 
examined by a Judicial Medical Officer. 
</p>
<p> On 17 November, one of the alleged perpetrators visited Mr. Kumara at his 
home to inquire into the possible action he was intending to take. On 19 November, 
Mr. Kumara submitted a complaint to the Inspector General of Police, the National 
Police Commission, the Attorney General and the National Human Rights 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>1040. Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, we should 
like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances of 
the arrest, detention at the police station and remand to detention in prison of Mr. Kumara. 
We would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p>1041. In this context, we would like to draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s attention to 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1042. We would further like to draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s attention to Article 
13 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (Convention against Torture), which requires that &#8220;Each State Party shall 
ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory 
under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and 
impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the 
complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a 
consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.&#8221; In this context, we would also like to 
draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 6 b and e of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 8/8 adopted in June 2008 which urges States &#8220;to take persistent, 
determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent 
national authority, to hold persons, who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of 
torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely punished, including the 
officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been 
committed [&#8230;] and &#8220;to ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate compensation 
and receive appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation [&#8230;].  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>298  
</b></p>
<p>1043. With regard to the alleged denial of adequate medical treatment and proper 
diagnosis of the injuries suffered by Mr. Kumara, we would like to draw the attention of 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;Sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall 
be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. &#8230;&#8221;. Furthermore, Rule 25(1) 
provides that, &#8220;The medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of 
the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any 
prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; (Approved by the Economic and 
Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 
1977.) 
</p>
<p>1044. With regard to the alleged denial of assistance by legal counsel during the hearing 
before the Magistrate&#8217;s Court in Galgamuwa, we would like to refer your Excellency's 
Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United 
Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, 
Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in particular:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 5. Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by 
the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 7. Governments shall further ensure that all persons arrested or       
detained, with or without criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and 
in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.  
</p>
<p>1045. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and that 
accountability of those guilty of the alleged torture and denial of medical treatment is 
ensured. We also request that your Government adopt effective measures to protect Mr. 
Kumara against intimidation by those involved in his torture.  
</p>
<p>1046. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they 
have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. In the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, please provide the full 
details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken; Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide the details of the measures adopted by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to protect Mr. Kumara against intimidation by those involved in his 
torture.

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 18 December 2009  
</b></p>
<p>1047. I write to your Excellency&#8217;s Government with regard to the circumstances of the 
death of three senior representatives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Mr. 
<b>Balasingham Nadeshan</b>, Mr. <b>Seevaratnam Pulidevan</b> and Mr.<b> Ramesh</b>, as well as of 
members of their families, in the night of 17 to 18 May 2009.   
</p>
<p> According to information I have received:  
</p>
<p> On 17 May 2009, the day before your Excellency&#8217;s Government announced 
that its forces had completely defeated the LTTE, Messrs. Nadeshan, Pulidevan and 
Ramesh were trapped with other senior cadres of the LTTE in a small area north of 
Vellamullivaikkal. Through intermediaries they sought to establish contact with 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to inquire how they could surrender to the Sri Lanka 
Army (SLA). The reply, coming from the Secretary of Defense in your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government and from a Member of Parliament who is at the same time a senior 
adviser to the President, and conveyed through the intermediaries, was that they 
should walk towards the positions of the SLA in a way that made their intentions 
clear and holding a white cloth. The Commander of the SLA 58th Brigade, the unit 
on the front line with the last LTTE position, however, received a telephone call 
from the Secretary of Defense instructing him to order his forces to shoot those 
surrendering. When Messrs. Nadeshan, Pulidevan and Ramesh walked towards the 
SLA positions carrying white cloths in the first hours of 18 May 2009, soldiers 
opened fire on them and killed them. An unspecified number of family members of 
the three men were killed as well.  
</p>
<p> These allegations were made by the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army at 
the time of the events and subsequent Chief of Defence Staff, (now retired) General 
Gardihewa Sarath Chandralal Fonseka, in an interview to the newspaper <i>The Sunday 
Leader</i>. The accounts of journalists embedded with the SLA 58th Brigade confirm 
some of the alleged circumstances of the death of Messrs. Nadeshan, Pulidevan and 
Ramesh and their families.  
</p>
<p>1048. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, I would like to refer 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to fundamental legal rules applicable to all armed conflicts 
under international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>1049. Common Article 3 (applicable to armed conflict not of an international character) of 
the Geneva Conventions of 1949, to which your Excellency&#8217;s Government is a party, 
dictates that &#8220;[p]ersons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed 
forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, 
wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely [&#8230;]. 
To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a) violence to life and person, in 
particular murder of all kinds&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1050. Similarly, an authoritative study of customary international humanitarian law finds 
that attacking and killing persons who are recognized as <i>hors de combat </i>is prohibited. 
Persons <i>hors de combat </i>include anyone who clearly expresses an intention to surrender, 
provided he or she abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape (Rule 47 of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>300  
</b></p>
<p>the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified in the study of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross). 
</p>
<p>1051. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human Rights 
Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on the death of Messrs. Nadeshan, Pulidevan and Ramesh, as well as of the members of 
their families, I would be grateful for the cooperation and observations of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government, in particular in relation to the following questions:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the allegations summarized above accurate? If not so, please share the 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. What information does your Excellency&#8217;s Government have on the family 
members of Messrs. Nadeshan, Pulidevan and Ramesh allegedly killed on 18 May 
2009? 
</p>
<p>3. Please refer to the results of any military, police, judicial or other inquiry or 
investigation carried out in relation to the allegations summarized above.

the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>1052. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the trial of Messrs. <b>Ishag Al 
Sanosi Juma</b>, <b>Abdulhai Omer Mohamed Al Kalifa</b>, <b>Al Taieb Abdelaziz Ishag, Mustafa 
Adam Mohamed</b> <b>Suleiman, Mohamed Abdelnabi Adam, Saber Zakaria Hasan, Hasan 
Adam Fadel, Adam Ibrahim Al Haj, Jamal Al Deen Issa Al Haj</b>, and <b>Abdulmajeed Ali 
Abdulmajeed</b>, ten men of origin from the Darfur region charged with the murder of Mr. 
Mohamed Taha, the founder and editor-in-chief of the daily Al Wifaq. The ten men were 
arrested in and around Khartoum between 9 September and December 2006 by National 
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) and police forces. On 10 November 2007, a court 
in Khartoum found the ten defendants guilty and sentenced them to death. On 10 March 
2008, the Court of Appeal upheld the verdict of the first instance court. On 26 August 2008, 
the Supreme Court upheld the death sentences for nine of the ten defendants and amended 
the charges against Mr. Al Taieb Abdelaziz Ishag, who was a minor at the time of the 
crime, from murder to harbouring offenders. His sentence was amended to a four-year 
prison term from the date of his arrest, 21 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>1053. The case was brought before the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in August 
</p><p>2008. On 24 November 2008, the Working Group adopted Opinion No. 38/2008. It found 
(paras. 41-45 of Opinion No. 38/2008) that the defendants  </p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;[&#8230;] have not had a fair and public hearing as established in article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All ten defendants [&#8230;] accused of murdering Mr. Mohamed Taha, revoked their 
confessions in court, stating that they had been threatened, intimidated and subjected 
to torture and ill-treatment as a means to compel them to make the incriminating 
statements that the investigators instructed them to make. These statements were 
made during up to four months of incommunicado detention &#8211; without permission of 
access to defence counsel and family visits &#8211; in the police-run Forensic Evidence 
Department and Criminal Investigations Department, as well as in NISS [National 
Investigation and Security Service] detention facilities in Khartoum. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A request was made to the prosecutor heading the investigation for the defendants to 
be medically examined on the grounds that they were feared to have been subjected 
to severe torture. However, the prosecutor and the judge turned down the request 
despite the fact that when the trial proceedings began, many of the defendants still 
bore clearly visible physical traces of injuries and scars on their arms, hands, thighs, 
and shoulders as a result of the alleged torture. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The sentence that condemns the defendants to death is exclusively based on their 
confessions during their incommunicado detention as explained above. The court did 
not consider: i) that the defendants had revoked their confessions and ii) that the 
prosecutor and the judge turned down the request on the medical examination.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1054. In light of these findings of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, we would 
like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles applicable 
to this case under international law.  
</p>
<p>1055. We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that 
in capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the 
guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Sudan is a party and which (pursuant to article 27(3) of Sudan&#8217;s 
Interim National Constitution) is &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights, 
admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to a 
public trial, to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and 
to communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] own choosing&#8221; and the right not to be compelled to 
confess guilt.  
</p>
<p>1056. We recall that &#8220;prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places 
may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment&#8221; (General Assembly 
Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, paragraph 12). Prolonged incommunicado 
detention furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a fair trial, 
such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence.  
</p>
<p>1057. We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence 
that the statement was made. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle 
is an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that &#8220;the prosecutor and the judge turned 
down [requests for the medical examination of the defendants] despite the fact that when 
the trial proceedings began, many of the defendants still bore clearly visible physical traces 
of injuries and scars on their arms, hands, thighs, and shoulders as a result of the alleged 
torture&#8221;. The courts&#8217; reliance on the self-incriminating statements made by the defendants </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>302  
</b></p>
<p>during incommunicado detention in NISS facilities and, allegedly, under torture suggests a 
particularly serious violation of these principles of international law.  
</p>
<p>1058. With regard to the right to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of 
his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 14(3)(b) of the 
Covenant), we would refer your Government to the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and 
the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990. Principle 7 
reads: &#8220;Governments shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or 
without criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later 
than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or detention.&#8221; The Human Rights Committee 
has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused 
must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (General 
Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). The circumstance that the defendants were 
kept up to four months of incommunicado detention, without access to defence counsel, and 
made the statements relied on by the courts during this period, negates the possibility of a 
fair trial.  
</p>
<p>1059. With regard to the right to a public trial, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
noted reports of heavy censorship of public reporting on the trial, which have not been 
disputed by your Excellency&#8217;s Government. According to Opinion No. 38/2008 (para. 21): 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;In addition, there was also a lack of public scrutiny and discussion about the 
investigation and trial. From the beginning of the investigation, the authorities 
imposed a ban on newspapers and media to report on the investigation, in a stated 
effort to prevent influencing the course of justice. Direct censorship of privately-
owned print media by the NISS, a practice used to restrict independent reporting on 
politically sensitive issues, was reinstated systematically from 6 September 2006, 
the day the body of Mr. Mohamed Taha was found. On 1 February 2007, three 
weeks before the start of the trial, the Minister of Justice imposed a new ban on 
publishing stories related to the trial, which applied to all media outlets except the 
state-run SUNA (Sudan News Agency). Papers that published articles on the murder 
trial were temporarily suspended. On 21 February 2007, the presiding judge met 
privately with journalists in order to inform them of a decision by the court to forbid 
photography or any news reporting inside the courtroom by any other outlet than 
SUNA. This measure was in accordance with Article 133 of the Criminal Procedure 
Act of 1991, which allows the court to exclude &#8220;the public generally or any person 
of those attending&#8221; at its discretion. On 12 March 2007 journalists from four Arabic-
language newspapers &#8211; Al Sudani, Akhbar Alyoum, Al Dar, and Al Adwa &#8211; were 
barred entry to the courthouse by the police and were informed that they would be 
forbidden to attend the court session unless they provided a written apology for 
having published commentary on the trial. On 27 March 2007, after protests from 
numerous dailies, the presiding judge granted newspapers the right to factually 
report on the trial without any independent commentary or analysis. However, 
because the gagging order was never definitively retracted and because NISS 
censorship of newspaper contents has continued, journalists have remained uncertain 
about the extent to which they could comment on the trial and have generally erred 
on the side of caution, rather than risk problems with the authorities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1060. These reports raise grave concerns with regard to the enjoyment of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in 
article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. They provide that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>303 
</b></p>
<p>art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; Additionally, as already mentioned above, 
such censorship on the reporting about the trial interferes with the defendants&#8217; right to a 
public trial protected by Article 14(1) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>1061. To summarize, only the full respect for stringent due process guarantees 
distinguishes capital punishment, as permitted by Article 6 of the Covenant &#8220;in countries 
which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, from a summary execution which violates the 
most fundamental human right. We therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take 
all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of Messrs. Ishag Al 
Sanosi Juma, Abdulhai Omer Mohamed Al Kalifa, Al Taieb Abdelaziz Ishag, Mustafa 
Adam Mohamed Suleiman, Mohamed Abdelnabi Adam, Saber Zakaria Hasan, Hasan 
Adam Fadel, Adam Ibrahim Al Haj, Jamal Al Deen Issa Al Haj, and Abdulmajeed Ali 
Abdulmajeed are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, 
this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns we have raised 
are dispelled in their entirety, or the above named men are given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p>1062. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not so, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. Please explain the steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government, in light of 
Opinion No. 38/2008, to grant a retrial to Messrs. Ishag Al Sanosi Juma, Abdulhai 
Omer Mohamed Al Kalifa, Al Taieb Abdelaziz Ishag, Mustafa Adam Mohamed 
Suleiman, Mohamed Abdelnabi Adam, Saber Zakaria Hasan, Hasan Adam Fadel, 
Adam Ibrahim Al Haj, Jamal Al Deen Issa Al Haj, and Abdulmajeed Ali 
Abdulmajeed, or to lift or commute the death sentences imposed against them. 
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to the allegation that the ten defendants were subjected to torture while in 
pre-trial detention. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>4. Please provide details regarding the defendants&#8217; access to legal counsel 
before the trial and please indicate whether the defendants had the possibility to 
communicate in private with their counsels.  
</p>
<p>5. Please provide information as to how the principle that any statement which 
is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made, is implemented in the Sudan. What steps should judges take 
under Sudanese law when confronted with allegations by defendants that they have 
been compelled to make confessions?

</b></p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Sudan has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. </p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 30 December 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>1063. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the cases of Mr. <b>Paul John Kaw</b>, 
Mr. <b>Idris Adam Alyas</b>, Mr.<b> Naser El Din Mohamed Ali Kadaka</b> (referred to as Nasr-al-
Din Ahmad Ali in our previous communication), Mr. <b>Suleiman Juma'a Awad Kambal</b> 
(referred to as Sulayman Jum'a Timbal in our previous communication), Mr. <b>Badawi 
Hassan Ibrahim</b> and Mr. <b>Abdelrahim Ali Al Rahama Mohamed</b> (referred to as Abd-al-
Rahim Ali in our previous communication), six men sentenced to death on murder charges 
related to the killing of 14 policemen in the Soba Aradi internally displaced persons camp 
in May 2005.  
</p>
<p>1064. Following their conviction and sentencing to death on 23 November 2006, on 23 
January 2007 the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture wrote to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
drawing attention to reports that the men had been detained without access to legal counsel 
for five months following their arrest (from May until October 2005), and that they 
confessed to murder charges under torture. Regrettably, we have not received a reply to this 
communication. In the meantime, we have received information on further developments in 
the case, which suggest that the six men&#8217;s execution might be imminent. The recently 
received information also strengthens our concerns that the execution of the men would 
constitute a violation of norms of international law binding for your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government. 
</p>
<p> According to reports recently received: 
</p>
<p> On 11 December 2006, the judge announced the verdict in the presence of the 
families of the victims. The families declared that they refused to spare the lives of 
the condemned in return for payment of diya and asked for retribution in kind, i.e. 
execution of the death sentences.  
</p>
<p> The trial court&#8217;s judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal, 
with the exception of the case of one defendant, Fathi Adam Mohammed Ahmad 
Dahab, who was found guilty of involuntary homicide instead of murder. His 
sentence was reduced from death to five years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p> On 18 July 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences, as did a 
review panel of the Supreme Court on 27 February 2008. From the judgment of the 
Constitutional Court in this case (see below), it would appear that the defendants&#8217; 
lawyers raised the violation of the defendants&#8217; constitutional rights before the 
Supreme Court, including that confessions were obtained under torture, but the 
Supreme Court declined to deal with these complaints. 
</p>
<p> On 13 October 2009, the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal in the case. 
The judgment notes, without further elaboration, that &#8220;allegations of torture were not 
convincing to the lower courts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Supreme Court then granted a one month stay, until 2 December 2009, a 
committee made up of family and traditional leaders to pursue contacts with the 
traditional leaders of the victims&#8217; tribes to seek pardons or acceptance of blood 
money.  These efforts were not successful. The stay of execution currently in force 
expires on 6 January 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>305 
</b></p>
<p>1065. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the reports received, we would 
like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several principles applicable 
to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p>1066. We would in the first place respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that 
in capital punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the 
guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Sudan is a party and which (pursuant to article 27(3) of Sudan&#8217;s 
Interim National Constitution) is &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights, 
admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to 
&#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [one&#8217;s] defence and to 
communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] own choosing&#8221; and the right not to be compelled to 
confess guilt. As the Human Rights Committee has observed, &#8220;[i]n cases involving capital 
punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all 
stages of the proceedings.&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). This 
would not appear to have been the case here, as consistent reports indicate that the 
condemned prisoners were deprived of access to legal counsel for five months following 
their arrest (from May until October 2005), during which, crucially, their confessions were 
obtained. 
</p>
<p>1067. In this respect, we would further like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 20 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/63/166 of 19 February 
2009, which &#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in 
secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all 
States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. 
Prolonged incommunicado detention furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees 
of the right to a fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities 
to prepare one&#8217;s defence. 
</p>
<p>1068. We also recall that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 urges States to 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence 
that the statement was made. In addition to being a key fair trial guarantee, this principle is 
also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, 
inter alia, in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>1069. Finally, we note that the accused were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death 
under Article 130 of the Criminal Act of 1991. Under this provision, the death sentence 
appears to be the only possible punishment for murder, unless the family of the victim 
forgoes retribution in kind and opts for the payment of compensation. This provision would 
appear to deprive the judge of the necessary discretion to tailor the sentence to the specific 
circumstances of the case and of the accused. Inevitably, some accused will be sentenced to 
death even though that sentence is disproportionate to the facts of their crimes, in violation 
of the requirement that only &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221; be punishable by death (article 6(2) 
of the Covenant). Moreover, this provision could be interpreted to give only the victims&#8217; 
families the right to forgo the death penalty, to the exclusion of the right to seek pardon 
from governmental authorities. Such an interpretation would violate article 6(4) of the 
Covenant, which provides that &#8220;[a]nyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek 
pardon or commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence 
of death may be granted in all cases.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1070. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of defendants in 
compliance with the obligations under international law of your Excellency&#8217;s Government, 
as outlined above. This can only mean suspension of the capital punishment until the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>306  
</b></p>
<p>allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this respect 
dispelled. Moreover, international law requires that the accountability of any person guilty 
of subjecting someone to torture is ensured. 
</p>
<p>1071. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on this case to the Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and your

</p>
<p>1. Are the facts reproduced in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in

to investigate the allegations of torture in this case?  
</p>
<p>3. With regard to Article 130 of the Criminal Act of 1991, please explain 
whether in case of a guilty finding on charges under Article 130, the judge can 
impose a prison sentence instead of the death penalty if the family of the victim 
refuses to accept the payment of blood money.  
</p>
<p>4. Please explain the avenues open to Paul John Kaw, Idris Adam Alyas, Nasr-
al-Din Ahmad Ali, Sulayman Jum'a Timbal, Badawi Hasan Ibrahim and Abd-al-

<p><b>Urgent Appeal dated 10 February 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers.  
</p>
<p>1072. On 11 August and 24 September 2008, we wrote to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
in relation to information we received regarding the death sentences imposed by special 
Anti-Terrorism Courts in greater Khartoum against persons convicted on charges connected 
to the attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008 led by the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM). We would now like to follow up to those previous communications, which 
regrettably have remained without a response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government, with 
specific regard to the cases of defendants who allegedly were children at the time of the 
attack on Omdurman. In this context, we would also like to raise more general concerns 
regarding the continued imposition of the death penalty against children in Sudan.   
</p>
<p>1073. In our letter of 11 August 2008, we drew the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to the case of <b>Mahmood Adam Zariba</b>. At the trial, his defence counsel </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>307 
</b></p>
<p>reportedly informed the court that he was aged 16 years at the time of the JEM attack. The 
counter terrorism court, however, reportedly did not grant a medical examination to 
determine his age. Mahmood Adam Zariba was sentenced to death on 31 July 2008 by 
Anti-Terrorism Court 4 in Omdurman, having been found guilty on a range of offences 
under the 1991 Criminal Act, the 1986 Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act and the 
2001 Counter-Terrorism Act. 
</p>
<p>1074.  On 31 July 2008, Anti-Terrorism Court 3 in Bahri (Khartoum North) 
sentenced to death two additional defendants charged in relation with the attacks on 
Omdurman who, according to statements they reportedly made to their defence counsel, 
were aged 17 at the time of the offence. Both <b>Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu</b> and <b>Ishag 
Yaseen Ali Adam</b> (whose mother gave his age as 16) were found to be over the age of 18 
according to the views of a police medical committee. Members of the committee testified 
that the determination of Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu&#8217;s age was based on the colour and 
number of his teeth; the committee testified that this methodology was also used in the case 
of Ishag Yaseen Ali Adam, as was an assessment of the deepness of his voice and an 
examination of his armpits for underarm hair. The court reportedly did not take into account 
doubt cast on the methodology of the medical committee during cross examination, and 
defence counsel were reportedly denied access to the prosecution&#8217;s evidence submissions of 
the committee&#8217;s findings.  
</p>
<p>1075. On 20 May 2009, Anti-Terrorism Court 3 in Bahri (Khartoum North) sentenced to 
death four additional defendants charged in relation with the attacks on Omdurman who, 
according to statements they reportedly made to their defence counsel, were aged 17 at the 
time of the offence. They are <b>Abdelsalam Yahya Abdallah Adam, Mohamed Al Duma 
Yahya Abaker, Mohamed Al Taib Mustafa Al Sanousi</b>, and <b>Mansour Ibrahim Abaker 
Hashim</b>. All four were found to be over the age of 18 according to the views of a police 
medical committee. Members of the committee testified in court that the defendants were 
not minors, but allegedly gave no details of the medical examinations conducted to allow 
them to reach this conclusion. Defence counsel challenged the adequacy of the medical 
examinations, but the court did not conduct any further inquiry. While the authorities have 
denied that any minors were sentenced to death in these trials, they have never produced 
court records nor medical certificates to show that adequate medical examinations had been 
conducted to assess the age of the above four defendants. The information received 
indicates that under Sudanese law neither the defence lawyers nor the interested public can 
demand disclosure of the court records in this respect. 
</p>
<p>1076. The case of <b>Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam</b>, raised in the communication 
of 24 September 2008, is different from those described above in that the Khartoum Anti-
Terrorism Court which sentenced him to death on 17 August 2008, reportedly accepted his 
birth certificate, showing him to have been aged 17 at the time of the offence, as valid 
documentation of his age. The court, however, found him guilty of hiraba, or brigandage 
(Article 167 of the Sudanese Criminal Act), a hudud offence, and concluded that he could 
be sentenced to death in spite of his age. Article 27(2) of the Sudanese Criminal Act allows 
the death penalty to be applied for hudud crimes regardless of age. 
</p>
<p>1077. As mentioned in our communications of 11 August and 24 September 2008, reports 
(which have remained unchallenged by your Excellency&#8217;s Government) indicate that the 
defendants in the trials concerning the attacks against Omdurman were held without access 
to the outside world after their apprehension and were not given access to lawyers until 
after the trial proceedings opened. 
</p>
<p>1078. Turning to the general question of the imposition and execution of the death penalty 
for offences committed by children, our attention has been drawn to the case of 
<b>Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed</b>. According to the information received with regard 
to this case: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>308  
</b></p>
<p> On 3 May 2007, Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed, aged 17 at the time of 
the trial, was found guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced to death by the 
Nyala General Court in South Darfur. The Court reasoned that the Interim National 
Constitution and the 1991 Criminal Act excluded hudud offences from the general 
ban against the death penalty for offenders aged less than 18 years at the time of the 
crime. The court concluded that, as the provisions of the Sudanese Constitution 
prevail over the provisions of any other domestic law, the victim&#8217;s family&#8217;s right to 
retribution (qisas) prevails over the 2004 Child Act which prohibits the death 
penalty for offences committed by minors.  
</p>
<p> On appeal, the Nyala Appellate Court quashed the judgment and returned the 
case for reconsideration to the Nyala General Court. The Appeals Court argued that, 
although the child had been found guilty of murder, the imposition of the death 
sentence was not permissible according to the Child Act 2004. It instructed the 
Nyala General Court to apply the appropriate alternative measures stipulated in the 
Child Act, and to decide on the compensation (blood money) for the family of the 
deceased.  
</p>
<p> The victim&#8217;s family, however, refused to accept compensation (blood money) 
as an alternative punishment for the offence, and appealed the Nyala Appellate 
Court&#8217;s decision instead.  
</p>
<p> The case thus reached the Supreme Court in Khartoum, which in December 
2008 confirmed the decision of the Nyala General Court and the death sentence 
against Abdulrahaman Zakaria Mohammed. The Supreme Court based its decision 
on two arguments. First, it found that under both the Constitution and the 1991 
Criminal Act the prohibition of the death penalty for children and those above age 
seventy did not extend to hudud offences. Second, the Supreme Court found that the 
definition of a child should be drawn from the definition of &#8220;adult&#8221; provided in the 
Criminal Act. According to the Criminal Act, &#8220;adult means any person whose 
puberty has been established by definite natural features and who has completed 
fifteen years of age, and whoever attains eighteen years of age shall be deemed an 
adult even if the features of puberty do not appear&#8221;. Therefore, as long as the 
defendant had reached 15 years of age and the natural puberty features had been 
established, the Criminal Act provisions applicable to adults should be applied, 
rather than the Child Act.  The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Nyala 
General Court and confirmed the death sentence against Abdulrahman Zakaria 
Mohammed.  
</p>
<p> Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed was executed in El Fasher, North Darfur, 
on 14 May 2009. 
</p>
<p>1079. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, we 
would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fact that article 
37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Sudan is a Party, expressly 
provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons 
below eighteen years of age. In addition, article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a Party as well, provides that the death penalty shall 
not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In 
application of these norms, in August 2007 the Human Rights Committee called on your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to &#8220;guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied to 
persons aged under 18 years&#8221; (Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee, 
CCPR/C/SDN/CO/3/CRP.1, para 20). These provisions are unequivocal and admit no 
exception. We must stress that, for the purposes of your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
obligation under international law, the distinction between hudud, ta&#8217;azir and qisas offences 
is immaterial. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and article 6(5) of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>309 
</b></p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights apply &#8211; and bind your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government &#8211; irrespective of this distinction in the law of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>1080. With regard to the Supreme Court&#8217;s reliance on the Criminal Act&#8217;s provision that, in 
the case of those who have attained 15 years of age, adulthood is defined by natural 
features, we would like to again draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to its 
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While the Convention leaves 
room in article 1 for the setting of an age below 18 years for the attainment of majority for 
specific purposes, this is not in fact the case in relation to the death penalty. To the 
contrary, the Convention is absolutely clear in article 37 (a) in establishing 18 years as the 
minimum age attained at the time of the relevant crime in order for an individual to be 
potentially subject to the death penalty in those jurisdictions that have retained it. Unlike 
other provisions of the Convention, this prohibition is not flexible when account is taken of 
the individual development and maturity of the offender. The International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights similarly admits no flexibility in terms of execution of the death 
penalty for persons under eighteen years of age. 
</p>
<p>1081. As to the cases of Abdelsalam Yahya Abdallah Adam, Mohamed Al Duma Yahya 
Abaker, Mohamed Al Taib Mustafa Al Sanousi, and Mansour Ibrahim Abaker Hashim, 
who were sentenced to death by Anti-Terrorism Court 3 in Bahri (Khartoum) on 20 May 
2009, we note that where a genuine dispute about the age of a criminal defendant exists, the 
Government is obligated to give the benefit of any doubt to the individual concerned.  
Moreover, to the extent that the age of these four accused at the time of the attack on 
Omdurman is decisive for the sanction imposed against them by the courts, they are entitled 
to a determination of their age in full compliance with fair trial principles. These include 
the right to an impartial tribunal and to have witnesses (including medical expert witnesses) 
on their behalf called and examined under the same conditions as witnesses against them, as 
provided in article 14 of the Covenant, paragraphs 1 and 3. If it were accurate that the 
courts relied exclusively on a report by a police medical committee for the determination of 
the defendants&#8217; age, which defence counsel did not have access to, and did not request 
independent medical examination, fair trial principles would have been gravely violated.  
</p>
<p>1082. Similarly, it would be incompatible with the right to a fair trial if it were accurate 
that, as reported, the lawyers of Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu, Ishag Yaseen Ali Adam, 
Abdelsalam Yahya Abdallah Adam, Mohamed Al Duma Yahya Abaker, Mohamed Al Taib 
Mustafa Al Sanousi, and Mansour Ibrahim Abaker Hashim were not allowed to see either 
the results of the alleged medical examination or their clients before the first trial hearing. 
According to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, Governments shall ensure that 
&#8220;all persons arrested or detained, with or without criminal charge, shall have prompt access 
to a lawyer, and in any case not later than forty-eight hours from the time of arrest or 
detention&#8221; (Principle 7). The Principles also stipulate that &#8220;[i]t is the duty of the competent 
authorities to ensure lawyers access to appropriate information, files and documents in their 
possession or control in sufficient time to enable lawyers to provide effective legal 
assistance to their clients. Such access should be provided at the earliest appropriate time.&#8221; 
(Principle 21). Both provisions highlight key aspects of the right to have adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of one&#8217;s defence and to communicate with counsel of his own 
choosing enshrined in article 14(3)(b) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>1083. In view of the urgency of this matter and of the irreversibility of the punishment of 
the death penalty, it is imperative that your Excellency&#8217;s Government take all steps 
necessary to prevent the execution of Messrs. Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu, Ishag Yaseen 
Ali Adam, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, Mahmood Adam Zariba, Abdelsalam 
Yahya Abdallah Adam, Mohamed Al Duma Yahya Abaker, Mohamed Al Taib Mustafa Al 
Sanousi, and Mansour Ibrahim Abaker Hashim. We therefore again urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to expeditiously lift or commute the death sentences imposed against them by </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter sent on 28 August 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1085. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Government&#8217;s attention 
information we have received regarding the targeting and burning of schools, school 
closures, murder and mutilation of, and threats against, teachers and students in certain 
districts in Southern Thailand (Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and five districts of Songkhla). 
</p>
<p> According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> For the past five years a separatist insurgency has raged in these four 
predominately Muslim provinces in Southern Thailand (Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, 
and five districts of Songkhla). Security forces have allegedly struggled 
unsuccessfully to protect schools, teachers, and students against attacks by the 
insurgents with the result that schools have often been shut down in many districts 
or even entire provinces.  
</p>
<p> During the night of 4 January 2004, groups of separatist militants burned 
down 20 government schools in Narathiwat in a series of near-simultaneous attacks. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>311 
</b></p>
<p>By 27 January 2004, nearly 700 schools (out of the total 925) across the southern 
border provinces had to be shut down temporarily as a result of growing fears of 
insurgent attacks.  
</p>
<p> It is further reported that on 13 June 2007, militants burned down 11 schools 
in Yala province&#8217;s Raman district, apparently in retaliation for the murder of 
Abdulraman Sama, age 60, a respected Muslim religious teacher. More than 500 
Muslim women and children blocked a highway in front of a mosque in Raman 
district in protest of his killing, accusing government security forces of 
responsibility. Fears of further reprisal attacks on schools led to the closure of 60 
other schools. 
</p>
<p> Over the past five years, there have also been many reported attacks on 
mosques and Muslim schools (ponoh). There have been no successful criminal 
investigations of these cases.  
</p>
<p> Separatist insurgents are increasingly attacking teachers. Since the beginning 
of the new school term in May 2009, five teachers have been killed by insurgents in 
the south. After each attack, schools in affected areas were closed down for security 
reasons. Hundreds of teachers have requested transfers from the region. On 19 May 
2009, a teacher at Nikhom Pattana Park Tai school, was reportedly shot dead as he 
was riding a motorcycle from his home to his school in Bannang Sta district of Yala 
province. On 2 June 2009, insurgents allegedly attacked a pickup truck transporting 
six teachers from their schools in Ja Nae district of Narathiwat province. Two 
Buddhist Thai teachers were singled out and killed: <b>Atcharaporn Thepsorn</b>, a 
teacher at Ban Dusung Ngor school who was eight months pregnant, and <b>Warunee 
Navaka</b>, a teacher at Ban Ri Nge School. 
</p>
<p> On 6 June 2009, insurgents killed <b>Matohe Yama</b>, a teacher at Ban 
Palukasamo in Bajoh district of Narathiwat province, and on 16 June 2009, 
insurgents shot dead <b>Lekha Issara</b>, a teacher at Ban Poh Maeng school, while she 
was riding on a motorcycle from home to work in Raman district of Yala province. 
</p>
<p>1086. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency's Government to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, as well as article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, ratified by your country, which consecrate everyone&#8217;s right to education. In this 
context we would like to bring your Excellency&#8217;s attention to the 2008 report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/8/10) dedicated to education in emergencies by the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education, which showed the urgent need to redouble efforts to 
safeguard educational opportunities for persons affected by emergency situations - 
especially children, adolescents and young people. 
</p>
<p>1087. With specific regard to the recent killing of teachers by insurgents, we would also 
like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to Article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. It provides that every individual has the right to life and security 
of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life. As reiterated in Human Rights Council resolution 8/3 (OP 4), all 
States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigation into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to identify and bring to 
justice those responsible, &#8230; and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such 
executions&#8221;. Where a State fails to take all appropriate measures to deter, prevent and 
punish the perpetrators of a pattern of attacks against a group in society, such as teachers, 
crimes, including murder, can also give rise to State responsibility (Report of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 71.) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>312  
</b></p>
<p>1088. We urge your Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the right 
to education of those affected by the conflict in Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and five districts 
of Songkhla is respected and that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations is ensured. We also request that your Government adopts effective measures to 
prevent the recurrence of attacks against teachers in those areas.  
</p>
<p>1089. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your

</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2.  What measures have been taken to protect teachers and students from 
violence by the insurgents, including killing?   
</p>
<p>3. What practical measures have been taken to protect educational buildings 
from violent attacks? What steps have and are being taken to monitor attacks on 
learners and educational personnel? 
</p>
<p>4. What precautions and measures have local and central authorities taken to

Narathiwat, and five districts of Songkhla is ensured and respected in spite of the

</p>
<p>5. What steps have, and are being taken to investigate and sanction those

</p>
<p>1090. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Government to 
information we have received regarding the situation of a group of<b> individuals from the

<p>are alleged to have already resulted in the death of two of the detainees, namely <b>Abdul 
Salam</b> and <b>Hammah Tulah</b>. They were reportedly part of a group of 78 individuals that 
arrived in Thailand on 26 January 2009 and who were subsequently transferred to the 
Immigration Detention Center (IDC) in Ranong, Thailand. The names of the other members 
of the group are <b>Chaina Aaben, Chuansu Aalam, Khafad Aalm, Mahmad Aarm, Nulu

<b>Sotamin, Saleem, Islam, Hunsein, Isu</b>, 17, <b>Baseh</b>, and <b>Jinud</b>, whose respective surnames 
could not be established. 
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> On 1 July 2009, Abdul Salam deceased at the age of 18 at the Ranong IDC 
after suffering from heart failure. On 13 August 2009, Hammah Tulah, 15 years of 
age, also died while in detention at the Ranong IDC. In both cases, the rapid 
deterioration of their health might be due to the inadequacy and inefficiency of 
healthcare being provided to them during the entire period of their detention and 
particularly during the hours preceding their deaths. A third person is reportedly in a 
critical medical condition. 
</p>
<p> Following these deaths, all remaining individuals from the aforementioned 
Rohingya minority group have been transferred to the Suan Plu IDC in Bangkok. 
</p>
<p> It has also been reported that irregular immigrants in Thailand face 
potentially indefinite administrative immigration detention. 
</p>
<p>1091. Despite the reported transfer of the above mentioned detained individuals to the 
Suan Plu IDC, serious concerns remain regarding their physical and mental integrity. For 
this reason, it is considered crucial that the entire group undergo immediate and proper 
medical examinations; that all individuals within the group are provided with all 
appropriate assistance; and that effective mechanisms are made available through which 
any specific protection needs are identified and timely addressed. 
</p>
<p>1092. We should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of 
the circumstances regarding the case of the persons named above. We would like to stress 
that each Government has the obligation to protect the human rights of the persons that are 
under their jurisdiction, regardless of their immigration status as has repeatedly been 
highlighted by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations General Assembly, inter 
alia, in resolutions 9/7,  62/156 and 63/184 respectively.  
</p>
<p>1093. We would also like to stress that the State obligation to protect and ensure the right 
to physical and mental integrity of all persons under the State&#8217;s jurisdiction is set forth inter 
alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights to which Thailand is a party as of January 1997. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>314  
</b></p>
<p>1094. Furthermore, without expressing at this stage an opinion whether the detention of 
the abovementioned persons is arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee their right not to be 
deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>1095. Moreover, with respect to the minors in detention, we would like to refer your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to 
which Thailand is a party , which, inter alia, provides that: &#8220;(b) &#8230; The arrest, detention or 
imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a 
measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time; (c) Every child 
deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the 
human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her 
age. &#8230; (d) Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to 
legal and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the 
deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and 
impartial authority, and to a prompt decision on any such action.&#8221;   In this connection, we 
would also like to bring your Excellency's Government's attention to General Comment 
No.6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which highlights that &#8220;all efforts, 
including acceleration of relevant processes, should be made to allow for the immediate 
release of unaccompanied or separated children from detention and their placement in other 
forms of appropriate accommodation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1096. We would also like to take this opportunity to stress that indefinite immigration 
detention in addition to its human rights implications fosters many negative repercussions 
including extreme desperation and hopelessness among those detained, and therefore we 
urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to find as a matter of urgency other suitable 
alternatives in view of applicable international human rights standards.     
</p>
<p>1097. We would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government attention to article 12 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Thailand is a 
party from December 1999, which recognizes the right to the highest attainable standard of 
mental and physical health. This includes an obligation on the part of all States parties to 
ensure that health facilities, goods and services are accessible to everyone, especially the 
most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>1098. We would like to draw the attention of your Government to the Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;sick prisoners who require 
specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. 
Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and 
pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment of sick 
prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers. Furthermore, Rule 25(1) 
provides that, &#8220;the medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of 
the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any 
prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; (Approved by the Economic and 
Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 
1977.)  
</p>
<p>1099. With regard to the death Article 6 of Abdul Salam and Hammah Tulah, allegedly 
due to a lack of adequate health care, we would like to recall that Article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights and Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights protect the right to life. When the State detains an individual, it is held to a 
heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  As a consequence, when 
an individual dies while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility (<i>see </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>315 
</b></p>
<p>for instance the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s views in <i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, 
communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2). In order to overcome the 
presumption of State responsibility for a death in custody, there must be a thorough, prompt 
and impartial investigation (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was 
reiterated by the Human Rights Council as recently as at its 8th Session in Resolution 8/3 
(OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into 
all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1100. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of the 
investigations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the deaths of 
Abdul Salam and Hammah Tulah. 
</p>
<p>3.    Please provide information concerning the health conditions of the                    
remaining individuals from the aforementioned Rohingya group and the steps being 
taken to ensure that their well being and physical integrity is protected and that their 
right to health is fully enjoyed. 
</p>
<p>4.  Please indicate the legal basis for the arrest and detention of the above named 
individuals and how these measures are compatible with applicable international 
human rights norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.

<p>1101. I wish to refer to your joint letter dated 26 August 2009 seeking clarification from 
the Royal Thai Government on the allegations regarding the situation of a group of 
individuals from the Rohingya minority in Myanmar currently in immigration detention in 
Thailand, particularly the death of two detainees, namely, Mr. Abdul Salam and Mr. 
Hammah Tulah. 
</p>
<p>1102. In this connection, I would like to forward herewith some preliminary response and 
information regarding the above-mentioned cases for your reference and consideration, as 
follows: 
</p>
<p> 1. First of all, the Royal Thai Government attaches the highest priority to the 
promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and other international human rights instruments to which Thailand is a 
Party. 
</p>
<p> 2. With regard to the Rohingyas who arrived on Thai shores, it needs to be 
noted that they have entered Thailand illegally and, hence, are illegal immigrants under 
Thai law. Nevertheless, Thailand has been caring for them based on its long-standing and 
firm adherence to humanitarian principles. 
</p>
<p> 3. Thailand believes that the issue of Rohingyas is a complex one which 
involves problems of statelessness, people smuggling and human trafficking. This issue 
must therefore be addressed in a comprehensive manner and through regional cooperation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>316  
</b></p>
<p> 4. To deal with this complex issue, Thailand is now pursuing a four-pronged 
approach as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bilateral cooperation with Myanmar and Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with a contact group of  affected countries (Bangladesh, India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and 
related Transnational Crime. 
</p>
<p> 5. With regard to the group of 78 Rohingyas who arrived on Thai shores in 
January 2009, Thailand has taken care of them based on humanitarian considerations. The 
Royal Thai Government allowed relevant embassy representatives and staff from the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to visit and talk to this 
group of persons earlier this year. 
</p>
<p> 6. With regard to the death of Mr. Abdul Salam and Mr. Hammah Tulah in the 
Immigration Detention Centre in Ranong Province, the post mortems have suggested that 
the causes of death were cardiac arrest. On a humanitarian basis, the Immigration Bureau 
moved all the Rohingyas to the Immigration Detention Centre in Bangkok. This was aimed 
at giving the Rohingyas more space for exercise and recreation, as well as better access to 
medical care. Furthermore, this move would also make it easier for UNHCR and other 
relevant NGOs to access this group of people. 
</p>
<p> 7. Thailand has no intention of detaining this group of persons indefinitely, and 
steps are being taken in order to verify their nationality and country of origin and provide a 
lasting solution for them. 
</p>
<p>1103. In this regard, I wish to reaffirm the importance that the Royal Thai Government 
attaches to human rights and the rule of law. The permanent mission of Thailand will 
forward any further development on the situation of the 78 Rohingyas currently in 
immigration detention in Thailand, and the death of two detainees, namely, Mr. Abdul 
Salam and Mr. Hammah Tulah as soon as we receive information from the relevant 
authorities in Thailand.

<p><b>  Thailand: Imposition of the death penalty for drug related offences 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions 
relating to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:  2 males  
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: Largely satisfactory response 
</p>
<p>1104. Observations of the Special Rapporteur: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Thailand.  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that, as 
the Government states, drug trafficking has seriously detrimental effects on society, but 
notes that the imposition of the death penalty for drug-related offenses is inconsistent with 
the interpretation of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; adopted by international human rights bodies 
because such crimes do not result directly in the loss of life.   The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates his appeal to the Government to suspend imposition of the death penalty for drug-
trafficking offenses. 
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 3 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1105. I am writing to your Excellency&#8217;s Government in relation to the reported execution 
of Bundit Jaroenwanit and Jirawat Poompreuk, two men found guilty of drug trafficking. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>317 
</b></p>
<p> According to the information received, <b>Bundit Jaroenwanit</b>, aged 45, and <b>Jirawat 
Poompreuk</b>, aged 52, were convicted on drug trafficking charges on 29 March 2001 and 
subsequently sentenced to death. They were executed by lethal injection at Bang Khwang 
prison, central Thailand, on 24 August 2009. These were reportedly the first executions in 
Thailand since 2003. 
</p>
<p>1106. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to me, I 
would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that, although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, to which Thailand is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which 
have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the 
most serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1107. Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances can certainly be 
considered a serious offence. Indeed, international treaties oblige Governments to 
criminalize international trafficking in illicit drugs and to cooperate in combating the trade. 
In interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant, however, the Human Rights Committee has 
consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not result in the 
loss of life, finding only cases involving murder not to raise concerns under the most 
serious crimes provision. As observed in a recent report to the Human Rights Council, the 
conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of 
the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes 
provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that 
there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). In its 
concluding observations on the initial report under the Covenant presented by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government (CCPR/CO/84/THA of 8 July 2005, para. 14), the Committee 
called on Thailand to &#8220;review the imposition of the death penalty for offences related to 
drug trafficking&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1108. I therefore urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to 
suspend the execution of all persons sentenced to death on drug trafficking charges and to 
eventually commute their sentences. In view of the urgency of the matter, I would 
appreciate a response on the initial steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government in this 
respect.  
</p>
<p>1109. Moreover, it is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to 
report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged above accurate? 
</p>
<p>2.  Please indicate any steps your Government intends to take or has taken to 
comply with article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
to which Thailand is a party, that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the 
most serious crimes in accordance with the law at the time of the commission of the 
crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present Covenant&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Thailand dated 8 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>1110. I wish to refer to your letter dated 3 September 2009, expressing concern regarding 
the execution on 24 August 2009 of Mr. Bundit Jaroenwanit and Mr. Jirawat Poompreuk, 
two men who were found guilty on drug trafficking charges. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>318  
</b></p>
<p>1111. The Royal Thai Government has recently considered and examined the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the above-mentioned cases. Please find enclosed herewith the 
clarification concerning the aforementioned cases for your perusal and kind consideration.  
</p>
<p>1112. I take due notice of your concern on the imposition of the death sentence for drug 
trafficking offences. However, I wish to point out that like many other countries, the 
scourge of drugs has posed a major challenge for Thailand. It has affected many segments 
of our society, especially our youths. It is an issue that has far-reaching repercussions for 
national stability, affecting the very fabric of our society and the future of our younger 
generation. Drug traffickers may not have the direct intent to take someone's life, but as 
evident to all, the consequences of their actions are devastating for the society and the 
nation as a whole. 
</p>
<p>1113. Having said this, I would like to assure you that Thailand takes the question of the 
death penalty very seriously. Thai law permits capital punishment only for the most serious 
crimes and heinous offences. Safeguards have been put in place to ensure due and thorough 
judicial process, as well as consideration of each individual case based on humanitarian 
grounds and any other exceptional circumstances. 
</p>
<p>1114. At the same time, there have been a number of positive developments in the area of 
your concern. I should like to point out that, since 2003, Thailand has amended its Penal 
Code to prohibit the imposition of capital punishment for crimes committed by persons 
under the age of 18 years. There had been a <i>de facto </i>6-year moratorium on the death 
penalty in Thailand until the recent two cases, which reflects the overall positive 
developments on  this matter which should continue. 
</p>
<p>1115. Clarification on the execution of Mr. Bundit Jaroenwanit and Mr. Jirawat 
Poompreuk 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Thai law permits capital punishment for the most serious crimes and heinous 
offences. During the past 6 years, capital punishment has been administered only 
twice. This 6 years interval during which no execution took place was due to judicial 
procedures and the availability of the various judicial safety nets. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The cases of Mr. Bundit Jaroenwanit and Mr. Jirawat Poompreuk concerned the 
possession of more than 114,000 methamphetamine pills alongside repeated 
offences, amounting to actions which could cause tremendous harm particularly to 
the youth. While in prison, the two prisoners still continued to unscrupulously act as 
agents for trafficking in methamphetamine pills among inmates. In view of such 
heinous offences, capital punishment was carried out according to Thai law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As to the question why the two prisoners were notified of their execution at short 
notice, the Thai Criminal Code stipulates that once the prisioners have exhausted all 
means of appeal, the Department of Corrections must carry out the death sentence 
without delay. In this case, the two prisoners had exhausted all means of appeal 
including seeking royal pardon, thus their sentence mcust be carried out without 
delay according to the Criminal Procedure Code. The prisoners were fully informed 
of their rights while relevant procedures were implemented in accordance with the 
laws and Ministerial Regulations governing the execution of capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under Thai law, there are adequate safety nets to ensure due and thorough judicial 
process as well as the involvement of careful and humanitarian consideration before 
the imposition of capital punishment. For instance, a person sentenced to death can 
lodge appeals all the way up to the Supreme Court. In addition, they can file petition 
for royal pardon or commutation of the death sentence. Persons under the age of 18 
years old, mentally-ill persons and pregnant women are also not subject to the death 
penalty.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Thailand has always taken account of the different perspectives on capital 
punishment. In this light, it is still the wish of the Thai general public to retain 
capital punishment as a deterrent. A recent survey conducted by a Thai news 
programme on 29 August 2009 revealed that 14.28 voted against capital punishment 
while 85.72 percent voted in favour. The Prime Minister has emphasized that the 
issue of capital punishment rests upon the opinion of the Thai general public, which 
is still divided on the issue.

promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>1116. In this connection, we would like to bring the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received concerning the death of over twenty persons, 
the arrest of over 663 persons, the closure of four radio stations, the suspension of radio and 
television programmes, and the abduction and alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Robert Kalundi 
Serumaga, talk-show host on Radio One, in connection with reported two-day protests in 
Buganda. 
</p>
<p> According to information received:  
</p>
<p> On 10 and 11 September 2009, violence erupted in Kampala and several 
Buganda districts (Mityana, Masaka, Rakai, Mukomo, Mpigi, Wakisi, and 
Kayunga), during which at least twenty-one persons died and approximately a 
hundred persons were injured. The violence reportedly followed tensions caused by 
the planned celebrations of National Youth Day in Kayunga district on 12 
September, where the king of Buganda, Ronald Musenda Mutebi II, was to make a 
formal presentation. On 10 September, a delegation of Baganda leadership attempted 
to visit the area in anticipation of the king&#8217;s visit, but was reportedly stopped by the 
police from entering the district, where the people of Banyala ethnicity reject the 
king&#8217;s authority. Reports claim that the king&#8217;s supporters, mainly youth from the 
Baganda ethnic group, felt they were being prevented from seeing the king, which 
allegedly sparked the protests. In response, police and military responded with tear 
gas and live ammunition, while some rioters blocked roads, lit fires and threw rocks. 
Whilst this remains to be confirmed, reports indicate that some of the deaths and 
injuries were allegedly caused by stray live bullets.  
</p>
<p> Protesters and onlookers were also allegedly severely beaten, including an 
incident in which at least 30 people were assembled on a sidewalk, and the police 
forced men to remove their shirts. A group of men in civilian clothes, standing 
alongside the uniformed police, allegedly beat them with large sticks.  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>320  
</b></p>
<p> On 10 and 11 September, the  Uganda Broadcasting Council, a government 
body responsible for monitoring broadcasting services in the country, reportedly 
switched off the broadcasting signals of four radio stations (Central Broadcasting 
Service, Radio Two, Radio Sapienta, and Ssuubi FM), based on allegations of 
inciting the public and escalating the protests. Other radio and television 
programmes such as the &#8220;Face of the Press&#8221; on Radio Simba and &#8220;Kibazo on 
Friday&#8221; on Wavah Broadcasting Station (WBS) have also been ordered off the air or 
suspended indefinitely.  
</p>
<p> The &#8220;Kibazo on Friday&#8221; programme was suspended indefinitely following 
the appearance on the show of Mr. Robert Kalundi Segumaga, talk-show host of 
&#8220;Spectrum&#8221; on Radio One. During the show on 11 September, he reportedly 
criticised President Museveni. At around 11:00 p.m. after his appearance on the 
show, Mr. Segumaga was abducted by men in civilian clothes outside the WBS 
studio. He was forced into an unmarked car and was allegedly beaten, choked and 
had his eyes gouged during transport. He was taken to a place of detention in Kirela, 
a neighbourhood of Kampala, where at least 23 others who had also been arrested 
during the protests were allegedly being held. On 12 September, he was transferred 
to the Central Police Station in Kampala, where he was allegedly interrogated about 
the content of the talk show. He reportedly spent two nights at a hospital to receive 
treatment for his injuries. On 15 September, he was charged with six counts of 
sedition and released on bail of US$250. According to police reports, at least 663 
persons were arrested during the two days, and most remain in custody to face trial.  
</p>
<p>1117. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we would like to 
express our concern that the deaths and injuries may have resulted from excessive and 
indiscriminate use of force. Further concern is expressed that the abduction, alleged ill-
treatment and charges against Mr. Segumaga may represent an attempt to stifle the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in Uganda. In addition, concern is expressed regarding 
the psychological and physical integrity of over 663 persons who remain in detention.  
</p>
<p>1118. With regard to the reported use of lethal force by police and military, we would like 
to refer your Government to the principles of international law governing the use of force 
when policing rallies and protests.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which Uganda is a party, prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment (Article 7), which, as the Special Rapporteur on Torture has highlighted in one 
of his reports (E/CN.4/2006/6), includes the prohibition of excessive use of violence: 
&#8220;Disproportionate or excessive exercise of police powers amounts to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and is always prohibited.&#8221; (para. 38) Furthermore, 
Article 6 of ICCPR provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the 
person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily 
deprived of his or her life (Article 6).  
</p>
<p>1119. In particular, Article 6 of the ICCPR requires that force be used by law enforcement 
officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate 
objective to be achieved.  As expressed in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Firearms 
by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this requires that law enforcement 
officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of 
force and shall only use force in exceptional cases including self-defence or defence of 
others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Such force must be 
proportional to these objectives, the seriousness of the crime and must minimize damage 
and injury. Force may only be used when less extreme means are insufficient (Principle 9).  
</p>
<p>1120. Of particular relevance in the present context are principles 12 to 14 which govern 
the policing of unlawful assemblies. In the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but 
non-violent, law enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>321 
</b></p>
<p>practicable, shall restrict such force to the minimum extent necessary. In the dispersal of 
violent assemblies, law enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous 
means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement 
officials shall not use firearms in such cases, except under the conditions stipulated in 
Principle 9. Principle 22 establishes that Governments and law enforcement agencies shall 
establish effective reporting and review procedures for all incidents where death or serious 
injury are caused by the use of firearms by law enforcement officials. This includes 
ensuring that independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to 
exercise jurisdiction in such circumstances. Governments and law enforcement agencies 
shall promptly send a detailed report to the competent authorities responsible for 
administrative review and judicial control. 
</p>
<p>1121. We would further like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all 
necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights which provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; 
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1122. With regard to alleged closure of radio stations and suspension of programmes, we 
would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the principle that the 
restrictions to the right to freedom of expression applied for the respect of the rights or 
reputations of others, for the protection of national security or public order, or of public 
health or morals, may not put in jeopardy the right itself. The restrictions must be provided 
by law and be justified as being necessary for those purposes. Moreover, the law must, on 
the one hand, be accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly and with precision so as to 
enable individuals to foresee whether a particular action is unlawful, and on the other hand, 
provide for adequate safeguards against abuse, including prompt, full and effective judicial 
scrutiny of the validity of the restriction by an independent court or tribunal. 
</p>
<p>1123. We also wish to reiterate the principle enunciated by Commission on Human Rights 
Resolution 2005/38, which calls on States, while noting that article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the exercise of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities, to 
refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with paragraph 3 of that article, 
including on (ii) the free flow of information and ideas, including practices such as the 
banning or closing of publications or other media and the abuse of administrative measures 
and censorship; and (iii) access to or use of information and communication technologies, 
including radio, television and the Internet. 
</p>
<p>1124. Moreover, regarding the case of Mr. Serumaga, we would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>1125. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and

<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any

</p>
<p>4. Please provide detailed information on the laws governing the closure of 
radio stations in Uganda, and how they are compatible with international standards 
regarding restrictions to the right to freedom of opinion and expression, namely that 
such laws must be accessible, unambiguous, draw narrowly and with precisions so

other hand, provide for adequate safeguards against abuse, including prompt, full 
and effective judicial scrutiny of the validity of the restriction by an independent

<p>1126. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the detention of nine men under 
Penal Act Code Article 145(a) and the alleged ill treatment of two of the detainees, one of 
which died immediately upon release from prison.   
</p>
<p> According to the information received, 
</p>
<p> Consensual homosexual conduct is a criminal offense in Uganda, punishable, 
in some cases, with life imprisonment. At present people suspected of homosexual 
conduct are being prosecuted on the charge of &#8216;carnal knowledge of any person 
against the order of nature&#8217; under Penal Act Code Article 145 (a). Reportedly, nine 
men are currently being detained on this charge and have been held in detention for 
over 90 days without trial. They were allegedly arrested without warrant or other 
permission by local police officers in some cases cooperating with the Local Council 
Officials, on the basis of unfounded allegations of homosexuality made by fellow 
villagers. They have then been detained for extended periods of time, longer than the 
maximum of 48 hours, during which time some men were beaten by other detainees 
and police, forced to undergo invasive medical examinations, and were denied 
access to necessary health care.  
</p>
<p> Details regarding each of the individuals are outlined below: 
</p>
<p> 1. Mr.<b> Simon Semondo</b> was first detained in Nakifuma, Kawuuga 
Prison, Mukono, and is now detained in Luzira Prison, Kibuye. Initially charged 
with &#8220;carnal knowledge against the order of nature&#8221;, he was later charged with

in Luzira Prison, Kibuye, charged with &#8220;aggravated defilement&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 6. Mr. <b>David Erias Musoke Kazeeyi Kazooba</b> was arrested in May 
2009 in Nakawuka Village, Kasanje Sub-County, Wakiso District and charged with 
&#8220;aggravated defilement&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 7. Mr. <b>Justus Kiiza Turyamureba</b> was arrested in October 2008 in 
Karoza, Mitooma, Bushenyi and charged with &#8220;carnal knowledge against the order 
of nature&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 8. Mr. <b>Fred Wasukiara </b>(also known as <b>Nabooza Margate</b>) was 
arrested on 8 April 2009 in Namakwekwe Village, Mbale District of Eastern Uganda 
and charged with &#8220;carnal knowledge against the order of nature&#8221;. He was detained in 
Kampala Road Police Station, Mbale Police Station, and Maluke Prison (all in the 
Mbale District of Eastern Uganda) until 20 May 2009.  
</p>
<p> 9. Mr. <b>Brian Mpadde</b> was arrested on 8 April 2009 in Namakwekwe 
Village, Mbale District of Eastern Uganda, charged with &#8220;carnal knowledge against 
the order of nature&#8221;. He was detained, in Kampala Road Police Station, Mbale 
Police Station and Maluke Prison (all in the Mbale District of Eastern Uganda) until 
June 16, 2009. 
</p>
<p> In particular, information received regarding Mr. Brian Mpadde and Mr. Fred 
Wasukira suggests that there were no investigations into allegations by the police 
who lacked warrants of arrest. The arrests followed denunciations of Namakwekwe 
villagers and local LCD officers who &#8216;suspected&#8217; Wasukira and Mpadde of 
homosexual activity. At the Kampala Road Police Station, both men were kept in a 
cell with 17 other men who allegedly severely beat them on two occasions, allegedly 
after having been incited by the police to do so and disclosure of the allegations 
against them. 
</p>
<p> On 9 April 2009, both men were transferred to Mbale Police Station, where 
they were allegedly examined by a police doctor in a humiliating and invasive 
manner. The report of these examinations (dated 16 June 2009) stated that both men 
had the STI gonorrhea and were HIV negative and mentioned that both men had 
pierced ear lobes, a presumed sign of homosexuality. The police also allowed the 
media to take photographs of Mr. Wasukira and Mr. Mpadde, which were then used 
in full coverage stories on television and in newspapers. Reports about these alleged 
violations of the right to privacy were submitted to the Uganda Human Rights 
Commission on 17 June 2009. 
</p>
<p> Both men remained in custody at Mbale until 17 April 2009 when they were 
formally charged in court with &#8216;having carnal knowledge against the order of 
nature&#8217;. They were then transferred on remand to Maluke Prison in Mbale. 
Following appearances on 21 April 2009 and 4 May 2009, bail was set for both of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>324  
</b></p>
<p>them. However, neither man could immediately meet the financial terms and 
conditions set by the court, so their detention was again extended until 20 May 2009, 
when Mr. Wasukira was released. He is attending court hearings while on bail.  
</p>
<p> Meanwhile, Mr. Mpadde remained in custody until 16 June 2009. Due to the 
violent treatment received while in custody, Mr. Mpadde was admitted to Mbale 
District Hospital, with severe injuries to his head and internal organs, immediately 
upon getting bail. However, he went into a coma before any medical examinations 
were carried out. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he died on 13 
September 2009. Medical records contain conflicting information on the cause of 
this death. While one report indicates that the coma was due to complications from 
syphilis, others indicate that his death was related to meningitis or anemia. Despite 
the resulting uncertainty, no autopsy was carried out on Mr. Mpadde and the cause 
of this death remains unknown. However, a number of sources have indicated their 
fear that physical and psychological ill-treatment or torture during Mr. Mpadde&#8217;s 
detention may have caused or contributed to his death.  
</p>
<p>1127. Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts of the above cases and on 
whether the detention of the abovementioned persons is arbitrary or not, we would like to 
appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee their 
right not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an 
independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>1128. We would also like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to its 
commitment to protect the right to health as reflected in the international legal instruments. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that &#8220;everyone has the right to a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, 
including food (Article 25 (1)).&#8221;  Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, which your Excellency&#8217;s Government ratified on 21 April 1987, 
specifically provides for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health.  This includes an obligation on part of all States 
parties to ensure that health facilities, goods, and services are accessible to everyone, 
especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, without 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>1129. We would further like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to the 
evidence that shows that criminalization of homosexuality has a negative effect on 
responses to HIV. It has been shown that decriminalization of homosexuality, combined 
with efforts to address stigma and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) presents an effective approach to HIV prevention. Criminalization of 
homosexuality impedes access to HIV- and health-related information and services for 
LGBT individuals and thereby can undermine the national HIV response, by not only 
discouraging LGBT individuals from seeking and accessing services, but also by 
preventing service providers from providing information and services to members of this 
community. 
</p>
<p>1130. In this context, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to 
General Comment No. 20 on Non-Discrimination in Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(art. 2 para. 2) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, and in particular 
to its paragraph 7, which states: &#8220;Non-discrimination is an immediate and cross-cutting 
obligation in the Covenant. Article 2(2) requires States parties to guarantee non-
discrimination in the exercise of each of the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined 
in the Covenant and can only be applied in conjunction with these rights. It is to be noted 
that discrimination constitutes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>325 
</b></p>
<p>differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the 
recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of Covenant rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1131. Furthermore, we should like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek 
clarification of the circumstances regarding the cases of the persons named above. We 
would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical 
and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. In this context, we would like to draw your Excellency's Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be 
justified, and calls upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1132. With regard to Mr. Mpadde, we wish to recall that, when the State detains an 
individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  
When an individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there 
is a presumption of State responsibility. In order to overcome the presumption of State 
responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a 
&#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary 
and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable 
reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles 
on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human Rights Council at its 8th Session 
in Resolution 8/3, stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; 
(OP 4).  
</p>
<p>1133. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and accountability 
of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>1134. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned persons in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>1135. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged pertaining to the arrests and detention of the nine men 
listed above correct? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to these nine cases. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been 
inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>3. Please indicate which measures were taken to address the medical needs of 
Mr. Brian Mpadde and Mr. Fred Wasukira following the injuries they sustained as a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p>result of the alleged beatings, and to ensure the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health. If no measures were taken, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>4. What measures have been taken to ensure non-discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation in the realization of the right to health? 
</p>
<p>5.  Please indicate the legal basis for the arrest and detention of these persons 
and how these measures are compatible with applicable international human rights 
principles and standards as contained, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.

</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Uganda has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 23 December 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on arbitrary 
detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>1136. We would like to bring the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government information 
received concerning a legislative bill pending before the Ugandan legislature, Bill N&#176; 18 of 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>1137. According to the information received, the Parliament of Uganda is currently 
considering Bill N&#176; 18 of 2009 (also known as the &#8220;Anti-Homosexuality Bill&#8221;) tabled 
before it on 15 October 2009. The proposed Bill increases penalties for homosexual 
conduct and criminalizes many related activities. The envisaged penalties range from 
imprisonment not exceeding three years for the failure to denounce the commission of an 
offence as defined by the Bill to life imprisonment and the death sentence. Consensual 
homosexual conduct is already a criminal offence under article 145 sub a) of the Ugandan 
criminal code, which penalizes &#8220;carnal knowledge of any person against the order of 
nature&#8221;. However, Bill N&#176; 18 would expand the reach of this existing provision by 
including &#8220;any person who touches another person with the intention of committing an act 
of homosexuality&#8221;. The Bill also punishes &#8216;aggravated homosexuality&#8217;, including activity 
by &#8216;serial offenders&#8217; or those who are living with HIV, with the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>1138. In addition, the Bill punishes any form of &#8216;promotion of homosexuality&#8217; with 
imprisonment of five to seven years. This raises concerns that the work of civil society 
actors and human rights defenders addressing issues of sexual orientation or gender identity 
might be criminalized. The Bill specifies that this includes anyone who publishes or 
disseminates &#8216;homosexual materials&#8217;, &#8216;funds or sponsors homosexuality and related 
activities&#8217;, &#8216;uses electronic devices which include internet, films and mobile phone&#8217; or &#8216;who 
acts as an accomplice or attempts to promote or in any way abets homosexuality and related 
practices&#8217;. The Bill also criminalizes failure to report any offences within its scope, 
compelling citizens to report to the authorities anyone whom they suspect of engaging in 
homosexual activity.  
</p>
<p>1139. Furthermore, HIV prevention activities in Uganda, which rely on an ability to speak 
frankly about sexuality and health and to provide condoms and other safer sex materials, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>327 
</b></p>
<p>may be compromised by this Bill. However, women, sex workers, people living with HIV, 
and other marginalized groups may also find their activities tracked and criminalized 
through this Bill should it be enacted into law. 
</p>
<p>1140. We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to its 
commitment to protect the right to health as reflected in the international legal instruments.  
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that &#8220;everyone has the right to a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, 
including food (Article 25 (1)).&#8221; Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, which your Excellency&#8217;s Government ratified on 21 April 1987, 
specifically provides for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health. This includes an obligation on part of all States 
parties to ensure that health facilities, goods, and services are accessible to everyone, 
especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, without 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>1141. Furthermore, a number of studies indicate that criminalization of homosexuality will 
have a detrimental impact on efforts to combat the spread of HIV in Uganda. It has been 
shown that decriminalization of homosexuality, combined with efforts to address stigma 
and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons 
constitutes a far more effective approach to HIV prevention. If the Bill came into force, it 
would impede access to HIV- and health-related information and services for LGBT 
individuals and could thereby undermine the national HIV response, not only by 
discouraging LGBT individuals from seeking and accessing services, but also by 
preventing service providers from providing information and services to members of this 
community. 
</p>
<p>1142. In this context, we would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of General 
Comment N&#176; 20 on Non-Discrimination in Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted 
by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2009. In paragraph 32, the 
Committee stated that &#8220;parties should ensure that a person&#8217;s sexual orientation is not a 
barrier to realizing Covenant rights, for example, in accessing survivor&#8217;s pension rights. In 
addition, gender identity is recognized as among the prohibited grounds of discrimination; 
for example, persons who are transgender, transsexual or intersex often face serious human 
rights violations, such as harassment in schools or in the work place&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1143. The Committee also underlined in paragraph 33 that &#8220;health status refers to a 
person&#8217;s physical or mental health. States parties should ensure that a person&#8217;s actual or 
perceived health status is not a barrier to realizing the rights under the Covenant. The 
protection of public health is often cited by States as a basis for restricting human rights in 
the context of a person&#8217;s health status. However, many such restrictions are discriminatory, 
for example, when HIV status is used as the basis for differential treatment with regard to 
access to education, employment, health care, travel, social security, housing and asylum. 
States parties should also adopt measures to address widespread stigmatization of persons 
on the basis of their health status&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1144. In relation to the penalty of imprisonment as enshrined in the Bill, we would like to 
draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to article 9, paragraph 1, clause 2, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Government of 
Uganda ratified on 21 June 1995. This provision stipulates that [n]o one shall be subjected 
to arbitrary arrest or detention. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has qualified 
deprivation of liberty as arbitrary, inter alia, &#8220;[w]hen the deprivation of liberty results from 
the exercise of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 10 and 21 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by 
articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (Category II). In this connection, we would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>328  
</b></p>
<p>Government to Opinion N&#176; 22/2006 (A/HRC/4/40/Add.1, page 91), in which the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, at para. 19, held that &#8220;[e]ver since the Human Rights 
Committee adopted its View in <i>Toonen v. Australia </i>and it itself adopted its Opinion 7/2002 
&#8230; the Working Group has followed the line taken in those cases. That means that the 
existence of laws criminalizing homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private 
and the application of criminal penalties against persons accused of such behaviour violate 
the rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination set forth in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Consequently, the Working Group considers that 
the fact that the criminalization of homosexuality &#8230; is incompatible with articles 17 and 26 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1145. In addition, with regard to the provisions in article 13 of the Bill which criminalize 
any form of &#8216;promotion of homosexuality&#8217;, including using electronic devices such as the 
Internet, films, mobile phones for &#8220;purposes of homosexuality&#8221; or &#8220;promoting sexuality&#8221;, 
we would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government of its obligation to take all 
necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the ICCPR, which provides that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1146. Finally, we would like to draw your attention to principles of international law 
relevant in relation to article 3 of the Bill, which makes &#8220;aggravated homosexuality&#8221; (such 
as where the person against whom the &#8220;offence of homosexuality&#8221; is committed is a minor 
or a person with a disability, or the &#8220;perpetrator&#8221; is a person living with HIV or a &#8220;serial 
offender&#8221;) punishable by the death penalty. We would like to recall that, although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be applied in the most 
restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of 
death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. As the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions observed in a report to the Human Rights 
Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the 
jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the 
most serious crimes provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where 
it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life 
(A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Article 3 of Bill N&#176; 18 of 2009 is incompatible with this well-
established principle of international law. 
</p>
<p>1147. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to ensure 
that the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, of the rights not to be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s life or personal freedom, as well 
as of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is protected.  It is our opinion as 
independent human rights experts of the Human Rights Council that only the withdrawal or 
rejection of Bill N&#176; 18 of 2009 can ensure that fundamental principles of international 
human rights law binding for Uganda are not seriously violated.  
</p>
<p>1148. We would be grateful for your cooperation and your observations on the following 
matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged pertaining to the proposed &#8220;Anti-Homosexuality Bill&#8221; 
correct? 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide details of any actions taken to remove the provisions in the 
Bill which violate the human rights of the people of Uganda &#8211; specifically those </p>

<p><b>Allegation letter dated 11 February 2010</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>1149. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning Mr. <b>H.H. Ashakhanov</b>, born in 1973.  
</p>
<p> Mr. Ashakhanov was serving his sentence in Orekhovskaya penal colony No. 
88, when he fell sick in September 2009. He approached the medical unit where he 
allegedly received two injections of unknown drugs. Subsequent to this treatment, 
Mr. Ashakhanov became permanently ill, lost his appetite and often vomited after 
meals. Mr. Ashakhanov reportedly complained repeatedly to the medical unit, 
requesting them to conduct an examination and administer proper treatment. 
However, no examination was performed and no treatment was administered.  
</p>
<p> Since November 2009, Mr. Ashahanov&#8217;s health condition severely 
deteriorated. He was unable to leave his bed as he was severely weak and suffered 
from nausea and vomiting. His temperature rose above 40 degrees. In two months,  
Mr. Ashahanov lost about 20 kg of weight. On those days when he was able to walk, 
he went to the medical unit to complain. He was given medication (analginum or 
diphenhydramine), which decreased his temperature for a short time. On several 
occasions, he was placed in the medical unit, however, never for a period exceeding 
5 days. There was no medical examination and no permanent treatment 
administered. When Mr. Ashakhanov could not get out of the bed and go to the 
medical attendant for help, he did not obtain medical assistance at all because the 
warders did not respond to his complaints.  
</p>
<p> In mid-January 2010, Mr. Ashakhanov was again placed in the medical unit 
for several days. In the morning of 19 January 2010, he was suddenly transported 
away from the colony in an unknown direction. On 20 January 2010, Mr. 
Ashahanov&#8217;s cellmates were told that he had died.  
</p>
<p> Information received indicates that Mr. Ashahanov has submitted a complaint 
to the European Court of Human Rights (application no. 35930/06). Reports further </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>330  
</b></p>
<p>suggest that prison officials intimidated Mr. Ashahanov more than once, in 
connection with this complaint. His correspondence was allegedly intercepted.  
</p>
<p> Reports further indicate a high mortality rate among prisoners at 
Orekhovskaya penal colony No. 88 due to the absence of medical assistance. 
Prisoners are reportedly taken out of the colony only in the event of exceptionally 
severe health deterioration. Information further suggests that neither family 
members nor other relevant persons are informed to which hospital detainees are 
transported.  
</p>
<p>1150. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we should like 
to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to seek clarification of the circumstances of the 
death of Mr. Ashahanov. We would like to stress that each Government has the obligation 
to protect the rights to life and physical and mental integrity of all persons. These rights are 
set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. When the State detains an 
individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights.  
As a consequence, when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained or illness 
contracted while in State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility (see, for 
instance, the conclusions of the Human Rights Committee in the case Dermit Barbato v. 
Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), paragraphe 9.2). In order to overcome 
the presumption of State responsibility for a death resulting from injuries sustained in 
custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation&#8221; (Principle 9 of the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions). 
</p>
<p>1151. We would highly appreciate information from your Government on the steps taken 
by the competent authorities with a view to ensuring the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health of the persons mentioned above. This right is reflected, inter alia, in 
article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
provides for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
mental and physical health. This includes an obligation on the part of all States parties to 
ensure that health facilities, goods and services are accessible to everyone, especially the 
most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, without discrimination 
</p>
<p>1152. We would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;Sick 
prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or 
to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, 
furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment 
of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers. Furthermore, Rule 
25(1) provides that, &#8220;The medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental 
health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, 
and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; (Approved by the Economic 
and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 
May 1977.). 
</p>
<p>1153. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have </p>

<p><b>  Imminent execution of Donald Lee Gilson 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions 
relating to the imposition of capital punishment 
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:  1 male

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed 
response of the United States of America. </p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 30 April 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1154. I am writing concerning <b>Donald Lee Gilson</b> who has been sentenced to death and is 
reportedly scheduled to be executed on 14 May 2009. Mr Gilson was charged with murder 
for his alleged role in the death of eight-year-old Shane Coffman in 1995. While it was 
reportedly impossible to establish the cause of Shane Coffman&#8217;s death, due in part to the six 
months that passed between his death and the discovery of his body, there was evidence of 
fractures to various bones. Mr. Gilson and Bertha-Jean Coffman, Shane Coffman&#8217;s mother, 
who was living with Mr. Gilson at the time of her son&#8217;s death, were charged jointly with 
first degree murder by child abuse. In August 1997, Ms. Coffman entered a guilty plea. Her 
sentencing was deferred until after she had testified at Mr. Gilson&#8217;s trial. She was later 
sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Donald Gilson was tried 
and sentenced to death in 1998. 
</p>
<p>1155. It is my understanding that, under Oklahoma law, a defendant can be found guilty of 
first degree murder when a child dies from &#8220;willful or malicious injuring, torturing, 
maiming or using of unreasonable force&#8221; by the defendant or he or she &#8220;willfully cause[s], 
procure[s] or permit[s]&#8221; any of these acts to be inflicted upon a child. The jury instructions 
in Mr. Gilson&#8217;s trial defined &#8220;permitting&#8221; to mean &#8220;to allow for the care of a child where 
one knows or reasonably should know&#8221; the child is being placed at risk of abuse. My 
understanding is that the jury in Mr. Gilson&#8217;s case was unanimous in finding first degree 
murder, but split on &#8220;the underlying theory&#8221;, i.e. some jurors found that he had willfully 
committed the child abuse leading to Shane Coffman&#8217;s death, while others found that he 
only permitted it. One of the jurors has reportedly since said in an affidavit that most of the 
jurors considered that Mr. Gilson had been a &#8220;permitter&#8221; rather than the &#8220;committer&#8221;, and 
that they had considered that &#8220;permitting&#8221; merely meant a failure to intervene rather than 
any active participation.  
</p>
<p>1156. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, I would like to 
remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that it must be regarded as an extreme exception to 
the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. 
Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United 
States of America is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;. As 
observed in a recent report to the Human Rights Council, based on a thorough and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>332  
</b></p>
<p>systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision, a death sentence can only be imposed 
in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss 
of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).   
</p>
<p>1157. Intrinsic to the most serious crime requirement, therefore, is the concept of personal 
culpability:  a state may only impose the death penalty when it can show, at a minimum, 
that the particular defendant committed an intentional act of violence that resulted in the 
death of another person.  The personal culpability requirement is reflected in the 
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States.  In 2002, the Supreme Court held 
in Atkins v. Virginia (536 U.S. 304 (2002)) that the death penalty could not be imposed on 
those with mental retardation because this class of people were significantly less culpable 
than people without functional impairment.  A few years later, the Supreme Court extended 
its reasoning to juveniles under 18, holding in Roper v. Simmons (543 U.S. 551 (2005)) 
that juveniles were insufficiently culpable and less deserving of retribution because of their 
age and immaturity and, thus, the imposition of the death penalty would be a 
disproportionate punishment, even for crimes that resulted in death.  Recently, in Kennedy 
v Louisiana, the Supreme Court decided that the death penalty could not be imposed for the 
crime of rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the 
death of the victim.  (128 S. Ct. 2641 (2008)).  The Court&#8217;s reasoning is instructive:  it 
found that the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that punishment be 
&#8220;graduated and proportioned&#8221; to the crime and that the death penalty must &#8220;be limited to 
those offenders who commit &#8216;a narrow category of the most serious crimes&#8217; and whose 
extreme culpability makes them &#8216;the most deserving of execution.&#8217;&#8221;  128 S. Ct. 2649-51.  
Oklahoma&#8217;s law does not appear to comply with the Supreme Court&#8217;s jurisprudence on 
individual culpability for the most serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>1158. As applied in the jury instructions on which Mr. Gilson&#8217;s conviction of first degree 
murder and thus the death sentence in his case are based, Oklahoma law appears to permit 
capital punishment in cases where the defendant is not found guilty of having intentionally 
killed the victim. Dissenting judges both on the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and 
on the United States 10th Circuit argued that the death sentence should not have been 
imposed on Mr. Gilson because he had not been found to have actively contributed to 
causing the victim&#8217;s death.  Judge Charles Chapel of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal 
Appeals wrote to dissent against the court&#8217;s decision upholding the death sentence in Mr. 
Gilson&#8217;s case: &#8220;The crime of permitting requires only that the defendant allows another to 
commit child abuse murder. No action is required &#8211; all that is necessary is that the 
defendant knows that child abuse is occurring but does not stop someone else from 
committing the crime&#8221;. Judge Chapel argued in dissent that the trial judge had erred in 
failing to instruct the jury that it could find Donald Gilson guilty of an offence less than 
first-degree murder. Chief Judge Robert Henry of the United States 10th Circuit noted that, 
on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, a rational jury could have found Mr Gilson 
guilty of culpable negligence, which is not an offense eligible for the death penalty. He 
argued that the jury should have been told that it could return a verdict of second-degree 
manslaughter. 
</p>
<p>1159. The conclusion I draw from the above is that the jury and the courts did not in fact 
unambiguously find that Mr. Gilson committed a &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; for the purposes of 
Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr. Gilson&#8217;s 
execution would therefore not be in accordance with human rights norms recognized by the 
international community and accepted as binding by your Excellency&#8217;s Government. It 
would also seem to me that his execution also would not comply with the jurisprudence of 
the United States Supreme Court.  I would respectfully urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to put Mr Gilson&#8217;s execution on hold with a view to commuting his death sentence. In this 
respect, I am greatly encouraged by reports that on 14 April 2009, the Oklahoma Pardon </p>

death sentence.

be grateful for your cooperation and your observations. In addition to an expeditious first 
reply, I would greatly appreciate being informed about further developments in this case. I

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the

questions on the issues raised to the Government of Afghanistan the United States fails to 
address the crux of his communication, which seeks information about the connection, if 
any, between the Afghan Special Guards involved in the shooting of the six Afghan 
National Police officers and any US force, agency or organization.   
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 17 July 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of 
people to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>1164. In this connection, we would like to bring to your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s 
attention information we have received concerning reports of a shooting incident that 
occurred on 29 June 2009, between armed Afghan Special Guards (also referred to by the 
local population as &#8220;Afghan Special Forces&#8221;) and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the 
Attorney General&#8217;s office in Kandahar, Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>1165. While the precise identity and chain of command of the Afghan Special Guards is 
unclear, according to information received, it is an Afghan private entity operating as a 
security company.  Information received indicates that it may be working with, or led by, 
American Special Forces in Afghanistan, or armed international intelligence services.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>334  
</b></p>
<p> On 29 June 2009, at 11.45 a.m. a shoot out erupted between Afghan Special 
Guards and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the Attorney General&#8217;s office, 
Kandahar.  
</p>
<p> It is alleged that Afghan Special Guards went to the Attorney's General office 
to forcefully and unconditionally demand the release of a suspect, who had been 
arrested by the ANP in connection with a criminal offence for theft of a motor 
vehicle.  
</p>
<p> The Attorney General, Mr. Hafizullah Khaliqya, reportedly refused to release 
the suspect on the grounds that it would be illegal and unconstitutional.  He also 
advised the Afghan Special Guards that the arrested suspect will have to be charged 
for the offence as required in law. The Attorney General then reportedly called the 
Chief of Police (B.G. Matiullah Khan Qateh) and the Chief of Crime (Col. Abdul 
Khalik) for assistance.  Both the Chief of Police and the Chief of Crime arrived at 
the scene accompanied by their body guards. Then, it is alleged that an argument 
erupted inside the Attorney General's office and that the Afghan Special Guards 
opened fire and killed the Chief of Police, the Chief of Crime and four other ANP 
officers. There are unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p> According to police reports, 41 suspects have been arrested in connection 
with the incident and await to be charged before the court in Kabul. In addition, it 
was also reported that six ANP sustained gun wound injuries and were admitted at 
Mirwais provincial hospital for treatment.  
</p>
<p>1166. Without expressing at this stage any opinion on the facts of the case, and bearing in 
mind that the primary responsibility to investigate the incident and prosecute those 
responsible rests with the Government of Afghanistan, we would like to bring to your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention our concern regarding the allegation referred to above 
and would welcome detailed information on the following questions:  
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate, including 
regarding the individuals and institutions involved? 
</p>
<p>2. If the Afghan Special Guards involved in the shooting have worked for or 
with any US force, agency, or organization, please provide details on this 
relationship and on the Afghan Special Guards.  Please provide information on the 
force&#8217;s command and control structure, and which, if any, US force, agency or 
organization it works with or reports to.  Please indicate whether the Afghan Special 
Guards is a private military and security company registered in accordance with the 
Afghan procedure for regulating the activities of private security companies in 
Afghanistan. Please also specify whether it operates under contract with the US 
Government. If it does, please detail the contractual modalities between the private 
security company and the US government, and in particular the oversight and vetting 
mechanisms stipulated in the contract, as well as a copy of the contract.  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation which may have been carried out in relation to this event.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of the United States of America concerning the deaths of Salah 
Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal Al-Zahrani at the 
Guant&#225;namo Bay detention facility.  The Special Rapporteur also appreciates the detail 
about the Government&#8217;s investigations into those deaths.   
</p>
<p><b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned</b>, however, about the inability of independent 
pathologists retained by the detainees&#8217; families to conduct meaningful autopsies because 
these pathologists lacked access to each detainee&#8217;s larynx, hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage.  
As the Government&#8217;s response acknowledges, these body parts would be key evidence for a 
&#8220;hanging-death&#8221; autopsy.  According to the Government, the independent pathologists were 
unable to examine these body parts because they did not submit an official request &#8211; but it 
would be hard for the pathologists to know to submit such a request when, as the 
Government notes, the body parts were taken and retained for evidentiary purposes without 
notification to the decedents&#8217; families.  The Special Rapporteu would appreciate being kept 
apprised of responses by the Government to any requests from the families or their 
representatives for access to the body parts for the purpose of an independent autopsy.  
</p>
<p><b>Allegation letter dated 22 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>1169. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information I have received regarding the deaths on 9 June 2006 of three 
prisoners at the US detention facility at Guant&#225;namo Bay - Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani 
Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal Al-Zahrani. According to this information, new 
evidence suggests that the three men may not have committed suicide, as claimed by the 
US government, but may have died as a result of interrogation by the members of the CIA 
or Joint Special Operations Command.  
</p>
<p><b>  Incident:  9 June 2006 &#8211; Deaths of Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani Shaman al-Utaybi 
and Yasser Talal Al-Zahrani 
</b></p>
<p>1170. During my mission to the US in June 2008, I investigated deaths in custody in the 
US, including deaths in Guant&#225;namo Bay.  At the time, I called upon the US government to 
provide fully unredacted medical records, autopsy files and other investigation records to 
the families of all the deceased, and I reminded the Government of its obligation to 
investigate and publicly report its findings and the evidence supporting them. 
</p>
<p>1171. When the deaths were initially reported, they were declared suicides by the 
commander at Guant&#225;namo, Rear Admiral Harry Harris, an assessment which was 
confirmed two years later in a report by the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service. 
According to the findings of the investigation, the three men were found unresponsive in 
their cells at approximately 12:30 a.m., apparently having taken their own lives by hanging 
themselves with rope made from bed sheets and tee-shirts. The investigation reported that 
blankets and sheets had been used to obstruct the guards&#8217; views and to create the 
appearance that the detainees were asleep in their cells. Two of the detainees &#8212; Salah </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>336  
</b></p>
<p>Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani Shaman al-Utaybi &#8212; were determined to be dead at the scene. 
Resuscitation attempts were made on Yasser Talal al Zahrani, who was then transported to 
Naval Hospital Guant&#225;namo where he was pronounced dead a short time later. According 
to the report, the detainees had last been seen alive at approximately 10:00 pm on June 9, 
</p><p>2006. 
</p>
<p>1172. The information I have received alleges that the conclusions of this report are 
problematic, and that the three men may have been victims of interrogation practices used 
at the Guant&#225;namo detention centre. According to this information, at least two of the men 
had cloth masks affixed to their faces, one was severely bruised, and all three had rags 
pushed down their throats. The information suggests that the men were taken from their 
cells in Alpha Block between 6 and 7.30 pm on 9 June 2006 and transported in a white van 
to a compound or &#8216;black-site&#8217; located just outside Camp Delta. It is alleged that the van 
returned around 11.30 pm and backed up to the entrance of the medical clinic where it 
delivered the bodies of the three men.  
</p>
<p>1173. In addition to the allegations surrounding the deaths of the three men, it has also 
been alleged that the deaths have not been the subject of a thorough, impartial and 
independent investigation. According to the information I have received, pathologists 
commissioned by the families to conduct autopsies on the three men were unable to obtain 
all information pertaining to the previous autopsies from the Armed Forces Institute of 
Pathology which had arranged immediate autopsies after the death of the three men. Family 
members were also unable to obtain those body parts which would have been the focus of 
the autopsy, namely the larynx, thyroid bone and the thyroid cartilage, which had been 
removed. The information received also alleges that injuries to Salah Ahmed Al-Salami&#8217;s 
mouth suggested blunt trauma inconsistent with damage associated with resuscitation 
attempts. According to the information I have received, on 10 June 2006 a meeting was 
held for the guards on duty the night the three prisoners died. It is alleged that at this 
meeting the guards were told to make no comments which might undermine the report of 
the men&#8217;s suicides. 
</p>
<p>1174. The information I have received also suggests that if the NCIS report is accurate, 
and the men had been dead for at least two hours before discovery, standard operating 
procedures which would have required the Navy guards on duty to visually search each cell 
and detainee every ten minutes must have been violated. In addition, the prisoners must 
have been allowed sheets, blankets and pillows in addition to their controlled allotment in 
order to be able to simultaneously hang sheets and blankets to conceal their activities, shape 
pillows and sheets to look like bodies in their beds, and fashion a noose for themselves.  
</p>
<p>1175. While I do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, I would like to 
refer your Government to the relevant principles of international law. The International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that every individual has the right 
to life, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life (Article 6). In its 
General Comment on Article 6, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has observed 
&#8220;that States parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life 
by criminal acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The 
deprivation of life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity.  
</p>
<p>1176. In this connection I would also like to recall Principle 9 of the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions 
which provides that there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where 
complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances&#8221;. This principle was reiterated by the 61st Commission on Human Rights in 
Resolution 2005/34 on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; (OP 4), stating that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>all States have &#8220;the obligation &#8230; to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all 
suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1177. I urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to conduct an impartial and transparent 
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani 
Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal Al-Zahrani in Guantanamo, with a view to taking all 
appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person 
guilty of unlawful killings.  
</p>
<p>1178. It is my responsibility under the mandate provided to me by the UN Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since I am expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, I would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters: 
</p>
<p>1. Please respond to the allegations outlined above which suggest that the 
deaths of Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal Al-
Zahrani were extrajudicial executions rather than suicides, and that a thorough, 
credible and independent investigation into their deaths failed to take place. 
</p>

<p><b>  Response from the Government of the United States of America dated 12 March 2010  
</b></p>
<p>1179. Thank you for your letter of February 22. 2010 [ALG/SO 214 (33-27) USA 4/2010], 
in which you inquired as to the accuracy of the allegations that the deaths on June 9, 2006 
of three individuals at Guntanamo Bay Detention Facility were extrajudicial executions 
rather than suicides. The United States took the deaths of Salah Ahmed Al-Salami, Mani 
Shaman al-Utaybi and Yasser Talal Al-Zahrani vey seriously and conducted a thorough, 
lengthy investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths. In addition the 
subsequent allegations suggesting misconduct were investigated and were determined to be 
unfounded.  
</p>
<p>1180. In all three cases, an autopsy performed by a senior medical examiner from the 
Department of Defence Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) determined that the 
cause of death for all three was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. A civilian, 
state level medical examiner served as an independent observer for these autopsies and 
concurred with these determinations. During the autopsies, the bodies were also thoroughly 
examined for signs of torture or abuse. None were found. The AFIP determinations were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>338  
</b></p>
<p>further supported by a 1300- page investigation by the U.S Naval Criminal Investigative 
Service (NCIS) that took more than two years to complete29  
</p>
<p>1181. In addition a number of experienced attorneys and agents from the U.S. Department 
of Justice extensively and thoroughly reviewed the subsequent allegations and found no 
evidence of wrong doing. 
</p>
<p> Specific findings of these investigations are detailed below:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; NCIS special agents who investigated this case found no evidence to suggest that the 
three detainees died by means other than suicide. On the contrary, it was clear from 
interviews and forensic evidence that these detainees wanted to end their lives and 
methodologically took steps to accomplish that goal. The knots that bound their 
hands and feet were not elaborate, and were of a type that each of the detainees who 
died would have been able to tie. In addition, short written statements declaring their 
intent to be martyrs was found in the pockets of each of the detainees. Lengthier 
written death declarations were also found. The rulings of the AFIP, which 
determined the cause and manner of death, were wholly consistent with the NCIS 
investigative findings.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; One of the detainees had a rag lodged down his throat. Investigators concluded that 
the detainee had positioned the rag in his mouth in order not to make any noise that 
could have alerted the guards. The detainees inhaled the rag as a natural reaction to 
death by asphyxiation.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Blankets and sheets had been used to obstruct the guards&#8217; views and to create the 
appearance that the detainees were asleep in their cells. During its investigation, 
NCIS discovered that the detainees were allowed to hang sheets for privacy; they 
were allowed to have extra linens and/or blankets; and some of the lights in the 
detention facility were dimmed at night to permit better sleep. This explains how the 
detainees were able to obscure their actions and why the guards did not discover the 
deceased detainees right away. All available video footage was reviewed by NCIS, 
and nothing of evidentiary value was discovered.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A team of lawyers and investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation were specifically tasked to review allegations made 
by Staff Sergeant Hickman, one of the tower guards on duty the evening of these 
individuals&#8217; deaths. According to the allegations, Staff Sergeant Hickman and other 
members of his unit were stationed on the exterior perimeter of the camp, including 
Tower 1, the night of the detainees&#8217; deaths. From this location, investigators 
confirmed that a person would have no visibility into the cell block or the cells 
where the deaths occurred. NCIS conducted more than 100 interviews during the 
investigation, including interviews with all of the guards who worked in the cell 
block at the relevant time and all of the detainees who were housed there. None of 
those interviewed reported that any detainees were taken away or alleged that 
homicide occurred.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), which conducted the autopsies of 
the three detainees, kept each detainee&#8217;s larynx, hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage 
for evidentiary purposes as is standard practice for hanging-death autopsies. When 
organs or tissue are taken for evidentiary purposes, families are not notified and the

<p>material is kept as part of the permanent record of investigation. Additionally, AFIP 
did not receive an official request by the independent pathologists to examine the 
retained parts.  
</p>
<p>1182. The deaths of these three individuals while in U.S. custody is indeed a matter of the 
utmost gravity, and the United States responded by immediately conducting an extensive 
investigation that included the participation of numerous government agencies. Due to the 
lessons learnt from this unfortunate event, the Joint Task Force- Guantanamo updated its 
Standard Operating Procedures to help prevent additional suicides. The United States 
provides safe and humane care for all detainees in its custody. We take all credible 
allegations of abuse very seriously and thoroughly investigate them. We will continue to 
ensure our detention operations meet or exceed applicable international standards.

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Uzbekistan.   
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 9 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the freedom 
of religion or belief and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>1183. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding <b>Sobit Zufarov</b>, aged 30, and his 
deceased brother, <b>Negmat Zufarov</b>, aged 45 at the time of his death, both of Tashkent.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received,  
</p>
<p> Negmat Zufarov was arrested in 1999 on charges related to the practice of his 
religion. These charges included &#8220;upsetting the constitutional order&#8221; (article 159 of 
the Uzbek criminal code) and &#8220;setting up, leading or participating in a religious 
extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other banned organization&#8221; (article 244.2 of 
the Uzbek criminal code).  
</p>
<p> In August 1999, Negmat Zufaraov was sentenced to a 20-year prison term by 
the Tashkent District Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the sentence was 
converted to an 18-year-sentence in a strict regime prison. Negmat Zufaraov served 
the first five years of his prison sentence at Jaslyk prison, where he sustained 
multiple beatings and ill-treatment as punishment for his praying. Negmat 
Zufaraov&#8217;s family wrote letters of concern about his ill-treatment to the Uzbek 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate of Prison, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
and the Ombudsman&#8217;s office &#8211; the responses were dismissive and no action was 
taken in response to the allegations.  
</p>
<p> In 2004, Negmat Zufaraov was transferred to a prison in Chirchik, and then 
subsequently to Zarafshan prison colony. In spring 2007, he was sentenced to an 
additional 20 months in prison to be served in Zarafshan, allegedly for violating 
prison rules. His family had not been informed in advance of the charges, nor were 
they sent a copy of the verdict.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>340  
</b></p>
<p> Whilst he was at Zarafshan prison, Negmat Zufaraov was allegedly subjected 
to torture and ill-treatment over several years. In particular, he was beaten by four 
fellow inmates with plastic bottles filled with water, and regularly placed in an 
isolation cell as punishment for praying. Even when he was in isolation, the fellow 
inmates who had beaten Negmat Zufaraov, were allowed access to him, and 
continued to beat him. In mid-May 2009, Negmat Zufaraov commenced a hunger 
strike, demanding that he be allowed to pray. After six days, he was force-fed by 
prison authorities, who also performed a forced enema on him, using pepper 
solution. The beatings allegedly continued after his hunger strike.  
</p>
<p> When his family visited him between 2 and 5 June 2009, Negmat Zufaraov 
informed them that he was being subjected to intensified ill-treatment in prison, to 
the point where he feared for his life.  
</p>
<p> On 16 June 2009, prison authorities telephoned Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family 
and informed them that he had committed suicide. His body was delivered to his 
family who were also given a death certificate stating that he had died of 
&#8220;mechanical asphyxiation&#8221;. However, Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s body displayed signs of 
ill-treatment, including wounds to the head, visible blood clots, a hematoma on his 
neck, and bruises on his back. Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family was instructed by the 
prison authorities to bury him the next morning, without any opportunity for a 
medical examination of his body. The burial was observed by police, who also 
monitored the family&#8217;s house in the days following the return of Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s 
body.  
</p>
<p> In 2000, the brother of Negmat Zufarov, Sobit Zufarov, was also arrested for 
religion-related charges. In spite of a serious medical condition, he was sentenced to 
8 years&#8217; imprisonment in a strict regime prison in 2000, and is currently serving time 
in Prison Colony 46 in Navoi region. In January 2008, just prior to his release date, 
Sobit Zufaraov was charged with violating prison rules, and was sentenced to a 
further 3 years and 6 months imprisonment.  
</p>
<p> There have been reports that Sobit Zufaraov is being ill-treated in prison, 
including being placed in an isolation cell for up to six months as punishment for 
praying.     
</p>
<p> In light of above allegations of isolation, concern is expressed in relation to 
Sobit Zufarov&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity.  
</p>
<p>1184. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations relating to the 
death in custody of Negmat Zufaraov, we would like to draw the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental principles applicable under international law 
to this case. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides 
that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Article 6 of the Covenant states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his 
or her life.  
</p>
<p>1185. When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. As a consequence, when an individual dies in State 
custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. In this respect, we would like to 
recall the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial death case (<i>Dermit 
Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 of 21 October 1982, paragraph 9.2): 
&#8220;While the Committee cannot arrive at a definite conclusion as to whether Hugo Dermit 
committed suicide, was driven to suicide or was killed by others while in custody; yet, the 
inescapable conclusion is that in all the circumstances the Uruguayan authorities either by 
act or by omission were responsible for not taking adequate measures to protect his life, as 
required by article 6 (1) of the Covenant.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>341 
</b></p>
<p>1186. In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death in custody, 
there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of 
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by 
relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; 
(Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, 
Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This principle was reiterated by the Human Rights 
Council in Resolution 8/3. (OP 4), stating that all States have &#8220;the obligation of all States to 
conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p>1187. The Council added that this obligation includes the obligation &#8220;to identify and bring 
to justice those responsible, [&#8230;], to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time 
to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and 
judicial measures, in order to [&#8230;] prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. These 
obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also 
under Articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>1188. We would also like to appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or 
Belief and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Furthermore, we would like to 
refer to General Assembly resolution 63/181, which recognizes with concern the situation 
of persons in vulnerable situations, including persons deprived of their liberty. In the same 
resolution, the Assembly also urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to protect and promote 
freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this end: [&#8230;] (b) To ensure that 
no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person 
because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to 
bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1189. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to conduct an inquiry into the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Negmat Zufaraov expeditiously, impartially and 
transparently, including the conduct of an independent autopsy, also with a view to taking 
all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any 
person guilty of the alleged violations, as well as to compensate Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family.  
</p>
<p>1190. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of Negmat and Sobit 
Zufaraov in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>1191. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p>2. Have any formal complaints been lodged by the family of Negmat Zufarov 
and/or Sobit Zufarov in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment sustained by each 
individual whilst in prison?

<p>3. Please provide the full details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in </p>

investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to the alleged ill-treatment of Sobit Zufarov. If no inquiries have taken

<p><b>  Response of the Government of Uzbekistan dated 13 October 2009 (translated from 
Russian) 
</b></p>
<p>1192. Information concerning N. Zufarov and S. Zufarov 
</p>
<p> 1. Nigmat Sobirovich Zufarov, born in 1964, was a citizen of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan with a criminal record. He worked as the director of a private company until his 
arrest. 
</p>
<p> By a judgement of 3 April 2000 the Tashkent provincial court sentenced him to 20 
years&#8217; deprivation of liberty under article 159, paragraph 3 (a) and (b) (infringement of the 
constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan), article 244-1, paragraph 3 (a) 
(manufacture or distribution of materials entailing a threat to public security and public 
order), article 244-2, paragraph 1 (establishment, leadership or participation in religious, 
extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations), article 190, 
paragraph 2 (b) (engaging in unlicensed activity), and article 273, paragraph 3 (b) (illegal 
manufacture, acquisition or possession of and other activities with narcotic substances or 
psychotropic materials with a view to their sale or the equivalent), of the Criminal Code of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan. By a decision of the criminal chamber of the Supreme Court of 
17 July 2000, the length of the penalty was reduced to 18 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> While serving his sentence in places of detention, the convict N. Zufarov continued 
his criminal activity, for which criminal action was again brought against him. By a 
judgement of 14 May 2004 of the Navoi provincial criminal court N. Zufarov was found 
guilty under article 159, paragraph 3 (a) and (b) (infringement of the constitutional order of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan), of the Criminal Code and sentenced to 15 years&#8217; deprivation 
of liberty to be served in a strict regime colony. 
</p>
<p> As from 14 April 2009 the convict N. Zufarov served his sentence in institution 
UYA-64/48 (in Zarafshan, Novoi province). While serving his sentence N. Zufarov 
incurred a disciplinary penalty 13 times for admitted breaches of the rules governing the 
serving of his sentence. 
</p>
<p> On 3 June 2009 the convict N. Zufarov was granted a long meeting with his parents. 
The administration did not receive any complaints or representations thereafter from his 
parents. 
</p>
<p> On 15 June 2009 the convict N. Zufarov committed suicide by hanging himself. 
Forensic report No. ZA 31 of 15 June 2009 came to the conclusion that N. Zufarov&#8217;s death 
was caused by mechanical asphyxiation. 
</p>
<p> A further investigation did not show that N. Zufarov had been subjected to any 
violence by the staff of the colony or other persons. Hence the decision of 25 June 2009 of 
the investigator of the Navoi Procurator&#8217;s Office responsible for the supervision of 
compliance with the law in places of detention to initiate criminal proceedings was 
dismissed pursuant to article 83, paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p>

</b></p>
<p> The senior managers of the colony K. Nuraliev, S. Boimuratov and Inspector T. 
Safarov were disciplined for failure to exercise due supervision of the conduct and actions 
of N. Zufarov, who committed suicide. 
</p>
<p> It must be noted in response to the unfounded accusations in the complaint from the 
special procedures of the United Nations that, in all penal institutions, all the conditions 
allowing convicts to observe religious rites have been created in accordance with penal 
enforcement legislation. 
</p>
<p> Convicts are allowed to perform religious rites and to use religious articles and 
religious literature. The performance of religious rites is voluntary and must not &#8220;breach the 
regulations of the penal institution or prejudice the rights and lawful interests of other 
persons&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In UYA-64/48, as in all other penal institutions, convicts are not punished for the 
performance of religious rites, they are not tortured in any way and they are not put in the 
disciplinary section. 
</p>
<p> 2. Sobit Sabirovich Zufarov, born in 1968, is a citizen of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan with a criminal record. He worked as a conductor before his arrest. 
</p>
<p> By a judgement of 22 June 2000 of the Yakkasarai district court in Tashkent he was 
sentenced to eight years&#8217; deprivation of liberty under article 159, paragraph 3 (b) 
(infringement of the constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan), article 244-1, 
paragraph 3 (a) (manufacture or distribution of materials entailing a threat to public security 
and public order), and article 216 (breach of the legislation concerning religious 
organizations) of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p> The convict S. Zufarov, who is serving his sentence in institution UYA-64/3, 
situated in the Bostanlyk district of the Tashkent region, has incurred a disciplinary penalty 
eight times, including on one occasion one month in the punishment cell, for failure to 
comply with the lawful demands of the prison administration and breach of the prison 
regulations. In connection therewith he has been prosecuted and by a judgement of 11 
January 2008 of the Bostanlyk district criminal court he was found guilty under article 221, 
paragraph 2 (b) (failure to comply with the lawful demands of the administration of a penal 
institution), of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and sentenced to three 
years and six months&#8217; deprivation of liberty to be served in a strict regime colony. 
</p>
<p> The convict S. Zufarov has been serving his sentence in institution UYA-64/46 (in 
Navoi) since 3 February 2008. During this period he has had three disciplinary penalties. 
According to the prison administration&#8217;s records, S. Zufarov shuns participation in 
educational measures and work, he does not attend educational talks, he does not 
understand the essence of the crime which he committed and he does not regret its 
commission. 
</p>
<p> On entering the penal institution he underwent a full medical examination and his 
medical record shows him as having been diagnosed with &#8220;osteochondrosis of the lumbar 
vertebrae, chronic pyelonephritis and prostatitis&#8221;. At intervals prescribed by the prison 
hospital he receives outpatient and inpatient treatment. At present the convict&#8217;s state of 
health is deemed to be satisfactory. 
</p>
<p> The use of torture and other unlawful methods of physical or psychological pressure 
on N. Zufarov and S. Zufarov and the alleged hunger strike of N. Zufarov were not borne 
out by the investigation conducted in response to the communication from the special 
procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Death sentence against Tuyet Lan Pham Thi 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violation alleged</b>: Non-respect of international standards on safeguards and restrictions 
relating to the imposition of capital punishment.   
</p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>: 1 female 
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: Cooperative but incomplete response 
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
response of the Government of Viet Nam with respect to the death sentence against Ms. 
Tuyet Lan Pham Thi.   
</p>
<p>1199. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Viet Nam for recognizing 
that the death penalty may be imposed only for the most serious crimes by eliminating the 
death penalty for a number of criminal offenses in which death does not result.  He notes 
that Viet Nam has, in June 2009, eliminated the death penalty for rape, the illegal use of 
drugs, smuggling and bribery, the unlawful seizure of aircrafts or vessels, and a variety of 
financial crimes. 
</p>
<p>1200. However, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that the Government 
continues to impose the death penalty for other offences similar to the ones for which the 
death penalty has been eliminated.  Specifically, the offence of embezzlement for which 
Mrs. Tuyet Lan Pham Thi received the death sentence violates international human rights 
law.  Especially given the Government&#8217;s recognition of the &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; 
requirement with respect to elimination of the death penalty for other financial crimes, the 
Special Rapporteur looks forward to an explanation of why the Government&#8217;s domestic law 
continues to permit the death sentence for embezzlement under Article 278 of the Criminal 
Code.  He also looks forward to receiving information about the outcome of Ms. Tuyet Lan 
Pham Thi&#8217;s appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 19 June 2009</b>, sent with the Working Group on arbitrary detention 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>1201. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the death sentence imposed on Mrs. 
Tuyet Lan Pham Thi, a woman aged 51, resident of Phu Nhuan District, Ho Chi Minh City.  
</p>
<p> According to the information received:  
</p>
<p> Mrs. Tuyet Lan Pham Thi (identity card n. 022438116) was arrested in her 
house by eight policemen, who also searched her house, on the evening of 7 
February 2005. This arrest followed a warrant issued by the People&#8217;s Procuratorate 
of Ho Chi Minh City, based on allegations of infringement of the Utilization of Land 
rule. It also occurred after five to seven summons to the Police Station, to 
collaborate with the police investigation. After her arrest, Mrs. Pham Thi was taken 
directly to a prison, in the Binh Thanh district of Ho Chi Minh.  
</p>
<p> Once in prison, she was also accused of embezzlement and of heading a 
criminal organization responsible for fraudulent transactions over a number of years. 
These last accusations are allegedly related to a transaction that Mrs. Pham Thi 
carried out in 2002, as chief executive officer of the SA An Hoi company, during 
which she sold (with profit) land to a state company.  
</p>
<p> After her arrest in February 2005, Mrs. Pham Thi was denied all visiting 
rights for a period of 6 months. It was reported that during this time, she was not 
provided with food and had to eat what was left by other prisoners, who also beat </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>347 
</b></p>
<p>her. Following this period of 6 months, she was transferred to the Chi Hoa Prison, in 
the 10th arrondissement of the City, where she also had restricted rights compared to 
other inmates, such as limited visits and food.   
</p>
<p> On February 2007, the first instance Court of Ho Chi Minh City sentenced 
her to death. On July 2007, the Appeal Court rejected the death sentence and asked 
for a new investigation. Allegedly however, her lawyers have not been kept 
appraised of the findings of the investigation and she has reportedly been charged 
with the wrong offence. After one and a half years of investigation, the police 
maintained its initial conclusions. It is reported that the new trial is set for 23 June 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p> Without expressing at this stage an opinion on the facts of the case and on 
whether the detention of the abovementioned person is arbitrary or not, we would 
like to appeal to your Excellency's Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee her right not to be deprived arbitrarily of her liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with 
articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>1202. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to several 
principles applicable to this case under international law. 
</p>
<p>1203. We would like to remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that although the death 
penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme 
exception to the fundamental right to life. As such, it must be interpreted in the most 
restrictive manner and can be imposed only for the most serious crimes. A thorough and 
systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged 
with interpreting the most serious crimes provision indicates that a death sentence can only 
be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted 
in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). In the present case, Mrs. Tuyet Lan Pham Thi did 
not kill anyone and no allegation of such was made.  
</p>
<p>1204. We would also like to refer your Excellency&#8217;s Government to article 14 3) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by your 
Government, which states: &#8220;In the determination of any criminal charge against him, 
everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality: (b) To 
have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense and to communicate 
with counsel of his own choosing.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1205. The right to be assisted by a lawyer is also set forth in the Basic Principles on the 
Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, in 
particular:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 1. All persons are entitled to call upon the assistance of a lawyer of their 
choice to protect and establish their rights and to defend them in all stages of 
criminal proceedings;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; principle 5. Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by 
the competent authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice 
upon arrest or detention or when charged with a criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>1206. In the event that your investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and accountability </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>348  
</b></p>
<p>of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. We also request that your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p>1207. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the above-
mentioned person in compliance with the above international instruments. 
</p>
<p>1208. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected 
to report on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your 
cooperation and your observations on the following matters, when relevant to the case 
under consideration: 
</p>
<p>1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? If not, 
please share all information and documents proving their inaccuracy. 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the legal basis for her death sentence and how these measures 
are compatible with international human rights norms and standards as contained, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.  
</p>
<p>3.  Please provide details regarding the trials of Tuyet Lan Pham Thi, including 
responses to the following: was she adequately represented by a lawyer during all 
steps of the investigation and the trials? Which provisions of criminal law was she 
found guilty of having violated and what are the maximum sanctions imposed for 
these violations?  
</p>
<p>4. Please provide details regarding Tuyet Lan Pham Thi alleged involvement in 
a criminal organization implicated in fraudulent transactions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Viet Nam dated 20 August 2009  
</b></p>
<p>1209.  With reference to your letter under reference code [ . . .] dated 19 January 
2009 regarding the case of Mrs. Pham Thi Tuyet Lan [sic], I have the honor to convey to 
you the following information:  
</p>
<p> 1  Mrs Pham Thi Tuyet Lan was arrested for falsifying documents on land-use-
rights and selling lands for huge illegal profits. Mrs Pham Thi Tuyet Lan is accused of 
embezzlement in accordance with Paragraph A of section 4 of Article 278 of the 1999 
Criminal Code Act, of which the maximum sanction imposed for such offense is the capital 
punishment.  Mrs Pham Thi Tuyet Lan has been judged by the Court of first instance and 
the Court of Appeal. 
</p>
<p> 2. During the period of provisional detention for investigation and the trial, Mrs 
Pham Thi Tuyet Lan is entitled to enjoy the rights of the suspected offender without 
discrimination or ill-treatment, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer of her own 
choosing. However, she has refused and wants to be defended by herself. All information 
which states that Mrs Pham Thi Tuyet Lan was denied visiting rights, not provided with 
food and beaten are totally untrue. 
</p>
<p> 3. The arrest, detention for investigation and trial of Mrs Pham Thi Tuyet Lan 
are carried out in strict compliance with the sequence and procedures stipulated in existing 
Vietnamese laws, particularly the Criminal Procedures Code and also in line with 
international standards on human rights, particularly the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. Based on recently 
found evidences, a court of final appeal will be soon convened to review Mrs Pham Thi 
Tuyet Lan&#8217;s case to ensure that justice is done.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>349 
</b></p>
<p> 4. According to the 1985 Criminal Code of Viet Nam, 44 serious criminal 
offenses were subject to capital punishment. In the process of judicial reform in compliance 
with international standards, the National Assembly of Viet Nam has adopted in 1999 the 
new Criminal Code in which there are only 29 serious criminal offenses that are punishable 
by death, and the death penalty is not applicable to juvenile offenders, pregnant women or 
women having children under 36 months of age.  
</p>
<p> Moreover, in the orientation of the restrictive imposition of the death penalty, only 
for the most serious crimes, in accordance with section 2 of article 6 of the International 
Convention on Civil and Political Rights, in June 2009, the National Assembly of Viet Nam 
has revised the 1999 Criminal Code, reducing from 29 to 21 the number of criminal 
offenses which are subject to the death penalty. The criminal offenses which are removed 
from the death penalty list are as follows: rape (Article 111); fraudulent appropriation 
(Article 139); smuggling (Article 153); production, stockpiling, transport and circulation of 
counterfeit money, counterfeit bank notes or counterfeit government bonds (Article 180); 
illegal use of drug (Article 197); unlawful seizure of aircrafts or vessels (Article 221); give 
bribes (Article 289) damage of arms and military equipments (Article 234).

<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 22 September 2009</b>, sent with Representative of the Secretary-
General on the human rights of internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>1210. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding reports of attacks on civilian 
targets, in particular camps for internally displaced persons in Adi in the Amran 
governorate, by the Yemeni armed forces on 14 and 17 September 2009 resulting in the 
killing of numerous civilians. 
</p>
<p> According to information we have received: 
</p>
<p> In mid-August 2009 renewed armed conflict between Yemeni governmental 
armed forces and insurgents referred to as &#8220;Al Huthis&#8221; broke out in &#8216;Amran and 
Saada Governorates in northern Yemen. The United Nations estimate that the recent 
combat has brought the total number of internally displaced people to 150,000, the 
majority of whom are women and children. 
</p>
<p> On 16 September 2009, a Yemen air force attack caused the death of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in an improvised camp  in Adi east of Harf 
Sufian in &#8216;Amran governorate. According to witnesses, the attack took place in two 
waves, the first targeting IDPs gathering in makeshift tents and under trees, the 
second targeting people fleeing towards a canal. The number of persons killed is 
indicated as 87 in some reports, 85 in others, as &#8220;dozens of displaced persons, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>350  
</b></p>
<p>mostly women and children&#8221; in others yet. In speaking to journalists, a Government 
official claimed that the fighter jets targeted rebels who were hiding among the 
IDPs. 
</p>
<p> The attack on 16 September was preceded by the air force attack on a 
crowded market place in Saada Governorate on 14 September 2009.  This attack left 
dozens of victims killed and wounded, including women and children, and caused 
huge material losses to trade shops, cars and houses near to the market. 
</p>
<p>1211. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these reports, we would like to 
refer Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the fundamental legal rules applicable to all armed 
conflicts under international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>1212. Specifically, your Government is under an obligation to distinguish between 
combatants and civilians and to direct attacks only against combatants (Rules 1, 6 and 7 of 
the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law identified in the study of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (&#8220;Customary Rules&#8221;)).   
</p>
<p>1213. Regarding claims that rebels were hiding among the IDPs and attacking the 
governmental forces, we would recall that indiscriminate attacks are prohibited as well 
(Rule 11 of the Customary Rules).  They include attacks which employ a method or means 
of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by international humanitarian 
law (Rule 12). Further, launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss 
of civilian life, injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects, which would be excessive 
in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited (Rule 14 
of the Customary Rules).  All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and minimize 
incidental loss of civilian life (Rule 15 of the Customary Rules).  This explicitly requires 
that parties to a conflict must give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect 
the civilian population (Rule 20 of the Customary Rules).  
</p>
<p>1214. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to ensure that immediate and independent 
investigations are carried out into these killings and to protect those displaced by the 
conflict according to the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement including 
Principle 10 on the right to life which codifies and reflects the above mentioned basic 
guarantees of international humanitarian law.. 
</p>
<p>1215. It is moreover our responsibility under the mandate provided to us by the Human 
Rights Council to seek to clarify all cases brought to my attention. Since we are expected to 
report on these alleged incidents, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
observations on the following four matters: 
</p>
<p>1.  Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? Please refer to the 
results of any police or military investigation, or judicial or other inquiries carried 
out in relation to the alleged incident. 
</p>
<p>2. What, if any, assessment was made to ensure that the attack complied with 
the rules of international humanitarian law and human rights law? Specifically, what 
safeguards, if any, were employed to verify that only legitimate military targets were 
attacked?  What methods were adopted to distinguish between military and civilian 
objects?  What precautions were taken to minimize loss of civilian life?  What 
means and methods of warfare were adopted to avoid incidental loss of civilian life, 
and to ensure that incidental loss of life was not excessive in relation to the 
anticipated military advantage?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide the details of any disciplinary measures imposed on or 
criminal prosecutions against members of the armed forces responsible for the 
alleged incident.  </p>

<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 29 April 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences. 
</p>
<p>1216. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the death sentence imposed against 
Ms. Fatima Hussein Badi, who may reportedly be at imminent risk of execution. Fatima 
Hussein al-Badi and her brother Abdullah Hussein al-Badi were arrested in July 2000 for 
the murder of her husband, Hamoud Ali al-Jalal, tried and sentenced to death on 17 
February 2001. The appeals court upheld the death sentence. In September 2003, the 
Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence imposed on Abdullah Hussein al-Badi. After 
confirmation of the sentence by the President of Yemen, he was executed on 2 May 2005. 
</p>
<p> We wrote to your Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding this case on 20 
December 2005, drawing your Government&#8217;s attention to reports that the two 
defendants had been tortured by police in detention, that Abdullah Hussein al-Badi 
confessed to the police after he was assured that his confession would lead to his 
sister&#8217;s release, that the two defendants had no legal representation during the trial, 
and were not allowed to speak in court. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government replied to 
our communication on 1 June 2006, stating that: &#8220;[Fatima Hussein al-Badi] was not 
subjected to any form of mental or physical torture. A lawyer was appointed to 
present her defence from the very first stage of proceedings until the Supreme Court 
delivered its ruling. The Yemeni judiciary takes every care to comply with, and 
abide by, the norms of international law. Yemeni law guarantees defendants the full 
right to a defence during every stage of judicial proceedings.&#8221; (A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, 
pp. 378-380). 
</p>
<p> With regard to the case of Fatima Hussein Badi, we have recently received 
information which was not available to us at the time of our letter of December 
</p><p>2005. These reports indicate that in September 2003 Section B of the Supreme Court 
found that Fatima Hussein Badi was not guilty of murder, but only of participating 
in hiding the victim&#8217;s body. It therefore quashed the death sentence and imposed a 
four years&#8217; prison term instead. Because of the death sentence imposed in the same 
Supreme Court judgment against Abdullah Hussein al-Badi, the case went to the 
President of Yemen for confirmation. The President ordered the Supreme Court to 
reconsider its findings and sentence regarding Fatima Hussein Badi. In August 2004, 
the Supreme Court sitting as General Assembly, i.e. with the participation of all 
judges, reportedly overturned the judgment of Section B of the Supreme Court and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>352  
</b></p>
<p>reinstated the death penalty against Fatima Hussein Badi. She has been on death row 
since then. Her death sentence has reportedly not been carried out as a special appeal 
to the President by her defence lawyer remains pending. 
</p>
<p> According to the information received, the President&#8217;s order to the Supreme 
Court to reconsider its decision not to sentence Fatima Hussein Badi to death 
followed a letter of January 2004 by the then Head of the Council of Representatives 
(Yemen&#8217;s Parliament) to the President urging him not to ratify the judgment. The 
letter allegedly referred to a report by the Justice and Endowment Committee of the 
Council of Representatives which had studied the case upon a request by relatives of 
the victim. The Justice and Endowment Committee noted that, if the death sentence 
against Fatima Hussein Badi was lifted, she would be reinstated as her late 
husband&#8217;s heir and could as such pardon her brother. 
</p>
<p>1217. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the information received, we 
would like to recall that in capital punishment cases, the obligations of States parties to 
observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Yemen is a Party, admits no exception.  
</p>
<p>1218. The reports received raise considerable concerns with regard to the right to be 
judged by an &#8220;independent tribunal&#8221;. As the Human Rights Committee explains in its 
General Comment No. 32 on the right to a fair trial, this requires a court &#8220;independent of 
the executive and legislative branches of government&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, at para. 18). The 
Human Rights Committee adds that &#8220;[t]he requirement of competence, independence and 
impartiality of a tribunal in the sense of article 14, paragraph 1, is an absolute right that is 
not subject to any exception.&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, at para. 19). The Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 
November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985, state in this respect that &#8220;[t]here shall 
not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process, nor shall 
judicial decisions by the courts be subject to revision.&#8221; (Principle 4) 
</p>
<p>1219. It is our understanding that the laws of Yemen require that any judgment imposing 
the death sentence must be confirmed by the President. This requirement that any death 
sentence be confirmed by the Head of State, which Yemen shares with the legal systems of 
other States, does arguably involve an interference with the independence of the judiciary. 
It is, however, an interference which is expressly allowed by international human rights law 
to protect the right to life in capital punishment cases. Article 6(4) of the Covenant provides 
that &#8220;[a]nyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence&#8221;, which implies that in death penalty cases domestic law may empower the 
executive branch (or the legislature) to change the determination of the sentence by the 
judiciary. 
</p>
<p>1220. This exception to the principle of the independence of the judiciary is, however, 
limited to decisions to reduce the sentence imposed, not to make it harsher. Indeed, having 
stated that judicial decisions by the courts may not be subject to revision, the United 
Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary immediately add that &#8220;[t]his 
principle is without prejudice to judicial review or to mitigation or commutation by 
competent authorities of sentences imposed by the judiciary, in accordance with the law.&#8221; 
In conclusion, the independence of the judiciary requires that competent authorities 
belonging to other branches of government may interfere with sentences imposed by the 
judiciary only to mitigate or commute the sentence imposed, not to aggravate it. The 
President&#8217;s order to the Supreme Court to review the prison term imposed on Fatima 
Hussein Badi with a view to considering whether the death sentence would not be 
appropriate would, assuming the reports received are accurate, constitute a serious violation 
of this principle. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <b>353

<p>1221. With regard to the reports that the confessions of Fatima Hussein al-Badi and 
Abdullah Hussein al-Badi were extorted by the police after their arrest in July 2000, which 
we brought to the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government in our previous 
communication, a new and particularly disturbing allegation was brought to our attention. It 
is alleged that Fatima Hussein Badi was threatened with rape in the presence of her brother, 
who confessed in order to save her. 
</p>
<p>1222. In this respect, and with regard to her right to counsel, we appreciate the assurances 
by your Excellency&#8217;s Government that Fatima Hussein Badi &#8220;was not subjected to any form 
of mental or physical torture. A lawyer was appointed to present her defence from the very 
first stage of proceedings until the Supreme Court delivered its ruling.&#8221; We remain 
concerned, however, that &#8211; as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions observed &#8211; your &#8220;Government&#8217;s response consists of conclusory denials that do 
not appear to reflect a thorough investigation of whether confessions were extracted with 
torture or of whether legal representation was provided in fact as well as law.&#8221; 
(A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, p. 377) We renew our call on your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
subject these questions to independent and detailed investigation. 
</p>
<p>1223. We recall in this regard Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which stipulates that &#8220;Each State 
Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person 
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; In addition to being a crucial 
fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to 
physical and mental integrity set forth in several international human rights instruments, 
such as the above mentioned Convention against Torture and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, to both of which Yemen is a party.  
</p>
<p>1224. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital 
punishment as still allowed under international law protecting the right to life from a 
summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human right. We therefore urge 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under 
international law of Fatima Hussein Badi are fully respected. Considering the irreversible 
nature of the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty is not executed until 
all concerns we have raised are dispelled in their entirety. 
</p>
<p>1225. It is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the Human Rights 
Council, to seek to clarify all cases brought to our attention. Since we are expected to report 
on these cases to the Human Rights Council, we would be grateful for your cooperation and 
your observations on the following matters. 
</p>
<p>1. Are the reports above regarding the proceedings before the Supreme Court in 
the case of Fatima Hussein Badi accurate? Please explain the legal basis for the 
order by the President to the Supreme Court to review the sentence imposed against 
Fatima Hussein Badi. 
</p>
<p>2. Are the allegations above regarding the threats against and torture of Fatima 
Hussein Badi, aimed at extorting confessions from her and Abdullah Hussein al-
Badi, accurate? If not so, please share the results of any investigation and all 
information and documents proving their inaccuracy.

<p><b>  Yemen: Death sentences against Shaikh Khalid Nahshal, Mabkhout &#8216;Ali Nahshal and

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>354  
</b></p>
<p><b>Subject(s) of appeal</b>:  3 males 
</p>
<p><b>Character of reply</b>: No response  
</p>
<p><b>Observations of the Special Rapporteur</b>: The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of Yemen has failed to cooperate with the mandate that he has been given by 
the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal dated 22 September 2009</b>, sent with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>1226. In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to information we have received regarding the alleged imminent execution of 
Messrs. Shaikh Khalid Nahshal, Mabkhout &#8216;Ali Nahshal and Abduh Muhammad Nahshal.  
</p>
<p> According to information received: 
</p>
<p> The three men were arrested in connection with the killing of a government 
official in the district of Khayran in northern Yemen. The incident occurred 
following an exchange of fire between a group of armed men and government 
officials during disputes over the local and presidential elections in September 2006,  
</p>
<p> The three men at risk of execution are reported to be leading members of an 
opposition party, Islah. Their lawyers have indicated that they were not given full 
and effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against their clients, and that 
court judges who were hearing the case were threatened by relatives of the official 
who was killed. They also submitted that their clients may have been targeted 
because they had supported a candidate who had challenged the incumbent 
President, during the 2006 presidential elections.  
</p>
<p>1227. While we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of the allegations reported to us, we 
would like to respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (&#8220;ICCPR&#8221;), to which the Republic of Yemen is a 
party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this 
right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her 
life (Article 6).   
</p>
<p>1228. We would respectfully remind your Excellency&#8217;s Government that in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees 
for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the ICCPR admits of no exception. It is essential that 
capital punishment, whenever it is applied, should fully respect all fair trial standards 
contained in international human rights law in the relevant proceedings with the sentence 
being pronounced only after following a regular judicial process.  Relevant to the case at 
hand, these guarantees under article 14 (b) include the right that in the determination of any 
criminal charge an accused person shall be entitled to have adequate time and facilities for 
the preparation of his defense.  
</p>
<p>1229. With regard to the allegation that Judges were threatened during the course of the 
trial, we would like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, Adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 
September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 
1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985, and in particular principle 2 which stipulates that 
the judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in 
accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, 
pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason. 
Further the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 32 has stated that it is 
necessary to protect judges against intimidation.  </p>

<p>1230. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights of Messer&#8217;s Shaikh Khalid Nahshal, Mabkhout &#8216;Ali Nahshal and Abduh 
Muhammad Nahshal under international law of are respected. Considering the irreversible 
nature of capital punishment, this can only mean suspension of the death sentence against 
the three men until the question of whether fair trial guarantees were respected has been 
clarified. 
</p>
<p>1231. In view of the urgency of the matter, we would appreciate a response on the initial 
steps taken by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to safeguard the rights of the three men 
mentioned herein in compliance with your Government&#8217;s international legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>1232. Moreover, it is our responsibility under the mandates provided to us by the 
Commission on Human Rights and extended by the Human Rights Council, to seek to

</p>
<p>2. Please indicate what legal measures are in place to ensure that Messer&#8217;s 
Shaikh Khalid Nahshal, Mabkhout &#8216;Ali Nahshal and Abduh Muhammad Nahshal,

time for preparation of their defense.

<p>3. Please indicate what measures are in place to ensure that judges discharge 
their functions without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements,
