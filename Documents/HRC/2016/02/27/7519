<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolutions 16/2 and 21/2. The Special Rapporteur examines the 
wide range of violations of the human rights to water and sanitation, seeking to increase 
awareness of those violations and to promote a greater commitment to identifying, 
preventing and remedying them.  
</p>
<p>2. In the report, the Special Rapporteur presents a typology of common violations of 
the human rights to water and sanitation. This framework is intended to assist States and 
others to identify and prevent violations, and to ensure access to effective remedies for 
existing violations. The Special Rapporteur draws on her work over the course of her 
mandate. To a large extent, her activities have focused on compiling good practices and 
providing guidance regarding how to implement the rights to water and sanitation. Given 
the multitude of violations she has been confronted with, it is crucial to complement this by 
devoting a report to failures in realizing those rights, shedding light on persisting human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>3. In 1992, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that we 
&#8220;tolerate all too often breaches of economic, social and cultural rights which, if they 
occurred in relation to civil and political rights, would provoke expressions of horror and 
outrage and would lead to concerted calls for immediate remedial action&#8221;.1 Even though 
recent decades have witnessed enormous progress in identifying violations, taking them 
more seriously and remedying them, at the national as well as the international level, there 
is still a long way to go before violations of economic, social and cultural rights provoke 
not only outrage, but also give rise to adequate preventive and remedial action. 
</p>
<p>4. The framework presented is based on a comprehensive understanding of violations 
that may occur with respect to all components of human rights and the corresponding State 
obligations. The Special Rapporteur hopes to promote greater awareness of violations that 
are most likely to escape attention. While it is generally recognized that a failure to comply 
with any human rights obligation constitutes a violation, key components of the rights to 
water and sanitation are still too often viewed primarily as aspirational policy goals. Many 
situations of lack of enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation have not been clearly 
identified as violations; judicial or quasi-judicial mechanisms have not been resorted to, and 
such situations have not been addressed with the urgency and level of commitment that 
they require, particularly in the light of their potentially devastating effects on large 
numbers of people. Where States have the necessary resources, it is unjustifiable that 
deprivations of access to even basic provision of water and sanitation persist. 
</p>
<p>5. Violations of the rights to water and sanitation are often connected with systemic 
patterns of exclusion and unequal power relationships. Greater attention to violations of the 
rights to water and sanitation and their structural causes can empower marginalized groups 
to secure effective remedies. Beyond remedying individual violations, identifying patterns 
of violation will also help to prevent such violations and will require governments to 
address their structural causes in policy-making and budgeting. 
</p>
<p>6. Violations of the human rights to water and sanitation frequently correlate with 
broader deprivations and other violations, including of the human rights to life, health, 
food, housing, education, work and a healthy environment. Lack of adequate sanitation in 
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>

 A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.5, para. 5. </p>


<p>schools has huge implications for the right to education and gender equality. It also puts the 
right to privacy and human dignity at risk. These linkages become apparent in the case law 
dealing with water and sanitation, which frequently relies on the rights to life, to health, to 
housing, to a healthy environment and to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>7. The present report reflects critical developments in international human rights law 
and attempts to respond to new opportunities and challenges. The Special Rapporteur 
expects that the recent entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will lead to a greater commitment to 
address violations of the rights to water and sanitation, contribute to a better conceptual 
understanding and promote their justiciability at the national level, leading to greater 
compliance with these rights.  
</p>
<p>8. While it primarily focuses on the role of States, the Special Rapporteur hopes that 
the present report will be useful to quasi-judicial bodies in adjudicating complaints, and that 
it will assist civil society organizations, national human rights institutions and other 
advocates to provide strategic support in cases that address any type of violations of the 
rights to water and sanitation. Lastly, the report acknowledges the important role of non-
State actors, both in causing and remedying human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>9. The identification of human rights violations is not intended as an accusation of 
those responsible or to undermine collaborative partnerships in addressing violations. On 
the contrary, the Special Rapporteur considers exposing human rights violations as 
constructive and invites participatory dialogue about how to better address violations of the 
rights to water and sanitation. This will involve identifying barriers faced by victims in 
accessing justice, and assisting courts and other bodies to become more accessible and open 
to adjudicating cases concerning the rights to water and sanitation. Examples of violations 
drawn from domestic courts and international or regional human rights mechanisms are not 
intended to suggest that violations are more serious in certain States. Indeed, States from 
which more decisions originate are generally those that have provided access to justice, and 
may provide guidance to others.  
</p>
<p>10. The report is informed by a broad consultative process with States, international 
organizations, civil society organizations, national human rights institutions, other 
stakeholders and human rights experts. The Special Rapporteur received nearly 
50 responses to a questionnaire, bringing common patterns of violation to the fore.2 The 
report is also based on the experience gained during her mandate, in particular from 
communications received and country missions. While the countries visited were extremely 
diverse, many challenges faced were remarkably similar: patterns of marginalization and 
discrimination; failure to take the necessary steps to realize the rights to water and 
sanitation with the urgency required and to the maximum of available resources; failure to 
regulate and protect those rights where services were delegated to third parties; and 
instances of retrogressive measures and lack of sustainability.  
</p>
<p>11. The report establishes a comprehensive framework for assessing violations of the 
rights to water and sanitation. It surveys the wide range of violations, establishes 
corresponding categories and references them to cases. It briefly considers how 
accountability and remedial measures can most effectively address those violations. The 
report concludes with recommendations on how to better ensure that violations are 
identified, prevented and addressed.

<p><b> II. Establishing a comprehensive understanding of violations 
of the human rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>12. Developments over recent decades have brought greater clarity to the identification 
of violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines on 
Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights draw on the typology of obligations to 
respect, protect and fulfil human rights, clarifying that failures to comply with any 
obligation &#8211; be it failures to utilize maximum available resources, or deliberate actions &#8211; 
constitute violations.3  
</p>
<p>13. During the drafting of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the debates about the scope of violations of 
economic, social and cultural rights were definitively resolved. Initial proposals for a 
narrow concept of violations based on deliberate State &#8220;interference&#8221; or known failures to 
provide minimum essential levels of those rights were rejected.4 It was recognized that 
realizing the rights of the most disadvantaged relies also on addressing violations resulting 
from failures to take positive steps.5 States are obliged to progressively realize rights by 
applying &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; and by prioritizing essential levels of access to 
the most marginalized. Ultimately, States have the obligation to fully realize the rights to 
water and sanitation by ensuring access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, accessible and 
affordable water and sanitation services for all. 
</p>
<p>14. Ensuring access to justice for victims of a State&#8217;s failure to meet any of its 
obligations is critical to guaranteeing that judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms do not 
reinforce patterns of systemic inequality and deprivation, or exclude some of the most 
egregious human rights violations. The Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provide that any failure to comply 
with human rights obligations, including obligations to progressively realize economic, 
social and cultural rights, constitutes a violation.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur embraces a comprehensive understanding of violations of 
the rights to water and sanitation. Even though all types of violations of rights to water and 
sanitation are serious, denial of access to services due to discrimination or disconnection 
from services may be more easily identified as violations. Situations where States have 
failed to adopt reasonable measures or to allocate appropriate resources are less familiar to 
many courts and raise additional challenges in determining whether a violation has 
occurred. Yet such types of violations often involve the greatest number of victims and the 
most intolerable deprivations.

<p>violations, applying the categories of human rights obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
the right to water. While the Committee has not yet adopted a general comment on the right 
to sanitation, it has issued a formal statement recognizing that similar obligations apply,6 
following an approach taken by the Special Rapporteur in her 2009 report to the Council.7 
The present report applies this framework and develops a typology of common violations of 
the rights to water and sanitation. In addition to the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil, 
it puts a particular emphasis on equality and non-discrimination, as well as on participation, 
and also examines extraterritorial obligations. The latter obligations cut across the &#8220;respect, 
protect, fulfil&#8221; framework. This typology is not proposed as a rigid classification, being 
utilized as a framework for surveying the range of violations which must be addressed, with 
inevitable overlaps in the categories. What is most important is to ensure that no type of 
violation is ignored and that no victim is denied access to effective remedies.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Violations of the obligation to respect  
</b></p>
<p>17. The obligation to respect the rights to water and sanitation requires States to refrain 
from action that will unjustifiably interfere with their enjoyment. This obligation is of 
immediate effect. Common violations of the obligation to respect can be placed within the 
following categories:  
</p>
<p>(a) Direct interference with access to water or sanitation;  
(b) Pollution, diversion or depletion of water resources;  
(c) Criminalization of activities linked to water or sanitation and punitive 
measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Direct interference with access to water or sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>18. Under the category of direct interference, common violations take the form of 
(a) unjustifiable or discriminatory denial of access to water or sanitation; (b) unjustifiable 
disconnection from services (including from prepaid water meters), for example when 
people are unable to pay and are left without access to even basic services; (c) unjustifiable 
restrictions on access to water or sanitation, such as latrines and toilets being locked at 
night or fenced-off water sources; (d) unaffordable increases in pricing; (e) land grabbing or 
other measures resulting in forced relocation that deprive the affected persons of access to 
water or sanitation services without an adequate alternative; and (f) destroying or poisoning 
water facilities or infrastructure during armed conflict, which would violate international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>19. Violations through direct interference are often addressed by national courts 
interpreting domestic law in line with international human rights law. The Court of Appeal 
of Botswana, for example, relied on the right to water as set out in general comment No. 15 
and the General Assembly resolution on the right to water and sanitation to interpret 
constitutional provisions. It found that preventing a community of Bushmen from accessing 
their traditional boreholes amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.8 In the context of 
informal settlements in Argentina, a court found that a discontinuation of water supplied 
with tanker trucks violated the rights to &#8220;a healthy environment and dignified housing&#8221;,

<p>ordering the resumption of water provision. 9  The court also ordered the progressive 
improvement of the water distribution system, thereby demonstrating that violations of the 
obligation to respect are often linked to violations of obligations to fulfil. The Human 
Rights Committee found that Bulgaria had violated the right to home and family, as well as 
the rights to life and non-discrimination, by allowing the Municipality of Sofia to 
disconnect the water supply to a Roma community.10 The Committee requested Bulgaria to 
issue interim measures requiring the authorities to reconnect the water supply.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Pollution, diversion or depletion of water resources 
</b></p>
<p>20. Pollution and over-abstraction of water resources through industrial activities or 
dumping are among the most commonly identified threats to the realization of the human 
rights to water and sanitation.11 Where such pollution or over-abstraction results from State 
action, such as (a) dumping of waste and sewage, (b) the activities of State-controlled 
extractive industries, or (c) licensing of projects predicted to result in human rights 
violations, States may be in violation of their obligation to respect the rights to water and 
sanitation.  
</p>
<p>21. In Argentina, a court considered the situation of impoverished neighbourhoods in 
C&#243;rdoba, where wells had been contaminated with faecal and other matter from a water 
treatment plant overflowing with untreated sewage.12 The court ordered the municipality to 
take urgent measures to address the situation, including providing 200 litres of safe water 
per household per day until a permanent solution was found. With regard to the licensing of 
projects such as mining, the Special Rapporteur has received numerous communications 
alleging water contamination.13  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Criminalization of activities linked to water or sanitation and punitive measures 
</b></p>
<p>22. Other violations arise from the criminalization of activities linked to access to water 
or sanitation, such as the prohibition of public defecation or urination when no other 
options are available &#8211; partially as a result of increasing closures of public facilities.14 The 
criminalization of homelessness frequently leads to serious violations of the right to 
sanitation, but these are rarely taken to court by affected groups, as they often face serious 
stigma and a constant battle to survive. However, a  court in the United States struck down 
ordinances preventing homeless people from engaging in life-sustaining activities linked to 
the right to sanitation: &#8220;The harmless conduct for which they are arrested is inseparable 
from their involuntary condition of being homeless. Consequently, arresting homeless 
people for harmless acts they are forced to perform in public effectively punishes them for 
being homeless&#8221;.15 On her mission to the United States, the Special Rapporteur observed

<p>circumstances among homeless people who had devised a makeshift &#8220;toilet&#8221; from which 
one individual carried bags of human waste to dispose of in public toilets. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that this may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.16 The 
Human Rights Committee in its review of the United States also expressed concern with 
respect to the criminalization of behaviours related to homelessness.17 
</p>
<p>23. Violations also result from decisions to deprive stigmatized groups, such as 
homeless people, undocumented migrants, occupiers of informal settlements or prisoners, 
of water and sanitation as a form of punishment for unlawful or undesired activity. The 
Special Rapporteur on torture has documented that detainees have been forced to rely on 
water to drink delivered by their families, or on water from toilets. 18  The Special 
Rapporteur on water and sanitation has also voiced concerns that limiting access to water 
and sanitation may be used as a, sometimes excessive, form of  punishment for prisoners.19 
In cases of secret detention, Special Rapporteurs 20  and the Council of Europe have 
expressed concern about detainees being forced to wear diapers, which is &#8220;offensive to the 
notions of dignity&#8221;.21  
</p><p>24. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to see that violations of the obligation to respect, 
such as unjustifiable disconnections or pollution of water resources are regularly brought to 
court. She encourages greater attention to violations that are linked to discrimination and 
stigmatization and threaten the inherent and equal dignity of all human beings. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violations of the obligation to protect and abuses by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>25. The obligation to protect requires States to enact and enforce necessary protections 
of the rights to water and sanitation to protect individuals from human rights abuses by 
third parties. Such obligation is generally considered to be of immediate effect, although in 
some cases it will take time and resources to develop the necessary institutional capacity 
and frameworks. Non-State actors, including private actors and international organizations, 
also contribute to the realization of human rights and, conversely, their action or inaction 
may also lead to human rights abuses. Where private actors are involved in the provision of 
water and sanitation services, their role comes with human rights responsibilities.22 Where 
States fail to provide services, private actors may be the only ones who step in as providers. 
Other private actors may have an impact on the rights to water and sanitation through their 
industrial or agricultural activities.  
</p>
<p>26. Violations of the obligation to protect can be grouped under several categories:  
</p>
<p>(a) Failure to protect in the context of service provision;  
(b) Failure to protect necessary resources or infrastructure from pollution or 
interference; 
</p>
<p>(c) At the same time, non-State actors may fail to comply with their human 
rights responsibilities.

<p><b> 1. Failure to protect in the context of service provision 
</b></p>
<p>27. Failures to protect rights in the context of service provision usually stem from a lack 
of regulation or lack of enforcement of such regulation. They may also be the result of 
negotiating service contracts that fail to protect users&#8217; rights. Violations may occur when 
States (a) fail to effectively regulate and control service providers in relation to safety, 
quantity, conditions of service or disconnections; (b) fail to regulate pricing to ensure that 
services are affordable for everyone; (c) fail to prevent discrimination by private actors; 
(d) fail to ensure that service providers extend services to marginalized households or 
communities; (e) fail to require provision of reasonable accommodation of disability or 
extenuating circumstances; or (f) fail to ensure that monitoring and complaints procedures 
are in place. 
</p>
<p>28. One example of enforcing the obligation to protect is an Argentine case in which the 
court prohibited a private company from disconnecting the water supply due to non-
payment, relying on the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights 
(art. 11) and other human rights instruments, which are directly applicable in Argentina.23 
The Greek Council of State recently blocked the planned privatization of the Athens Water 
Supply and Sewerage Company, arguing that it could put public health at risk due to the 
anticipated deterioration of water and sanitation quality.24 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Failure to protect resources or infrastructure from pollution or interference 
</b></p>
<p>29. Failures to protect necessary resources and infrastructure relate to issues such as 
(a) failure to protect water distribution or sanitation infrastructure from interference, 
damage and destruction; (b) failure to regulate excessive exploitation of water resources by 
third parties that leads to deprivation of water necessary for personal and domestic uses; 
and (c) failure to develop and enforce regulation to protect water resources from 
contamination. 
</p>
<p>30. In the case of <i>Sardinal</i>,25 the Costa Rican Supreme Court ordered the authorities to 
assess whether a permit should be granted to build a pipeline that would withdraw water 
from an aquifer, in order to make sure that the pipeline would not deprive the local 
population of water for personal and domestic use. Without certainty that there would be 
sufficient water, the pipeline would violate the residents&#8217; rights, including that to a healthy 
environment. A French court held a public water company accountable for ensuring that the

Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights found violations, inter alia of the rights to life 
and to health, owing to the failure of the Government of Nigeria to monitor the impact of 
oil operations polluting water in the Niger Delta.27

<p>supported by international financial institutions &#8211; have been brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteur.28 The Special Rapporteur on toxic waste also examined the detrimental 
impact of extractive industries and disposal of toxic wastes on water.29 Such violations can 
be prevented by effective regulation. Where violations take place, access to justice for those 
affected must be guaranteed. Courts and human rights bodies should play a more active role 
in requiring governments to enact protective measures.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Failure to comply with human rights responsibilities by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>32. Independently of State obligations to protect vis-&#224;-vis non-State actors, the latter 
also have human rights responsibilities and may be held accountable for failures. Under the 
United Nations Guiding Principles, businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights 
and to exercise due diligence to avoid any action which would result in human rights abuses 
in the scope of their operations, including their supply chain.30 If non-State actors abuse 
human rights, victims must be ensured access to justice.  
</p><p>33. International organizations may also contribute to the perpetration of violations, 
which calls for enhanced accountability. Article 55 (c) of the Charter of the United Nations 
stipulates that the United Nations shall promote &#8220;universal respect for, and observance of, 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all&#8221;. It would go against the very object and 
purpose of the Charter if the United Nations itself were not required to respect the human 
rights law it promotes. 
</p>
<p>34. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti has come under scrutiny for its 
role in the cholera epidemic in Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. The epidemic 
killed over 8,500 people, sickened more than 700,000 and is still ongoing. It has been 
alleged that the cholera was brought in by peacekeepers and that it spread because of 
haphazardly constructed sanitation facilities that leaked sewage into a river that was an 
important source of drinking water.31 The United Nations has rejected the accusations and 
claimed immunity based on the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United 
Nations, but United Nations human rights representatives are increasingly calling on the 
United Nations to establish responsibility. The Independent Expert on Haiti has stressed the 
need &#8220;to assure the Haitian people that the epidemic will be halted as soon as possible and 
that full reparation for damages will be provided&#8221;. He called for clarification of the facts 
and for realization of the right to a remedy, arguing that the &#8220;United Nations should be the 
first to honour these principles&#8221;32 and that &#8220;silence is the worst response&#8221;.33 The United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an investigation by the United 
Nations and the country concerned, and called for &#8220;those who suffered as a result of that 
cholera be provided with compensation&#8221;.34 The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize the 
obligation to investigate the allegations in order to establish responsibility for any 
violations and to ensure the alleged victims&#8217; right to a remedy, including compensation, if 
warranted. She welcomes the commitment by the United Nations to eradicate the disease in 
Haiti and urges it to meet that commitment by providing adequate resources. She further

<p>calls on the United Nations to establish appropriate accountability mechanisms for ongoing 
and future missions as well as to review and reinforce measures for adequate sanitation and 
preventive measures. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violations of the obligation to fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>35. Violations of the obligation to fulfil may be the most critical category. Such 
violations are often complex and affect a large number of victims, yet they have generally 
received the least attention. Potential claimants face considerable challenges in relation to 
gaining access to justice for alleged structural or systemic violations. Jurisprudence, 
including the standards of review developed by courts in recent years, has demonstrated, 
however, that violations of the obligation to fulfil can indeed be adjudicated.  
</p><p>36. Violations of the obligation to fulfil can be grouped in the following categories: 
</p>
<p>(a) Failure to develop, implement and monitor strategies, plans and programmes; 
(b) Failure to properly raise, allocate and utilize the maximum available resources; 
(c) Corrupt practices; 
(d) Unjustified retrogressive measures; 
(e) Failure to prioritize the necessary steps to ensure minimum essential levels of access 
to water and sanitation;  
</p>
<p>(f) Failure to provide adequate services in public facilities and institutions and in 
emergency situations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Failure to develop, implement and monitor strategies, plans and programmes  
</b></p>
<p>37. Article 2(1) of the Covenant stipulates that States must take steps to achieve 
progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate 
means. Steps must be deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards the 
full realization of human rights.35 Where resource constraints prevent a State from fully 
realizing the rights to water and sanitation immediately there is an immediate obligation to 
adopt a strategy for the realization of those rights. To assess progress towards the full 
realization of human rights, States must monitor progress. The Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights regularly calls on countries to put into place mechanisms for that 
purpose.36 
</p>
<p>38. Violations may result from failure: (a) to design and implement a strategy based on 
human rights standards and principles; (b) to identify and meet targets in line with human 
rights standards; (c) to ensure effective monitoring and accountability; and (d) to target 
vulnerable or marginalized communities.  
</p>
<p>39. A seminal decision on the obligation to progressively realize socioeconomic rights is 
that taken in the <i>Grootboom</i> case, in which the Constitutional Court of South Africa 
considered the plight of a community lacking basic shelter, sanitation facilities and access 
to clean water. 37  To determine whether the State had complied with the obligation of

<p>progressive realization, the Court applied a standard of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221;.38 It held that a 
reasonable programme must: be comprehensive, coherent and coordinated; be capable of 
facilitating the realization of the right; prioritize the needs of those in the most desperate 
situations; make appropriate financial and human resources available; be balanced and 
flexible; make appropriate provision for short-, medium- and long-term needs; be 
reasonably conceived and implemented; and be transparent.39 Through that approach, the 
Court clarified that, while it is the role of the Government to determine precise policies and 
programmes, it is the proper role of courts to assess whether policies and programmes are 
in compliance with human rights. In <i>Grootboom</i>, the Court found that the State&#8217;s 
programmes failed to address as a priority the circumstances of those in the most desperate 
situations, and required the Government to take measures to correct this.40  
</p>
<p>40. The Optional Protocol incorporates the standard of reasonableness in article 8(4), 
which stipulates that States may choose the precise means to realize Covenant rights from a 
range of options, but stresses that it is the role of the Committee to assess whether those 
measures are reasonable. In the light of limited national jurisprudence addressing States&#8217; 
failures to progressively realize the rights to water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur 
urges States to ensure that courts have the authority to adjudicate such cases and that judges 
and prosecutors are adequately trained to make such assessments.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Failure to properly raise, allocate and utilize available resources or to budget 
appropriately  
</b></p>
<p>41. A leading cause of systemic violations of the rights to water and sanitation relates to 
the failure of States to raise, allocate and utilize necessary resources.41 Violations can be 
grouped into the following types: (a) failure to raise the maximum available resources 
through taxation and other sources of revenue; (b) failure to combat tax evasion and illicit 
financial flows; (c) failure to seek and accept international assistance where needed; 
(d) failure to allocate appropriate levels of funding; (f) failure to fully utilize allocated 
resources; (e) failure to direct resources to meeting the needs of vulnerable or marginalized 
communities; and (g) failure to direct sufficient funds to sub-national governments and 
other delegated authorities to allow them to fulfil their roles. 
</p>
<p>42. Current water and sanitation budgets may not reflect maximum available resources, 
as they may have been developed on the basis of budget decisions or fiscal policy that 
failed to prioritize the rights to water and sanitation. Existing budgets must therefore not be 
equated with available resources. In the <i>Blue Moonlight</i> case, the South African 
Constitutional Court demonstrated the role that courts can play in determining whether 
budgets comply with human rights obligations using the standard of reasonableness, 
holding that &#8220;it is not good enough for the City to state that it has not budgeted for 
something, if it should indeed have planned and budgeted for it in the fulfilment of its 
obligations&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>43. Civil society organizations have also made important advances in assessing whether 
maximum available resources are being raised and utilized, providing evidence on which to

<p>adjudicate claims. The Special Rapporteur recommends that courts, human rights bodies, 
and civil society make concerted efforts to demand budget transparency and bring 
budgetary decisions under review for human rights compliance. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Corrupt practices 
</b></p>
<p>44. Human rights violations may result from misappropriation of resources allocated for 
the realization of the rights to water and sanitation. Corruption directly affects the available 
resources for basic service provision: in 2006 the World Bank estimated that there would be 
a loss of US$ 20 billion in financing over the next decade.43 Corruption increases the price 
of services, making them unaffordable, for example when bribes have to be paid. Corrupt 
practices disproportionately affect poor and marginalized groups, who lack the resources to 
pay bribes and the power and voice to oppose the vested interests of elites.44  
</p>
<p>45. While courts tend to address corruption as an issue of criminal law, there has also 
been success in securing compensation for users of services who suffer the effects of 
corruption, and in linking corruption to human rights. In a case of corruption in the 
privatization of water services in Grenoble, France, the Court of Appeal ruled that 
FF 300,000 in compensation be awarded. 45  The Court of Justice of the Economic 
Community of West African States found that the misappropriation of public funds could 
constitute a violation of the right to education and required compensation.46  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Unjustified retrogressive measures  
</b>46. A retrogressive measure is one that leads to a backward movement in the enjoyment 
of the human rights to water and sanitation.47 The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has stated that the burden of proof rests with the State to show that the 
adoption of retrogressive measures was based on the most careful consideration of 
alternatives, that disadvantaged groups have been prioritized and that the measures can be 
justified by reference to the totality of the rights and by the fact that full use was made of 
available resources.48 The Committee has mainly expressed concern about measures that 
are deliberately retrogressive, in particular in the context of austerity measures. 49  The 
Special Rapporteur has previously stated that even if not deliberately retrogressive, some 
acts and omissions may have a retrogressive effect, for instance where States fail to ensure 
operation and maintenance and services are unsustainable as a result. Even where 
retrogression is non-deliberate, the human rights framework obliges States to act with care 
and deliberation, to assess the impacts of their actions and omissions, and to adjust their 
policies and measures as soon as they become aware that current policies might lead to 
unsustainable results.50 States&#8217; failure to meet this obligation may result in human rights 
violations.

 Report by the Special Rapporteur on water and sanitation (A/HRC/24/44), para. 16. </p>


<p>47. Examples of common violations include (a) raising prices excessively so that poor 
people can no longer afford even basic services; (b) reducing social benefits on which poor 
people rely; (c) allowing infrastructure to deteriorate due to a failure to ensure operation 
and maintenance; and (d) implementing austerity measures that create long-term 
retrogression not limited to the period of crisis or which disproportionately impact 
marginalized or vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>48. A particular concern relates to private sector participation and withdrawal of State 
regulation, oversight and provision in times of austerity. The Portuguese auditing institution 
found that private-public partnerships &#8211; by not sharing risks and benefits equally &#8211; benefit 
largely the private sector, that they are detrimental to the people and that services are often 
of lower quality while higher prices are charged.51  The Special Rapporteur has raised 
related concerns in a series of communications.52  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Failure to ensure minimum essential levels of access to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>49. The obligation to ensure minimum essential levels of water and sanitation is 
considered an immediate obligation.53 However, huge numbers of people lack access to 
even basic services, and more than one billion people practise open defecation. Where a 
State has the capacity and resources to ensure minimum essential levels of rights, this 
obligation must be met immediately. In many instances, it can be achieved with a 
redistribution of resources and comprehensive strategies and plans aimed at achieving 
universal access. However, the human rights framework does not demand the impossible. 
There are situations where States lack the capacity to ensure access to basic services for all 
immediately. In such circumstances, human rights law requires that addressing such 
massive deprivations related to the minimum essential levels of the rights to water and 
sanitation be accorded the highest priority. A State &#8220;must demonstrate that every effort has 
been made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of 
priority, those minimum obligations&#8221;.54 Hence, where minimum essential levels are not 
ensured, the State is, <i>prima facie,</i> violating human rights, and it bears the burden of proof to 
demonstrate that it lacks the capacity to do so.55 
</p>
<p>50. Courts have held in a number of circumstances that minimum essential levels of 
water and sanitation must be ensured immediately. In circumstances where capacity 
existed, the Constitutional Court of Colombia held that the authorities had to connect 
housing to water and sewerage and to ensure a sufficient daily amount of water.56 The 
Supreme Court of India dealt with lack of basic sanitation in more desperate circumstances, 
in a case where informal settlements collectively complained that the cesspits used for 
sanitation were overflowing and causing serious health concerns. The Court ordered the

<p>municipality to construct a sufficient number of public latrines and to provide water supply 
and desludging services.57 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Failure to provide adequate services in public facilities and institutions and in 
emergency situations 
</b></p>
<p>51. Where individuals are in a situation where they cannot provide for themselves, 
States have an obligation to provide services, for instance in places of detention, in schools 
or other public institutions, and in times of emergency.  
</p>
<p>52. The Indian Supreme Court ordered schools to provide adequate toilet facilities in 
schools.58 Relying on empirical research showing that &#8220;parents do not send their children 
(particularly girls) to schools&#8221;59 wherever sanitation facilities are not provided, the Court 
found that a lack of toilets violated the right to education. Failure to provide water and 
sanitation to those deprived of liberty has been addressed by courts and international bodies 
primarily as constituting cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The High Court of Fiji 
held that prisoners&#8217; right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment was violated 
by lack of access to adequate sanitation facilities.60 The Human Rights Committee has 
found human rights violations, as have regional human rights bodies, in a number of cases 
in which prisoners have been denied access to sanitation.61  
</p>
<p>53. States are obliged to have plans in place to respond to potential situations of 
emergency or natural disaster. Because individuals are usually unable to provide for 
themselves in such situations, States have an obligation to provide culturally appropriate 
services directly. 62  As State capacity is often limited in such situations, international 
organizations, non-governmental organizations, donors and other humanitarian 
organizations play an important role in responding to emergencies. Violations can occur 
where States and other actors (a) fail to design sustainable, resilient systems; (b) fail to have 
emergency plans in place; (c) fail to respond promptly to provide essential services to 
affected populations as the highest priority; (d) fail to allow access to humanitarian service 
providers, or create onerous barriers to access; or (e) fail to prioritize the most vulnerable 
populations during times of emergency.  
</p>
<p>54. While case law for enforcing the obligation to fulfil is still relatively limited, the 
Special Rapporteur is pleased to witness significant advances in almost all areas &#8211; from 
ensuring minimum essential levels to progressive realization through plans and strategies 
and scrutinizing budgets. She encourages all stakeholders to further such initiatives to build 
a more comprehensive body of case law.

<p><b> D. Violations of the obligation to refrain from discrimination and to 
ensure substantive equality 
</b></p>
<p>55. The prohibition of discrimination is of immediate effect, while positive measures 
and programmes to ensure substantive equality may require resource allocation and 
infrastructure development over time. The prohibition of discrimination allows for, and in 
many circumstances requires, differential treatment and other measures designed to 
eliminate systemic or structural discrimination. To identify inequalities, and progress 
towards eliminating them, States must develop monitoring mechanisms and collect 
disaggregated data.63 Moreover, States are obligated not only to eliminate discrimination 
resulting from State action or inaction, but also to &#8220;immediately adopt the necessary 
measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and attitudes which cause or 
perpetuate substantive or de facto discrimination&#8221; including discrimination by private 
actors, 64  which must include measures to combat stigmatization. 65  Moreover, the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities explicitly stipulates that denial of 
reasonable accommodation constitutes discrimination (art. 2).  
</p><p>56. Examples of violations of the right to equality and non-discrimination can be 
grouped in the following categories: 
</p>
<p>(a) Exclusion of groups or individuals from services or facilities, or failure to 
take measures to achieve substantive equality and address systemic patterns of 
inequalities;  
</p>
<p>(b) Failure to reasonably accommodate persons with disabilities and take into 
account particular requirements;  
</p>
<p>(c) Failure to prevent and combat discrimination and stigmatization in the private 
sphere, or endorsement of stigmatizing practices through State action; 
</p>
<p>(d) Failure to monitor inequalities in access to water and sanitation and to collect 
disaggregated data for that purpose.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Exclusion from facilities or services or failure to address systemic inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>57. Inequalities in access to water and sanitation are often due to systemic neglect or 
exclusion. Courts have successfully adjudicated on discrimination in provision of water, 
and the requirement to prioritize access by marginalized groups in order to remedy systemic 
discrimination. In a case in Florida, the court ruled that the municipality could not 
implement any infrastructure in white majority areas until the African-American majority 
areas that lacked provision of water were on par with those areas. 66  The European 
Committee of Social Rights also ordered remedial action including &#8220;a positive obligation of 
authorities to take such [disproportion] into account and respond accordingly&#8221; to improve 
the situation with regard to housing and water for Roma.67 Violations of the rights to water 
and sanitation of indigenous peoples is evidence of historic patterns of colonialism and

Rights determined that denying an indigenous community access to ancestral lands denied 
them access to water and sanitation and violated the right to life<i>.</i>69 
</p>
<p>58. While remedies have been provided in the context of discrimination on account of 
race or minority status, there are fewer examples of such remedies when discrimination is 
on other grounds, such as property or socio-economic status, including for those living in 
poverty, those residing in informal settlements, the homeless and similarly marginalized or 
vulnerable groups. Discrimination on any prohibited grounds is a violation of the rights to 
water and sanitation, and access to justice must be ensured for the full scope of prohibited 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Failure to provide reasonable accommodation and to meet particular requirements 
</b></p>
<p>59. Failure to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities has far-
reaching effects and may amount to violations of the rights to water or sanitation. The 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities raised concerns about water and 
sanitation service provision not taking into account the needs of persons with disabilities.70 
The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the lack of reasonable accommodation in 
sanitation facilities for children with disabilities in schools, in extreme instances forcing 
parents to stay at school with their children to allow them to meet their sanitation needs.71 
Moreover, inadequate facilities for menstrual hygiene management have been shown to 
prevent girls from attending school, as well as creating serious health consequences.72 
People with health conditions also often require particular protection. The Colombian 
Constitutional Court found that the disconnection of water services to a woman with 
chronic kidney failure violated the right to life, and ordered the reinstatement of the 
service.73  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Failure to prevent and combat stigmatization and to take measures against 
discrimination in the private sphere 
</b></p>
<p>60. Discriminatory and stigmatizing practices frequently occur in the private sphere. 
States have an obligation to prevent and combat stigmatization and to protect against 
human rights abuses in the private sphere. Where States fail to adopt appropriate measures, 
this may amount to human rights violations. More directly, human rights are violated where 
States endorse, perpetuate and reinforce discriminatory and stigmatizing practices, for 
instance through the criminalization of homelessness or employing manual scavengers or 
sweepers.74 
</p>
<p>61. Examples of violations include (a) lack of protection against denial of access to 
facilities; (b) lack of protection of health and dignity for sanitation workers; (c) lack of 
protection from violence when accessing facilities; and (d) lack of protection from harmful 
practices, in particular in the context of sanitation and menstrual hygiene.

<p>62. People may be deliberately excluded from the use of existing facilities, for instance 
through societal rules preventing Dalits from using water fountains 75  or not allowing 
women and girls or other individuals to use an existing toilet in the household.76 Inordinate 
amounts of time spent by women and girls carrying water have major impacts on access to 
paid employment and education. Measures to address such practices could seek to alleviate 
that burden, for instance by making water collection over long distances unnecessary by 
providing direct access, while challenging the stereotypes which lead to that task being 
assigned to women. 
</p>
<p>63. Sanitation workers frequently face serious health risks, stigmatization, violence and 
exploitation. In India, the Parliament adopted an act requiring that sanitation systems be 
overhauled so as to eliminate the need for manual scavengers and seeking to eradicate 
stigma, inter alia by arranging for alternative jobs.77 The Supreme Court of India observed 
that &#8220;manual scavengers are considered as untouchables by other mainstream castes and are 
thrown into a vortex of severe social and economic exploitation&#8221;. 78  It held that the 
continuation of manual scavenging violated human rights and ordered the State to fully 
implement the new act and take appropriate action in response to any violations.79 
</p>
<p>64. Women and girls are frequently subjected to unacceptable risks of violence, 
including sexual violence, in accessing water and sanitation facilities. Their right to 
personal security may be violated by failures to provide adequate protection from violence, 
including through appropriate design and placement of facilities with the participation of 
women.80 Many other groups and individuals such as Dalits and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex individuals also face violence in accessing water and sanitation, 
often linked to deeply entrenched stigmatization.81 
</p>
<p>65. Many cultures have certain prescriptions for women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; behaviour during 
menstruation which may amount to harmful traditional and cultural practices, violating not 
only the right to sanitation but, more broadly, women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights and gender 
equality. In Nepal, the Supreme Court issued an order to eliminate the practice of <i>chaupadi</i>, 
which forces menstruating women and girls to sleep in isolation from the rest of the family, 
in a hut or shed, with risks to their health and security. The Court declared that the practice 
was discriminatory and violated women&#8217;s rights. It ordered the Government to conduct a 
study on the impact of the practice, to create awareness and to take measures to eliminate 
the tradition.82

<p><b> 4. Failure to monitor inequalities in access to water and sanitation and to collect 
disaggregated data for that purpose 
</b></p>
<p>66. Without collecting data on inequalities, States are unable to identify systemic 
discrimination and inequalities. The failure to collect data makes it more difficult, if not 
impossible, to hold States to account for a lack of progress. In the context of disability, 
article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities explicitly obliges 
States to collect and disaggregate data to enable them to formulate appropriate policies. 
There is often a misconception that the collection of disaggregated data would be 
discriminatory as such. However, the contrary is true: disaggregated data are necessary in 
order to address inequalities.83 Where States fail to take reasonable measures and to make 
monitoring part of their planning exercises, they may be violating human rights. In 
collecting such data, States must put in place appropriate mechanisms to safeguard the 
privacy and security of individuals and groups and prevent misuse of data. This includes 
repealing laws that criminalize people because of their identity, for instance on the basis of 
sexual orientation or gender identity, in order to avoid a particular population group being 
targeted and abused under the pretext of monitoring. Without such safeguards, being 
identified as a distinct group may be politically sensitive, reinforce stigma and result in 
grave risks to individuals and groups. 
</p>
<p>67. Violations of rights to non-discrimination and equality infuse other rights violations. 
What has become increasingly clear to the Special Rapporteur is that systemic and 
widespread denials of access to water and sanitation are first and foremost driven by 
patterns of discrimination, stigmatization and exclusion. Challenging violations of rights to 
water and sanitation invariably confronts endemic patterns of inequalities. More efforts are 
needed, in particular with regard to challenging discrimination faced by persons with 
disabilities, inequalities based on socioeconomic status, and discrimination and 
stigmatization deeply entrenched in society. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Violations of the obligation to ensure active, free and meaningful 
participation 
</b></p>
<p>68. Article 25 (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides 
for the right to participate in public affairs. Participation must be active, free and 
meaningful. While it is often stressed that participation has significant instrumental value in 
ensuring more sustainable results, participation is a human right in itself, and non-
compliance with the relevant human rights obligations may give rise to violations. Such 
violations may arise from direct denial of participation as well as indirect, by failure to take 
reasonable steps to facilitate participation, including by ensuring the right to access to 
information.  
</p>
<p>69. Courts have found that denying the right to participation constitutes a violation. The 
South African Constitutional Court developed the concept of &#8220;meaningful engagement&#8221; in 
the <i>51 Olivia Road</i> case 84, holding that rights holders have a right to participate in decisions 
affecting the enjoyment of social rights, including in the development of plans. The Court 
found that the City of Johannesburg had made no effort to engage and hence had not met its 
obligations. The concept of meaningful engagement has since been taken up by courts in

<p>other countries, for instance in Kenya.85 In the <i>Beja </i>case, a South African court found that a 
denial of meaningful engagement and effective community participation in decision-
making regarding the design and installation of toilets violated constitutional rights.86 The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that increased attention be paid to the obligation to ensure 
participation. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Violations of extraterritorial obligations 
</b></p>
<p>70. Violations of extraterritorial obligations are a growing concern in relation to the 
rights to water and sanitation, for instance in the context of transboundary water resources, 
the activities of transnational corporations, or donor activities. The Maastricht Principles on 
Extraterritorial Obligations, adopted by 40 experts to clarify the extraterritorial obligations 
of States on the basis of existing international law, affirm that the obligations to respect, 
protect and fulfil extend extraterritorially and that States must ensure the right to a 
remedy. 87  Human rights obligations also apply to actions of States as members of 
international organizations.88 The International Law Commission stated that a State member 
of an international organization would be breaking international law if it caused that 
organization to commit an act that would be illegal under international law for a State to 
carry out itself.89 
</p>
<p>71. Extraterritorial violations may occur, for example, when (a) States fail to regulate 
activities of companies under their jurisdiction that cause violations abroad; (b) States 
contribute to human rights violations in the context of development cooperation activities, 
including by imposing conditions that undermine rights; (c) States adopt sanctions that 
negatively affect the realization of human rights in other countries; (d) States fail to 
respect human rights or restrict the ability of others to comply with their human rights 
obligations in the process of elaborating, applying and interpreting international trade and 
investment agreements; (e) States fail to prevent harm resulting from greenhouse gas 
emissions which contribute to climate change that have negative impacts on the realization 
of human rights;90 and (f) water contamination or use causes human rights violations in a 
neighbouring country. 
</p>
<p>72. Treaty bodies have increasingly addressed violations of extraterritorial obligations. 
The Human Rights Committee has called for the regulation and monitoring of corporate 
activities abroad that may violate human rights and for measures to ensure access to 
remedies in the event of such violations.91 Both the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have expressed concern about the 
denial by Israel of access to water and sanitation and about the destruction of infrastructure

<p>in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.92 The Special Rapporteur recommends that increased 
attention be paid to violations of extraterritorial obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to justice  
</b>73. The purpose of a more focused consideration of violations of the rights to water and 
sanitation is to promote more concerted action to ensure access to justice. The Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights points out that &#8220;all victims of violations of the 
right to water should be entitled to adequate reparation, including restitution, compensation, 
satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition&#8221;.93  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes a remedial rather than punitive approach. While 
it is important in some cases to hold those responsible for violations accountable for their 
actions, the general focus should be on what needs to be done to remedy violations and on 
who is responsible for remedying violations, rather than on who is to blame. The Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that initiatives to better identify and remedy violations of human 
rights should not be seen as adversarial or undermining of constructive dialogue. The rights 
and interests of rights holders must be the focus of remedying violations. As such, access to 
justice for violations of the rights to water and sanitation can serve to equalize power 
dynamics. 
</p>
<p>75. International mechanisms for identifying, adjudicating and remedying violations 
offer important opportunities for developing clearer understanding of violations and 
appropriate remedies. Inquiry mechanisms allow the treaty bodies to act at their own 
initiative and offer an innovative tool to address systemic violations of rights and situations 
where victims are unable to seek remedies. However, international bodies can only 
intervene in a few cases, when national remedies have been exhausted or are not available 
or effective, and the record of implementation of their decisions is not strong. Most of the 
work in identifying and remedying violations must be accomplished by domestic 
institutions. It is at the domestic level that laws and policies can be better influenced 
through civil society participation and be more context-specific, and where there is a better 
record of implementation of judicial decisions.  
</p><p>76. While courts in many jurisdictions are amenable to litigation challenging human 
rights violations, access to justice should not generally rely on litigation. States must ensure 
that water and sanitation services are provided within a context of clear rules. They must 
adopt measures to prevent human rights violations, for instance through carrying out human 
rights impact assessments. Where violations are being alleged, dispute and complaint 
mechanisms should be available with the aim of resolving issues quickly and efficiently. 
Where human rights violations are not adequately addressed, individuals must be able to 
proceed to court. Being able to turn to the courts &#8211; as a last resort &#8211; is an essential 
component of ensuring access to justice. Violations of the rights to water and sanitation 
have generally been dealt with more effectively in States where constitutional and 
legislative protections guarantee that those rights are directly or indirectly justiciable. In 
States where this is not yet the case, courts and governments should be guided by 
international developments and recognize the rights to water and sanitation as justiciable. 
Governments should promote the use of international law in interpreting domestic law.

<p>77. Violations of the human rights to water and sanitation are often complex and 
interrelated. For instance, victims of violations of the obligations to respect rights, such as 
those living in informal settlements, are often in precarious situations caused by violations 
of the obligation to fulfil rights. Many violations can be traced to unequal power 
relationships and systemically entrenched patterns of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>78. Given this context, the notion of restorative remedies for violations, whereby the 
status quo ante is restored, may fall short of addressing the underlying violations at the 
structural or systemic level. Consequently, transformative remedies, which aim not only to 
correct direct violations but also the underlying structural conditions, are required in order 
to provide comprehensive remedies to structural and systemic violations. Examples of such 
transformative remedies are participatory structural injunctions that require the State to 
adopt a plan to correct a structural violation with the meaningful participation of 
beneficiaries and report back to the court on progress made. This allows courts to supervise 
progress and make ancillary orders to ensure that both the process and outcomes are 
consistent with the rights to water and sanitation. As such, transformative remedies can 
move claimants further towards the full enjoyment of human rights. 94  Without such 
remedies, there is a risk that access to justice will be limited to those people who are in a 
position to seek remedies for themselves and will preclude claims in the public interest. 
States may need to ensure that their constitutional and legislative frameworks clearly give 
their judicial systems the responsibility to provide systemic remedies and to accept 
complaints in the public interest. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur has observed that it is too often forgotten that the defining 
role and purpose of courts and others involved in adjudicating human rights claims is to 
ensure that rights holders are afforded the full benefit of rights. If few or no claims are 
being heard addressing the most critical, wide-ranging and complex violations of the rights 
to water and sanitation, then this suggests that the justice system must be transformed. 
Many judicial systems give preference to claims based on negative obligations over those 
based on positive obligations, claims to immediately enforceable remedies over longer-term 
transformative ones, and claims affecting individuals or small groups over claims that 
require systemic changes. This preference can no longer be permitted to deny victims of 
human rights violations the remedies to which they are entitled. The consequences of 
denying access to justice for the most egregious violations are too severe to be 
contemplated. Courts, human rights institutions, governments and advocates must redefine 
justice and the role of courts in relation to what human rights require and ensure access to 
effective remedies.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to see advances in identifying, 
preventing and remedying violations of the human rights to water and sanitation. 
Nevertheless, the extent of continuing violations constitutes a major human rights 
crisis. It is imperative for States to implement review and adjudication procedures to 
identify violations, with the full participation of stakeholders, and to prioritize action 
to address violations. The Special Rapporteur has found that, while more attention 
needs to be paid to violations of the rights to water and sanitation in general, progress 
has not been equal across the full range of obligations or for all groups of rights 
holders. Access to justice for violations at a more structural or systemic level,

<p><b>particularly in relation to the obligation to progressively realize the rights to water 
and sanitation, to avoid retrogressive measures and to achieve substantive equality, 
has lagged behind in comparison with access to justice for violations linked to the 
obligations to respect and to protect. Violations related to inequalities experienced by 
certain groups, such as people living in poverty, informal settlements, or rural and 
remote communities, or homeless people, have remained largely unchallenged in 
courts, despite their severity.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Furthermore, violations of the right to sanitation in general have not received 
the attention they deserve. Victims of violations of the right to sanitation are among 
the most stigmatized and marginalized in society, and there remain taboos preventing 
an open discussion about the indignities linked to unhygienic conditions. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages all actors to frame violations related to water and sanitation 
more explicitly as violations of the human rights to water and sanitation, in order to 
draw attention to the particularities of such violations and the deprivation and 
indignity they often cause. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>To emphasize a comprehensive understanding of violations of the human rights 
to water and sanitation resulting from failure to meet any human rights obligation, 
the Special Rapporteur stresses that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Violations may result from action or failure to act; 
(b) Violations may be deliberate and intentional or they may be unintended 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences of policies, programmes and other measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Violations may relate to failures to provide minimum essential levels or 
from failures to progressively realize human rights commensurate with maximum 
available resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Violations may result from retrogressive measures or from failures to 
make reasonable progress; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Violations may result from immediate deprivations or from failures to 
implement comprehensive plans and strategies to ensure full realization of rights in 
the long term; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Violations may be of an individual or of a structural and systemic 
nature; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Violations may result from direct action by the State or from the failure 
to regulate non-State actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Violations of the right to non-discrimination may result from de jure or 
de facto discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Violations of the obligation to achieve substantive equality may result 
from the failure to take positive measures necessary to address pre-existing inequality 
or to provide reasonable accommodation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Violations may result from the failure to meet substantive or procedural 
obligations such as ensuring participation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Violations may occur as a result of State conduct that has effects within a 
State&#8217;s territory, or extraterritorially; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Violations may result from failure to ensure access to remedies. 
</b>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur therefore focuses her recommendations on how to 
more effectively ensure that violations are identified, prevented and remedied, with an </b></p>


<p><b>emphasis on those areas which have been most neglected. She recommends that 
States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Recognize the full range of violations of the rights to water and 
sanitation and ensure access to justice for all such violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that a comprehensive human rights framework is embedded in 
legislation, policy and practice with the aim of both preventing and remedying 
violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that international law and jurisprudence on the rights to water 
and sanitation are used in interpreting and applying domestic legislation, regulations 
and policies;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that the rights to water and sanitation are taken account of in 
administrative decisions interpreting legislation and exercising any discretion 
conferred by relevant legislation;

<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that non-State actors comply with their 
responsibility to respect human rights, that they be held accountable for human rights 
abuses, allow for an independent investigation into allegations, establish complaint 
mechanisms and proactively engage with the State to detect, and find solutions to 
address existing and potential human rights abuses .

<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages civil society organizations to support 
(strategic) litigation, in particular related to systemic and structural violations of the 
rights to water and sanitation linked to the obligations to progressively realize human 
rights, to use maximum available resources, to avoid unjustifiable retrogression, and 
to achieve substantive equality, including through preventing and combating 
stigmatization.

<p><i>[English only] 
</i>Robust indicators are essential tools for revealing possible violations, assessments of available resources, and implementing and 
monitoring targeted, evidence-based and time-bound policies and programmes. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention 
to the table of illustrative structural, process and outcome indicators that were identified in collaboration with the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. She recommends that States develop and use contextually relevant indicators through 
participatory efforts and guided by the table of illustrative indicators. The list is work in progress and feedback is welcomed and 
may be submitted to the Human Rights Indicators Unit (hrindicators@ohchr.org) at the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights.
