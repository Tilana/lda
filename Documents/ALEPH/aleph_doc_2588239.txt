EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1
Introduction
Malmyzh is a district-scale copper-gold porphyry project located in Khabarovsk Krai of the Russian Federation's
Far  East  region.  IG  Copper  LLC  ("IGC"),  a  privately  held  company,  has  a  Joint  Venture  Agreement  (the  "Joint
Venture") with Freeport McMoRan Exploration Corporation (“FMEC”) covering the Malmyzh Project's exploration
and mining licenses. Both companies hold their interest via a Russian subsidiary company in which IGC has a
51%  share  and  FMEC  has  the  remaining  49%  share.  IGC  is  operating  and  managing  the  Project.  Eurasian
Minerals Inc. ("EMX" or "Eurasian"), listed on the TSX Venture exchange as EMX and the NYSE MKT as EMXX, is
IGC’s largest shareholder with 42.2% of the issued and outstanding shares (40.0% on a fully diluted basis).
Wardell Armstrong International (“WAI”), was engaged by EMX and IGC to prepare a first time statement of Mineral
Resources for the Malmyzh Project and a supporting technical report under National Instrument 43-101 Standards
of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 43-101”) and Canadian Institute of
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) definition standards. FMEC did not participate in the completion of the
Malmyzh resource estimate or this report, as FMEC is subject to disclosure requirements that are different than
IGC's and EMX's. WAI is not an insider, associate, or affiliate of IGC, EMX or FMEC, nor has WAI acted as an
advisor to these companies or their subsidiaries or affiliates in connection with this Project.
1.2 Property Description
The Malmyzh Project is approximately 210 km northeast of the regional administrative centre of Khabarovsk, and
220 km from the international border with China. The Project is centred on latitude 49º55’30” North and longitude
136º55’00”  East  within  the  Malmyzh  and  Malmyzh  North  exploration  and  mining  licenses.  The  Malmyzh  and
Malmyzh North licenses cover 152.8 km2.
IGC  has  advised  that  the  Malmyzh  Joint  Venture,  through  its  Russian  subsidiary  Amur  Minerals  LLC,  received
approval of the “official on balance C1+C2 reserves” from the GKZ (State Reserves Committee), the government
agency authorized to approve resources and reserves in the Russian Federation (EMX news release, May 26,
2015).  The  Malmyzh  “official  government  approved  reserves”  were  estimated  according  to  the  rules  and
regulations  of  the  Russian  Federation,  and  are  not  the  same  as  reserves  under  NI  43-101,  but  are  relevant  to
meeting requirements of keeping the licenses in good standing.
IGC has also advised that the Project's "Technical-Economic Justification (TEO) of Temporary Conditions" report
has been accepted, and that the “prospecting phase” of the Malmyzh exploration and mining licenses has been
successfully  completed.  Consequently,  the  Malmyzh  and  Malmyzh  North  licenses  are  in  good  standing  for  this
stage of the Project's development according to the laws of the Russian Federation.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The GKZ C1+C2 "reserves" of copper and gold exceed thresholds that classify Malmyzh as a "strategically
significant" mineral deposit under the Russian Federation's Strategic Industries Law ("SIL"). SIL requires that the
Joint Venture receive approval through the relevant Russian Federation agencies in order to continue with its
exploration and development programmes. IGC advises that the requisite applications are being prepared for
submission.
Contingent  on  receiving  SIL  approval,  the  Project  will  be  required  to  move  forward  according  to  an  "advanced
exploration" work programme designed by the Joint Venture, and approved by the responsible Russian Federation
agencies. The advanced exploration programme has not yet been formulated, but it is generally known that it will
include in-fill drilling and advanced technical studies.
1.3 Project Geology and Mineralisation
The Project's terrain consists of low relief hills of the Amur River valley, with the multiple copper-gold porphyry
centres occurring within a district-scale 16 by 5 km intrusive corridor concealed beneath a shallow cover of soils,
alluvium, and colluvium. The porphyry centres occur as Cretaceous-age dioritic stocks that intruded and hornfels-
altered siltstone and sandstone sedimentary sequences. Concealed mineralisation extends from shallow subcrop
(~1 to 50 m) to greater than 400 to 600 m depth. The porphyry mineralisation consists of thin, near-surface zones of
variable  chalcocite  enrichment  grading  into  chalcopyrite-rich  and  chalcopyrite-bornite-magnetite  mineralisation.
Copper-gold mineralisation occurs in the porphyry intrusives, as well as in the hornfels-altered and stockworked
sedimentary wall rocks.
1.4 Exploration, Drilling and Sampling
Exploration completed to date for Malmyzh includes geological mapping, geochemical surveys, ground magnetics
surveys,  and  drilling.  Early  work  by  Phelps  Dodge  Exploration  Corp.,  and  subsequently  FMEC,  resulted  in  the
identification of concealed exploration targets for initial reconnaissance drilling. FMEC drilled 8 core holes totalling
1,126  m  in  2008  that  resulted  in  the  discovery  of  the  Central  and  Flats  deposits,  as  well  as  the  North  and
Stockwork prospects.
Additional geochemical and geophysical surveys were conducted by a joint venture between FMEC and operator
Fortress  Minerals  Inc.  from  late  2009-2010,  and  subsequently  by  the  Joint  Venture  between  operator  IGC  and
FMEC  from  2011-present.  In  total,  approximately  5,300  soil  samples  collected  along  500  line-km,  650  grab
samples of rock float, and various campaigns of backhoe soil pits, auger drilling, and limited deep soil sampling
have  been  conducted  at  Malmyzh.  This  work  further  delineated  targets  initially  recognised  by  FMEC,  and  also
identified new copper-gold porphyry targets for follow-up. At present there are 14 centres of copper-gold porphyry
mineralisation recognised on the property.
As follow-up to FMEC's initial drilling, reconnaissance and deposit delineation drill programmes were conducted
from  2010-2014  (Fortress  in  2010,  IGC  from  2011-2014),  resulting  in  a  combined  Project  total  of  211  diamond
holes and over 70,600 m of HQ and NQ core. This work concentrated both on grid drilling four principal deposits
(i.e., Valley, Freedom Southeast, Central, and Flats) at nominal 200 by 200 m spacing, and reconnaissance drilling
the additional porphyry copper-gold prospects and targets. Over half of the holes were drilled vertically, and the
majority  of  the  angle  holes  were  drilled  at  an  inclination  of  -60˜  along  the  azimuths  of  drill  fences  oriented  at
N40oW. The total down-hole depth drilled averages ~330 m, with the deepest hole reaching 680.8 m at the Central
deposit. Core recoveries average ~97% in bedrock.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The Project's exploration sampling, sample preparation, analyses, and security have adhered to both industry best
practice and Russian Federation standards, and produced reliable and representative results as demonstrated by
the Joint Venture's extensive QA/QC programme, and verified by the author's independent property visit, core
sampling, and data reviews. The Malmyzh drill database and supporting exploration information is judged to be
suitable for mineral resource estimation.
1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate and Classification
The Malmyzh mineral resource estimation process was a collaborative effort between WAI and IGC geologists.
IGC provided WAI with Project exploration databases that included topography, drilling, density measurements,
and geological interpretations. In addition, IGC provided preliminary block models that were reviewed by WAI, and
adjusted and refined to produce the final mineral resource block models. The block model estimates, selection of
metal prices, costs, and metallurgical recoveries, copper equivalent and cut-off calculations, optimised open pit
generation, and mineral resource classification, verification and reporting were completed under the supervision of
WAI's Managing Director, Dr Phil Newall. The software used included LeapFrog, Vulcan, Snowden Supervisor,
Datamine,  and  NPV  Scheduler.  The  resulting  mineral  resource  estimates  meet  the  National  Instrument  43-101
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 43-101”) and Canadian
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) definition standards.
Mineral  resources  were  estimated  for  the  Valley,  Freedom  Southeast,  Central,  and  Flats  deposits.  These  four
deposits  were  systematically  drilled  on  200  by  200  m  grids,  with  cross  sectional  fences  oriented  N40˜W.
Geological  interpretations  by  deposit  were  provided  for  each  drill  fence,  and  used  to  construct  3D  models  of
overburden, diorite porphyry, and hornfels units. In addition, surfaces representing oxide, transition, and sulphide
mineralisation were modelled. Interpretations of lithology, structure, and alteration on section were reviewed with
distributions  of  copper-gold  mineralisation  and  down-hole  multi-element  geochemistry  to  define  domains  of
porphyry alteration and mineralisation to constrain grade estimation. Generally these domains correspond to 0.1%
copper  grade  shells  that  are  inclusive  of  gold  mineralisation  greater  than  0.05  g/t,  and  reflect  the  lithological
contacts, alteration boundaries, and structural truncations based on the geological interpretations.
The Malmyzh resource estimation parameters are summarised below:

•
Assay and geological data available on or before May 1, 2015.
Block models were constructed with parent block dimensions of 25 x 25 x 10 m, with sub- blocking to a

Samples  were  composited  to  10  m  lengths,  typically resulting  in  an  average  of  five  samples  per
composite.
High-grade  capping,  determined  separately  for  each deposit,  was  applied  for  copper  and  gold.  The
spatial occurrence of the capped values was visually verified to establish that they do not form zones
that could be modelled separately.  An  exception  was  for  the  Central deposit,  where  a  single  higher
grade zone at depth was modelled separately.
Specific  gravity  was  determined  from  drill  core  samples for  the  four  deposits,  with  average  density
values of 2.65-2.72 t/m3 in diorite porphyry and 2.64-2.66 t/m3 in hornfels.
Inverse distance weighting to the third power ("IDW") was used for the grade estimation of copper and
gold.
Search ellipsoids were determined from interpreted geological controls and correlograms/variography.
A minimum of 3 and maximum of 12 sample composites were used to estimate blocks. A maximum of 5
composites was allowed from a given drill hole.
Estimates  were  constrained  by  the geological/mineralisation  model,  as  well  as  the  oxide  and
sulphide/transition models.
Visual comparison between composite and block grades, swath plots and other techniques were used
for verification of the IDW estimates.
The Malmyzh mineral resources are classified as Inferred by WAI, and include blocks with copper and gold that
have  lateral  and  down-dip  continuity  as  defined  from  the  geological  interpretations.  Inferred  Resources  of
sulphide/transition material are reported within optimised open pit shells with 45˜ slope angles. WAI's criteria for
reporting the open pit constrained Inferred resources are based on:
•
•
•
•
•
A copper price of US$ 3.25/lb and a gold price of US$1,400/oz.
Metallurgical recovery assumptions of 90% for copper and 70% for gold.
Costs of US$2/t mining, US$7/t processing, and US$2/t G&A.
Copper equivalent (CuEq) calculated from the assumed metal prices and recoveries as CuEq% = Cu%
+ (Au g/t x 0.5).
A  cut-off  grade  of  0.30%  CuEq  based  upon  metal  prices, recoveries,  costs,  and  comparison  with
examples of analogous deposits that occur worldwide.
Metal prices used by WAI were based on long term consensus forecasts and include some upside to reflect their
reasonable  prospects  for  eventual  extraction,  which  is  a  typical  industry  approach  for  Mineral  Resources.  The
optimised open pit parameters were based upon metal prices, costs, and metallurgical recoveries from potentially
similar operations, as well as independent technical assessments conducted within the Russian Federation.
1.6 Mineral Resource Statement
WAI's statement of Inferred resources for the Valley, Freedom Southeast, Central, and Flats deposits at a 0.30%
copper  equivalent  cut-off  is  1,661  Mt  at  average  grades  of  0.34%  copper  and  0.17  g/t  gold,  or  0.42%  copper-
equivalent, containing 5.65 Mt (12.45 billion pounds) copper and 9.11 Moz gold, or 7.06 Mt (15.56 billion pounds)
copper-equivalent.  The  open  pit  constrained  Inferred  resources  are  summarised  in  the  table  below  (mineral
resources are given on a 100% basis, with 51% attributable to IGC).

The cut-off grade of 0.30% CuEq is suitable for reporting mineral resources for what would be developed as an
open pit project. The resulting mineral resource estimate, while based on broadly spaced drill holes, is considered
by WAI to be robust, though subject to revision in the future. In-fill drilling may lead to the delineation of discrete
higher grade zones of copper-gold mineralisation, and will provide additional confidence for resource estimation.
1.7 Additional Targets and Prospects
Freedom,  comprised  of  two  distinct  northeast  trending  bodies  of  copper-gold  mineralisation,  has  an  Inferred
resource for the Southeast deposit, but also has drilled mineralisation on 400 m panels for the Northwest prospect.
Although the Freedom Northwest ("NW") prospect is not included as an Inferred resource, it has sufficient geologic
(cross sections) and drill control (six holes) to be defined as a "target for further exploration" according to NI 43-101
(2.3(2),(a -b))1.

1The potential quantity and grade for the Freedom Northwest prospect is conceptual in nature, as there has been
insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being
delineated as a mineral resource.
The extent of porphyry copper-gold mineralisation within the Malmyzh district has not been fully determined. There
is exploration upside given by the ten additional prospects with reconnaissance drilling that intersected porphyry
alteration and mineralisation. Further, there is exploration potential for additional "blind" discoveries in undrilled
areas of the property, particularly towards the southeast where there is more than 15-20 m of cover.
1.8
Interpretation and Conclusions
The  Malmyzh  Inferred  resources  represent  the  copper-gold  mineralisation  as  currently  defined  at  the  Valley,
Freedom Southeast, Central and Flats deposits. The tonnes and grades at various cut-offs illustrate that there is
higher  grade  copper-gold  material  available  at:  a)  Valley  in  the  shallow,  potassically  altered  hornfels  on  the
southeastern flank of the deposit, b) Freedom Southeast as postulated cross-cutting features of intense chloritic
alteration within a broader zone of potassic alteration, and c) Central within a steeply plunging core of potassic
alteration. In-fill drilling is required to gain additional confidence in the geometries and tenors of these higher grade
zones.
The block model validations establish that the mineral resource estimates are globally unbiased. However, there
are  local  mineralising  controls  that  cannot  be  adequately  defined  at  the  current  200  m  resource  deposit  drill
spacing. Further, the preliminary metallurgical testwork conducted to date has yet to define optimised copper and
gold  recoveries.  These  uncertainties  led  to  the  classification  of  the  resources  as  Inferred,  and  can  only  be
addressed by further drilling and additional metallurgical testwork in order to potentially advance them to a higher
level of classification.
Although  Malmyzh  is  at  a  relatively  early-stage  of  project  evaluation,  WAI  notes  that  the  infrastructure  and
physiographic  setting  for  a  potential  open  pit  mining  operation  are  favourable.  There  are  multiple  options  for
transportation, power, water sources, and nearby population centres with potential workforces. The property size
and gentle topographic expression provide a suitable layout scenario for potential tailings storage, waste dumps,
processing plant sites, and other operational infrastructure.
The most significant risk to Malmyzh is achieving Russian Federation SIL approval in order for the Joint Venture to
continue  advancing  the  Project.  The  results  and  timing  of  this  process  cannot  be  assured  or  predicted.
Notwithstanding,  there  are  examples  of  successful  outcomes  for  western  exploration  and  mining  companies,
including  recent  approval  for  the  Kun  Manie  deposit  and  the  ongoing  operations  at  Kupol.  WAI  also  notes  the
positive  developments  related  to  investment  incentives  implemented  by  the  Russian  Federation  in  2014  for
developing projects in the Far East, including Khabarovsk Krai.

THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The Malmyzh exploration programmes have established a substantial porphyry copper-gold Inferred resource with
potential for expansion in the 4 deposits that have been drill defined to date. Importantly, the a) potential for zones
of higher grade copper-gold mineralisation, b) multiple concealed targets with limited or no drilling, and c) geologic
setting with broad distributions of porphyry mineralisation and alteration highlight the Project's many exploration
opportunities.  These  opportunities,  coupled  with  a  favourable  infrastructure  setting,  underscore  Malmyzh's
potential for further advancement assuming the necessary government approvals are received.
1.9 Recommendations
Pending  completion  of  the  SIL  approval  process,  the  technical  advancement  of  the  Malmyzh  Project  should
proceed at a modest pace. IGC advises that the necessary applications are being prepared for submission.
Assuming  SIL  approval  is  received,  the  Project  must  then  move  forward  according  to  Russian  Federation
requirements for "advanced exploration" of the Project. WAI cannot comment on the duration of these regulatory
processes, nor on their ultimate outcomes. As a result, the immediate required priorities are:
•
•
Finalise and submit the documents for SIL approval.
Subject to approval of SIL, prepare and submit an advanced exploration work programme for approval.
The  advanced  exploration  programme  will  include  in-fill  drilling  and  further  metallurgical,  engineering,
hydrogeological, environmental, socio-economic, and other work. WAI has not reviewed budgets for this work, as
the final requirements have not yet been set.
As this programme is developed for Malmyzh, there are initial recommendations to be considered (in US $):
a)
b)
c)
Review  the  drill  core  for  holes  in  areas  of  higher-grade mineralisation  and  other  priority  targets
($125,000-$150,000).
Review  and  assess  the  potential  for  higher  grade,  shallow mineralisation  at  Valley,  Freedom,  and
optionally Central ($30,000-$40,000).
Review all exploration data to refine interpretations for exploration targeting ($20,000- $30,000).
The above work can be accomplished from the field exploration completed to date, and totals $175,000-$220,000.
It is recommended that this modest programme proceed as a first phase while awaiting Project approvals, so as to
be prepared for the next phase of drilling and assessment.

Contingent  on  receiving  the  necessary  Project  approvals,  the  second  phase  of  recommended  work  includes
metallurgy,  a  focused  in-fill  drilling  programme  at  the  Valley  and  Freedom  Southeast  deposits  to  define  higher
grade copper-gold zones, and drilling at Freedom Northwest designed to potentially bring it to resource status:
1.
2.
3.
Metallurgical testwork to optimise copper and gold recoveries ($250,000-$350,000).
Valley and Freedom Southeast in-fill drilling: 46 holes @ 23,000 m ($2,300,000-$2,875,000).
Freedom  Northwest  grid  drilling  and  other  exploration drilling:  18  holes  @  9000  m  ($900,000-
$1,125,000).
The post-approval work totals $3.45 -4.35 million and could be completed in a 12 month period. The author notes
that the projected drilling costs are relatively low. However, the Joint Venture owns the drill rigs and IGC advises
that these are appropriate costs to use.
If designed and executed properly, the recommended work programmes will a) initially provide the background for
making  informed  exploration  decisions,  and  assuming  SIL  approval,  b)  commence  the  work  to  meet  Russian
Federation license requirements while providing the basis to advance the Malmyzh Project with a PEA study.

INTRODUCTION
2.1 Background
Background
IG  Copper  LLC  ("IGC"),  a  privately  held  company,  has  a  Joint  Venture  Agreement  with  Freeport-McMoRan
Exploration  Corporation  ("Freeport"  or  “FMEC”)  covering  the  Malmyzh  exploration  and  mining  licenses  in
Khabarovsk Krai of the Russian Federation, which is the Project area covered in this Technical Report. Both IGC
and  FMEC  hold  their  respective  interests  in  the  Project  via  Amur  Minerals  LLC  (“Amur”),  a  Russian  subsidiary
company in which IGC has a 51% share and FMEC has the remaining 49% share. IGC is operating and managing
the Malmyzh Project.
Eurasian Minerals Inc. ("EMX" or "Eurasian"), listed on the TSX Venture Exchange as EMX and the NYSE MKT as
EMXX, is IGC’s largest shareholder with 42.2% of the issued and outstanding shares (40.0% on a fully diluted
basis). As of the effective date of this report, EMX had invested approximately US $7.8 million in IGC, principally to
support the exploration programmes at Malmyzh. EMX's investment in IGC and the Malmyzh Project is material to
Eurasian.
Malmyzh is a porphyry copper-gold exploration Project, located in the Russian Far East, and is approximately 210
km northeast of Khabarovsk, the administrative centre and largest city of Khabarovsk Krai (Figure 2.1). The Project
is centred at latitude 49º55’30” North and longitude 136º55’00” East. The property consists of the Malmyzh and
Malmyzh North exploration and mining licenses that in aggregate cover 152.8 km2.

2.7 Limitations, Reliance, and WAI Declaration
WAI’s opinion contained herein is based on information collected throughout the course of WAI’s work, which in
turn reflects various technical and economic conditions as of the effective date. Given the nature of the mining
business,  these  conditions  can  change  significantly  over  relatively  short  periods  of  time.  Consequently,  actual
results may be significantly more or less favourable than assumed according to changes in metal prices or other
variables.
This report may include technical information that requires subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, totals and
weighted  averages.  Such  calculations  inherently  involve  a  degree  of  rounding,  and  consequently  introduce  a
margin of error. Where these occur, WAI does not consider them to be material.
WAI is not an insider, associate, or affiliate of IGC or EMX, nor has WAI acted as an advisor to these companies or
their subsidiaries or affiliates in connection with this Project. The results of the technical review by WAI are not
dependent  on  any  prior  agreements  concerning  the  conclusions  to  be  reached,  nor  are  there  any  undisclosed
understandings concerning any future business dealings.
Except as specifically required by law, WAI does not assume any responsibility and will not accept any liability to
any other person for any loss suffered by any such other person as a result of, arising out of, or in connection with
this  Technical  Report  or  statements  contained  herein,  except  required  by  and  given  solely  for  the  purpose  of
complying  with  the  mandate  as  outlined  in  this  Technical  Report  and  compliance  with  NI  43-101.  WAI  has  no
reason to believe that any relevant additional information or material facts have been withheld by IGC or EMX.

WAI  was  wholly  reliant  upon  the  information  and  data  provided  by  IGC  and  EMX.  WAI  has,  however,  where
possible,  independently  verified  the  data  and  information  provided,  and  completed  site  visits  and  independent
sampling to verify the existence and nature of the copper-gold mineralised systems at Malmyzh.
The opinions expressed in this report are based on information supplied by IGC and EMX. WAI has exercised due
care in reviewing, compiling, and reporting the supplied information, including a detailed review of the technical
data for the Malmyzh Project. The accuracy of the results, and conclusions from this review, rely on the accuracy of
the supplied data. WAI has relied on this information and has no reason to believe that any material facts have
been withheld, or that a more detailed analysis may reveal additional material information. Technical reports, maps
and data produced by IGC are of a reliable and relevant nature, and are supported by WAI’s property and data
reviews. However, WAI does not accept responsibility for any errors or omissions in the supplied information, and
does not accept any consequential liability arising from commercial decisions or actions resulting from them.
The title to, and status of, the Malmyzh Project as described in Section 4.0 of this report was researched and an
opinion provided that was current as of May 1, 2015 by IGC’s legal counsel in Russia, Olga Agabakyan. From this
review, the licenses that constitute the Malmyzh Project are in good standing as required by Russian Federation
mining law.

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
4.1
Introduction
The description of the Malmyzh Project is based upon information provided in reports from IGC, including the TEO
report of temporary conditions prepared by OREOLL LLC (2014), as well as personal communications with IGC's
Thomas  E.  Bowens,  CPG  (President  and  CEO)  and  Evgeney  Ignatiev  (Deputy  General  Director,  Geologic
Compliance and Permitting).
4.2 Legal Description and Location
The Malmyzh Project is covered by two exploration and mining licenses issued to Amur Minerals LLC (IGC 51%,
Freeport 49%; see Section 4.4) for the right to use the subsoil according to Russian Federation law:
1)
2)
HAB  02018,  (bedrock  prospecting,  exploration  and  mining at  the  Malmyzh  "ore  field"),  issued  on
September 18, 2006 and valid until December 31, 2026 ( extendable), and
HAB 02334 (bedrock prospecting, exploration and mining at the Northern Malmyzh "ore field"), issued
on July 23, 2010, and valid until July 31, 2030 (extendable).
These "Subsoil Use" licenses total 152.8 km2, with HAB 02018 accounting for 79 km2 and HAB 02334 covering
73.8  km2  (Figure  4.1  and  Table  4.1).  IGC  advises  that  the  initial  20  year  period  for  the  license  terms  can  be
extended until the end of mining in accordance with Russian law. IGC also advises that the two Malmyzh licenses
are currently valid and in good standing according to the rules, regulations, and laws of the Russian Federation.
4.3 Overview of Mining Law Requirements and Malmyzh License Status
In the Russian Federation the government retains permanent mineral rights, whereas license holders and their
business partners hold contractual rights for exploration and exploitation. Mineral exploration and development is
controlled by legislation related to activities associated with the exploration for, and mining of, minerals including:
•
•
•
Federal Law “On Subsoil” dated February 21, 1992,
Federal Law “On Precious Metals and Precious Stones” dated March 26, 1998 and
Federal  Law  “On  the  Procedure  for  Making  Foreign Investments  in  Business  Entities  of  Strategic
Importance for the National Defence and Security of the Russian Federation” dated May 7, 2008.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
In summary, the above legislation stipulates:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Mineral resources are owned by the State,
The State grants a right to exploit resources in the form of a license,
The license document proscribes the scope and period of exploitation,
The license establishes the right to carry out mineral exploration, mine development, and mining waste
management,
All mineral resources are subject to mandatory State technical audit,
The technical audit is carried out by the State GKZ Reserves Committee of Experts,
Mineral extraction is authorised only after GKZ verification of "reserve" estimates,
This verification is the basis for inclusion of the "reserves" on the State minerals "balance".
The Malmyzh licenses are governed by the above laws and regulations. IGC has advised that the Malmyzh Joint
Venture (51% IGC, 49% Freeport), through Russian subsidiary Amur Minerals LLC, has received approval of the
“official on balance C1+C2 reserves” from the GKZ. The Malmyzh government approved "reserves" were estimated
according to the rules and regulations of the Russian Federation, and are not the same as reserves under NI 43-
101,  but  are  relevant  to  meeting  requirements  for  keeping  the  licenses  in  good  standing.  The  GKZ  “official
reserves”  have  now  been  listed  and  added  to  the  “State  Balance  of  Reserves”.  IGC  has  also  advised  that  the
Project's "Technical-Economic Justification (TEO) of Temporary Conditions" report has been accepted, and that
the “prospecting phase” of the Malmyzh exploration and mining licenses has now been successfully completed.
The GKZ and TEO approvals completed the requirements to keep the Malmyzh and Malmyzh North licenses in
good standing for this phase of the Project's development.
The  next  requirement  for  Malmyzh's  advancement  relates  to  the  2008  Strategic  Investment  Law  (“SIL”),  which
regulates  foreign  investment  in  industrial  sectors  that  are  considered  of  strategic  importance  to  the  Russian
Federation. The relevant SIL stipulation is that mineral deposits exceeding certain thresholds for contained copper
or  contained  gold  are  considered  to  be  "strategically  significant".  Based  on  the  applicable  Russian  "reserve"
calculation methodologies, the Project surpasses these thresholds according to the approved "GKZ C1+C2 official
on balance reserves”.
As a result, the Malmyzh Joint Venture must complete an application process, through the Federal Anti-Monopoly
Service  (FAS)  and  the  Prime  Minister-chaired  Commission  for  Control  over  Foreign  Investments,  to  obtain
approval for on-going control of the Project. IGC has been advised by the Federal Agency for the Subsoil Use
(Rosnedra) that, as an approximation, the process could take approximately up to a year given the specifics of the
Malmyzh Project; there is no certainty to this general timeframe.
Contingent on SIL approval, the Joint Venture will proceed to the next level of Project advancement. This next
phase will include additional technical work (i.e., drilling, exploration, metallurgy, engineering, etc.) and economic
assessment culminating in a more detailed report termed the "TEO of Permanent Conditions". This report fulfils the
criteria  for  a  "fully  explored"  mineral  deposit,  and  in  the  Russian  system  is  considered  to  be  a  precursor  to
commencement of exploitation and mining.

In  the  case  of  withdrawal  of  a  license  under  SIL,  the  Government  of  the  Russian  Federation  is  required  to
reimburse the expenses incurred in respect of the geological study of the subsoil plot and any tender fees paid by
the license holder. In addition, the license holder may also be paid a finder’s fee by the Government of the Russian
Federation at its discretion.
As of the effective date of this report, the Joint Venture was preparing to file documents for SIL approval, and was in
the process of designing work programmes to continue to the Project's “advanced exploration” stage. Advanced
exploration  for  the  Malmyzh  licenses  is  scheduled  to  commence  by  June  1,  2016,  although  this  date  may  be
extendable.
4.4
Joint Venture Agreement and Eurasian Minerals Interest
The Malmyzh and Malmyzh North licenses are held in the name of Amur Minerals LLC, a wholly owned Russian
subsidiary of offshore registered Khabarovsk Minerals LLC (the "Malmyzh Joint Venture"), which is jointly owned
by IG Copper LLC (51%, through a wholly owned subsidiary) and by Freeport-McMoRan Exploration Corporation
(49%,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Freeport  McMoRan  Inc.).  The  Malmyzh  Joint  Venture  is  operated  and
managed by IGC. FMEC retains no claw-back or NSR provisions.
IGC and FMEC fund at their respective level of ownership interest, or dilute. Should either company dilute to less
than a 10% interest in the Company, remaining ownership is converted to a US $0.005 (one-half cent) per pound
copper equivalent reserve payment, which remains in effect through the life of mine.
The majority shareholder in IGC is Eurasian Minerals Inc. (TSX Venture: EMX; NYSE MKT: EMXX), with 42.2% of
the issued and outstanding shares (40% on a fully diluted basis), resulting from private placement investments
totalling approximately US $7.8 million.
4.5 License Fees and Royalties
As the "prospecting phase" for the Malmyzh licenses has been completed, payments to the Russian Federation for
the right to use the subsoil will commence on August 1, 2015 at rates enumerated in Table 4.2.

In accordance with Russian Federation mining law, once in production the Malmyzh licenses will be subject to a
federal royalty, known as a Mineral Resources Extraction Tax ("MRET"). The MRET schedule for Khabarovsk Krai,
and other administrative districts of the Russian Far East and Siberia, was reduced by a law that was put into effect
on January 1, 2014 as an incentive to foster investment and development in the region.
The MRET schedule for Malmyzh is outlined below in Table 4.3.

In addition to the MRET incentives, the new tax laws established lower rates for corporate income taxes ("CIT") for
qualifying investment projects.
4.6 Surface, Access, and Community Agreements
Surface  agreements  have  been  established  providing  the  Joint  Venture  with  access  for  exploration.  The  Joint
Venture must pay Russian Federation "rental" fees for forested areas on the property that are cut for building drill
pads,  roads,  and  project  infrastructure.  The  average  payment  is  ~9,000  rubles  per  one  hectare.  On  an  annual
basis,  the  company  rents  from  15  to  30  hectares,  yielding  forest  rental  payments  of  approximately  130,000  to
300,000 rubles per year, or at the exchange rate as of May 1, 2015 (51.89 RUR / 1 USD) approximately US $2500
to $5,800 per year.
The Joint Venture has also concluded an agreement with the local aboriginal Nanaisky district for providing social
"assistance" in the amount of 0.5% (½ of one percent) of the annual field related exploration budget.
4.7 Other Agreements or Encumbrances
There  are  no  agreements  with  parties  other  than  FMEC,  and  no  back-in  rights  or  other  encumbrances  on  the
Malmyzh Project.
4.8 Environmental Liabilities
The Malmyzh Project has no known environmental liabilities.

4.9 Other Factors or Risks
There are no protected territories, nature reserves, or wildlife preserves within, or nearby to Malmyzh. The faunal
diversity of the property is "low" due to strong anthropogenic impact. There are no known archaeological sites or
historical memorials which require preservation.
Locally,  there  are  areas  adjacent  to  streams  (within  a  +-50  m  buffer)  where  drill  pads  cannot  be  built  without
permission. As well, there is a "water protective" zone associated with the Amur River in the far west of the Project
area  that  is  set  aside  from  development;  this  zone  is  outside  of,  and  away  from  the  main  areas  of  exploration
(Figure 4.2).
There are no additional factors or risks that affect the exploration programmes at the Malmyzh Project as given from
the information provided by IGC.

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
5.1
Introduction
The accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure, and physiography of the Malmyzh Project is based upon
information provided in reports from IGC and OREOLL (2014).
5.2 Accessibility
The Malmyzh Project is located in the Nanaisky district of Khabarovsk Krai (Figure 5.1), approximately 210 km
northeast of the regional administrative centre of Khabarovsk (population 600,000), and the nearby international
border with China (220 km), and 70 km south from the industrial centre of Komsomolsk (population 250,000). There
are  regularly  scheduled  international  flights  into  Khabarovsk,  principally  from  Beijing,  Seoul,  Tokyo,  and
connecting  via  Moscow  and  other  transportation  hubs  within  the  Russian  Federation.  Komsomolsk  also  has  a
medium sized airport that services regional flights.

The  Project  has  a  paved,  two  lane  "Khabarovsk-Komsomolsk-on-Amur"  federal  highway  (Photo  5.1)  that  runs
adjacent to the eastern boundary of the property. This well maintained highway connects Malmyzh to Khabarovsk
(by road: 275 km, ~4 hours) and the important rail yard (Photo 5.2) at Komsomolsk (125 km, ~2.5 hours), and at
marker 210 (km) there is an east bound paved road of regional significance to the port city of Vanino (~450 km)
situated on the Sea of Japan coast. As well, the Project has a well maintained internal network of gravel and dirt
roads that allow ready access to the prospects and targets on the property.
5.3 Climate
The region has a dry-winter, humid-summer continental climate due to the effects of the Siberian High and East
Asian  Monsoons,  respectively  (Table  5.1).  The  average  annual  precipitation  is  540  mm,  with  extreme  years
ranging from 268 to 798 mm. Summers generally extend from late May to early September, and are warm and
humid, with monsoonal rains in late summer driven by cyclones formed in the Yellow and East-China seas.

5.4 Local Resources
The Malmyzh region is sparsely populated, and the principal economic activity in the region is logging. Currently,
logging activities are limited and occur on a rotational basis.
The  small  villages  of  Malmyzh  and  Verhniy  Nergen  occur  ~  5-6  km  west  of  the  Malmyzh  license  boundary.
Troitskoye village is the administrative centre of the Nanai district, and is located 50 km south of the Project. The
nearest airport is in Komsomolsk, which is a hub of industrial activity on the Amur River. The local work force is
adequate  to  support  the  Project’s  exploration  activities,  and  a  labour  force  from  the  surrounding  region  could
support a mining operation.
The  Project  has  a  well  maintained  and  self-sufficient  exploration  camp.  The  camp  has  logging  and  sample
preparation  facilities  (Photo  5.3),  core  storage,  supply  and  fuel  storage,  offices  (cargo  containers),  temporary
housing (gers - Photo 5.4), and a camp kitchen. The camp is well maintained, operational year-round, and secured
by Project staff 24 hours/day, 365 days/year.
5.5
Infrastructure
The license area is located adjacent to the Amur River, the major shipping river in the Russian Far East. Product
from potential mining operations could utilise barging northward to Nikolaevsk port (~680 km) at the mouth of the
Amur River on the Sea of Japan. Alternatively, shipping could be directed southward to the border with China. Of
note, the Amur River freezes over during the winter months, and may not be navigable from early November to mid-
May.
Railroad  access  on  the  BAM  (Baikal-Amur-Mainline)  is  available  at  Selikhino,  located  ~65  km  northeast  of  the
Malmyzh  licenses.  The  BAM  railway  parallels  the  Trans-Siberian  railway  to  the  Sea  of  Japan.  The  railroad
connects about 390 km down the line from Selikhino to Vanino, with the main cargo being lumber transported from
regional logging operations. Access to smelting operations and world markets for a mining operation at Malmyzh
would readily be provided at Vanino, which is an all-year, deep-water port (Photo 5.5).

Parallel to the paved highway is the Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok natural gas pipeline, as well as LEP-110
kW electrical power line (Photo 5.6), which branches from the LEP-500 kW power line at the Selikhino transformer
substation.  The  LEP  power  line  is  continuing  to  be  developed,  and  could  be  upgraded  and  utilized  to  provide
power for a mining operation at Malmyzh.
5.6 Physiography
The Project physiography consists of low lying hills on the east bank of the Amur River valley (Figure 5.2). The
Malmyzh topographic highs form a distinct northeast trending ridge 25 km long, with a series of southeast trending
ridges and valleys. The highest elevation is ~360 m, but more commonly the elevations do not exceed 200 to 250
m elevation. Relief of the topographic highs above the valleys are on the order of 100 to 250 m (Photo 5.7). There
are no outcrops except along the Amur River bank.
The hydrographic network of Malmyzh is distinctly asymmetrical relative to the trend of the ridge, and is most well
developed on the southern and southeastern slopes. The streams, creeks and drainages of the region ultimately
flow  into  the  Amur  River  valley  (Photo  5.8).  The  water  supply  in  the  area  is  sufficient  to  support  future  mining
operations.
Forests  cover  approximately  95%  of  the  Malmyzh  property,  and  primarily  occur  as  mixed,  secondary  growth  in
various  stages  of  reforestation  due  to  an  ongoing  history  of  fires  and  logging.  The  upper  stage  vegetation  is
represented  by  oak,  maple,  yellow  birch,  ash,  aspen,  cedar  and  spruce-fir  trees,  with  woodreed  and  sedge
undergrowth and grass cover.

5.7 Comments on Accessibility, Climate and Infrastructure
The  Malmyzh  Project  has  excellent  logistics  and  infrastructure,  with  readily  available  sources  of  power,  water,
mining personnel, and multiple alternatives for transport and access including the Amur River, a paved federal
highway, and a nearby rail line. The Project has ample area with favorable physiographic characteristics within its
two exploration and mining licenses for potential processing plant sites, tailings storage, heap leach pads, waste
disposal, and mining operation infrastructure. The climate of the region would allow year-round mining operations.

HISTORY
6.1
Introduction
This  section  on  Malmyzh  historical  exploration  substantially  relies  on  the  summaries  by  OREOLL  (2014)  and
Ashleman (2010). Exploration work in the region dates back to 1894, with various government surveys conducted
from the 1950s to early 1990s. The discovery of the Malmyzh porphyry copper-gold district resulted from initial
exploration work conducted by Phelps Dodge/FMEC during 2006-2008, and follow-up work by Fortress Minerals
Corp.  in  2010.  There  has  not  been  any  significant  historical  resource  or  reserve  estimates,  nor  any  significant
production from the Malmyzh property.
6.2 Early Prospecting and Government Surveys
The initial reference to geological prospecting in the Malmyzh region dates back to 1894 regarding small scale
gold  placer  operations.  Subsequently,  limited  placer  mining  was  conducted  on  an  infrequent  basis,  with  no
documentation available for the time period of 1931-1950.
Starting  in  the  1950s,  the  government  commenced  regional  scale  geophysical  and  geological  surveys  in  the
region. This work identified a "large" magnetic anomaly at Malmyzh, and two pan concentrate gold anomalies near
Malmyzh  village.  Regional  scale  geologic  mapping  at  1:500,000  scale  outlined  Cretaceous  sedimentary  rock
sequences intruded by Late Cretaceous intrusives of intermediate composition, and stockworking was noted in the
area from float samples.
In  1960,  placer  gold  prospecting  re-commenced,  and  zones  of  silicified  and  sulphidised  rocks  containing  gold
mineralisation were identified at Malmyzh. In addition, anomalous copper in surficial Quaternary sediments was
identified. Further exploration in 1960-1961 included pitting and shallow churn drilling, and it was concluded that
the area had a negative potential for identifying placers of economic interest.
In  1970,  the  government's  Far  Eastern  Geological  Enterprise  conducted  follow-up  prospecting  at  Malmyzh  to
identify the bedrock sources of gold. Five zones of veinlet silicification with low level gold-copper and lead-zinc
mineralisation were identified. Further prospecting work was recommended.
From 1975 through 1979, the area was covered by a combined geological-hydrogeological survey at a1:200,000
scale. This work served as the basis for compiling USSR State Geological Map sheets М-53-XXIII and М-XXIV
that were published in 1989. A single gold occurrence was identified in the region of Bikha Mountain. Also during
this  time  period,  bedrock  gold  prospecting  was  conducted  with  trenching,  geophysical  surveying,  channel
sampling, grab sampling, pan concentrate sampling, and soil and stream sediment sampling. As a result of this
work, modest gold mineralisation (to 5 g/t Au) was identified in linear bodies of secondary "quartzite" and quartz
veinlet-stockwork zones. Despite the fact that the Malmyzh prospect received a negative assessment in terms of
bedrock  gold,  an  assumption  was  made  about  the  possibility  of  identifying  zones  of  secondary  sulphide
enrichment at depth, associated with stockwork (porphyry) gold-copper mineralisation.

A  1991  review  of  geochemical  anomalies  in  the  southern  part  of  Khabarovsk  Krai  by  V.  Lovyagin  identified
Malmyzh  as  a  target  with  high  potential  for  copper-molybdenum  (gold)  porphyry  mineralisation.  Lovyagin’s
recommendation  was  supported  by  later  regional  metallogenic  studies  in  1999  and  2000.  However,  follow-up
government surveys were not undertaken.
6.3 Phelps Dodge/FMEC and Fortress Minerals
In 2006, Phelps Dodge Corporation, through its Russian subsidiary Amur Minerals LLC, acquired a 79 km2 mining
and exploration license (HAB 02018) at Malmyzh after concluding the region was prospective for porphyry copper
(gold) exploration. At the time, no mineral deposits were recognised in the area.
Phelps  Dodge  was  acquired  by  Freeport-McMoRan  Inc.  (NYSE:  FCX)  in  2007.  From  2006-2008,  Phelps
Dodge/Freeport  McMoRan  Exploration  Corp.  (“FMEC”)  conducted  preliminary  exploration  assessments  that
included geochemical sampling, a ground magnetic survey, and eight diamond drill holes totalling 1,126 m. This
early  work  established  that  the  coincidence  of  magnetic  and  soil  geochemical  anomalies  was  effective  in
delineating porphyry targets concealed beneath Malmyzh's ubiquitous cover of soil and alluvium (Figure 6.1 and
Figure  6.2).  FMEC's  drilling  intersected  copper-gold  porphyry  alteration  and  mineralisation,  and  identified  the
Central, Flats, North, and Stockwork prospect.
FMEC downsized worldwide exploration activities in late 2008, with Malmyzh being one of the only exploration
projects  retained  in  Eurasia.  In  September  2009,  Fortress  Minerals  Corp.  (“Fortress”)  entered  into  a  "Share
Purchase" joint venture agreement with FMEC to acquire a 51% interest in the subsidiary (Amur) that controlled
Malmyzh, as well as two other exploration projects in the Russian Far East (Fortress news release; September 29,
2009).  The  agreement  required  a  nominal  cash  payment,  the  completion  of  12,000  m  of  drilling,  and  the
assumption of operational control by Fortress of the Malmyzh Project.
Fortress commenced a Malmyzh winter drill programme in late 2009, and completed 23 core holes totalling ~7,000
m (Fortress news releases; January 13, March 17, March 29, and May 25, 2010). This work followed-up on the
targets drilled by FMEC, and also intersected copper-gold mineralisation at the ABV, Valley, Z, West, Sharga, and
East targets (Figure 6.3). In July 2010, the joint venture acquired a second exploration and mining license (HAB
02334), known as North Malmyzh, and increased the total Project area to 152.8 km2.

Subsequently,  Fortress  concluded  a  transaction  in  December,  2010  with  IGC  (through  predecessor  in  name
Intergeo Resources LLC), whereby IGC acquired Fortress's interests in the Russian Federation for an aggregate
consideration of US $500,000 (Fortress news release; December 17, 2010). Fortress assigned IGC the option to
“earn in” for a 51% interest in the Malmyzh Joint Venture by completing the drill requirements. IGC commenced a
winter drill programme in late 2010-early 2011 that consisted of 16 holes for ~5,000 m. This drilling completed
IGC's obligation to FMEC to earn IGC a 51% interest in the Malmyzh Joint Venture.
6.4 Comments on Historical Exploration Results
The  2006-2010  Phelps  Dodge/FMEC/Fortress  exploration  programmes  were  conducted  utilising  industry  best
practice standards. FMEC remains as a 49% Malmyzh Joint Venture partner, and their original exploration data
has  been  reviewed,  updated,  and  incorporated  into  the  Malmyzh  Project  databases.  The  Fortress  exploration
programmes were managed by T. Bowens, CPG (former Fortress Chief Operating Officer) and J. Ashleman, LPG
(former Fortress Chief Geologist). Bowens and Ashleman transitioned from Fortress to form IGC as President/CEO
and Chief Geologist, respectively, and to assume ongoing operational management of the Malmyzh Project. The
continuity of the Project management has resulted in consistent exploration protocols, sampling procedures, and
QA/QC programmes as discussed in Sections 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0 of this report.
The  government  geologic  mapping  programmes  conducted  in  the  Malmyzh  region  are  discussed  in  Section  7.
There are no significant historic resources/reserves or production from the property.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION
7.1
Introduction
Section  7  is  principally  based  on  summary  information  taken  from  Ashleman  (2010),  Westra  (2012a,b),  and
OREOLL (2014); this work is hereby acknowledged.
Regional Geology
Regional Geology
7.2
The  regional  geologic  setting  of  Malmyzh  is  a  complex  collage  of  accretionary  complexes  and  magmatic  arcs
related to the subduction of the ancestral Pacific plate during the Cretaceous through early Tertiary (Figure 7.1).
Malmyzh is located in the Amur River Terrane, a package of Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous continental margin
turbidites (flysch) that were accreted in the Cretaceous (Nokleberg et al., 2006). This package of sedimentary rocks
was  subjected  to  magmatic  activity  interpreted  to  be  related  to  the  East  Sikhote-Alin  continental-margin  arc
complex during the Late Cretaceous. It is within this regional tectonic and magmatic framework that the porphyry
copper-gold systems of Malmyzh were formed. During Eocene time, the Sikhote-Alin active margin evolved to a
transform  margin  characterised  by  northeast-trending,  large-offset,  left-lateral  strike-slip  faults  (Natal’in,  2007;
Nokleberg, 2010; Parfenov and others, 2011).
The sedimentary rocks of the Amur River Terrane and the plutonic-volcanic rocks of the East Sikhote-Alin overlap
assemblage are now separated by the Amur Suture.
Early work by Zvezdov and others (1993) delineated what they termed the Sikhote-Alin porphyry copper province.
In  a  subsequent  analysis  of  lithotectonic  schemes  and  metallogeny  of  the  North  Pacific  orogenic  collage,
Yakubchuk (2002) identified a Cretaceous episode of porphyry Cu-(Au-Mo) formation in the Sikhote-Alin region.
Sato and others (2004) noted a similar episode of metallogenesis, but also distinguished between earlier, reduced-
type (with Sn) granitoid magmatism in the western region of Sikhote Alin (Khingan-Okhotsk continental arc) and
later,  oxidised-type  (with  Au)  in  the  eastern  region  (East  Sikhote-Alin  continental  arc).  Although  these  earlier
studies identified the region as prospective for copper-gold porphyry systems, it has for the most part remained
under-explored (Figure 7.2).

7.3 Property Geology
7.3.1 Introduction
The geology of the Malmyzh Project area has been regionally mapped by various Russian government agencies.
The Project area is covered by 1 to over 50 m of unconsolidated Quaternary soils and alluvium, and outcrop is
practically non-existent. As a result, the regional scale geologic mapping has been supplemented largely based on
drilling and magnetic anomalies. Accordingly, the Project geology is highly interpretative, but generally consists of
Cretaceous siliciclastic sequences intruded by multiple Late Cretaceous stocks of diorite porphyry affinity (Figure
7.3).

7.3.2 Lithologies
Malmyzh is underlain by Cretaceous flysch-like sequences consisting of arkosic sandstone, siltstone and shale.
This  folded  sedimentary  rock  sequence  has  been  intruded  by  Late  Cretaceous  hypabyssal  stocks  and  dykes
ranging  in  composition  from  diorite  porphyry  and  quartz  diorite  porphyry  to  granodiorite  porphyry.  The  dioritic
intrusives  are  similar  in  texture  and  mineralogy,  although  alteration  overprinting  often  makes  it  difficult  to
confidently differentiate individual porphyry units.
Photo 7.1 shows examples of the various rock types seen at the Project.

Plagioclase  porphyry  with  a  granular  groundmass  that contains  plagioclase  and  small  biotite
phenocrysts. Forms some late stage dykes.
Coarse hornblende-plagioclase porphyry. Poorly mineralised late to post-mineral intrusive.
Some of the intrusives are associated with phreato-magmatic breccias, for example at Freedom, Bikha and ABV.
Extensive hybridisation and contact brecciation occurs at Valley, Central and Bikha.
7.3.3 Structure
The  lack  of  outcrop  precludes  a  clear  understanding  of  the  property's  detailed  structural  architecture,  but  the
prevailing  interpretation  is  of  an  overall  east-northeast  to  northeast  district-scale  structural  fabric.  The  Russian
geologic maps also portray a predominance of northeast trending dykes, alteration zones, magnetic lineaments,
and soil geochemistry anomalies. This broad corridor of structural preparation has been termed the "Malmyzh fault
zone" by Russian workers.
A subsidiary set of northwest oriented faults has been inferred based on the trend of drainages along assumed
zones  of  weakness.  It  has  been  postulated  that  the  intersection  of  the  northwest  faults  with  the  predominant
northeast structural fabric provided a localised control on the emplacement of the Malmyzh porphyry systems. Fault
zones logged in drill core as rubble zones often post-date alteration and mineralisation, and their occurrence varies
significantly between the various deposits and prospects on the property. The most clearly recognisable structural
deformation  occurs  at  Freedom,  and  is  manifest  as  intense,  late  stage  brittle  fracturing  and  fault  truncation  of
mineralisation.
Bedding  within  the  siliciclastic  rock  units  has  been  masked  by  alteration,  but  where  apparent  in  drill  core,  the
bedding planes strike east-northeast with dips that range from shallow to steep, suggesting east-northeast trending
folds within the area. Locally, bedding attitudes can steepen near faults and at the contacts with intrusive units.
7.3.4 Alteration
7.3.4.1Introduction
The  following  is  an  outline  of  the  porphyry  alteration  assemblages  and  features  of  the  Malmyzh  copper-gold
porphyry systems as taken from Westra (2012a,b) and updated by J. Ashleman.
7.3.4.2Potassic Alteration
This type of alteration (Photo 7.2) occurs as an early hydrothermal biotite-magnetite stage and a more localised K-
feldspar alteration stage which also includes abundant biotite.

EURASIAN MINERALS INC AND IG COPPER LLC
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Potassic alteration in intrusive rocks is expressed as finely disseminated biotite and magnetite in the groundmass,
as veinlets ± quartz, and as biotite-magnetite replacement of earlier mafic minerals. The intrusion of the porphyry
stocks into the siliciclastic wall rocks developed  contact  alteration  aureoles  of  early  stage  biotite  hornfels.  This
early  biotite  alteration  is  commonly  overprinted  by  K-feldspar  alteration  and  local  quartz  vein  stockwork
development,  particularly  at  Valley.  Copper  and  gold  mineralisation  is  commonly  associated  with  potassic
alteration.
7.3.4.3Chlorite-Sericite Alteration
This  alteration  facies  occurs  above  and  peripheral  to,  as  well  as  overprinting  the  potassic  alteration  zone.  It
consists of chlorite, sericite and clays and may have associated magnetite and/or sulphides (Photo 7.3). It may be
very  intense  and  texture  destructive,  thereby  masking  earlier  potassic  alteration.  Copper-gold  mineralisation  is
commonly associated with chlorite-sericite alteration.

7.3.4.4Propylitic Alteration (Chlorite-Epidote)
This forms a peripheral alteration zone around the potassic zone, and occurs as chlorite, epidote, and variable
magnetite (Photo 7.3). Total sulphide content is generally low and includes pyrite and minor chalcopyrite and/or
sphalerite. Copper grades are typically low, except where it overprints earlier alteration zones.
7.3.4.5Phyllic Alteration
This  type  of  alteration  occurs  as  a  quartz-sericite-pyrite  assemblage  with  high  pyrite  and  pyrite-to-chalcopyrite
ratios  (Photo  7.4).  The  alteration  is  typically  texture  destructive,  and  magmatic  magnetite  is  mostly  destroyed.
Sulphides in outer phyllic halos largely occur as disseminations, whereas in the inner phyllic halos a network of
pyritic veinlets cuts the rock. Phyllic alteration zones typically have lower grades of copper.
7.3.4.6Quartz Veins
These are common to abundant in several prospects, for example at Valley, Freedom, and Central (Photo 7.5).
Several stages of quartz veining have been identified, including a) "A-type" quartz veins that form stockwork and
sheeted vein zones, b) “B-type" veins that occur as coarse pyrite-sulphide veins that formed during the later stages
of porphyry development, and c) “D-type” veins that occur in more peripheral zones of phyllic alteration.
7.3.4.7Chlorite-rich Veinlets
These are especially common at the Freedom prospect where they form high density sub-parallel vein and veinlet
sets.  Chlorite-rich  veinlets  are  commonly  associated  with  sulphide  introduction,  and  can  have  significant
chalcopyrite content.

7.3.4.8Magnetite
Magnetite, which is abundant and widespread, was introduced early and occurs as diffuse magnetite replacement
bands, or as early coarse quartz-magnetite veins and pure magnetite veinlets, as well as during potassic alteration.
Magnetite is associated with copper mineralisation in the Central, Freedom and other target areas, but appears to
be of lesser significance at Valley and Flats.
7.3.4.9Gold:Copper Ratios
Au:Cu ratios are generally constant within a given prospect, but vary between prospects. Higher gold contents and
Au:Cu ratios occur at Freedom and Flats, and locally at Valley and Central. The highest ratios are often associated
with potassic alteration of the porphyry systems.
7.3.4.10Late Stage Alteration
Late alteration stages are commonly hosted in zones of brittle fracturing. These fracture zones often contain coarse
white  calcite  and  pink  or  peach-coloured  zeolite  veins  (Photo  7.6).  A  late  alteration  phase  is  associated  with
polymetallic epithermal veins that consist of quartz, abundant pyrite and sphalerite, and lesser amounts of galena
and rarely sulphosalts. Both gold-copper-zinc-lead and gold-only vein/shear zones have been observed.
7.3.4.11Argillic Alteration
Argillic  alteration  is  a  minor  component,  occurring  primarily  as  supergene  argillisation  located  within,  and  just
below the oxidation zone.

Advanced argillic alteration has generally not been recognised within the drilled prospects. However, there may be
a broad area of quartz-alunite in the southern part of the property just east of Bikha. Also, diaspore has also been
reported from this area. This area is poorly explored, but could be a lithocap or deeper level advanced argillic
alteration associated with an undiscovered porphyry system.
7.3.4.12Alteration Discussion
The  alteration  environment  that  most  closely  fits  the  assemblages  at  Malmyzh  is  proximal,  deeper  potassic
alteration  transitioning  outboard  to  broad  outer  propylitic  halos.  Several  features  of  the  Malmyzh  alteration  and
geological setting suggest a relatively deep erosional level for the porphyry systems (Westra, 2012b):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
A lack of co-magmatic or younger volcanics in the area.
A high temperature environment suggested by the hybrid biotite hornfels/intrusive contact zones and
sediment assimilation.
Poorly developed phyllic alteration zones.
Preservation of magmatic plagioclase demonstrating a lack of argillic overprinting and suggesting a low
permeability environment with little to no incursion of meteoric fluids until very late in the development
of the hydrothermal systems.
Lack of advanced argillic alteration features.
Evidence of ductile deformation and presence of “A- type" quartz veining.
According  to  Westra,  the  observed  geologic  and  alteration  features  place  the  present-day  erosional  level  at
Malmyzh at over 3 km below the paleosurface. However, the relatively unexplored southern portion of the license
with deeper overburden, and evidence of advanced argillic alteration (i.e., east of Bikha), may host higher level
mineralisation representing the upper parts of a porphyry system.

7.4 Mineralisation
7.4.1 General
The Malmyzh Project hosts 14 porphyry copper-gold deposits, prospects, and targets within a district-scale area 16
by 5 km corridor (Figure 7.4). Most of the exploration work has focused on the Valley, Freedom, Central, and Flats
deposits. However, exploration potential remains at the other prospects and targets, as well as undrilled areas with
deeper overburden cover.
The multiple alteration and copper-gold mineralisation centres at Malmyzh are hosted by composite porphyritic
stocks  and  adjacent  hornfels  altered  sandstone  and  siltstone  sedimentary  sequences.  Higher  grades  of
mineralisation  are  often  associated  with  potassic  alteration,  and  biotite+magnetite  are  the  dominate  alteration
minerals  associated  with  the  main  stage  of  mineralisation.  Mineralisation  is  also  associated  with  the  chlorite-
sericite alteration, particularly in areas where there is an overprint of potassic alteration. Stockworks and veinlet
networks locally control mineralisation. The potassic zones grade up into, or are overprinted by chlorite-sericite
alteration and flanked by and locally overprinted by propylitic alteration zones.

Chalcopyrite and subordinate bornite are the principal copper species. Covellite, chalcocite, and digenite have
been noted in local zones of enrichment, and malachite and copper wad locally occur in the oxidised zones. The
phyllic  zones  encountered  to  date  tend  to  be  moderate  to  small  in  extent  as  is  characteristic  of  copper-gold
porphyry  systems.  In  general,  the  oxide  zone  is  fairly  shallow  and  with  the  low  pyrite  content  large  supergene
enrichment blankets have not been developed.
An interpretation of the development of porphyry copper-gold mineralisation at Malmyzh is as follows:
Intrusion  of  quartz  diorite  porphyry  magmas  with formation  of  a  biotite  hornfels  contact  aureole,
Intrusion  of  quartz  diorite  porphyry  magmas  with formation  of  a  biotite  hornfels  contact  aureole,
formation of intrusion breccias and zones of assimilation, intrusion of small aplitic dykes and K-feldspar
introduction in the hornfels zone.
Crystallisation of the magma with generation of magmatic hydrothermal fluids and early replacement of
hornblende  phenocrysts  by biotite,  as  well  as  formation  of  quartz,  quartz-  magnetite  and  magnetite
veins with minor chalcopyrite.
Early magmatic hydrothermal stage of potassic alteration dominated by biotite with K- feldspar largely
confined to the hornfels aureole, local development of quartz vein stockworks with chalcopyrite-bornite
mineralisation, but little pyrite.
Mineralisation  stage  with  formation  of  complex  veinlets with  quartz-chlorite-sericite-clay-  pyrite  and
chalcopyrite.
A later mineralisation stage with high total sulphide content (mainly pyrite) and varying volumes of vein
quartz and associated sericite.
Sphalerite with minor galena, chalcopyrite, rare sulphosalts and abundant pyrite in epithermal quartz-
carbonate veins and broad zones of clay-carbonate-Fe alteration.
Post-mineral calcite, anhydrite and zeolite veinlets.
Latest calcite fracture coatings.
Supergene gypsum veinlets.

These  generalised  stages  are  variously  developed  in  the  different  prospects,  For  example,  at  Valley  the  main
stage  of  mineralisation  is  associated  with  potassic  alteration.  On  the  other  hand,  at  Freedom  later  chloritic
alteration is very strongly developed and is the main mineralisation stage.
The following sections provide a brief outline of the Malmyzh copper-gold mineralised deposits, prospects, and
targets. Further discussion on mineralisation is given in Sections 9 (Exploration) and 10 (Drilling) of this report.
7.4.2 Valley Deposit
Valley is a 1,600 by 1,100 m deposit hosted in diorite porphyries and hornfelsed sedimentary rocks. Valley is the
most well developed porphyry system at Malmyzh, with a shallow zone of intense biotite-rich and biotite-K-feldspar
potassic alteration (> 0.3 -0.5% Cu, > 0.2 -0.3 g/t Au) and mineralisation occurring as chalcopyrite and local bornite
(Photo 7.7). There are peripheral phyllic and propylitic zones (> 0.1 % Cu, > 0.05 g/t Au) with high total sulphide
content and pyrite:chalcopyrite ratios. The deposit is distinguished by elevated copper-gold grades in extensive
zones  of  assimilation  and  hybridisation  at  the  intrusive-wall  rock  contact  accompanied  by  the  development  of
intense quartz vein stockworking in the hornfels. Mineralisation remains open to depth.

7.4.3 Central Deposit
Central copper-gold mineralisation is principally hosted in a N50°E striking 900 by 450 m zone of a potassically
altered  and  chlorite-sericite  overprinted  composite  porphyry  of  dioritic  to  quartz  dioritic  composition  that  dips
steeply to the northwest.
The down-dip projection of mineralisation extends to over 600 m, and remains open at depth. Mineralisation also
occurs in the footwall of hornfelsed fine-grained siliciclastic wall rocks.
The mineralisation at Central is characterised by low Au:Cu ratios. There is a higher grade (> 0.3 -0.5% Cu, > 0.1 -
0.2  g/t  Au)  mineralisation  in  a  northeast  aligned  potassically  altered  core  to  the  porphyry  system.  This  zone
projects to depth, and includes a thick steeply dipping laminated quartz-feldspar zone with UST textures (AMM-41),
abundant chalcopyrite and bornite, and high copper-gold grades (> 1% Cu, > 0.3 -1.0 g/t Au).
Examples of mineralisation are shown in Photo 7.8 below.

7.4.4 Freedom Deposit
Freedom's two northeast-trending zones are hosted in a complex assemblage of diorite porphyries, multi-stage
breccias, and hornfels, and have lateral dimensions of 1000 by 600 m (Southeast deposit) and 1,200 by 300 m
(Northwest prospect). Freedom has an early biotite-magnetite potassic alteration stage with weakly mineralised
quartz  and  magnetite  veins.  Significant  copper-gold  mineralisation  is  hosted  in  a  strong  chlorite-rich  alteration
assemblage with the more intense alteration accompanied by steeply dipping, high-density sets of parallel quartz
veins with higher grade copper-gold (> 0.4 -0.5% Cu, > 0.3 -0.5 g/t Au). The mineralisation has high Au:Cu ratios.
Post  mineral  faulting  and  fracturing  has  affected  much  of  the  Freedom  area.  Examples  of  mineralisation  from
Freedom are shown in Photo 7.9.
7.4.5 Flats Deposit
The Flats prospect is 800 by 500 m in dimension, with mineralisation hosted by potassically altered hornblende
feldspar porphyry with adjacent hornfels altered sandstones. The potassic alteration is characterised by biotite and
magnetite with subordinate K-feldspar, and relatively high Au:Cu ratios (Cu > 0.1 -0.4%, Au > 0.1 -0.4 g/t), with
higher-grade gold intercepts intersected at the intrusive-hornfels contact. Copper-gold mineralisation remains open
to depth.

7.4.6 Other Prospects
 
7.4.6.1Bikha
Bikha mineralisation is hosted in diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry plugs and dykes, as well as hornfels.
The  alteration  and  mineralisation  characteristics  are  compatible  with  a  high 
temperature  contact
metasomatic/hydrothermal environment, with low level copper (> 0.1 -0.3%), variable gold grades (> 0.05 -0.4 g/t),
and relatively high Au:Cu ratios.
7.4.6.2North
The North comprises an area of 2.5 (east-west) by 1.5 km (north-south) over a strong, east-west trending magnetic
anomaly. Copper-in-soil values in excess of 50 ppm define a large anomaly that coincides with the main magnetic
anomaly and extends beyond it. Gold-in-soil values define strong discrete anomalies with values ranging from < 5
to 100 ppb. The North system has a unique clay-calcite-Fe-carbonate overprint with associated sphalerite, galena
and arsenic geochemistry. Copper mineralisation is hosted in diorites and diorite porphyries.
7.4.6.3ABV
The ABV prospect is a 1,500 (northeast) x 1,100 m (northwest) magnetic anomaly with anomalous copper and gold
soil geochemistry. The zone of copper mineralisation at the hornfels-porphyry contact ranges from > 0.1 -0.5%, with
gold > 0.05 -0.1 g/t.
7.4.6.4Destiny
The Destiny prospect consists of a 500 by 500 m magnetic anomaly with weak copper and gold soil anomalies
over a small diorite porphyry stock. Mineralisation occurs in a chalcopyrite-bornite-quartz-magnetite assemblage.
Thick and relatively higher grade copper and gold mineralised intervals with high Au:Cu ratios have been noted.
Sharga
7.4.6.5Sharga
The Sharga prospect is along the western edge of a magnetic anomaly over a small quartz diorite porphyry stock.
The area is highlighted by a weak copper-in-soil anomaly. The intrusive is weakly mineralised in copper and gold.

7.4.6.6Stockwork
The  Stockwork  prospect  is  centred  on  a  weak  magnetic  anomaly  and  localised  gold-in-soil  anomaly,  over  a
porphyry intrusive with a northeast axis of ~ 500 m, and width of ~ 200 m. As currently understood, the copper-gold
mineralisation (0.1 -0.3% Cu, 0.05 -0.2 g/t Au) is open to the southeast.
7.4.6.7North Slope
North  Slope  is  located  along  a  northeast-trending  magnetic  high  that  parallels,  and  is  similar  in  size  and
magnitude, as Freedom Northwest. The geology is interpreted as a northeast trending intrusive about 2,700 m long
and  up  to  500  m  wide,  consisting  of  diorite  porphyry  with  smaller  bodies  of  granodiorite  and  diorite  porphyry
breccias. Copper and gold mineralisation is generally sporadic and weak.
7.4.6.8Volkov
The Volkov prospect (also known as Volker) area covers two strong magnetic anomalies northwest of Freedom.
The geology is interpreted as fault bounded blocks of diorite porphyry. The copper mineralisation is modest (> 0.1 -
0.3%) with gold grades > 0.1 g/t.
7.4.6.9West
The West target is southwest of the Central area with copper mineralisation associated with late stage breccias.
7.4.6.10Z
The Z target is a magnetic anomaly that was tested with one hole which had two low-grade intercepts in sandstone
hornfels. There is over 50 m of overburden that could explain the lack of soil geochemical anomalies.

DEPOSIT TYPES
The  Malmyzh  district  hosts  multiple  copper-gold  porphyry  centres  within  a  regional  scale  setting  of  arc  terrane
tectonism  and  magmatism.  The  Project's  14  porphyry  deposits,  prospects,  and  targets  occur  in  a  16  by  5  km
intrusive corridor, with copper and gold mineralisation hosted by composite diorite porphyry stocks and adjacent
hornfels-altered sandstone and siltstone rock sequences; this typifies the description of the porphyry copper-gold
deposit type given by Sillitoe (2010). Figure 8.1 shows a schematic porphyry system cross-section.

At  Malmyzh,  potassic  alteration  with  biotite+magnetite  is  associated  with  the  main  stage  of  copper-gold
mineralisation; secondary potassium feldspar is also sometimes present. The potassic alteration zones transition
up  into,  or  are  overprinted  by,  chlorite-sericite  alteration,  which  in  turn  is  flanked  by,  or  locally  overprinted  by
propylitic alteration. Local areas have phyllic alteration and late stage D-veins (sericite+ quartz+pyrite).
Chalcopyrite and subordinate bornite are the principal copper phases observed at Malmyzh. Covellite, chalcocite,
digenite, and copper wad have been noted in supergene enriched transition zones, and malachite and copper wad
locally occur in the oxide zones. Pyrite content tends to be low within the porphyry systems, and the pyritic phyllic
zones tend to be limited in extent, as is characteristic of copper-gold porphyry systems. In general the oxide zone is
fairly shallow, and with the low overall pyrite content appears to preclude the development of large supergene
enrichment blankets.
Westra (2012b) suggested that the porphyry systems at Malmyzh have been eroded to over 3 km depth below the
paleosurface (see "approximate erosional level" in Figure 8.1). At this erosional depth the lithocap and associated
mineralisation would have been removed from the stratigraphic section.
However, the high-sulphidation minerals alunite and diaspore have reportedly been noted from rock float in the
poorly explored southern part of the license east of the Bikha prospect. This occurrence may represent the upper
levels of a porphyry system as a down-faulted block that has not been as deeply eroded.

9.1
EXPLORATION
 
Introduction
Surface exploration at Malmyzh, other than geologic mapping discussed in Section 7.0 of this report, has included
soil, “deep” soil, and rock float sampling geochemical programmes, and ground magnetic geophysical surveys. As
the  Project  is  covered  by  varying  thicknesses  of  unconsolidated  Quaternary  overburden,  the  identification  of
concealed  porphyry  systems  for  drill  follow-up  relied  almost  exclusively  on  soil  geochemical  and  magnetic
anomalies.  These  indirect  exploration  techniques  have  been  remarkably  successful  in  delineating  14  separate
target areas that have yielded copper-gold mineralisation and porphyry or porphyry related alteration over a 16 by
5 km area.
As described in Section 6.0 of this report Phelps Dodge/FMEC conducted all Malmyzh exploration activities from
the start of the Project in 2006 to the spring of 2009. From the autumn of 2009 to late 2010, the Joint Venture's field
activities were under the direction of Fortress, and subsequently from late 2010 to the present, the Malmyzh Joint
Venture's exploration work has been operated and managed by IGC.
The Fortress and IGC programmes have been managed by Thomas E. Bowens and James C. Ashleman, and
senior  FMEC  management  has  been  consulted  during  the  course  of  exploration  from  Project  inception.  This
continuity of the Project's management has ensured that the exploration protocols and procedures have remained
consistent  over  time.  Accordingly,  the  results  detailed  here  represent  the  combined  results  of  exploration  from
2006-present (see Section 6.2. for details of historical 2006-2010 exploration results).
9.2 Soil Geochemistry
Approximately 5,300 soil samples have been collected along 500 line kilometers on a variety of grids with various
sample densities (Figure 9.1). Soil surveys were conducted on the initial Malmyzh license (HAB 0218) from 2006-
2008 on northwest oriented 200 by 100 m grids, with some areas covered by 100 by 50 m grids. These soil surveys
resulted in 3,438 samples being collected, sieved to -60 mesh, and assayed. Soil surveys were conducted on the
new Malmyzh North license (HAB 02334) in 2010 and 2011 on 400 by 100 m and 200 by 100 m grids, resulting in
1,856  samples  being  collected  and  assayed.  The  protocol  was  to  collect  the  soil  samples  from  the  B  horizon.
Samples were sieved to -20 mesh in 2010 and to -80 mesh in 2011. Duplicate soil lines of the earlier soil surveys
yielded similar results, and provided confidence in merging the results of the various programmes.
The  sieved  soil  fractions  were  pulverised  by  the  analytical  laboratory  and  gold  was  fire  assayed  and  a  multi-
element  package  was  analysed  utilising  aqua  regia  digestion  and  ICP  techniques.  The  majority  (~92%)  of  the
2006-2008 soils were analysed by Alex Stewart Labs of Moscow, except for the 201 sample grid over the ABV
prospect that was analysed by Dal Geophysical of Khabarovsk.

The  2010-2011  soil  samples  were  analysed  by  Irgiredmet  Labs  of  Irkutsk.  The  various  laboratories  had  trace
element packages with different detection limits and elemental suites, so caution was exercised when merging soil
geochemical data other than the gold fire assays.
As soil depths on the property can range from less than a metre to over 50 m, the geochemical anomalies have
been attenuated as a function of cover. Further, post-mineral alluvial sediments cover some areas of the Project. In
general, areas with more than 15-20 m of cover rendered the surface soil geochemistry fairly ineffective (Figure
9.2).
However,  the  soil  geochemistry  has  been  a  useful  exploration  tool  in  evaluating  the  property  for  concealed
porphyry  copper-gold  systems  with  shallow  cover.  In  particular,  gold,  copper,  molybdenum  and  zinc  soil
geochemistry  has  been  particularly  effective  for  targeting,  especially  when  the  areas  of  deep  cover  have  been
masked from the sample population (Figure 9.3).

In summary, the characteristics of the soil geochemical anomalies include:
•
•
Gold was the most useful element for targeting, with all of the principal prospects having an associated
anomaly.  Gold-in-soil values  were  low,  with  the  median  value  less  than  5  ppb  Au,  and  only  in rare
cases exceeding 100 ppb. Coherent gold anomalies of >10 ppb were significant, and often indicative of
an underlying porphyry system.
Copper values ranged from < 2 ppm to > 2000 ppm, with a median value of ~20 ppm. However, copper
•
•
is mobile in the weathering environment, and often yielded transported anomalies in areas that did not
host  significant  porphyry  mineralisation,  or  conversely  was weak  to  non-existent  over  some  of  the
principal porphyry prospects.
Molybdenum  values  are  low  in  the  mineralised  systems  at Malmyzh,  and  Mo  values  from  the  soil
samples  had  a  median  of  ≤2ppm  Mo  (the detection  limit),  and  up  to  12  ppm.  A  relatively  strong
molybdenum  anomaly is  associated  with  Central,  and  weak  anomalies  occur  at  Valley  and  in  the
Freedom area.
Zinc,  as  a  distal  pathfinder  for  porphyry  systems,  forms anomaly  halos  around  Central,  Valley  and
North, and is diffuse around Freedom. The Central and Valley zinc anomaly halos are incomplete due
to deeper soil and post-mineral cover to the southeast.
The geochemistry was most effective for targeting when integrated with the ground magnetics data (discussed in
Section 9.4).
9.3 Deep Soil Geochemical Sampling
 
9.3.1 Introduction
In order to overcome the masking effect of the deep overburden covering most of the property, various methods
were tried to obtain deeper, more representative samples, including digging pits with a backhoe, power augering,
and core drilling overburden to the top-of-bedrock (deep mapping).
9.3.2 Backhoe Soil Pit Sampling Orientation
A limited programme of excavating pits > 2 m depth with a backhoe was conducted during the summer of 2012.
Orientation lines were sampled in two areas: a) 20 pits at 50 m spacing were excavated north of Valley, and b) 40
pits at 50 m spacing were excavated at the Destiny prospect. These programmes yielded insignificant increases in
the gold results when compared to soil samples, and were subsequently discontinued.
9.3.3 Auger Soil Geochemical Sampling
A soil auger programme was conducted during the winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 to obtain deeper, more
representative soil samples, and also to help satisfy a Russian requirement for trenching. A backhoe was outfitted
with an auger capable of sampling to 8 m depth. A total of 406 holes was augured and sampled on 100 by 200 m
grids in the Freedom and Valley areas (Figure 9.4 and Figure 9.5).

The deeper auger soil samples yielded significantly stronger gold anomalies when compared to the conventional
shallow soil survey results over the two target areas. For example, Freedom which has deeper soil cover had a
robust  50  to  >500  ppb  auger  soil  gold  anomaly  as  compared  to  the  10-30  ppb  anomaly  resulting  from  the
conventional  soil  samples.  As  these  two  target  areas  had  undergone,  or  were  undergoing  significant  resource
drilling at the time, the auger soil samples have served more as an orientation study that illustrated the efficacy of
this sampling technique.
9.3.4 Deep Mapping
A Longyear LF-70 diamond drill was mounted on tracks and utilised for deep mapping top-of-bedrock sampling
programme in areas of thick overburden. The soil just above bedrock and the upper bedrock were sampled. The
programme was started in June of 2013, but terminated in July as the drill was needed for resource drilling. An
initial line of 35 holes at 50 m spacing was completed southwest of Valley and a second was started in the east
Bikha area where 6 holes were drilled at 100 m spacing. Production rates were two to three holes a day depending
on their depth and difficulty in getting water to the drill rig. This is a very effective exploration method, albeit more
expensive than conventional geochemical sampling.
Regardless,  the  “deep  mapping”  method  is  recommended  in  the  future  for  follow  up  of  geologic  trends  and
magnetic anomalies in the southern part of the license where overburden is deep.
9.4 Rock Geochemistry
Surface rock geochemistry has not been a very useful tool for targeting at Malmyzh due to the lack of outcrop.
However, float samples did provide some early indications of alteration and mineralisation in a given area, albeit
transported to a greater or lesser extent. Approximately 650 grab samples of float have been collected during the
various reconnaissance exploration and geologic mapping campaigns (Figure 9.6 and Figure 9.7).

9.5 Ground Magnetic Survey
The Malmyzh licenses have been covered with a series of ground magnetic surveys conducted from 2007-2012.
Approximately 1,000 line kilometers have been completed on either a 400 by 20 m grid, or more commonly on a
200 by x 20 m grid. Most of the surveys were conducted with a base station, and readings were corrected to the
base. The base was also used for quality control; if irregular readings were noted, the lines were subsequently
reacquired in the field to ensure the recording of representative magnetic readings before they were merged into
the final database.
The  magnetic  survey  results  have  been  critical  for  concealed  target  identification  at  Malmyzh.  Copper-gold
porphyry systems tend to be formed from more oxidised magmas and have oxidised (i.e., lower sulphide) alteration
systems. In addition to the intrusive rocks containing accessory magnetite, there is abundant secondary magnetite
within the potassic alteration zones of the porphyry systems that yield a positive magnetic response. Further, the
surrounding weakly or unaltered siliciclastic rocks have a low magnetic response, which accentuates the contrast
with the porphyry centers.
Figure 9.8 shows the total magnetic field reduced to pole (RTP), with blue depicting low values (54450-54800
teslas) and red representing higher values (56000 - >60000 teslas). Note that the earlier magnetic survey results
from FMEC and Fortress are illustrated in Section 6, and primarily covered the initial Malmyzh license. Many of the
earlier  magnetic  survey  lines  have  been  re-acquired  by  IGC,  resulting  in  the  final  merged  magnetics  database
shown in Figure 9.8.

All  of  the  mineralised  prospect  areas  discovered  to  date  at  Malmyzh  have  some  level  of  a  positive  magnetic
response. However, the lower magnetic responses are also important in that not only can they result from areas
underlain by clastic sedimentary rocks, but also can be due to attenuation by deep overburden. The latter point is
especially important in light of the relatively unexplored southeastern area of the property.
9.6 Comments on Exploration
Malmyzh surface exploration has identified fourteen copper-gold mineralised systems within a 15 by 5 km belt of
diorite porphyry intrusives. There is virtually no outcrop on the property, and the porphyry centers are concealed by
a cover of soil and alluvium ranging from one to over 50 m thick. A combination of soil geochemical (Au-Cu-Mo-Zn)
and magnetic anomalies have been very effective in identifying the porphyry targets. In addition to traditional soil
sampling techniques, the utilisation of top-of-bedrock drilling (i.e., "deep mapping") or power augering to collect
more  representative  samples  in  areas  of  deeper  cover  show  promise.  In  particular,  exploration  of  the  southern
portion  of  the  property  with  deeper  cover  would  benefit  from  the  utilisation  of  the  deep  mapping  and  auger
techniques.  Furthermore,  in  consideration  of  the  ability  of  ground  magnetic  anomalies  to  successfully  identify
shallow porphyry targets, aeromagnetics, with an inherent ability to provide magnetic signatures of deeper features
may be an effective tool for areas with thicker overburden cover.

Four of the prospects, Valley, Central, Freedom Southeast, and Flats, were drilled systematically on 200 by 200 m
grid patterns to delineate the copper-gold mineralisation in preparation for estimating C2 resources according to the
Russian  Federation's  GKZ  requirements.  These  drill  grids  were  oriented  N40°W,  across  the  predominately
northeast  structural  fabric  of  the  district.  Some  infill  drilling  was  completed  at  100  by  200  m  coverage  to  meet
Russian requirements for C1 resources. The other prospects have undergone reconnaissance exploration drilling
to confirm mineralisation identified from magnetic and geochemical anomalies.
Over half of the holes were drilled vertically and the majority of the angle holes drilled at an inclination of -60°
along the azimuths of the drill fences. The total down-hole depth drilled averages ~330 m, with the deepest hole
reaching 680.8 m at the Central deposit.
10.2 Drilling Contractors, Core Diameters and Recoveries
The FMEC 2008 drill campaign was conducted by Russian contractor Componenta Trading. The Fortress and IGC
managed campaigns were completed with Company owned rigs, which substantially decreased drilling expenses.
Initially a single Longyear LF-90 drill rig was deployed during 2010-2011, and subsequently a second LF-90 was
added during the 2012 drill campaign (Photo 10.1). A third rig, a track mounted Longyear LF-70, was added in
2013 to accelerate exploration and deposit drill-outs.

THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The initial drilling in 2008 was all NQ size core. In the 2010 campaign, 18% of the core was HQ; the holes were
started in HQ to drill through overburden and oxide zones, then eventually reduced to NQ after the rock became
competent. In the 2011 and 2012 drill campaigns, HQ was drilled to deeper depths accounting for 47% of the core.
For  the  2013  and  2014  drill  campaigns,  holes  were  drilled  deeper  with  HQ  (many  are  all  HQ)  to  obtain  larger
sample sizes and better recoveries; 71% of the core was HQ diameter.
Core recovery has been excellent (Table 10.3), and averages 94% for all Project drilling. Lower recoveries were
principally  in  overburden,  with  bedrock  recoveries  generally  over  97%.  On  two  holes,  recovery  was  low  in  the
upper part of the hole, so these holes were offset and the upper part re-drilled to maintain good overall recovery.

10.3 Drill Core Logging
The  initial,  eight  hole  2008  drilling  campaign  had  an  early  logging  format  that  was  not  as  extensive  and
quantitative as was set up for subsequent campaigns.
For the 2010 through 2014 programmes (>98% of the drilling), a thorough and comprehensive core logging system
was put in place. A quick log was done at camp on each hole as the core came in from the rig. A Niton (portable X-
ray  fluorescence  spectrometer)  was  used  during  quick  logging  to  assist  with  identification  of  mineralogy  and
estimate  preliminary  copper  grades  (Photo  10.2).  Subsequently,  detailed  geologic  and  geotechnical  logs  were
recorded for each drill hole (also Photo 10.2). The geologic core log was optimised for recording key features of a
copper-gold porphyry system, and was in a format easily entered into the Project’s database.
Data from the paper log forms was entered into the Project database, cross checked, and then translated from
Russian to English on site. Assay samples were marked by the logging geologist and are typically 2 m in length,
but were locally reduced to adjust for lithologic, alteration or mineralisation contacts.
10.4 Drill Hole Collar and Down-Hole Surveys
A handheld GPS was used to locate the 2008 reconnaissance holes, and starting in 2010 completed holes were
surveyed using post processing differential GPS (Magellan ProMark 3). Five of the eight 2008 drill hole collars
were later located and resurveyed with differential GPS (“DGPS”). Current practice is to mark all holes drilled with
a wooden post cemented at the collar, and a DGPS survey of the collar locations is completed regularly during the
drilling season (Photo 10.3).

The survey control network was originally anchored on a point established in base camp by using over a hundred
hours  of  averaged  GPS  readings.  Two  additional  survey  points  were  established  from  this  control  point  using
DGPS, one in the Freedom area and one at Central. All DGPS surveyed hole locations are tied to these control
points. Hole locations are recorded in UTM Zone 53 east meters, WGS84 horizontal datum, and EGM96 vertical
datum.
A  component  of  the  quality  control  programme  for  each  round  of  DGPS  surveying  included  resurveying  earlier
holes  and  comparing  the  results.  The  drill  hole  collar  duplicate  surveys  have  an  average  precision  +-2  cm  for
horizontal coordinates and elevation, with maximum variances up to 10 cm. The horizontal and vertical differences
are inconsequential, and result from minor inconsistencies in location measurement procedures in the field (i.e.,
which side of the drill hole marker the antenna shaft is placed for vertical holes, etc.). The accuracy and precision
of the drill hole collar locations support work through the feasibility stage of project evaluation.
Down-hole surveys were completed for five of the eight holes drilled in 2008; the instrument type is unknown. For
the 2010-2014 drill campaigns, a down-hole survey was conducted with readings taken every 20 m using a Reflex
Easy Shot instrument. However, due to broken survey equipment, five holes do not have down-hole survey data.
An overall check of the down-hole surveys illustrates that even for deep holes the maximum deflection is generally
only a few degrees and most holes have less than one degree of deflection. Thus, due to the relatively short hole
lengths (40 to 300 m) and medium hole sizes, the holes without down-hole surveys are likely to have minimal
deviations.

10.5 Drill Results
The Malmyzh drill campaigns have outlined 14 concealed copper-gold porphyry systems (Figure 7.4). The Valley,
Central,  Freedom  Southeast  and  Flats  deposits  have  been  systematically  drilled  for  resource  definition.
Reconnaissance drilling at the other prospects has intersected porphyry alteration and copper-gold mineralisation.
Note a) reported intercepts are approximate true widths in porphyry style mineralisation unless otherwise stated, b)
CuEq% = Cu% + (0.5*Au g/t) (see Section 14.9.2.2), c) CuEq% grade*thickness (m) calculated at a 0.3% CuEq cut-
off, and d) drill hole names with a prefix of "FMXC" were FMEC holes drilled in 2008.
10.5.1Valley Drill Results
Valley is the largest deposit discovered to date as defined by 53 drill holes totaling 20,558 m. It is expressed as a
bowl shaped topographic depression in the central part of the property and was discovered by drilling a weak soil
anomaly and a weakly positive magnetic anomaly. The drilling has defined mineralisation over an area of ~1.6 by
1.1 km hosted in diorite porphyry and hornfelsed siliciclastic units (Figure 10.2 and Figure 10.3).
Valley has been drilled on a 200 x 200 m, N40oW oriented grid, with the central part of the grid covered by 2 or
more holes from the 200 m grid points to achieve the equivalent of 200 m x 100 m coverage. Two holes were
drilled along NE strike, to confirm continuity of the mineralised zone.

The area is covered by shallow to moderate overburden (2-20 m) and copper-gold mineralisation extends from the
base of the oxide zone (20-40 m below the surface) to 300 to >500 m deep, and remains open at depth.
A  northeast  trending,  steep  northwest  dipping  fault  limits  mineralisation  along  the  southeast  side,  but
mineralisation gradually drops off along the other margins.
The higher grade copper-gold zones of the Valley system are hosted in shallow hornfels host rocks that occur from
near-surface to depths of ~150 to 250 m. Copper-gold grades have also been locally enhanced with secondary
enrichment. Table 10.4 lists selected intercepts from Valley drilling.

The  Central  deposit  is  located  in  the  west-central  part  of  the  license  6  km  southwest  of  Valley.  It  has  been
evaluated with 33 drill holes totaling 11,632 m. Drilling has outlined a 900 by 450 m copper-gold mineralised zone
trending N50E and dipping steeply northwest that is principally hosted in diorite porphyry (Figure 10.4 and Figure
10.5).
Central has been drilled on a 200 by 200 m N40W grid, with some infill holes to give the core area the equivalent
of 100 by 200 m coverage.
There  is  30  m  of  overburden  over  the  main  mineralised  area,  but  it  decreases  to  a  few  meters  to  the  NW.
Mineralisation starts from the base of oxidation (30 to 45 m below the surface) and extends down dip over 300 -
400 m. Higher grade mineralisation is hosted in a steeply plunging potassically altered core, and decreases rapidly
towards the edges of the system. Of note is a high-grade copper-gold quartz-feldspar "vein-like" intercept deep
down-dip (+600 m) in drill hole AMM-041 interpreted to have universal solidification textures (UST). This feature,
as well as the potassically altered core remains open to depth. Table 10.5 lists select intercepts from the Central
drilling.

The Freedom deposit encompasses a large area (i.e., > 4 km2) in the northeast portion of the license area. Drilling
has  defined  two  sub-parallel,  northeast  trending  zones  of  mineralisation  (Freedom  Southeast  and  Northwest)
hosted in a complex assemblage of diorite porphyries, multi-stage breccias, and hornfels that are coincident with
two prominent magnetic high anomalies (Figure 10.6).
Freedom has been evaluated with 49 holes totaling 17,482 m. Freedom has been drilled on 200 by 200 m and 200
by  400  m,  N40W  grids,  with  some  of  the  peripheral  holes  on  400  by  400  m  spacing.  Overburden  at  Freedom
ranges from 1 to >40 m.
The Freedom Southeast deposit has been drilled on a 200 by 200 m grid with infill holes drilled from the 200 m grid
points to give the equivalent of 100 by 200 m coverage in the core of the system. The drill defined mineralisation
has  an  oval  shape  of  about  1,000  m  by  600  m  with  a  NE  trend.  It  is  cut  off  along  the  eastern  side  by  a  post-
mineralisation fault. Copper-gold mineralisation extends from the base of oxidation at 25-40 m below the surface to
over 400 m depth (Figure 10.7). Table 10.6 lists select drill intercepts from Freedom SE.

There is insufficient drilling to define the geometries and extents of these targets, but most still have compelling
exploration potential. Their locations are shown in Figure 7.4 and discussed below. ABV is east of Valley, whilst
Destiny,  Sharga  and  Stockwork  are  along  a  northwest  trending  transverse  between  ABV  and  Freedom.  North
Slope and Volkov (with Destiny) lie along an easterly trending belt north of Freedom, whilst North and Bikha lie to

10.5.5.2ABV
This prospect is marked by the strongest positive magnetic anomaly on the property, and is located 2 km east of
Valley. It has been evaluated with 9 drill holes totaling 2,895 m (Figure 10.10). The magnetic anomaly highlights a
diorite  porphyry  with  accessory  magnetite  and  containing  abundant  secondary  magnetite  as  veinlets  and
disseminations.  Three  angle  holes  were  drilled  along  a  N40W  profile  across  the  contact  zone  of  the  magnetic
anomaly  and  two  were  mineralised.  The  copper-gold  mineralisation,  strong  magnetite  bearing  alteration,  and
phreato-magmatic breccias encountered by drilling suggests exploration potential remains within the area.
10.5.5.3Destiny
This  prospect  is  located  4.5  km  northeast  of  Valley  and  4  km  west-northwest  of  Freedom  along  the  northern
boundary of the property. It is part of a northwest trend of prospects between ABV and Freedom and was identified
from a small magnetic anomaly with weak copper-gold soil anomalies, and tested with 6 vertical holes totaling
1,584.2 m (Figure 10.11).

Two holes intersected copper-gold mineralisation in a weakly altered diorite porphyry stock and adjacent hornfels.
Mineralisation consists of chalcopyrite and bornite associated with magnetite and quartz magnetite veins. They
were offset ~400 m and no additional mineralisation was found.
10.5.5.4North Slope
This target starts about 1 km east of Destiny and has been drilled along a line of 5 widely spaced holes (~500 m)
extending 2 km to the northeast along a magnetic anomaly (refer to Figure 10.11). Four of the holes intersected
weak copper-gold mineralisation, including AMM-095 with 81m of 0.16% Cu and 0.21 g/t Au.
10.5.5.5Volkov
This is about 2 km east of North Slope and along the northeast margin of Freedom (refer to Figure 10.11). Two sets
of two holes, spaced about 1 km apart on two discrete magnetic anomalies have been drilled in this area and
intersected copper-gold mineralisation which is bounded on the east by the northerly fault that cuts off Freedom.
Due to the wide spaced reconnaissance drilling at Destiny, North Slope, and Volkov that intersected copper-gold
mineralisation and porphyry alteration, these targets have remaining upside potential that require additional follow-
up exploration.

10.5.5.6Sharga
This is located about 2 km southeast of Destiny, and has been evaluated with 5 drill holes totaling 1,276 m. Initially
a copper-gold soil anomaly with a coincident magnetic high was drilled that intersected anomalous mineralisation.
A second hole was drilled 1 km to the south-southeast on weaker soil and magnetic anomalies that encountered
224 m of alteration and copper mineralisation, including an upper zone of chalcocite enrichment. This hole was
offset  400  m  to  the  northwest  and  southeast,  and  200  m  to  the  southwest,  but  these  holes  intersected  weak,
sporadic copper-gold mineralisation. Sharga remains open along trend to the northeast towards Freedom.

Stockwork
Stockwork
Stockwork is located about 2 km southeast of Sharga, and occurs in a bowl shaped valley with a weak magnetic
high flanked by hills of hornfels with a quartz stockwork and phyllic and argillic alteration. The prospect has been
evaluated with 5 drill holes totaling 888 m. Three of the holes are at the same collar location. The two initial holes
were  lost  in  the  deep  overburden.  The  third  hole  intersected  copper  mineralisation  within  a  potassic  altered
feldspar porphyry, and was offset 400 m to the northeast and southwest with drilling that encountered weak and
sporadic mineralisation. The target remains open under deep cover to the southeast.
10.5.5.8North
The North area consists of several targets within an area 2.5 km east-west by 1.5 km north-south, and is located
2.5 km north-northeast of Central. The North area has been evaluated with 10 drill holes totaling 2,983 m (Figure

The  principal  target  is  on  an  easterly  trending  magnetic  high  with  a  copper-gold  soil  anomaly  and  rock  float
samples with copper and gold mineralisation. The main easterly trending magnetic anomaly was found to be a
composite diorite porphyry stock with variable alteration and mineralisation.
Holes AMM-030 and AMM-031 were drilled south and north from the same location and define an alteration and
mineralisation gradient that points to the south. AMM-030 had the best mineralisation and quartz-chlorite-magnetic
alteration, and AMM-031 intersected quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration. AMM-021 and AMM-071, 800 m and 100 m to
the south and south-southeast respectively, are propylitically altered with AMM-071 intersecting phreato-magmatic
breccias. The North target area has significant remaining exploration potential.
10.5.5.9Bikha
This  is  located  3  km  south  of  Central  in  the  southern  part  of  the  area.  It  has  been  evaluated  with  7  drill  holes
totaling 2,142 m. Two holes were drilled on a small but strong magnetic high anomaly and encountered copper-
gold  mineralisation  within  potassic  altered  hornfels.  These  were  offset  400  m  without  encountering  significant
mineralisation.  An  area  1.7  km  ENE  of  the  drilled  area  has  high  sulphidation  alteration  (quartz-alunite  and
diaspore) and a weak soil gold anomaly and remains untested.
10.6 Comments on Drilling
The  Malmyzh  drilling  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  industry  best  practice  standards.  The  drill  hole
collars and down-hole samples are accurately and precisely located. There are no known drilling, sampling, or
recovery factors that materially impact the accuracy or reliability of the results.
The  Project  drilling  has  confirmed  14  concealed  porphyry  copper-gold  centres  initially  identified  from  surface
exploration. The Valley, Central, Freedom (SE) and Flats deposits have been drill delineated at a nominal 200 by
200  m  grid  spacing  to  support  resource  estimation.  The  remaining  prospects  are  considered  to  be  worthy  of
consideration for further exploration.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
11
 
11.1 Introduction
The Malmyzh Project protocols and procedures for sample preparation, analyses and security follow industry best
practice guidelines. The sample preparation and analysis has been diligently monitored, and included a rigorous
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) programme that included the utilisation of certified reference materials
(CRM), blanks, and duplicate samples. The rigor of the QA/QC programmes has developed over time since initial
grassroots  exploration  discovery  (2007-2009)  to  drill  delineation  of  resources  (2010-2014).  In  parallel  with  the
QA/QC programmes, procedures for the secure handling, shipment, and archiving of Project exploration samples
has also been instituted.
11.2 Sample Preparation
11.2.1Sampling and Sample Preparation (2006-2008)
The  FMEC  soil  samples  for  2006-2008  were  dried  and  sieved  to  -60  mesh  on  site,  and  the  sieved  samples
packaged and securely delivered to the Alex Stewart Laboratory in Moscow via Khabarovsk. Drilling and sampling
for the Project's initial eight hole 2008 drill programme was conducted by FMEC. The core was quick logged on
site and split longitudinally along the core axis with a diamond saw. The core was sampled and delivered to the
office  in  Khabarovsk  by  company  personnel,  and  then  shipped  via  a  registered  transportation  carrier  to  Alex
Stewart for sample preparation and analysis. The second half of the core and coarse rejects are now stored in the
Joint Venture's secure warehouse in Khabarovsk.
11.2.2Sampling and Sample Preparation (late 2009-2014)
Additional  rigor  and  documentation  was  put  in  place  for  the  late  2009-2014  Malmyzh  exploration  programmes,
which included 98.4% of the Project's drill meters. Sample handling and preparation was continuously under the
supervision of North American geologic staff. Photo 11.1 shows a selection of photographs of the facilities and
procedures.
Soil samples were dried and sieved on site, QA samples were added into the sample stream, and preliminary
Niton  pXRF  readings  taken  of  the  sieved  samples.  The  soil  samples  were  then  boxed  in  cardboard  cartons,
securely  shipped  to  Khabarovsk,  and  air  freighted  to  Irgiredmet  Laboratories  in  Irkutsk  for  analysis.  Rock  float
samples were also boxed on site, sent to the Khabarovsk office, and securely shipped to Irgiredmet.

For drilling, the core was logged, sample numbers assigned, sample intervals marked, and a splitting mark placed
longitudinally  along  the  core  by  a  geologist.  The  core  was  then  sawn  in  half  with  a  diamond  saw  on  site.  In
addition, select samples of core, for example zones with “sooty” chalcocite that could be washed away in sawing,
were split with a hydraulic core splitter. The hydraulic splitter was also used for brief periods when the diamond
core saws were undergoing maintenance, or to relieve core saw backlogs during intense periods of delineation
drilling conducted with three rigs. A single, trained, experienced and diligent technician was responsible for core
movements and sampling, and this individual was under the constant supervision of the geologic staff. The second
half of the core is securely stored on site in a wood storage building.

The majority of drill samples (84%) underwent the first stages of sample preparation, including sample crushing
and  splitting,  utilising  an  on-site  sample  prep  "line"  designed  and  implemented  by  IGC’s  Chief  Geologist,  J.C.
Ashleman,  LPG.  The  procedures  and  protocols  for  sample  handling,  drying,  crushing  and  splitting,  carefully
planned  to  meet  both  Russian  and  Western  best  practice  standards,  were  rigorously  implemented  under  the
supervision of the on-site Project geologist.
The split core sample was logged onto a sample preparation manifest, dried, weighed, crushed, and a sub-sample
for analysis taken from a riffle split. Samples were crushed with a Rocklabs crusher to a nominal –2 mm, with most
of the material at –1 mm (p80% < 1 mm). A split of every 10th sample was sieved and the size fractions weighed to
QC the final size fraction to acceptable tolerances. The crushed sample was sub-sampled with a riffle splitter to a
500-600 g split, bagged, and delivered to the geology office for final organisation and shipment to the analytic lab.
The analytic lab was given instructions to pulverize the entire 500-600 g sample.
Detailed records were maintained for each sample regarding the sample preparation process, including details on
the number of splits and weights of each sample; these records are archived at the Project site. The crushing and
splitting  equipment  was  cleaned  with  brushes  and  compressed  air  between  each  sample  to  minimise  cross
contamination. The coarse rejects are securely stored on site in locked cargo containers.
An exception to the procedures described above occurred for ~15% of the drill core samples, and included secure
shipment of sawn/split core to the analytical laboratory for sample preparation via Khabarovsk. This procedure was
put in place to reduce turnaround time for on-site sample preparation, and primarily included samples for peripheral
"unmineralised" holes drilled in 2013. The laboratory was instructed to follow the same procedures as used on site,
which included crushing the samples to -2mm and then pulverizing a 500-600 g split for standard analysis.
11.3 Sample Analyses
The Malmyzh Project has a total of ~34,670 drill core samples, more than 5,400 soil and deep mapping samples,
and over 600 rock samples that have been analysed, in addition to blank, standard, and duplicate QA samples.
The principal analytical lab for the Project has been Irgiredmet Laboratories in Irkutsk, Russia (GOST ISO/MEK
17025 accredited). Also, Alex Stewart Geo Analytical LLC of Moscow (now part of ALS) was used early in the
programme, and ALS Laboratories of Chita (GOST ISO/IEC 17025 accredited) was utilised. All three of these labs
are internationally established organisations, and independent of IGC, EMX, and FMEC.
The large majority of the drill core samples (92.4%) were analysed by Irgiredmet. The first holes drilled in 2008
were  analysed  by  Alex  Stewart  (1.6%  of  the  drill  samples).  In  2013  there  was  a  back  log  with  Irgiredmet,  so
overflow samples were sent to ALS; these peripheral exploration holes represent 6% of the total drill samples. All
three laboratories performed a one assay-ton fire assay for gold with an AA or ICP finish, and analysed for copper
and  multi-element  suites  using  an  aqua  regia  digestion  and  ICP/AES  techniques.  The  analytic  laboratories  all
utilised  internal  standards,  blanks  and  duplicate  QA  samples,  and  reported  the  results  with  the  final  assay
certificates per Russian regulations.

The soil and rock samples taken from 2006-2008 were analysed by Alex Stewart with fire assay gold and aqua
regia digestion and ICP/AES techniques for copper and a multi-element suite.
One limited subset of soil samples and rock samples were analysed by Dal Geophysical of Khabarovsk. These
early exploration soil and rock samples were taken in the initial Malmyzh license (HAB 02018).
The 2010-2013 soil, auger, and deep mapping samples were analysed by Irgiredmet with a fire assay gold and
aqua regia digestion and ICP/AES techniques for copper and a multi-element suite. These samples principally
cover the Malmyzh North license (HAB 02334).
11.4 Quality Analysis/Quality Control
11.4.1Introduction
A QA/QC programme of standard, blank and duplicate samples has been consistently implemented for Malmyzh
drill samples. Fortress and IGC were the Project managers from late 2009 through 2014, and a rigorous and well
documented QC programme was introduced that included increasing the frequency of duplicate samples, as well
as the utilisation of certified reference material for the rock, soil and auger samples in addition to drill samples. The
QC programme (with the certified standards) covers 98.4% of the drill samples, and a rate of 15% QC samples has
been maintained throughout the 2009-2014 exploration programmes. In addition to the duplicate samples included
with the original assay batches, additional duplicate sampling has been subsequently performed, including umpire
lab duplicate analyses.
11.4.22006-2008 QA/QC Programmes
The  2006  through  early  2008  exploration  programmes  only  utilised  QC  samples  for  the  initial  drill  programme.
There were only eight holes drilled and this only represents 1.6% of the total Project drilling. The QC sample rate
was 15% of the samples submitted for analysis, and included 5% blanks, 5% standards and 5% duplicates. An in-
house FMEC standard was used (PDIS-1: 0.26±0.02 g/t Au, 0.258±0.005% Cu). The blank sample material was
reported to be barren sandstone from a local quarry. There were no significant QC problems noted. QA samples
were not included with the rock and soil exploration samples.
11.4.3Late 2009-2014 QA/QC Programmes
11.4.3.1Introduction
Starting in late 2009 the QA/QC programme was extended to all exploration samples including soil, rock and auger
samples as well as drill samples. Certified Reference Material ("CRM") standards from Ore Research Pty. of Perth,
Australia (OREAS) were introduced to the Project's QA/QC programme, and included high, moderate and low level
copper  and  gold  standards  within  expected  grade  ranges  for  Malmyzh  mineralisation.  Table  11.1  lists  the
standards used for the various drill campaigns.

The protocol was for an alternating standard or blank to be inserted approximately every tenth sample to yield five
standards and five blanks per 100 samples sent to the lab for analysis. A check of the drill sample database for
2010 through 2014 shows that the target rate of 1 in 20 samples for both standards and blanks was achieved. The
standards were designated by the geologist and inserted at site prior to sample shipment. Duplicate coarse reject
samples were spaced out through a given sequence and run at the end of the sample batch. The procedure was to
submit the samples from a complete drill hole, along with the QA samples, as a single work order to the laboratory
with instructions to run the analyses in sample number sequence. Additional duplicate samples have also been
analysed for different grade classes and between the different laboratories used.
The QA samples were promptly QC monitored upon receipt of each analytical report by the Project geologist. If
problems  were  identified,  the  lab  was  contacted  with  a  request  to  rerun  samples.  Overall,  the  labs  performed
consistently, yielding accurate and reproducible analyses; very few QC problems were identified.
11.4.3.2CRM Standards
CRM standards make up 5% of the total samples submitted for analysis (Table 11.2 and Table 11.3). The principal
analytic laboratory, Irgiredmet, performed very well with no bias shown and only rare cases of samples reporting
outside of the expected ranges for copper or gold. ALS was only used for a few exploration and peripheral drill
holes, and demonstrated acceptable performance on the standards.

11.4.3.3Blanks
Blank samples constitute 5% of the drill samples submitted for analysis (Table 11.4). During 2010 a blank of barren
sandstone from a local quarry was used (MSS in Table 11.4); it was from the same quarry reportedly used for the
2008-2009 drilling. IGC geologists obtained blank material from a different part of the quarry in 2011.

None of the blank samples returned detectable gold, but they did run variable low levels of copper; minor iron
staining and calcite veining was noted in the samples. In 2012 sandstone from another quarry that had less copper
variability was used as a blank (MS2 in Table 11.4).
A large amount of blank material was obtained from the Korf quarry near Khabarovsk in 2012. The Korf blank is a
uniform granodiorite used for building stone, and has consistent low levels of copper and no detectable gold. The
rock blank samples were inserted in the sample stream per the geologist's instructions, and crushed in sequence
with the drill samples (see Section 11.1.2).
A certified pulp blank, OREAS 9C, was also introduced as a QA sample in 2012, and replaced with OREAS 9d in
2013. In 2012 the pulp blank was used at a ratio of 1:3 to the Korf blank, but decreased to a 1:8 ratio for the 2013-
2014  drill  programmes.  Table  11.5  lists  summary  statistics  for  the  blanks  used  in  each  drilling  campaign,  and
Figure 11.2 is an example plot of blank analytical results for the 2013-2014 drill campaigns.
The blank QC results demonstrated good performance over time for both copper and gold. In only one case did
Irgiredmet report detectable gold from a blank, and it turned out this resulted from a sample switch at the lab; the
lab's re-run reported correctly.
ALS reported detectable gold in three Korf blanks, and one OREAS 9d blank; the reported gold levels were low (<
0.01g/t  Au),  and  inconsequential.  Of  note,  ALS  was  used  for  overflow  work  in  2013,  and  performed  all  of  the
sample preparation, including the crushing. As the OREAS pulp blank reported Au, it is considered an analytical
issue with low level gold. Copper has been very stable and of a low level in the Korf and OREAS 9 series blanks
which yield acceptable QC analytical performance. The low and consistent values in the Korf blank indicate no
significant contamination problems in the sample preparation.

11.4.3.4Coarse Reject Duplicates
Duplicates were submitted at a rate of 5% for the drill samples. For the samples crushed on site (84%), two splits
were taken from the coarse rejects for every 20th sample, and given unique sample numbers and submitted to the
analytical laboratory as part of the batch for a given drill hole. For samples not crushed on site, duplicates were
taken after the coarse rejects were returned from the lab, and subsequently submitted for analysis. The exception is
a few of the 2013 peripheral holes analysed by ALS for which duplicates were not submitted.
Figure 11.3 is an example of scatter plots for copper and gold in duplicate pairs for the 2013 and early 2014 drill
campaigns. The scatter plots demonstrate excellent correlation and analytic reproducibility, particularly as these
are coarse reject duplicates, and not duplicates of homogenised pulp material.
11.4.3.5Grade Class Duplicates
Additional duplicate samples were taken for each drill campaign as selected from three grade classes (0.1 -0.4, 0.4
-0.6,  >0.6%  Cu)  and  re-analysed  both  by  the  original  laboratory,  Irgiredmet,  as  well  as  by  an  external  umpire
laboratory. For 2010 through 2012, the class duplicates were sent to Alex Stewart, and for the 2013 and 2014 drill
campaign they were sent to ALS. In total, Alex Stewart ran 210 class duplicates and ALS analysed 238 duplicates.
The external labs re-analysed each duplicate sample twice, for both copper and gold.
The umpire lab duplicate performance for copper and gold is given in the scatter plots of Figure 11.4 and Figure
11.5. Overall the umpire duplicate analyses samples show good agreement, and do not indicate significant issues
or laboratory biases. However for gold, both Alex Stewart and ALS duplicate analyses do vary (either higher or
lower) from Irgiredmet at the lowest end of the range, suggesting minor issues of analytical precision at these two
laboratories.

The  remaining  half  of  the  split  core  was  submitted  for  duplicate  analysis  for  105  samples  from  the  2011-2012
drilling, and 203 samples from the 2013-2014 campaign. The samples were selected from the same three grade

original assays and the half core duplicate assays.

As a step in the ½ core duplicate sampling process, the weights of the second half of the core were recorded. The
duplicates averaged 8% higher, with variability suggesting possible sampling inconsistencies (Figure 11.6). There
are two weight populations representing NQ and HQ core sizes core. The variability is greater with the HQ core.
The  larger  diameter  HQ  core  was  frequently  used  at  shallower  depths  where  broken  and  weathered  rock  was
encountered.
Several possible factors that contribute to the variability in weights include: 1) not getting an equal split of the fine
and broken material, 2) inconsistent splitting for holes that were hydraulically split versus the normal practice of
using a core saw, and 3) sample markers for the split core having been jostled after repeated moves of the core
boxes.
It is recommended that in the future core sampling be monitored by spot checks of the weight of the second half of
the core immediately after splitting and prior to the core boxes being moved. Notwithstanding, the variances in split
core weights for NQ are not significant, and the HQ core samples in shallow and weathered zones do not impact
the most important samples from zones of underlying mineralisation.
The correlation of assay grades for copper and gold grades for the ½ core duplicates is good (Figure 11.7), with
high correlation coefficients and strong linear regression characteristics. This is especially so considering that core
duplicates will inherently have the highest variability as compared to coarse reject or pulp duplicates.

11.5 Sample Handling and Security
Sample  handling  and  security  for  the  Project's  exploration  samples,  particularly  the  drill  samples,  has  been
conducted with industry standard procedures. Malmyzh is a relatively "remote" site, and the property is constantly
occupied by site staff and personnel responsible for security.
Drill samples were transported from the rig to camp by Project personnel for logging and sampling on a frequent
basis  (twice  daily).  Once  logged,  the  core  was  transported  to  the  nearby  sample  prep  facility.  The  prepared
samples were moved to the camp's geology office at the end of each shift for final organisation and packaging for
shipment. This process included a) taking Niton pXRF readings on the prepared samples (which included blanks
and duplicates) as a "rough" QC check for the final laboratory analyses and determining preliminary results for
copper and other pathfinder/alteration elements, the b) insertion of CRM standards into the sample sequence, and
c) final packaging for shipment.
The packaged samples were driven by Project personnel from site at least on a weekly basis to the Khabarovsk
office, where they were securely stored until shipment to the analytic lab. Shipment to the lab was via registered air
freight. The remaining pulp not utilised by the analytical lab was returned and is securely stored at the Project
warehouse  in  Khabarovsk.  In  summary,  the  sample  handling  for  the  Malmyzh  exploration  samples  had  a
continuous and secure chain of custody from the drill rig to the analytic lab.
11.6 Comments on Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security
The Project's on-site sample preparation facility performs crushing and splits the samples down to 500-600 g sub-
samples. This process is effective in saving considerable sample shipment costs from site and speeding up turn-
around time from the commercial laboratories. The QA/QC programme has established that the on-site crushing
and  splitting  are  providing  material  for  subsequent  analysis  comparable  to  that  provided  by  major  commercial
sample  preparation  facilities.  Project  personnel  perform  the  sample  preparation  process,  but  IGC  personnel
including, Thomas Bowens, CPG and James Ashleman, LPG constantly monitor and manage the process. The
coarse reject material and the split core are retained on site and can be used for future check and due diligence
analyses.

The QA/QC programme has identified rare cases where sample-switching, or QC samples out of acceptable range
occur. Corrective actions have included having the lab re-run the questionable samples. Duplicate samples sent to
umpire laboratories do not show analytic bias or other issues with the Project's principal lab, Irgiredmet.
The Malmyzh Project sampling, sample preparation, and analytical procedures have been carried out in a manner
that meets accepted industry best practices. The chain of custody maintained sample integrity, and was secure and
well documented. The resulting Malmyzh analytical database is considered reliable, reproducible, and suitable for
resource estimation.

12 DATA VERIFICATION
12.1 Introduction
The author undertook two visits to Far East Russia, the first from 10-12th March 2015 when bad weather prevented
access to the site, and the second site visit, from 25-27th March 2015.
During the first visit, the Amur Minerals/IGC Khabarovsk offices were viewed, data analysed, and the core storage
facility visited in the city from where check core and pulp samples were collected, whilst for the second visit, the
Malmyzh site, sample preparation facility, core storage and field office were the focus.
The  aim  of  the  visit  was  to  review  the  geology,  mineralisation,  exploration  programmes,  drill  core,  sample
preparation facilities, terrain, access, infrastructure and overall project setting.
The  drill  holes  chosen  for  data  verification  included  those  holes  that  represented  the  main  mineralised  zones
present within the Valley, Freedom, Central and Flats deposits which in turn included mineralisation in hornfelsed
siltstone, diorite porphyry, sandstone, siltstone, recrystallised sandstone and breccia.
Data verification work involved:
•
•
•
Review and audit of sample database;
Site overview including sample preparation facilities;
Independent verification of 12 core samples, 12 pulp samples and 2 standard samples; and
•
QA/QC review of the drill hole assay data.
The site visit confirmed that the technical team is highly qualified and that the exploration programme undertaken
on site was robust.
12.2 Assay Database versus Lab Certificates
The Malmyzh Project has been managed in a very professional manner over the last few years and great care has
been taken with sample collection, preparation, analysis and data recording.
As an example of this, during the site visit, the author of this report randomly selected approximately 30 assay
values  of  gold  and  copper  from  the  different  deposits  in  the  assay  database  and  checked  these  against  to  the
original laboratory assay results.
The check found zero errors or discrepancies for the drill assay records, and clearly demonstrated the high quality
of the assay database. Therefore, WAI concludes that the current database is adequate for the Mineral Resource
estimate.

12.3 Site Overview
During the site visit, no exploration was taking place, with the result that WAI was not able to directly view logging
and  sample  preparation  methodologies.  However,  it  was  possible  to  verify  the  procedures  as  stipulated  by  the
Company and described elsewhere in this report.
The  camp  at  Malmyzh  is  well  established  with  offices,  mess  room  and  garaging  facilities  fabricated  from  sea
containers, and the accommodation units in gers, similar to yurts (Photo 12.1).
Samples from the field were brought to the camp for logging in a dedicated core log room which also had a good
display of reference lithologies mounted on the wall (Photo 12.2) to aid logging. The Company used a standard
logging sheet which follows industry best practice.
Core was marked up and then split using one of two diamond saws before being sent to the sample preparation
facilities. This had not been used for some time, but comprises a drying oven with racked shelving, two parallel
lines of a Rocklabs jaw crusher, which reduces the sample to 2mm, followed by sample reduction stages using a
sample splitter to produce a 600g laboratory split and a 600g duplicate. Equipment was cleaned with compressed
air between samples.

As  part  of  the  data  verification  process,  an  attempt  was  made  to  view  some  drill  collars  and  to  establish  their
position.  However,  due  to  very  heavy  snowfall  (over  1  m),  the  logistics  of  verifying  drill  collar  positions  proved
difficult, although it was possible to get to a few collars in the Valley area. In particular, hole AMM 102 was located
and verified (Photo 12.3).

12.4 Core Inspection & Storage
At the camp, core is stored in a dry, timber frame building (Photo 12.4), with core stacked in ordered piles, labelled
by hole. Boxes are well labelled with hole number, from and to and box number. In addition, sample numbers were
noted within the boxes as well as drill markers denoting depth.
WAI inspected a selection of drill holes that represented the main mineralised zones present within the Valley,
Freedom,  Central  and  Flats  deposits  (Table  12.1)  which  in  turn  included  mineralisation  in  hornfelsed  siltstone,
diorite porphyry, sandstone, siltstone, recrystallised sandstone and breccia.

Core  was  also  viewed  in  Khabarovsk  where  it  is  stored  in  a  large,  dry  warehouse.  From  here,  samples  were
collected for independent analysis (see below).
12.5 Independent Check Samples
12.5.1Independent Duplicate Core Samples
The author conducted independent verification of drill core sampling results during the site visit. As part of this
audit, 12 sample intervals were selected from nine core drill holes as being representative of the Project’s copper
and gold mineralisation in the Valley, Freedom, Central and Flats deposits.
Drill holes were chosen from each deposit as follows: Valley Deposit (AMM007, AMM016 and AMM017), Freedom
Deposit  (AMM037  and  AMM039),  Central  Deposit  (AMM023)  and  Flats  Deposit  (AMM001,  AMM003  and
AMM004). The intervals were chosen to provide a variety of rock types, styles of mineralisation, and importantly,
grade distributions.
For each intersection, the remaining ½ cores were placed in a heavy duty polythene bag with a sample tag noting
sample number, then placed inside of another similar bag which was also labelled with the sample number. These
were then sealed with cable ties (Photo 12.5).
The bagged samples were then sent by courier to the ALS laboratory in Chita and submitted to the same assay
procedures as the original samples which was fire assay for Au (Au-AA23) and aqua regia multi-element ICP (ME-
ICP41).

The assay results for the independent duplicate core samples checks are listed in Table 12.2. The author noted
that  all  results  are  returned  within  acceptable  control  limits  with  an  exception  of  Sample  ID  71190  (denoted  in
yellow in Table 12.2). Due to the generally very close correlation between original and check assays, WAI is of the
opinion  that  sample  ID  71190  is  a  spurious  outlier,  and  therefore  for  the  purposes  of  further  comparisons,  was
removed from the dataset.

The duplicate analysis for copper shows good correlation between the original sample results and the independent
sample  assays,  with  a  correlation  coefficient  of  0.89  (Figure  12.1).  The  original  samples  on  average  assayed
0.50%  versus  0.52%  copper  for  the  independent  samples,  which  corresponds  to  a  4%  difference.  Ranked  half

As a further check on the assay values, the author selected 12 pulp samples from each deposit as follows: Valley
Deposit (AMM152 and AMM114), Freedom Deposit (AMM56, AMM191 and AMM196), Central Deposit (AMM42
and AMM49) and Flats Deposit (AMM143 and AMM41).
Approximately 200g of pulp sample was placed in a heavy duty polythene bag, with a sample tag inside, which
was in turn placed inside a second bag with the sample number labelled on the outside. These were then fastened
with cable ties and submitted for assay at ALS Chita for the same assay procedure as the core samples.

12.5.4Independent Verification Results
Excluding  gold  core  duplicates,  correlation  exceeds  0.89  for  all  other  datasets.  Ranked  half  absolute  relative
difference (HARD) plots show that 90% or more of the data are within an absolute relative error of 10%, with the
exception of independent core duplicates for gold.
This is entirely to be expected given the gold distribution within the mineralisation and will be most prevalent within
higher grade gold samples where two half cores may well give significantly different assays.
However, this effect is somewhat ameliorated when a comparison of pulp duplicates is made as the fine grained
samples effectively smooth any grade inconsistencies.
Therefore, in the author’s opinion, the independent verification checks have been successful in demonstrating the
accuracy and robustness of the existing database.

13 MINERAL PROCESS AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
13.1 Introduction
Malmyzh  Project  mineralogical  studies  and  metallurgical  test  work  have  been  conducted  according  to  Russian
requirements by Irgiredmet Laboratories (Irkutsk). This Section 13 summarises the results of this work as provided
from OREOLL (2014) and internal IGC reports (2014).
Irgiredmet  did  test  work  on  four  composites  of  multiple  drill  core  samples,  of  which  three  represented  sulphide
copper-gold mineralisation 1) MET-35-1 from Central, 2) ТП–02-S from Valley, and 3) ТП–03-S from Freedom, and
a  fourth  was  of  oxide  mineralisation  4)  ТП–04-Ox  from  Valley  and  Freedom.  No  metallurgical  test  work  was
conducted on Flats material.
13.2 Mineralogical Characterisation
Descriptions of the metallurgical samples and their copper and gold grades from drilling are as follows (refer to
Photo 13.1):
•
•
•
•
MET-35-1: diorite porphyry from Central (0.45% Cu, 0.17 g/t Au).
ТП–02-S: hornfels from Valley (0.42% Cu, 0.18 g/t Au).
ТП–03-S: diorite porphyry from Freedom (0.38% Cu, 0.32 g/t Au).
ТП–04-0x: Composite oxidised material from Valley and Freedom (0.20% Cu, 0.22 g/t Au).
In general, the sulphide minerals noted include pyrite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, bornite and covellite, that occur as
disseminations and in veinlets.
A  more  detailed  accounting  of  the  mineralogical  composition  of  the  samples  was  determined  utilising  a
combination of X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and electronic scanning microscopy (Table 13.1).
The sulphide samples for a given deposit were composited from a mixture of rock and alteration types, as well as
grade ranges to represent "average mineralisation" for each deposit. The composited samples broadly represent
the  Malmyzh  copper-gold  mineralisation  as  currently  defined,  but  geometallurgical  work  to  test  for  variability  of
different rock, alteration, and mineralisation types had not yet been done.
Nevertheless, the samples do provide a basis for initial metallurgical test work for the current stage of assessment.
The work on the oxide sample consisted of preliminary flotation and other testing. However, the thin oxide zones
represent minor tonnages at Valley, Central, Freedom, and Flats and were considered as a waste domain during
resource modelling. The oxide metallurgical work is not considered further in this report.

13.3 Metallurgical Testwork
The metallurgical work focused on crushing, grinding and flotation testing of the sulphide composite samples, each
weighing ~110-150 kg. The proposed flowsheet included a first stage SAG crush and a second stage ball mill
grind.  Irgiredmet's  reporting  of  the  Bond  Abrasion  Index  and  Bond  Work  Index  physical  properties  of  the
mineralised material falls within expected norms (Table 13.2).

The  recovery  testwork  was  conducted  on  material  crushed  and  ground  to  a  -1  mm  size  (p85-90%).  Initially,  a
flotation scheme with five cleaner steps was designed from work conducted on the Central sulphide sample in
2012. Subsequently in 2013, the Valley and Freedom sulphide samples were submitted for metallurgical testing
using the same flotation scenario developed for Central. The resulting metallurgical recoveries for copper and gold
are summarised in Table 13.3.

This initial processing scheme resulted in average recoveries of 94.8% for copper and 71.8% for gold, but yielded
low  concentrate  copper  grades  for  Central  (15.1%),  and  very  low  concentrate  grades  (<  8%)  for  Freedom  and
Valley.  This  led  to  two  additional  tests  on  the  Valley  and  Freedom  samples  using  alternative  approaches  to
increase the concentrate grades.
The  first  test  used  different  reagents  and  was  based  upon  three  cleaner  stages;  the  recovery  results  are
summarised in Table 13.4. This scheme did not significantly improve the copper concentrate grades (< 9%), and
decreased the overall copper recoveries whilst significantly reducing the gold recoveries for Freedom.

The second flotation test was with two cleaner steps, and additional adjustments of reagents, pH, etc. The results
of  this  metallurgical  testwork  significantly  upgraded  the  copper  concentrate  grades  (34.4%  Valley,  26.3%
Freedom),  but  at  the  expense  of  reducing  the  gold  recovery.  The  results  of  this  metallurgical  testing  are
summarised in Table 13.5.

Irgiredment's metallurgical testwork has demonstrated that flotation of Malmyzh mineralised sulphide material can
yield  acceptable  copper  recoveries  and  concentrate  grades.  However,  this  early  stage  work  has  yet  to  be
optimised for gold recoveries, and further studies need to be conducted. One approach to improve gold recovery
could include an added process of cyanide leaching of the high pyrite tails.
13.4 Comments on Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
Given the current level of understanding, a conceptual flow sheet for mineral processing could be based upon the
following known characteristics of Malmyzh copper-gold mineralised material:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The host rocks are altered diorite porphyries and hornfelsed siliciclastics.
Mineralisation occurs principally as chalcopyrite, but chalcocite, bornite and covellite can also be
present.
Copper is finely dispersed, and there is no significant free gold.
Gold reports with copper and pyrite.
Preliminary testwork indicates that flotation can yield an acceptable copper concentrate grade.
There are no complex minerals or penalty elements.
Oxide material should be considered in a separate processing study utilising hydrometallurgical
methods.
Principal steps for flotation processing suggested at this stage include:
•
•
•
•
Crush (SAG mill) and grind (ball mill).
Rougher flotation stage - maximise copper-gold extraction at coarse grind.
Re-grind/cleaner flotation stages - grind smaller volumes to fine sizes.
Cyanide leach the cleaner flotation tails to improve gold recovery.
This conceptual processing scenario is outlined in Figure 13.1.

Irgiredmet's work suggests that standard crushing, grinding, and flotation processing methods, with project specific
adjustments such as cyanidation of tails to improve gold recovery, could be beneficially applied to the Malmyzh
mineralised material. At this stage of the Project's evaluation, and until more testwork is conducted, it is reasonable
to  assume  that  copper  recoveries  will  be  over  90%,  and  that  gold  recoveries  will  be  in  the  range  of  70%.  It  is
recommended that further metallurgical testing be conducted to optimise copper-gold recoveries.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
14.1 Introduction
The Malmyzh mineral resource estimation process was a collaborative effort between WAI and IGC geologists.
IGC provided WAI with Project exploration databases that included topography, drilling, density measurements,
and geological interpretations. In addition, IGC provided preliminary block models that were reviewed by WAI, and
adjusted and refined to produce the final mineral resource block models. The block model estimates, selection of
metal prices, costs, metallurgical recoveries, copper equivalent calculations, cut-off determinations, optimised open
pit generation, and mineral resource classification, verification and reporting were completed under the supervision
of the author of this report, WAI's Managing Director, Dr Phil Newall.
The  software  used  to  estimate,  verify,  and  report  the  Malmyzh  mineral  resources  included  LeapFrog,  Vulcan,
Snowden Supervisor, Datamine, and NPV Scheduler. The resulting mineral resource estimates meet the National
Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (“NI 43-
101”) and Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) definition standards.
The Malmyzh geologic and resource models are supported by the author’s independent checks and assessment of
the  drill  data,  QA/QC  results,  and  geologic  interpretation  of  the  porphyry  copper-gold  mineralised  porphyry
deposits.
Drill Hole Database
Drill Hole Database
14.2
The Malmyzh geologic models and resource estimates were based upon the drill hole database provided by IGC.
The database includes 211 holes and over 70,600 m of core drilling, details of which are described in Section 10 of
this  report.  The  data  provided  included:  1)  drill  collars  in  UTM  metres,  2)  down-hole  survey  records,  3)  assays
consisting of copper, gold and multi-element geochemistry, and 4) geologic logs.
The Malmyzh Joint Venture has followed CIM Best Practice guidelines for drilling, sampling, assaying, QA/QC,
and internal database verification. The veracity of the drill database has been independently verified. As a result,
the quality of the drill database used to estimate the Malmyzh resources is judged to be reliable, accurate, and
appropriate  for  mineral  resource  estimation.  Figure  14.1  is  a  map  representing  the  property-wide  drill  hole
locations.
Mineral resources were estimated for the Valley, Central, Freedom Southeast, and Flats deposits from a subset of
the Project drilling:

These four deposits were systematically drilled on 200 by 200 m grids, with select in-fill holes to fulfill Russian
reporting requirements. The Freedom NW prospect was drilled on a 200 by 400 m grid, and was evaluated as a
prospect for follow-up exploration as discussed in Section 14.11.
14.3 Topographic Surface Model
The Malmyzh topographic surface was based on contours that were photogrammetrically produced at 1 m (minor)
and  5  m  (major)  contour  intervals  from  Geoeye-1  stereo  satellite  imagery.  The  imagery  resulted  from  a  custom
tasking of the satellite. The collection date was October 6, 2011 which was both cloud and snow free, providing a 1
m resolution imagery base for Project mapping purposes. The orthorectification was controlled by placing DGPS
surveyed ground panels across the property in order to provide precise tie points. The final planimetric contours
were produced for a "bald earth" model by compensating for tree cover over the property.
14.4 Geologic and Mineralised Domain Models
The  Valley,  Central,  Freedom,  and  Flats  geologic  and  mineralised  domain  models  were  principally  developed
from:  a)  logged  lithology,  alteration,  and  structure,  and  b)  copper  (gold)  assays.  In  addition,  down-hole  multi-
element geochemistry was reviewed to provide further context for defining the porphyry system domains. The data
were integrated to develop models of a) overburden, b) oxide-transition-sulphide zones, c) diorite porphyry bodies,
d) copper-gold mineralised envelopes and e) structures that truncated mineralisation.

IGC provided cross sectional interpretations for lithology and generalised alteration and structure on the N40°W
oriented, 200 m spaced drill fences for each deposit. These interpretations were used to guide construction of 3D
models of overburden and diorite porphyry, with the hornfels units assigned outside of these domains. In addition,
surfaces representing oxide, transition, and sulphide mineralisation were modeled from the logged geology.
Exploratory data analysis of logged geology and alteration was conducted on the drill hole database. From this
work, it was concluded that given the current drill spacing and relatively early stage of exploration assessment, that
IGC's cross sections combined with copper and gold assay distributions provided the best approach to defining
domains of porphyry copper-gold mineralisation for constraining grade estimation.
The frequency distributions were reviewed with Log10 histograms, probability plots, and univariate statistics (Table
14.1 and Figure 14.2). In general, the histograms are notable as distinct log symmetric distributions representing a
majority  of  the  population,  with  a  second  significant  population  defined  by  a  negative  tail  representing  weakly
altered and mineralised holes drilled on the periphery of the porphyry deposits. Positive tail outlier populations are
apparent, but minimal for Central (deep quartz-feldspar UST zone) and Freedom (higher-grade Au in postulated
cross-cutting features). At Flats, there are notable high-grade gold outliers that form a positive tail (principally from
the diorite porphyry-hornfels contact).

For all four deposits, the main bodies of porphyry alteration and mineralisation generally correspond to the 0.1%
copper  threshold.  Gold  mineralisation  variably  occurs  within  the  0.1%  copper  envelopes,  typically  forming
cohesive zones at a level of 0.05 -0.10 g/t Au. As a result, a 0.1% copper threshold was selected as a guideline to
define the mineralised domains at Valley, Central, Freedom, and Flats, with minor adjustments to include higher
gold grades at the margins of the systems.

14.5 Compositing, Mineralised Domain Models, and Cap Grades
Run length composites were calculated from the drill assay database at a 10 m interval length, representing an
assumed bench height for a potential open pit mining operation. The nominal sample length was 2 m for all Project
drilling, and as a result the composites are typically averaged from five drill intervals.
The drill composites and geologic sections were used to construct the porphyry mineralised domain solid models
for Valley, Central, Freedom, and Flats. Initially 0.1% grade shell solids were generated with anisotropies defined
by the overall strike and dip geologic controls for each deposit. The grade shells were then sliced as polygons on
25-50 m sections, and compared to the interpreted geologic sections. The polygons were then adjusted to reflect
the trends of the diorite porphyry-hornfels contacts, as well as generalised interpretations of alteration envelopes
from  the  cross  sections.  These  manually  adjusted  polygons  were  used  to  control  the  generation  of  the  final
porphyry  copper-gold  mineralised  domains  solid  models,  and  to  code  the  assay  composites  in  preparation  for
further analysis and block modeling (Figure 14.3).
The  composite  frequency  distributions  for  the  copper-gold  mineralised  zones  at  Valley,  Central,  Freedom,  and
Flats were characterised with univariate statistical analysis and Log10 histograms (Table 14.2 and Figure 14.4).
There are low coefficients of variation for copper, and higher coefficients of variation for gold. The mineralisation in
the Malmyzh porphyry deposits appears consistent as defined by the mineralised domain envelopes, and reflected
in the composite statistics.

From the composite histograms, the copper-gold domains generally define symmetric Log10 distributions. All four
deposits have negative tail sub-populations that represent both internal dilution, as well as the inclusion of lower
grades  peripheral  to  the  porphyry  centres.  The  Valley  mineralised  domain  in  particular  has  "lognormal"
distributions for both copper and gold, suggesting a single overall population, excepting a small number of higher-
grade outliers. For Central, there are clearly polymodal distributions composed of higher grade quartz-feldspar-
UST related mineralisation, a main population representing the potassically altered "core" of the system, and lower
grades representing the margins of the system. Freedom is characterised by overall Log10 symmetric populations
for both copper and gold, with positive tails representing cross-cutting higher grade zones. The Flats deposit has a
higher grade positive tail, ascribed to the porphyry-hornfels contact, with a negatively skewed main population.
In order to restrict the influence of higher-grade outliers, the Log10 frequency distributions were reviewed and cap
grades  determined.  In  the  case  of  Central,  the  "UST"  zone  was  broken  out  as  a  distinctive  geologic  domain,
modelled separately, and no cap grade applied. However, cap grades were determined for Central's main zone of
copper-gold porphyry mineralisation. The copper and gold cap grades accounted for less than 0.5% (i.e., <½%) of
the composite populations, except for Flats where 1.2% of the gold composites were capped. A summary of the
cap grades is:
•
•
•
•
0.85% copper and 0.62 g/t gold
Valley:
0.80% copper and 0.50 g/t gold
Central :
Freedom: 1.00% copper and 1.50 g/t gold
Flats:
0.52% copper and 0.75 g/t gold
Given the symmetric distributions within the mineralised domains, the relatively low coefficients of variation, and
the capped composite outliers, the copper-gold mineralised domains and the composites contained therein provide
a basis for block model grade estimation.

14.6 Correlograms and Variography
Variography,  in  the  form  of  correlogram  analysis,  was  conducted  on  the  10  m  composites  for  the  copper-gold
mineralised domains. The principal advantage of the correlogram over the variogram is that it renders a smoother,
more coherent structure for fitting a semivariogram model. Correlogram (autocorrelation) studies are often referred
to as variography due to the traditional emphasis on the variogram; this use of terminology is hereby adopted for
subsequent discussion.
Initially, omni-directional correlograms were calculated for the mineralised zones at Valley, Central, Freedom and
Flats.  These  correlograms  provided  a  first-pass  assessment  of  the  spatial  continuity  of  mineralisation  by
considering all directions of sample pairs simultaneously, including down-hole composite pair distances that start
at  10  m  as  opposed  to  the  200  m  distances  of  the  nominal  drill  grid  spacing.  The  correlograms  and  the
corresponding double spherical model parameters are given in Table 14.3, Table 14.4 and Figure 14.5.

The four resource deposits have nugget to sill ratios for copper and gold that range from 15-30%, highlighting that
over two-thirds of the variance has a spatial component, with the balance of the variance due to ‘nugget effect’.
This relatively low nugget effect reflects the general consistency of the copper-gold zones at the deposit scale.
The primary model ranges (i.e., Range 1) are similar for copper and gold, and vary from 110 m at Flats to 200 m at
Valley, and the secondary ranges (i.e., Range 2) vary from 225 m at Flats to 475 m at Valley. Valley's long ranges
reflect the relative consistency of the mineralisation observed in the diorite porphyry and hornfels host rocks, as
well as the relatively large size of this well-developed porphyry system. In contrast, at Flats, which is the smallest
deposit at Malmyzh, an important local control on mineralisation is the diorite porphyry-hornfels contact which has
restricted continuity and contributes to the shorter ranges. The ranges for Central and Freedom are similar to each
other (i.e., Range 1 from 125-150 m, and Range 2 from 275-300 m), and intermediate in length as compared to
Valley (long) and Flats (short).

The  definition  of  the  omni-directional  correlogram  parameters  provided  a  basis  for  proceeding  with  directional
correlogram analysis. The Valley and Central correlograms exhibited variable degrees of spatial continuity in the
strike  and  down-dip  direction,  but  the  correlograms  were  "noisey",  and  for  Central  in  particular,  the  model
structures were poorly defined. The directional copper and gold correlograms for Freedom and Flats did not define
readily apparent spatial continuities that could be confidently fit with models.
Notwithstanding, from the correlogram work it is clear that there is overall spatial continuity of the porphyry deposits
as given from the omni-directional models. However, much of the spatial variance and correlogram structure is
given at ranges of 150-200 m, which is at or less than the drill grid spacing. In large measure this explains the
difficulty in defining the directional correlogram models. As a result, the correlogram exercise was only useful for
generally  confirming  overall  ranges  of  grade  continuity  given  the  drill  density  at  this  stage  of  the  Project's
evaluation.
14.7 Block Model Definitions
The  Malmyzh  block  models  were  constructed  to  cover  the  extent  of  the  copper-gold  mineralised  domains  for
Valley, Central, Freedom, and Flats. The models were oriented parallel to the axes of the Project’s UTM coordinate
grid with a 25 m x 25 m x 10 m (x, y, z) parent block size, and a 12.5 m x 12.5 m x 5 m sub-block size. The parent
block  dimensions  are  based  on  the  current  drill  hole  spacing  and  a  selective  mining  unit  size  suitable  for  a
potential open pit operation. The sub-blocking scheme allowed a higher degree of precision in assigning geologic
codes to blocks at solid model contacts. The parameters used for defining the block model extents are given in
Table 14.5.

There were a number of additional variables included in the block model definitions (i.e., number of drill holes to
estimate  a  block,  number  of  composites  to  estimate  a  block,  etc.)  that  were  used  for  block  model  interpolation
assessment, model checks, etc.
14.8 Specific Gravity Measurements and Density Assignments
IGC provided a database of specific gravity measurements for various rock types. The specific gravity work was
conducted on site, using a wax coated procedure setup by Chief Geologist, J.C. Ashleman. In total, there were over
2,300 measurements. After review of the database statistics (i.e., min, max, median, and average), and removing
non-representative outliers, the following specific gravity values were selected:
•
All deposits:
2.45 for oxide material.
•
•
•
•
Valley deposit: 2.65 for diorite porphyry and 2.64 for hornfels.
Central deposit: 2.71 for diorite porphyry and 2.66 for hornfels.
Freedom
deposit:
Flats deposit:
2.72 for diorite porphyry and 2.66 for hornfels.
2.69 for all rocks types.
Specific  gravity  for  unconsolidated  sediments  was  not  practical  to  measure,  and  as  a  result  a  Project  wide
assignment of 2.00 was used for overburden blocks.
14.9 Grade Estimation, Resource Classification and Reporting, and Model Validation
14.9.1Grade Estimation
Copper  and  gold  grades  were  estimated  for  the  Valley,  Central,  Freedom  Southeast,  and  Flats  deposits  with
inverse  distance  to  the  third  power  ("IDW").  This  is  a  standard  interpolation  technique,  and  can  be  a  good
alternative to ordinary kriging. This is especially so considering the current drill hole spacing and the challenge of
confidently defining directional correlogram models as discussed in Section 14.6.
The search ellipsoids were oriented according to the northeast striking and southwest dipping geologic controls
evident at the deposit scale. The omni-directional correlogram ranges were used as a general guideline for the
search  ellipsoid  distances.  Anisotropic  weighting  factors  were  applied  to  control  estimations  for  Freedom
(postulated cross-cutting higher grade) and Flats (diorite porphyry-hornfels contact high grade), whereas at Valley
and Central they were not. Two estimation passes were conducted, with the first pass restricted to, or just over the
nominal drill grid spacing. The second pass search distances were extended to fill-in blocks along the margins of
the deposits that were unestimated from the first pass.
A summary of the IDW search ellipsoid parameters is given in Table 14.6.

The  10  m  drill  composites  within  the  porphyry  mineralised  sulphide/transition  domain  models  were  used  for
resource  estimation.  The  blocks  estimated  were  also  restricted  to  the  mineralised  domains.  These  restrictions
controlled the "smearing" or extrapolation of grades into wall rock peripheral to the porphyry systems.
Further restrictions for higher-grade composites were imposed at Central, Freedom Southeast, and Flats. In the
case  of  Central,  a  separate  modelling  domain  for  the  deep  zone  of  quartz-feldspar  alteration  and  UST  texture
development was imposed; the impact of this zone on the resource was minimal (i.e., < 0.05% of the tonnes) and is
more of interest from an exploration point of view. For Freedom and Flats, the influence of geologically distinct
"high grade" composites (defined at the cap grade) was confined by search ellipsoid axes reduced to 50% of the
first pass search range. At Freedom Southeast, this search range restriction had minimal impact, as less than 0.5%
of  the  composites  were  affected.  At  Flats,  1.2%  of  the  gold  composites  had  restricted  searches  to  control  the
influence of the outlier grades.
The  number  of  composites  to  estimate  a  block  was  set  to  a  minimum  of  three  and  a  maximum  of  twelve.  A
maximum of five composites was allowed from a single drill hole. The minimum and maximum composite criteria
ensured that block grades were typically estimated with 2-4 drill holes, while maintaining strong local control from
the nearest hole.
In addition, blocks in the thin oxide zones overlying the sulphide deposits were also estimated, but not included as
resources. Although oxide is currently considered to be waste, the oxide zone estimates provided a more complete
geological characterisation of the copper-gold distributions for each deposit. Search ellipsoids oriented parallel to
the  general  topographic  slope  for  a  given  deposit  were  used,  along  with  more  relaxed  estimation  criteria  (i.e.,
minimum of 1 composite for estimation, extended ranges, etc.) in order to fill in blocks from a limited number of
oxide composites.
14.9.2Resource Classification and Optimised Open Pits
14.9.2.1Preliminary In Situ Classification
The Malmyzh mineral resources were classified to reflect several factors that influenced the confidence in, and
risks to, the estimates. These factors principally include the confidence of grade and tonnage estimates relative to
the current drill hole spacing and the early stage of metallurgical characterisation.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
At the broad deposit and global in situ scale, the porphyry copper-gold mineralisation is relatively continuous, yet
there are localised controls evident that cannot be confidently defined at a 200 m spacing. Moreover, at Freedom
complexities precluded the development of a coherent, 3D reconcilable model of the geology. Valley has the most
continuous styles of copper-gold mineralisation, including potassically altered hornfels host rocks that are relatively
elevated in copper and gold. However, the alteration logs were sometimes inconsistent in key areas, and it was not
practical to construct alteration models to constrain grade estimation. Industry-wide, such inconsistencies are more
common than not for early stage exploration projects such as Malmyzh.
The metallurgical testwork described in Section 13 underscores the critical necessity to develop a processing flow
sheet that will establish confidence not only in copper recoveries, but as well gold recoveries. The testwork does
present  a  reasonable  range  of  copper  recoveries,  although  the  gold  recoveries  remain  uncertain.  Also,  the
geometallurgical characterisation of different types of mineralised material (i.e., high versus low pyrite, etc.) has yet
to be determined.
In consideration of the foregoing, the Malmyzh in situ estimates were all preliminarily determined to be candidates
for classification as Inferred resources.
14.9.2.2Final Open Pit Constrained Classification
In order to meet the criteria for "reasonable prospects for economic extraction", the Malmyzh in situ resource block
models  were  constrained  by  Lerchs-Grossman  ("LG")  optimised  open  pit  configurations  for  final  resource
classification.  The  LG  open  pit  parameters  were  based  upon  metal  prices,  costs,  and  metallurgical  recoveries
taken from examples of potentially similar operations, as well as independent technical assessments conducted
within the Russian Federation.
In preparation for LG pit optimisation and resource reporting, the sub-blocked models were regularised to blocks
with  dimensions  of  25  x  25  x  15  m  (X  by  Y  by  Z).  The  regularised  block  models  more  accurately  represent  a
potential selective mining unit size that includes both internal and external edge dilution that would be encountered
during mining.
The input parameters for LG open pit generation included:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
Copper price of $3.25/lb,
Gold price of $1,400/oz,

Mining cost adjustment of $0.03/tonne/bench,
Processing cost of $7/tonne,

THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The LG open pit metal prices and metallurgical recoveries were also used as a basis for the copper equivalent
calculation of CuEq = Cu % + (Au g/t x 0.5). For reference, the detailed CuEq calculation is given below:
CuEq% = Cu % + (Au g/t x factor), where the factor is defined as:
(($1400/oz Au) x (1 oz/31.1035 g)) ÷ (($3.25/lb Cu) x (1 lb/453.592 g)) x ((1 %) ÷ (10,000 g/t)) x ((70% Au rec) ÷
(90% Cu rec)).
The metal prices were based on long term consensus forecasts, and include some upside to reflect reasonable
prospects for eventual extraction, which is a typical industry approach for mineral resources. Further, these are
generally in line with industry assumptions for resource reporting current as of the effective date of this report.
The mining, processing, and G&A costs used are consistent with examples of similar scale porphyry copper (gold)
projects. The mining cost adjustment of $0.03/tonne/bench is applied to each successively LG "mined" level in the
resource  open  pit,  and  recognises  the  additional  expense  associated  with  hauling  material  from  what  could
eventually be relatively deep open pits.
The metallurgical studies (see Section 13) suggest that copper recoveries could be higher than 90%. The 70%
gold  recovery  is  marginally  lower  than  reported  from  the  first  set  of  flotation  tests  for  Central,  but  higher  than
reported  from  subsequent  testing  for  Valley  and  Freedom.  However,  none  of  the  metallurgical  processing
scenarios included a potential step of cyanide leaching of tails to enhance gold recoveries. At this early stage of
the Project's evaluation, it is reasonable to assume copper recoveries of 90% and gold recoveries of 70% until
further metallurgical testing is conducted.

14.9.3Resource Reporting
WAI's statement of the Malmyzh Inferred resources are reported for the Valley, Central, Freedom Southeast, and
Flats block models within the LG open pits at a 0.30% copper equivalent cut-off (Table 14.7, Table 14.8 and Figure
14.7). The 0.30% copper equivalent (CuEq) cut-off is appropriate for a potential open pit operation in consideration
of  the  metal  price,  recovery,  and  operating  cost  assumptions,  as  well  as  comparison  with  similar  deposits  that
occur  worldwide.  The  Inferred  resources  consist  of  sulphide/transition  mineralisation,  with  sulphide  material
representing over 96% of the tonnes.

The principal variables used for reporting include: estimated copper grades in percent (%) and gold in grams/tonne
(g/t), calculated copper equivalent in percent, tonnage reported as metric tonnes, contained copper equivalent and
copper  in  metric  tonnes  and  pounds,  and  contained  gold  in  troy  ounces.  All  figures  are  rounded  to  reflect  the
relative accuracy of the estimates, and the mineral resources are given on a 100% basis, with 51% attributable to
IGC.  Note  that  totals  may  not  sum  to  100%  due  to  rounding;  these  rounding  effects  are  not  considered  to  be
material.
The Malmyzh mineral resource estimates, whilst based on broadly spaced drill holes, are considered by WAI to be
robust, though subject to revision in the future. In-fill drilling may lead to the delineation of discrete higher grade
zones of copper-gold mineralisation, and will provide additional confidence for resource estimation.
The Malmyzh Inferred mineral resources were tabulated at a range of cut-offs as given in Table 14.8 above and
represented as a grade-tonnage chart in Figure 14.8.

In  total,  the  Inferred  resources  represent  the  copper-gold  mineralisation  of  an  important  porphyry  district  as
currently represented by four separate deposits. The tonnes and grades at the various cutoffs underscore that there
are significant tonnages of higher grade copper-gold material available in these deposits.
14.9.4Resource Model Validation
The estimated block model estimates for Valley, Central, Freedom, and Flats were verified by visual and statistical
methods. Copper and gold block grades were compared with drill hole composites on cross and long section, as
well as by bench level. From this review, there is a close correspondence between the composite grades and the
estimated block grades. Cross section examples are illustrated for the four resource deposits in Section 14.10 of
this report.
Also, nearest neighbour block models were estimated for Valley, Central, Freedom Southeast, and Flats in order to
check  for  potential  global  biases  in  the  estimated  copper  and  gold  grades.  A  global  comparison  between  the
Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) resource grades and nearest neighbour (NN) grades at a zero cut-off was within
1.3% for both copper and gold, which is in close correspondence. The comparisons for copper ranged from within
0.0% (Flats) to 1.8% (Valley). For gold, the IDW and NN average grades ranged from within 0.8% (Valley) to 2.6%
(Central and Flats). The comparisons between the IDW models and NN models at a zero cut-off establish that the
Malmyzh Inferred resource estimates are globally unbiased.
As a further measure of resource model validation, Swath plots by level for copper and gold were generated for the
four resource deposits. Examples for Valley are given in Figure 14.9.

the drill hole copper and gold grades.

Discussion of Malmyzh Resources
Discussion of Malmyzh Resources
14.10.1Valley Resource
The Valley deposit is the largest, most well-developed porphyry system in the Malmyzh district, with mineralisation
hosted in hornfels and diorite porphyry. At the 0.30% CuEq cut-off, the Inferred resources account for 60% of the
total tonnes, 60% of the contained copper tonnes, and just under 54% of the contained gold ounces. Although
mineralisation has been closed off laterally, Valley remains open at depth. The LG resource open pit flattens at the
bottom  where  the  mineralised  domain  was  limited  by  the  depth  of  current  drilling.  Also  important  to  note  are
significant tonnages of higher grade copper-gold mineralisation hosted in the potassically altered hornfels on the
southeastern flank of the deposit that occur from near-surface to depths of ~150-250 m (Table 14.9, Figure 14.10,
and Figure 14.11).

14.10.3Freedom Southeast Resource
Freedom Southeast is a large, geologically complex deposit with mineralisation hosted in diorite porphyries, multi-
stage  breccias,  and  hornfels  units,  and  has  high  Au:Cu  ratios.  At  the  0.30%  CuEq  cutoff,  the  Inferred  resource
accounts for 20% of the total tonnes, 20% of the contained copper tonnes, and 29% of the contained gold ounces.
The mineralising controls at Freedom are poorly understood, but there are cross-cutting, intensely altered, higher
grade copper-gold zones within the system's overall alteration assemblage (Table 14.11, Figure 14.14 and Figure
14.15). Additional drilling is required to follow-up and geologically define these higher grade zones.

14.10.4Flats Resource
The Flats deposit is the smallest of the porphyry deposits at Malmyzh, accounting for 7% of the Inferred resource
tonnes,  5%  of  the  contained  copper,  and  9%  of  the  contained  gold  ounces  at  the  0.30%  CuEq  cut-off.  Flats  is
relatively enriched in gold, but has low to moderate copper grades (Table 14.12, Figure 14.16 and Figure 14.17).
It  is  known  that  the  diorite  porphyry-hornfels  contact  locally  hosts  higher-grade  gold,  but  the  geometries  and
continuities of these zones is undefined with the current broad spaced drilling. Of note was the diligent effort taken
during resource estimation to reduce the influence of these zones by capping and limiting the influence of high
grade composites. As an example of the effect of these limitations, the high grade intercept illustrated at depth in
Figure  14.17  and  the  near-by  block  grades  were  constrained  and  fall  below  the  LG  Inferred  resource  pit.  The
system remains open to depth.

14.11Discussion of Freedom Northwest Prospect
The Freedom deposit is, as discussed in Sections 7.4.4 and 10.5.3, as well as elsewhere in this report, comprised
of  two  distinct  northeast  trending  bodies  of  copper-gold  mineralisation.  Freedom  Southeast  has  an  Inferred
resource as described in Section 14.10.3, but there is also drilled mineralisation on 200 x 400 m fences at the
Freedom Northwest (NW) prospect. The styles of alteration and mineralisation are similar between Freedom NW
and  SE.  Although  the  Freedom  NW  prospect  is  not  included  as  an  Inferred  resource,  it  has  sufficient  geologic
(interpretation  on  cross  sections)  and  drill  control  (six  holes)  to  be  defined  as  a  “target  for  further  exploration”
according to NI 43-101 (2.3(2),(a -b))1, and as given in Table 14.13.

1  The  potential  quantity  and  grade  for  the  Freedom  NW  prospect  is  conceptual  in  nature,  as  there  has  been
insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being
delineated as a mineral resource.
The tonnage and grade ranges in Table 14.13 reflect the uncertainty due to the widely spaced drill pattern, but also
highlight the upside potential of this prospect that requires further drilling.
14.12Comments on Mineral Resources
The Malmyzh Inferred resource estimates are considered to be robust given the current drilling, and represent the
copper-gold mineralisation at the Valley, Freedom, Central, and Flats deposits. The tonnes and grades at various
cut-offs  underscore  that  there  are  significant  Inferred  resource  tonnages  of  higher  grade  copper-gold  material
potentially available in these deposits. Follow-up drilling will provide additional confidence for resource estimation,
and may lead to the delineation and definition of discrete higher grade copper-gold zones.
Of note, during the course of data review at Valley the author noted anomalous Mo grades (i.e., 20-100 ppm) in the
shallow hornfels zone. Although the absolute Mo grades are low, and have yet to be given consideration, it may be
worth further review with additional drilling to model Mo as a possible by-product to accompany the copper-gold
credits.
At this Inferred resource stage of the Malmyzh Project's evaluation, there are various risk factors that need to be
assessed.  Significant  in-fill  drilling  and  revised  geologic  models  will  be  required  to  fully  define  the  extents  of
mineralisation.  Additional  metallurgical  testwork  is  needed  to  definitively  establish  both  the  copper  and  gold
recoveries. Metal prices have continued to recede over the past year, and further reductions could adversely affect
project  economics.  The  author  is  generally  aware  that  due  to  the  Project's  location,  and  the  associated
hydrographic  and  climatic  conditions,  the  need  for  open  pit  de-watering  must  be  taken  into  account  with  more
advanced  studies.  Finally,  from  the  permitting  and  legal  vantage,  it  is  an  absolute  requirement  that  the  Project
receive Russian Federation SIL approval in order to move forward, as discussed in Section 4.3 of this report.
The author emphasises that mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic
viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into a mineral reserve.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES
The Malmyzh Project is a grassroots exploration discovery, and there are no adjacent properties. Although the
region  is  situated  in  a  geologic  setting  favourable  for  the  development  of  porphyry  copper-gold  deposits,  as
discussed  in  Section  7.2,  it  has  remained  under-explored  relative  to  its  prospectivity.  This  makes  the  Malmyzh
district-scale discovery all the more significant in what may develop into an emerging copper-gold porphyry belt.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
The Russian Federation has stringent requirements for exploring and developing mineral properties. These rules,
regulations, and laws cover a comprehensive spectrum of project related work. The Malmyzh Joint Venture has
diligently met these conditions, whilst also adhering to NI 43-101 requirements and CIM best practice standards.
IGC  has  advised  that  the  Malmyzh  Joint  Venture,  through  its  Russian  subsidiary  Amur  Minerals  LLC,  received
approval of the “official on balance C1+C2 reserves” from the GKZ (State Reserves Committee), the government
agency authorised to approve resources and reserves in the Russian Federation (EMX news release, May 26,
2015).  The  Malmyzh  “official  government  approved  reserves”  were  estimated  according  to  the  rules  and
regulations of the Russian Federation, and are not the same as reserves under NI 43-101. These "reserves" do not
meet NI 43-101 or CIM requirements for resource or reserve reporting, and accordingly the results are not given in
this  report.  However,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  them  as  their  establishment  met  Russian  requirements  for
keeping  the  Malmyzh  licenses  in  good  standing,  and  triggered  additional  requirements  for  moving  the  Project
forward.
The  GKZ  “official  reserves”  are  now  listed  and  added  to  the  “State  Balance  of  Reserves”  of  the  Russian
Federation. The GKZ C1+C2 "on balance reserves" of copper and gold exceed thresholds that classify Malmyzh as
a  "strategically  significant"  mineral  deposit  under  the  Strategic  Industries  Law,  or  "SIL"  (see  Section  4.3).  SIL
requires that the Joint Venture receive approval through the relevant Russian Federation agencies to continue with
its Malmyzh exploration and development programmes.
In addition, the "prospecting phase" of the Malmyzh license was completed with the approval and acceptance of
the  Project's  TEO  "preliminary  conditions"  report,  which  was  based  upon  the  GKZ  "reserves".  Contingent  on
receiving SIL approval, the Project will be required to move forward according to an "advanced exploration" work
programme  designed  by  the  Joint  Venture,  and  approved  by  the  relevant  Russian  Federation  agencies.  The
advanced  exploration  programme  has  not  yet  been  formulated,  but  generally  it  will  include  in-fill  drilling  and
advanced technical studies. This work will culminate in completion of a TEO "permanent conditions" report as a
precursor to eventual mine development (T. Bowens, personal communication, 2015).

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
The 152.8 km2 Malmyzh Project hosts porphyry deposits, prospects, and targets that occur within a district-scale 16
by  5  km  intrusive  corridor  concealed  beneath  a  shallow  cover  of  alluvium,  colluvium,  and  soil.  Mineralisation
extends from shallow subcrop (~1 to 50 m) to greater than 400 to 600 m depth. The porphyry centres occur as
Cretaceous-age  diorite  porphyry  stocks  that  intruded  and  hornfels-altered  siltstone  and  sandstone  sedimentary
sequences.  Copper-gold  mineralisation  occurs  in  the  porphyry  intrusives,  as  well  as  in  the  hornfels-altered
sedimentary wall rocks.
The Joint Venture's exploration work has been carefully designed to meet Russian Federation and international
reporting  requirements.  Surface  exploration,  principally  consisting  of  property-wide  soil  and  ground  magnetics
surveys has been effective at delineating concealed porphyry copper-gold targets for follow-up drill testing in areas
where soil cover is less than ~15-20 m. Project drilling includes 211 HQ and NQ diamond drill holes totaling over
70,600 m. The majority of drill metres (~55,000 m) were concentrated on four principal deposits: Valley, Central,
Freedom,  and  Flats.  Reconnaissance  drilling  also  included  evaluation  of  porphyry  prospects  prioritised  from
additional target areas.
The  Project's  exploration  sampling,  sample  preparation,  analyses,  and  security  have  produced  reliable  and
reproducible  results  as  demonstrated  by  the  Joint  Venture's  extensive  QA/QC  programme  and  verified  by  the
author's independent property visit, core sampling, and data reviews. The drill database and supporting exploration
data are judged to be suitable for resource estimation.
The  Project’s  initial  Inferred  mineral  resources  at  a  0.30%  CuEq  cut-off  are  estimated  as  1,661  Mt  at  average
grades of 0.34% copper and 0.17 g/t gold, or 0.42% CuEq, containing 5.65 Mt (12.45 billion pounds) copper and
9.11 Moz gold, or 7.06 Mt (15.56 billion pounds) copper equivalent. The Inferred resources are constrained within
open pit configurations to ensure reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The CuEq calculation (CuEq% =
(Cu% + 0.5 * Au g/t)) and optimised open pit parameters are based upon reasonable assumptions of metal prices,
costs, and metallurgical recoveries. The cutoff grade is also guided by these assumptions, as well as comparison
with examples of other porphyry copper-gold deposits that occur worldwide.
In total, the Malmyzh Inferred resources represent the copper-gold mineralisation of an important porphyry district
as currently represented by the four deposits drilled on nominal 200 m grids. The Valley deposit is the largest
porphyry  system  in  the  Malmyzh  district  as  currently  understood,  and  at  the  0.30%  CuEq  cut-off  has  Inferred
resources that account for 60% of the total tonnes, 60% of the contained copper tonnes, and just under 54% of the
contained  gold  ounces.  Freedom  Southeast  has  high  Au:Cu  ratios,  and  at  the  0.30%  CuEq  cut-off  the  Inferred
resource represents 20% of the total tonnes, 20% of the contained copper tonnes, and 29% of the contained gold
ounces. The Central deposit accounts for 13% of the Inferred resource tonnes, 15% of the contained copper, and
9%  of  the  contained  gold  ounces  at  the  0.30%  CuEq  cut-off,  and  the  smaller  Flats  deposit  contributes  to  the
balance of the Inferred resources total.

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT ON THE INITIAL MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR
THE MALMYZH COPPER-GOLD PROJECT, KHABAROVSK KRAI, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The tonnes and grades at various cut-offs illustrate that there are tonnages of higher grade copper-gold material
available  at:  a)  Valley  in  the  shallow,  potassically  altered  hornfels  on  the  southeastern  flank  of  the  deposit,  b)
Freedom  Southeast  as  postulated  cross-cutting  features  of  intense  chloritic  alteration  within  a  broader  zone  of
potassic alteration, and c) Central within a steeply plunging core of potassic alteration. In-fill drilling is required to
gain additional confidence in the geometries and tenors of these higher grade zones.
Although  the  model  validations  establish  that  the  mineral  resource  estimates  are  globally  unbiased,  there  are
clearly  localised  controls  that  cannot  be  adequately  defined  at  the  current  200  m  drill  spacing.  Further,  the
preliminary  metallurgical  testwork  conducted  to  date  yields  wide  ranges  of  potential  gold  recoveries,  and  to  a
lesser extent ranges of copper recoveries. These uncertainties led to the classification of the resources as Inferred,
and can only be addressed by further drilling and definitive metallurgical testwork in order to potentially advance
the resource estimates to a higher level of resource classification.
There is potential to add to the Malmyzh porphyry copper-gold resources at Freedom Northwest and to depth in the
other deposits with additional drilling. As well there is exploration upside for new discoveries, particularly in the
southern portion of the license beneath more extensive soil cover. An especially notable target for follow-up is in
the area of east Bikha, where field reconnaissance has identified alteration that may be related to the upper levels
of a porphyry system; successful follow-up of this exploration target could identify a new style of mineralisation on
the property.
Although Malmyzh is at a relatively early stage of project evaluation, the author notes that the infrastructure and
physiographic  setting  for  a  potential  open  pit  mining  operation  are  favourable.  There  are  multiple  options  for
transportation,  power,  water  sources,  and  nearby  population  centres  with  candidate  workforces.  Regarding  the
water  sources,  consideration  of  the  hydrogeologic  groundwater  conditions  and  the  likelihood  of  open  pit
dewatering will need to be addressed with more advanced studies. The climate will support year-round mining
operations. The property’s size and gentle topographic expression provide a suitable layout scenario for potential
tailings storage, waste dumps, processing plant sites, and other infrastructure.
The most significant risk to Malmyzh is achieving Russian Federation SIL approval in order for the Joint Venture to
continue  advancing  the  Project.  The  results  and  timing  of  this  process  cannot  be  assured  or  predicted.
Notwithstanding,  there  are  examples  of  successful  outcomes  for  western  exploration  and  mining  companies,
including recent approvals for the Kun Manie deposit and the ongoing operations at Kupol. The author also notes
the  positive  developments  related  to  MRET  and  other  investment  incentives  implemented  by  the  Russian
Federation in 2014 for developing projects in the Far East, including Khabarovsk Krai.
Contingent on gaining SIL approval, the Joint Venture will need to submit a plan for taking the Project through the
"advanced  exploration"  stage.  Although  the  final  work  programme  has  yet  to  be  formulated,  it  will  entail  in-fill
drilling and advanced technical studies. Securing adequate funding to proceed with this work given the current
market conditions for exploration and mining companies may be a risk, but one that is faced in the normal course of
business throughout the industry.

The Malmyzh exploration programmes have established a substantial porphyry copper-gold Inferred resource with
potential for expansion in the 4 deposits that have been drill defined to date. Further, the a) potential for zones of
higher grade copper-gold mineralisation, b) multiple concealed targets with limited or no drilling, and c) geologic
setting with broad distributions of porphyry mineralisation and alteration highlight the Project's many exploration
opportunities to upgrade and enhance the current resource base. These opportunities, coupled with a favourable

26 RECOMMENDATIONS
The Joint Venture's exploration programmes have established Malmyzh as a district scale project that has Inferred
porphyry copper-gold resources at the Valley, Central, Freedom Southeast, and Flats deposits.
In addition to the Inferred resources that are the subject of this NI 43-101 Technical Report, the Project has official
Russian Federation "on balance reserves" that exceed thresholds requiring government approvals for the Joint
Venture to proceed with its Malmyzh programmes (see SIL discussion in Sections 4.3 and 24; these "reserves" do
not meet NI 43-101 or CIM requirements for resource or reserve reporting). As a result, for the most part, technical
advancement of the Project should be held in abeyance until SIL approval is granted. IGC advises that the relevant
applications are currently being prepared for submission.
Assuming  SIL  approval  is  received,  the  Project  must  then  move  forward  according  to  Russian  Federation
requirements for an "advanced exploration" work plan. This programme must be submitted by the Joint Venture for
approval by the relevant Russian Federation agencies, as was the case with the earlier work plan for the now
successfully completed "prospecting phase".
WAI cannot comment on the duration of these approval processes, as the timelines are undefined, nor on their
ultimate outcomes. However, the immediate steps required for the Malmyzh Project are:
•
•
Finalise and submit documents for SIL approval.
Subject to SIL approval, prepare and submit an advanced exploration work programme for approval.
The  advanced  exploration  programme  requirements  will  include  in-fill  drilling  and  further  metallurgical,
engineering, hydrogeological, environmental, socio-economic, and other work. WAI has not reviewed budgets for
this work, as the final requirements have not yet been set.
There are early stage recommendations for technical work that can proceed:
a)
b)
Review the drill core for holes in areas of higher grade mineralisation to better understand the controls
for follow-up drilling. As part of this review, re-log additional core to improve the geologic and alteration
interpretations for the resource deposits and exploration targets ($125,000-$150,000). This could result
in additional input for, and confidence in, future resource models, as well as highlight priority targets for
follow-up.
Review and assess the potential for higher grade, shallow mineralisation at Valley (shallow hornfels),
Freedom  (postulated  zones  of cross-cutting high grade), and optionally Central (potassic core zone)
($30,000-$40,000). This work will help provide focus for follow-up drill programmes.

c)
Review  all  exploration  data  to  refine  interpretations  for exploration  targeting.  In  addition,  review  the
distribution of molybdenum mineralisation in the resource deposits to determine if there is the potential
for low grade by-product credits ($20,000-$30,000).
The above work can be accomplished from the exploration work completed to date, and totals $175,000-$220,000.
It is recommended that this modest programme proceed as a first phase while awaiting Project approvals, so as to
be prepared for the next phase of drilling and assessment.
Contingent  on  receiving  the  necessary  Project  approvals,  the  second  phase  of  recommended  work  includes
metallurgy,  a  focused  in-fill  drilling  programme  at  the  Valley  and  Freedom  Southeast  deposits  to  define  higher
grade copper-gold zones, and drilling at Freedom Northwest designed to potentially bring it to resource status:
1.
2.
3.
Metallurgical testwork to further optimise copper and gold recoveries ($250,000-$350,000).
Valley and Freedom in-fill drilling: 46 holes @ 23,000 m ($2,300,000-$2,875,000).
Freedom Northwest drilling and other exploration drilling (i.e. east Bikha area, etc.): 18 holes @ 9000 m
($900,000-$1,125,000).
The post-approval work totals $3.45 -4.35 million and could be completed in a 12 month period. The author notes
that the projected drilling costs are low. However, the Joint Venture owns the drill rigs and advises that these are
appropriate costs to use (T. Bowens personal communication, 2015).
In addition to drill defining Freedom Northwest, the above recommendations are designed to meet the following
objectives:
•
•
•
Prepare for (first phase), and contingent on Project approvals, subsequently initiate (second phase) the
required advanced exploration work programme.
Define an optimised metallurgical flow sheet for recovering copper and gold.
Evaluate the possibilities for initially developing the Project with higher grades from shallower
mineralisation. If a preliminary review is positive, then the groundwork has been provided to advance
the Project with a PEA study.
If  designed  and  executed  properly,  the  recommended  Malmyzh  work  programmes  will  a)  initially  provide  the
background for making informed exploration decisions, and assuming SIL approval, b) commence the work to meet
Russian Federation license requirements while providing the basis for a PEA study.
