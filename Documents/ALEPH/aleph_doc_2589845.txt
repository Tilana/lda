ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops,
and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have exploration and production interests in four
geographic areas: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, and the U.K. (North Sea). Apache also pursues exploration interests in other
areas that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
During the second quarter of 2016, Apache changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development
activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. Financial information for all periods has
been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method of accounting. See Note 1 – Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K.
During 2015, Apache sold its Australia LNG business and oil and gas assets. During 2014, Apache sold its operations in
Argentina. Results of operations and cash flows from operations for Argentina and Australia are reflected as discontinued
operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Certain historical information has been recast to
reflect the results of operations for Argentina and Australia as discontinued operations.
The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in
Part I, Item 1A of the Previously Filed Annual Report, and Part II, Item 7A of this Form 8-K.
Overview of 2015 Results
This year was a transitional year for Apache. We made significant progress high-grading our portfolio, reducing drilling
activity, driving down costs, and proactively strengthening our financial condition.
We completed an extensive refocusing of the Company’s asset portfolio which began several years ago. Through this
process, we successfully monetized both capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-
term and other non-strategic assets. These divestitures included Apache’s interest in LNG projects in Australia and Canada,
its exploration and production operations in Australia and Argentina, and mature assets offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.
Proceeds from divestitures were used to improve our liquidity and redeployed to upgrade our portfolio.
We also reacted swiftly to the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 and continued
throughout 2015 and into 2016. Immediate action was taken to substantially reduce activity levels, and concrete steps were
taken to cut overhead and operating costs. Apache’s intense focus on driving internal efficiencies, along with considerable
downward pressure on third-party service costs, resulted in savings in both capital and operating costs. Lease operating
expenses and general and administrative expenses decreased 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively, from the prior year.
During the year, we also took action to strengthen our financial and liquidity position. The Company reduced debt by $2.5
billion since year-end 2014 and exited the year with $1.5 billion of cash. Our nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018, and
only $700 million, or 8 percent of our total debt portfolio, matures prior to 2021. In June 2015, we replaced $5.3 billion in
revolving credit facilities with one $3.5 billion credit facility, which matures in June 2020.
Daily production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaged 543 Mboe/d during 2015. Excluding the impact of
divested assets and the impact of Egypt impairments, production for the year would have increased 3 percent from 2014,
despite a reduction of over 60 percent in capital spending. Production volumes for 2015 included a nonrecurring downward
adjustment of 4,726 boe/d related to Egypt taxes on a $1.1 billion impairment of certain gathering, transmission, and
processing (GTP) assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. These charges drove a significant loss in Egypt for the fourth quarter,
which mostly offset tax expense and tax volumes recognized in the first three quarters of the year. For more information
regarding our production-sharing contracts and taxes, please refer to the “Geographic Area Overviews” section set forth in
Part I, Item 1 and 2 of the Previously Filed Annual Report.

In spite of these and other operating achievements, the precipitous decline in commodity prices negatively impacted our
earnings and cash flow compared to the prior year. We reported a $10.4 billion loss attributable to common stock, or $27.40
per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $8.4 billion, or $21.76 per share in 2014. Notable items impacting our
earnings that were driven by the decline in commodity price and refocusing our asset portfolio include the following:
 
 
 
 
Impairments, net of tax(1)(2)
Tax adjustments and valuation allowances
Discontinued operations (income) loss, net of tax

2016 Outlook
We believe our proactive actions taken in 2015 and previous years have positioned us to be flexible and rapid in our
responses to the challenges faced in this difficult and unpredictable environment. We are prepared for a potentially “lower for
longer” commodity price cycle, while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels as commodity price and
service costs dictate. To ensure that we sustain this position, we have reduced our activity with a target of achieving “cash
flow neutrality.” This means our capital program and dividends will be funded through cash from operations and a limited
amount of non-core asset sales, without external financing.
We currently plan capital investments in 2016 in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, a reduction of over 60 percent from
2015 levels. Approximately $700 million to $800 million will be allocated to North American onshore plays, with the balance
to international and U.S. offshore regions. This budget may be adjusted with commodity price movements throughout the
year. Our budgeted amounts exclude expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Our capital
budget for 2016 has been, and will be, allocated on a prioritized basis as follows: (i) maintain assets and keeping them
running efficiently and preserve mineral rights and leases, (ii) further optimize and build high quality inventory for the future,
(iii) conduct certain medium-cycle, high impact exploration activities, and (iv) conduct limited-scale development activities that
remain economically robust at these low prices. In addition, we will continue our overhead and lease operating expenses cost
reduction efforts in order to position Apache for an extended low commodity price environment.
Given the further curtailment of capital spending, we are projecting a production decline of 7 percent to 11 percent in 2016
compared to 2015 production levels after adjusting for divestitures and volumes associated with Egypt’s noncontrolling
interest and tax impacts. However, we believe that if commodity prices improve from current market levels, we will be able to
increase our capital plan accordingly with a greater focus on growth in our onshore North America assets.

Operational Highlights
Operational highlights for the year include:
North America
•
•
North America onshore liquids averaged 193,483 barrels per day, with crude oil representing 69 percent of the liquids
production. When adjusted for asset divestitures, this represents an increase of 4 percent compared to 2014. North America
onshore liquids production represented 56 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our overall
production.
The Permian region averaged 12 operated rigs during the year, drilling 378 gross wells, 241 net wells. Drilling activity in the
region resulted in a production increase of 6 percent relative to the prior year. Over half of the region’s production is crude oil
and 20 percent is NGLs. Combined, this represents more than a third of Apache’s total liquids production for 2015. The
region averaged 168 Mboe/d during 2015.
The MidContinent/Gulf Coast region averaged 5 operated rigs during the year, drilling 127 gross wells, 76 net wells. The
region focused its drilling activities in the Canyon Lime, Eagleford, Marmaton, and Woodford formations during 2015.
Apache is active in the SCOOP play in Central Oklahoma targeting the Woodford formation, where we drilled or participated
in drilling 33 wells. The region averaged 73 Mboe/d during 2015.
The Canada region averaged 2 operated rigs during the year, drilling 38 gross wells, 21 net wells. Canada primarily focused
on advancing growth plays in the Duvernay and Montney formations, with a goal of reducing drilling and completion costs. In
the Duvernay, we brought on-line our first seven-well pad under budget and at production levels that are exceeding our initial
expectations. The region averaged 68 Mboe/d during 2015.
International and Offshore
•
•
•
The Egypt region significantly reduced its drilling program throughout the year, averaging 14 rigs and drilling 122 gross
wells, 107 net wells. Despite the reduction, gross production increased 1 percent, while Egypt’s net production decreased
3 percent from 2014, a function of our production-sharing contracts. Development of the Ptah and Berenice oil fields
continued to deliver excellent results, with nine new wells brought on-line and combined gross field production exceeding
26,000 b/d at its peak. The region averaged 154 net Mboe/d during 2015.
The North Sea region averaged 6 rigs, drilling 26 gross wells, 22 net wells. During the year, the region averaged production
of 71 Mboe/d. Apache was able to maintain relatively flat production year over year despite a 21 percent reduction in capital
expenditures. The 2015 drilling program was extremely successful and sets up excellent growth and profitability
opportunities over the next five years. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Apache announced five significant wells in the North
Sea: three exploration discoveries and two notable development wells.
Exploration Discoveries
•
•
•
The K discovery, in the Beryl area, is a significant oil discovery with multiple commercial zones across three distinct fault
blocks, including one fault block with over 1,500 feet of net pay. Apache is the operator of this discovery with a 55 percent
working interest.
The Corona discovery, also located in the Beryl area, logged 225 feet total vertical depth net pay in excellent reservoir-
quality sandstone. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in this discovery.
The Seagull discovery confirmed 672 feet of net oil pay over a 1,092-foot column in Triassic-age sands. The well was flow
tested with a facility-constrained rate of 8.7 Mb/d of oil and 16 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcf/d) with a very
low pressure drawdown. Further appraisal work will continue following the recent acquisition of a multi-azimuth 3-D survey.
Apache has a 35 percent working interest in this project and is now operator of this license.
Notable Development Wells
•
•
Apache drilled two significant development wells in the Beryl area, which Apache operates. Apache owns a 60.55 percent
working interest in both wells. The ACN development well came online in October at a test rate of    11 Mb/d of oil and 30.4
MMcf/d of natural gas. The L4S pilot well started production in July and had an initial production rate of 2 Mb/d of oil and 45
MMcf/d of natural gas.

section set forth in Part I, Item 1 and 2 of the Previously Filed Annual Report.
Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
Over Apache’s 60-year history, we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes
in our industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize our portfolio
of assets in response to changes. Most recently and prior to the precipitous decline of commodity prices beginning in 2014,
Apache closed, or had agreements executed, on a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and
enhance our portfolio. These divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to
earnings in the near-term, and included all of our operations in Australia and Argentina. These divestments include:
•
•
•
•
Australia Operations On June 5, 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of the Company’s Australian subsidiary
Apache Energy Limited to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield
Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion (net of $225 million in customary, post-closing adjustments for the
period between the effective date, October 1, 2014, and closing). Additionally, in October 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries
completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd (YPHPL), to Yara International for total
proceeds of $391 million. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2015.
LNG Projects On April 2, 2015 and April 10, 2015, Apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the Wheatstone
LNG and Kitimat LNG projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to Woodside
Petroleum Limited (Woodside) for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.
Nonstrategic Assets in the Anadarko Basin and in southern Louisiana On December 31, 2014, Apache completed the sale of
certain Anadarko basin and southern Louisiana oil and gas assets for approximately $1.3 billion in two separate
transactions. In the Anadarko basin, Apache sold approximately 115,000 net acres in Wheeler County, Texas, and western
Oklahoma. In southern Louisiana, the Company sold working interests in approximately 90,000 net acres. The effective date
of both of these transactions was October 1, 2014.
Certain Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Assets On June 30, 2014, Apache completed the sale of non-operated interests in the
Lucius and Heidelberg development projects and 11 primary term deepwater exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico for
$1.4 billion. The effective date of the transaction was May 1, 2014.
Nonstrategic Canadian Assets On April 30, 2014, Apache completed the sale of primarily dry gas producing hydrocarbon
assets in the Deep Basin area of western Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, for $374 million. The assets comprise
328,400 net acres in the Ojay, Noel, and Wapiti areas. Apache retained 100 percent of its working interest in horizons below
the Cretaceous in the Wapiti area, including rights to the liquids-rich Montney and other deeper horizons. The effective date
of the transaction was January 1, 2014.
Argentina Operations On March 12, 2014, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s operations in
Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anónima for $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments) plus the assumption of $52
million of bank debt as of June 30, 2013.
Egypt Sinopec Partnership On November 14, 2013, Apache completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its
Egypt oil and gas business to a subsidiary of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation
(Sinopec). Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion. This noncontrolling interest is recorded separately in the
Company’s financial statements.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Operations On September 30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations
and properties to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood), an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement,
Apache received cash consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment
liabilities. In respect of such abandonment liabilities, Fieldwood has posted letters of credit in the amount of $500 million and
has established a trust account funded by a net profits interest, which contains approximately $140 million as of
December 31, 2015. Additionally, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in both exploration blocks and in
horizons below production in developed blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. The effective date of the transaction
was July 1, 2013.

Crude Oil Prices
A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many
factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for 2015 were down 47 percent compared
to 2014, a direct result of the sharply lower benchmark oil prices over the past year.
Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market
price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a tighter global range. Price
movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. Crude oil prices realized in 2015
averaged $48.31 per barrel.
Natural Gas Prices
Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply
and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market
conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
8
•
North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market
prices. Our North American regions averaged $2.39 per Mcf in 2015, down from $4.24 per Mcf in 2014.
•
In Egypt, our gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a
minimum gas price of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids
content. Overall, the region averaged $2.91 per Mcf in 2015, down 2 percent from the prior year.
•
Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to
a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region
averaged $6.73 per Mcf in 2015, a 19 percent decrease from an average of $8.29 per Mcf in 2014.
NGL Prices
Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions,
less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Crude Oil Revenues
2015 vs. 2014   During 2015 crude oil revenues totaled $5.1 billion, approximately 49 percent lower than the 2014 total of
$10.1 billion, driven by a 47 percent decrease in average crude oil prices and a 4 percent decrease in worldwide production.
Average daily production in 2015 was 289.6 Mb/d, with prices averaging $48.31 per barrel. Crude oil represented 78 percent
of our 2015 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 79 percent and 51
percent, respectively, in the prior year. Lower realized prices reduced revenues $4.8 billion, while lower production volumes
reduced revenues an additional $222 million.
Worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 12.6 Mb/d. When excluding production from asset
divestitures during 2015 and 2014, crude oil production remained essentially flat as drilling and recompletion activity in our
North American onshore regions offset natural decline in all regions.
2014 vs. 2013   During 2014 crude oil revenues totaled $10.1 billion, $1.8 billion lower than the 2013 total of $11.9 billion,
driven by a 5 percent decrease in worldwide production and 10 percent decrease in average realized prices. Average daily
production in 2014 was 302.2 Mb/d, with prices averaging $91.66 per barrel. Crude oil represented 79 percent of our 2014 oil
and gas production revenues and 51 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 80 and 48 percent, respectively, in
the prior year. Lower realized prices reduced revenues $1.2 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues $544
million.
Worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 16.3 Mb/d, however, when excluding production from
asset divestitures during 2014 and 2013, crude oil production increased 18.8 Mb/d. This increase was driven by production
growth of 20.1 Mb/d in our Permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity, partially offset by a decrease
in production from the North Sea on natural decline.
Natural Gas Revenues
2015 vs. 2014   Natural gas revenues of $1.2 billion for 2015 were $841 million lower than 2014, the result of a 31 percent
decrease in realized prices and a 16 percent decrease in production volumes. Worldwide production decreased 222.4
MMcf/d, lowering revenues by $228 million. Realized prices in 2015 averaged $2.80 per Mcf, a decrease of $1.23 per Mcf
compared to 2014, which decreased revenues by $613 million.
Worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 16 percent. Excluding production from asset divestitures
during 2015 and 2014, gas production decreased only 2 percent. This decrease was driven primarily by natural decline and
well shut-ins in Egypt and Canada. This decrease was primarily offset by drilling and recompletion activity in North America
onshore regions.
2014 vs. 2013   Natural gas revenues of $2.0 billion for 2014 were $286 million lower than 2013, the result of a 20 percent
decrease in production volumes offset by a 10 percent increase in realized prices. Worldwide production decreased 348.8
MMcf/d, lowering revenues by $513 million. Realized prices in 2014 averaged $4.03 per Mcf, an increase of $0.36 per Mcf
from 2013, which increased revenues by $227 million.
9
Worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 20 percent. However, excluding production from asset
divestitures during 2015 and 2014, gas production increased 11.3 MMcf/d. This increase was driven by production growth of
28.0 MMcf/d in the Permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity. Egypt’s net production increased
11.0 MMcf/d as a result of our successful drilling program with new wells coming on-line during 2014, and production from the
North Sea increased 5 MMcf/d on stronger than expected well performance.
NGL Revenues
2015 vs. 2014   NGL revenues totaled $227 million in 2015, a decrease of $441 million from 2014, the result of a 7 percent
decrease in production volumes and a 63 percent decrease in realized prices. Worldwide production from continuing
operations decreased 4.8 Mb/d, reducing revenues by $17 million. Realized prices in 2015 averaged $9.98 per barrel, a
decrease of $17.30 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $424 million.
2014 vs. 2013   NGL revenues totaled $668 million in 2014, an increase of $16 million from 2013, the result of a 7 percent
increase in production volumes partially offset by a 4 percent decrease in realized prices. Worldwide production from
continuing operations increased 4.5 Mb/d, which added $45 million to revenues. This increase was primarily driven by drilling
and recompletion activity in our North American onshore regions. Realized prices in 2014 averaged $27.28 per barrel, a
decrease of $1.28 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $29 million.
Operating Expenses
The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production
(boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on
context. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Operating expenses for all
periods exclude discontinued operations in Argentina and Australia.

of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements
both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based.
Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor,
boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed more than half of our 2015 production, is inherently more
expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
10
During 2015, LOE decreased $384 million, or 17 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2014. On a per-unit basis,
LOE decreased $0.91, or 9 percent compared to 2014. During 2014, LOE decreased $412 million, or 16 percent, on an
absolute dollar basis compared to 2013. On a per-unit basis, LOE decreased $0.61, or 6 percent, compared to 2013. These
reductions reflect our continued focus on cost reductions consistent with the current price environment.
Gathering and Transportation
We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge.
One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to
reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the
purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party
carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate transportation cost as
gathering and transportation costs.
In the U.S. and Canada we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation
charges to a third-party carrier. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under netback
arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements.
2015 vs. 2014  Gathering and transportation costs decreased $62 million from 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by
North American onshore divestitures.
2014 vs. 2013  Gathering and transportation costs decreased $15 million from 2013. Canada’s 2014 costs decreased $32
million from a decline in production primarily associated with divestitures. The U.S. costs for 2014 increased $9 million as
compared to 2013 primarily as a result of increased production in the MidContinent/Gulf Coast and Permian regions from
increased drilling activity partially offset by a decrease from the Gulf of Mexico asset sales. Egypt costs were down $2 million
from decreases in the world scale freight rates. North Sea costs increased $10 million on increased NGL activity and oil
transportation tariffs.
Taxes Other Than Income
Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and
in state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance
taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net
receipts from qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes
and various Canadian taxes, including the Freehold Mineral tax and Saskatchewan Resources surtax. The table below
presents a comparison of these expenses:
 
 
 
 
U.K. PRT

Total Taxes other than income $ 282
2015 vs. 2014  Taxes other than income were $295 million lower than 2014. U.K. PRT decreased $118 million over the
comparable 2014 period as the result of decreased production revenues in the North Sea from qualifying fields during the
year. Severance tax decreased $138 million as the result of lower revenues and the divestiture of properties in Louisiana and
Oklahoma. Ad valorem taxes decreased $27 million as a result of property divestitures. In 2015, the U.K. government enacted
Finance Bill 2015, which provides tax relief to exploration and production (E&P) companies operating in the North Sea.
Effective January 1, 2016, the U.K. PRT rate is reduced from 50 percent to 35 percent.
2014 vs. 2013  Taxes other than income were $195 million lower than 2013. U.K. PRT decreased $205 million over the
comparable 2013 period based on a decrease in production revenues in the North Sea from qualifying fields during the year.
Severance tax increased $14 million with increased production from the Permian region offset by higher tax credits and
decreased commodity prices.

2015 vs. 2014  Exploration expenses in 2015 increased $272 million, or 11 percent, compared to 2014 as lower commodity
prices impacted current and planned exploration activity and resulted in unproved leasehold impairments increasing in all key
geographic areas. This increase was partially offset by reduced exploration dry hole costs in 2015. Dry hole expense was
$185 million higher in 2014 as a result of unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in that period associated with wells
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt. Geological and geophysical expense decreased $33 million as a result of fewer
seismic purchases in Canada during 2015.
2014 vs. 2013  Exploration expenses in 2014 increased $1.6 billion, or 165 percent, compared to 2013 as lower commodity
prices impacted exploration activity and resulted in unproved leasehold impairments increasing in all key geographic areas.
This increase was partially offset by reduced exploration dry hole costs in 2014. Dry hole expense was $92 million higher in
2013 as a result of unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in that period associated with wells primarily in the Gulf of Mexico
and North Sea.
General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses
2015 vs. 2014  G&A expenses decreased $73 million, or 16 percent, from 2014. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses
decreased $0.15 to $1.92 per boe. These reductions reflect Apache’s intense focus on driving internal efficiencies and
bringing overhead in line with the current commodity price environment. In 2015, we rationalized our entire organizational
structure, eliminating layers of management, consolidating office locations, and reducing corporate and regional staffing to
more closely align with activity levels expected in the future.
2014 vs. 2013  G&A expenses decreased $38 million, or 8 percent, from 2013. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses increased
$0.06 to $2.07 per boe, with the benefit of lower costs offset by the impact of lower production.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
2015 vs. 2014  Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $3.0 billion in 2015 decreased $1.2 billion compared to 2014. The
Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased $4.21 per boe in 2015 compared to 2014. The primary factor driving
both lower absolute dollar expense and lower DD&A per boe rates was the reduction in the Company’s oil and gas properties
as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2014 and 2015. Other asset depreciation remained relatively flat.
2014 vs. 2013  Oil and gas property DD&A expense decreased $510 million on an absolute dollar basis, primarily a result of
decreased production volumes. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased $0.09 to $19.22 per boe in 2014
compared to 2013.
Impairments
During 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $9.5 billion in connection with fair value assessments,
including $7.4 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $1.7 billion impairments of gathering, transmission, and
processing (GTP) facilities, a $148 million impairment of our YPHPL equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, $163
million impairment of goodwill in our North Sea reporting unit, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. Oil and gas proved
property impairments resulted from lower commodity prices and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the
Company's development plans in certain areas. GTP impairments included $555 million for facilities in Canada, $102 million
in
12
the U.S., and $1.1 billion in Egypt. The Egyptian impairments resulted in net losses for the year in the applicable
concessions, significantly reducing tax expense recorded under our production-sharing contracts.
During 2014, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $7.1 billion, including $6.1 billion impairments of oil and gas
proved properties, $655 million impairment of assets held for sale, $347 million impairments of goodwill in our U.S. and
Canadian reporting units, and $32 million for inventory write-downs.
During 2013, the Company recorded asset impairments of oil and gas proved properties of $1.4 billion.

Provision for Income Taxes
In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream
assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of $560 million.
Pursuant to its plan of divestiture of these assets, Apache recorded a deferred income tax liability of $560 million on
undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
The 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $1.0 billion. The 2015 effective rate reflects the tax benefit
from $11.9 billion of asset impairments and the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit
carryforwards. The 2015 effective tax rate reflects an increase in valuation allowance against the U.S. and Canadian region’s
net deferred tax assets. Separately, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015 that provides income tax relief to E&P
companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective
January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related
to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.
The 2014 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $519 million. The 2014 effective rate reflects the tax benefit
from $9.1 billion of asset impairments. The Company’s rate is also impacted by the $560 million of deferred income tax
expense recorded in 2014 for changing our position on undistributed earnings on foreign subsidiaries and $311 million of

Capital Resources and Liquidity
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available cash on hand,
committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic
assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas
prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact our revenues, earnings and cash
flows. These changes potentially impact our liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically,
costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less
volatile impact in the short-term.
Deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. During 2015, we recognized negative
reserve revisions of approximately 15 percent of our year-end 2014 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. If
realized prices for the remainder of 2016 approximate commodity future prices as of December 31, 2015, the Company is
reasonably likely to report additional negative revisions, currently estimated at eight to ten percent of year-end 2015 estimated
proved reserves.
Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing
operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved
crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent
on the success of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically.
We currently plan capital investments in 2016 in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, a reduction of over 60 percent from
2015 levels. Approximately $700 million to $800 million will be allocated to North American onshore plays, with the balance
to international and U.S. offshore regions. This budget may be adjusted with commodity price movements throughout the
year. Our budgeted amounts exclude expenditures attributable to a one-third non-controlling interest in Egypt. Our capital
budget for 2016 has been, and will be, allocated on a prioritized basis as follows: (i) maintain assets and keeping them
running efficiently and preserve mineral rights and leases, (ii) further optimize and build high quality inventory for the future,
(iii) conduct certain medium-cycle, high impact exploration activities, and (iv) conduct limited-scale development activities that
remain economically robust at these low prices. In addition, we will continue our overhead and LOE cost reduction efforts in
order to position Apache for an extended low commodity price environment.
We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache, combined with proactive measures to adjust
our capital budget to reflect lower commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term
and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and
any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities
Operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-
term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that
affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion,

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2015 totaled $2.6 billion, down $4.5 billion from 2014. The decrease
primarily reflects lower commodity prices and divestitures.
For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in this Item 7.
For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net
cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial
Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K.
Australia Discontinued Operations
During 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Wheatstone LNG project and associated upstream assets to Woodside for
total proceeds of $2.8 billion. During 2015, Apache also completed the sale of its Australian subsidiary AEL to a consortium of
private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds
of $1.9 billion. The results of operations for the divested Australian assets, asset impairments, and losses on disposal are
classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
16
Argentina Discontinued Operations
During 2014, Apache completed the sale of our Argentina operations and properties to YPF Sociedad Anónima for cash
proceeds of $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments). The results of operations related to Argentina have been
classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K. Net cash provided by
Argentina discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 was $2 million.
Asset Divestitures
During 2015, 2014, and 2013, Apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling $1.5 billion, $3.1 billion, and $4.4 billion,
respectively. For information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K.
Egypt Noncontrolling Interest
During 2013, Apache completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec for
$2.95 billion. Apache made cash distributions totaling $129 million and $140 million to Sinopec in 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
Capital Expenditures
During 2015, capital spending for exploration and development (E&D) activities totaled $4.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in
the prior year. Apache’s E&D capital spending was primarily focused on our North American onshore region, where Apache
operated an average of 19 drilling rigs. Apache’s investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing facilities totaled
$233 million and $881 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Apache’s investment in GTP was primarily for the Kitimat
LNG project, which was divested in the second quarter of 2015.
Apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions totaling $367 million during 2015, compared with $1.5 billion in
2014. Our acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our North American onshore
portfolio.
Shares Repurchased
Apache’s Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Shares
may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the
buyback program on June 10, 2013, and through December 31, 2014, had repurchased a total of 32.2 million shares at an
average price of $88.96 per share. The Company has not purchased any additional shares during 2015 and is not obligated
to acquire any specific number of shares.
Dividends
The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 51 consecutive years through 2015. Future dividend
payments will depend on the Company’s level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. Common stock
dividends paid during 2015 totaled $377 million, compared with $365 million in 2014 and $303 million in 2013. The Company
paid dividends on its Series D Preferred Stock totaling $57 million in 2013. The preferred stock was converted to common
stock in August 2013.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2015, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion of cash was held by foreign
subsidiaries, and approximately $382 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by
foreign subsidiaries should not be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The majority of the cash is invested in
highly liquid, investment-grade securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Debt
At December 31, 2015, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.7 billion. We have $550 million
maturing in 2018, $150 million maturing in 2019, and the remaining $8.1 billion maturing in years 2021 through 2096. At
December 31, 2015, we had $416,000 of notes due June 2016 classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
In September 2015, the Company fully redeemed its $500 million 5.625% notes due in 2017 and its $400 million 1.75% notes
due in 2017. The notes were redeemed pursuant to the provisions of each respective note’s indenture. Apache paid the
holders an aggregate of $939 million in cash reflecting principal and the premium to par, and an additional $8 million in
accrued and unpaid interest.
Available Credit Facilities
In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache’s
two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million
letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may
be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial
paper program. In connection with entry into the $3.5 billion facility, Apache terminated $5.3 billion in commitments under
existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, aggregate available borrowing capacity under this credit facility was $3.5
billion.
At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a
margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. At December 31, 2015 the margin over LIBOR was 1.0
percent. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments, which at December 31,
2015 was 0.125 percent on the total $3.5 billion in commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the
Company’s senior long-term debt rating. As a result of recent ratings downgrades, the base rate margin is 0.075 percent, the
LIBOR margin is 1.075 percent, and the facility fee is 0.175 percent as of the date of filing this report.
The financial covenants of the credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater
than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-
downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s debt-to-
capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 33 percent.
Negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-
related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary
assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’
liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s
consolidated assets, or approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability
to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of
non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
There are no clauses in the facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
material adverse changes. The credit facility agreement does not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in
the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and
terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its U.S. or Canadian
subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable
judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity
and terminate lending commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified
pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility
as of December 31, 2015.
In February 2016, Apache entered into a three-year letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, with options
to increase commitments to £1.075 billion and extend the term by one year. The facility is available for letters of credit and
loans to cash collateralize letter of credit obligations to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The
facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s $3.5
billion
18
revolving credit facility. Commissions are payable on outstanding letters of credit and borrowings bear interest (at a base rate
or LIBOR), plus a margin. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s
senior unsecured long-term debt rating. The Company has not requested any letters of credit or borrowings under this facility
as of the date of the Previously Filed Annual Report. This facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs,
particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions.
There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the Company will not deteriorate. We
closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the
potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.
Commercial Paper Program
As of December 31, 2015, the Company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program. The commercial paper
program generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper
program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. If
the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the
Company’s 2015 committed credit facility, which expires in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of December 31,
2015, the Company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank facility, or uncommitted bank lines.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation
agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance
sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated
entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. For additional information
regarding these obligations, please see Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to

K.
This represents minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Apache’s expenditures for drilling rig services will
exceed such minimum amounts to the extent Apache utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment
for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract.
Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and
specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price
provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay
contracts, NGL processing agreements, and drilling work program commitments.
(4)Firm transportation commitments relate to contractual obligations for capacity rights on third-party pipelines.
(5)
Other operating lease obligations pertain to other long-term exploration, development, and production activities. The
Company has work-related commitments for supply and standby vessels, gas pipeline and land leases.
19
Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management
feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $52 million for environmental
remediation and approximately $29 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s
environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K.
In addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to
divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the
purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and
facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil
and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face
financial problems that may have a significant impact on its solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser
of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to
perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws
and regulations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations
should they arise.
With respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)
is currently planning to issue a new Notice to Lessees (NTL) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in
the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and
decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities. We currently expect such new NTL
may require Apache to provide additional security to the BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and
decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are
working closely with the BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security
becomes necessary under the new NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on
counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such
parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue
as a going concern.
Insurance Program
We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, third party liability, workers’
compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage includes
deductibles or retentions that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and
limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential
consequences and damages.
Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These
policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. Coverage for Gulf of Mexico named windstorms is excluded
from this coverage.
Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s
interest, subject to a retention that must be met prior to recovery. This coverage is in excess of any existing policies, including,
but not limited to, aircraft liability and automobile liability. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally
indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service
provider.
Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other
highly rated international insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation,
nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an
agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy
terms and conditions, provide approximately $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to a self-insured retention of
approximately $1 billion.
In addition, Apache has a separate policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides $300 million of
coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache
on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt
prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of
the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.
Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In
addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
20
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future
events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain
accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition,
results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical
accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is
unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting
policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.
Reserves Estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under
existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage,
or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be
classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of
production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled
locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that
they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements.
For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves
could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in
property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the
previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no
escalation.
Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
Oil and Gas Exploration Costs
Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of
acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive
wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs,
other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an
exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been
found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing
exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and
appraisal efforts. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur,
associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the
statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever
changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated
by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest
level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If
there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through
an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans
are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset
group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for
long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future
cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The expected
future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair
21
value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating
costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review.
During 2015, there was a substantial decline in commodity prices. The resulting change in future commodity price
assumptions and impact to our future development plan was a triggering event which required us to reassess our long-lived
assets for impairment. Based on the results of this assessment, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas
properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value
Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)
The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas
production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning
wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future
restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal
technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations
considerations.
ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is
incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO
liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities
associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash
outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments
including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes
in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact
the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
Income Taxes
Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.
We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If
we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under
accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as
related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain
legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are
reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing
tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to
the potential for any additional tax assessments.
Purchase Price Allocation
Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of
the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated
deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities
and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information
becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending
upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. The most significant
assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To
estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above
in “Reserve Estimates” of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on
results of operations in the future.
22
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet included $87 million of goodwill, all of which has been
assigned to the Egypt reporting unit. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We
conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1st of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise,
by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as
macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash
flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.
The first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to
which goodwill has been assigned. If it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a combination of
the income approach and the market approach.
Under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future
cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and
operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates,
and other variables. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a
significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction
in expected future cash flows and possibly an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods.
Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and
natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves; estimates of market prices
considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and
capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using discount rates similar to those used by
the Company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures.
To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar
businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. This requires management to make certain judgments
about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. Associated
market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value.
Although we base the fair value estimate of each reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those
assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. In the event of a
prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the
reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment of the entire amount of recorded
goodwill in the North Sea reporting unit of $163 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recognized non-cash
impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the U.S. and Canada reporting units of $244 million and $103
million, respectively.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL
prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise
indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information
provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.
Commodity Risk
The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent
on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of
unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather and political climate. In 2015, our average crude oil
realizations decreased to $48.31 per barrel compared to $91.66 per barrel in 2014. Our average natural gas price realizations
decreased 31 percent in 2015 to $2.80 per Mcf from $4.03 per Mcf in 2014.
We periodically enter into derivative positions on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of
financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity
prices. Apache typically uses futures contracts, swaps, and options to mitigate commodity price risk. During 2015, the
Company did not have any derivative positions. In 2014, approximately 9 percent of our natural gas production from
continuing operations and approximately 39 percent of our crude oil production from continuing operations was subject to
financial derivative hedges.
See Note 5—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 8-K.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash
flows measured in foreign currencies. In Canada, oil and gas prices and costs, such as equipment rentals and services, are
generally denominated in Canadian dollars but are heavily influenced by U.S. markets. Our North Sea production is sold
under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, all oil and gas production is
sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Revenue and
disbursement transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents
based on the average exchange rates during the period.
Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other”
under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the
Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A 10 percent strengthening or
weakening of the Canadian dollar and British pound against the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2015, would result in a
foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $122 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash
flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of
accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full-cost method of accounting to the successful-
efforts method of accounting in 2016.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Apache Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP
Houston, Texas
February 26, 2016, except for the effects of the retrospective application of a change in accounting principle as discussed in
Note 1, as to which the date is August 4, 2016.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nature of Operations
Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces
natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company has exploration and production interests in four geographic
areas: the United States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) North Sea (North Sea). Apache also pursues
exploration interests in other areas that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that
were made to conform to the current-year presentation. During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its
Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. In March 2014, Apache completed the sale of all of its operations in
Argentina. Results of operations and cash flows for the divested Australia assets and Argentina operations are reflected as
discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Significant policies are discussed
below.
Recast Financial Information for Change in Accounting Principle
In the second quarter of 2016, Apache voluntarily changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and
development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. The financial information for
prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932 “Extractive Activities—Oil and
Gas.” Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities continues to be an
accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the generally preferred method of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and is more widely used in the industry such that the change will improve comparability of the
Company's financial statements to its peers. The Company believes the successful efforts method provides a more
representational depiction of assets and operating results. The successful efforts method also provides for the Company's
investments in oil and gas properties to be assessed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 "Property, Plant, and
Equipment" rather than valuations based on prices and costs prescribed under the full cost method as of the balance sheet
date. For more detailed information regarding the effects of the change to the successful efforts method, please refer to Note 2
—Change in Accounting Principle. The Company has recast certain historical information for all periods presented, including
the Statement of Consolidated Operations, Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income, Statement of Consolidated
Cash Flows, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of Consolidated Changes in Equity, and related information in Notes 1,
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.
In addition, the Company retrospectively adopted a new accounting standard update for all periods presented which requires
debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. For more information regarding this update, please refer to Note 8—Debt and Financing Costs.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany balances and transactions. The Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production
ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either
through direct or indirect ownership, Apache has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating
decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated Apache subsidiary and
are reflected separately in the Company’s financial statements. Investments in which Apache holds less than 50 percent of
the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded as a
component of “Deferred charges and other” in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a
component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Use of Estimates
Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results
may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in these
estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the fair value
determination of acquired assets and liabilities and assets held for sale at year-end (see Note 3—Acquisitions and
Divestitures), the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows
therefrom (see Note 16—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 7
—Asset Retirement Obligation), the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets and goodwill (see “Fair Value
Measurements,” “Property and Equipment,” and “Goodwill” sections in this Note 1 below), and the estimate of income taxes
(see Note 9—Income Taxes).
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. ASC
820-10-35 provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in
active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that
are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.
The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost
approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical
or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single
present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the
excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service
capacity of an asset (replacement cost).
Recurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 8—Debt and Note 11—Retirement and Deferred
Compensation Plans.
Apache also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets
indicate a potential impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling
$11.9 billion in connection with fair value assessments in the current low commodity price environment. Impairments totaling
$11.6 billion were recorded for certain property and equipment, which were written down to their fair values. These
impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” Also in 2015, the Company recorded $163
million for the impairment of goodwill, $148 million for the impairment of an equity method investment sold in the fourth
quarter, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. For a discussion of the equity method investment impairment, see Note 3
—Acquisitions and Divestitures.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $9.1 billion in connection with fair
value assessments, including $8.0 billion for property and equipment, $347 million for the impairment of goodwill, $655
million for the impairment of assets held for sale, and $32 million for inventory write-downs. The Company also recorded $833
million in impairments related to the sale of the Company's Australian assets and an additional $271 million in impairment of
proved properties and inventory in Australia. These impairments are classified as discontinued operations in 2014. For
discussion of these impairments, see “Property and Equipment” and “Goodwill” below and Note 3—Acquisitions and
Divestitures.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.8 billion for property and
equipment in connection with fair value assessments.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase
to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2015 and
2014, Apache had $1.5 billion and $679 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.
F-8
APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write-offs and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
carrying amount of Apache’s accounts receivable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the
instruments. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of all material trade and other receivables. Many of Apache’s
receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache operates. The Company may have the ability to withhold
future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint interest billings. The Company accrues a reserve on
a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the
amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company had an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $103 million, $98 million, and $78 million, respectively. During 2015, Apache’s allowance
for doubtful accounts increased $5 million, reflecting additional provisions for the year of $40 million, partially offset by $35
million for uncollectible accounts written off net of recoveries.
Inventories
Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment, stated at weighted-average cost, and oil produced but not
sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.
Property and Equipment
The carrying value of Apache’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment,
including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on
the fair values at the acquisition date.
Oil and Gas Property
The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of
accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory dry holes, exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals,
unproved impairments, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate
overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential
development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a
determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of
drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of
hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal
drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government
sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the
status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is
making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government
sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that
future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are
expensed.
Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and
gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases
are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties
with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that
provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned
leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.
Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and
impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.
Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production
of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the
unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced
each quarter by the carrying value of those reserves. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold
acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration
drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and
abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.
F-9
APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Oil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932 “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas.” The
basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic
condition, such as a reservoir or field.
When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the Company compares unamortized
capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future
cash flows, based on Apache’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production
from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced
to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in the ASC 820 “Fair Value
Measurement.” If applicable, the Company utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. The expected future
cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of
future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available
information at the date of review. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then
discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.
Apache has classified these fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The following table represents non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved property
and equipment for 2015, 2014 and 2013:
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Property:  
Proved
Unproved
The fair values of the impaired proved properties as of the most recent date of impairment were $3.9 billion, $4.8 billion, and
$3.8 billion for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
On the consolidated statement of operations, unproved impairments are recorded in exploration expense, and proved
impairments are recorded in impairments. Gains and losses on significant divestitures are recognized in the statement of

consolidated operations. See Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures for more detail.
Gathering, Transmission, and Processing Facilities
GTP facilities totaled $1.1 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with accumulated
depreciation for these assets totaling $160 million and $1.7 billion for the respective periods. GTP facilities are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration
anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GTP assets, whether Apache-operated or third party, as well as
potential development plans by Apache for undeveloped acreage within or in close proximity to those fields.
The Company assesses the carrying amount of its GTP facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. During
2015, the Company recorded impairments of $1.7 billion on certain GTP assets, including $1.1 billion in Egypt, $555 million
in Canada, and $103 million in the U.S., which were written down to their fair values of $306 million in aggregate. The fair
values of the impaired assets were determined using an income approach, which considered internal estimates of future
throughput volumes, processing rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections
that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market
participants. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. During
2014, the Company recorded impairments of $1.1 billion of its GTP assets related to the sale of Apache’s Wheatstone and
Kitimat LNG projects, and the remaining carrying value of those assets was reclassified to “Assets held for sale” on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. The $430 million impairment of GTP assets related to
Apache's Wheatstone LNG project is reflected in discontinued operations in the Company's statement of consolidated
operations. No impairments of GTP facilities were recognized during 2013.
F-10
APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The costs of GTP facilities retired or otherwise disposed of and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from
Apache’s consolidated financial statements, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in “Gain (loss) on divestitures” under
“Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations. During 2015, Apache recorded a gain on the
sale of GTP facilities totaling $59 million associated with the Company’s divestitures of certain Permian Basin assets. During
2014, the Company recorded a loss totaling $180 million associated with divestitures of certain Anadarko basin and southern
Louisiana assets. No gain or loss on the sales of GTP facilities was recognized during 2013.
Other Property and Equipment
Other property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land,
and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from 3 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled $693 million and $673 million at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations
The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment is recorded as a liability at its fair value,
with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated
balance sheet. If the fair value of the recorded asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to both the asset
retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated
inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset
retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and
equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.
Capitalized Interest
For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant
oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that
have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity
method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for
interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by
multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred.
Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is
expensed through depreciation or impairment.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, and it is recorded in "Deferred charges and other" in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The
Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise.
The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. As of
December 31, 2015, Apache assesses each country as a reporting unit. The fair value of each unit is determined and
compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including
goodwill, then goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.
In order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of the income approach and the
market approach. The income approach considers management views on current operating measures as well as
assumptions pertaining to market forces in the oil and gas industry, such as future production, future commodity prices, and
costs. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimate fair value,
using a discount rate similar to those used by the Company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures. To assess the
reasonableness of its fair value estimate, the Company uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar
businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. This requires management to make certain judgments
about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. Associated
market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value. Apache has classified this
reporting unit estimation as a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement.

When there is a disposal of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, goodwill associated
with that business is included in the carrying amount to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill
allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of
that business. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the
business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. The changes in goodwill in 2014 and
2013 represent amounts allocated to U.S. properties sold in each respective year.

Reductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair
values below the carrying values of Apache’s U.S., North Sea, and Canada reporting units. These goodwill impairments have
been recorded in “Impairments” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.
Accounts Payable
Included in accounts payable at December 31, 2015 and 2014, are liabilities of approximately $129 million and $229 million,
respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection
exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.
Commitments and Contingencies
Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are
adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.
Revenue Recognition and Imbalances
Oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery
has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future
revenues is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.
Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the
volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. These differences create imbalances that are
recognized as a liability only when the properties’ estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be sufficient to enable
the under-produced owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded liability is generally
reflected in other non-current liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken less than its
share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved gas reserves and future cash flows
in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
Apache markets its own North American natural gas production. Since the Company’s production fluctuates because of
operational issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase third-party oil and gas to fulfill sales obligations and
commitments. The costs of third-party oil and gas purchases totaled $105 million, $70 million, and $39 million, for 2015, 2014,
and 2013, respectively, which were netted against the related sales proceeds .

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which contractor partners
pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the concessions. A percentage of the production, generally
up to 40 percent, is available to contractor partners to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined
periods. Cost recovery is reflected in revenue. The balance of the production is split among the contractor partners and the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk. These derivative
contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures
contracts, swaps, or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based
reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company for
its oil and gas production. As of December 31, 2015, Apache had no open derivative positions.
When applicable, Apache records all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales
exception, on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of
derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current-period income as “Derivative instrument
gains (losses), net” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. Hedge accounting treatment
allows unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and
losses from the Company’s oil and gas cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally recognized in oil and
gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. If at any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged
forecasted transaction ceases to be “probable,” hedge accounting treatment will cease on a prospective basis, and all future
changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive
income prior to the change in the likelihood of occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other comprehensive
income until such time as the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the original forecasted
production will not occur, then the derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings immediately. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair
value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is immediately reported as
“Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.
Income Taxes
Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its
deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the
determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to
prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.
Apache does not record U.S. deferred income taxes on foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested.
When such earnings are no longer deemed permanently reinvested, Apache will recognize the appropriate U.S. current or
deferred income tax liabilities. For more information, please refer to Note 9—Income Taxes.
Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The functional currency is determined
country-by-country based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity pricing environment and
financing arrangements in each country. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise when monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent at the exchange rate in effect at the
end of each reporting period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and disbursement transactions
denominated in a country’s local currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average exchange rates
during the reporting period.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. For further discussion, please refer to Note 9—Income Taxes. All
other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of
consolidated operations. The Company’s other foreign currency gains and losses netted to a loss in 2015 of $11 million, a
gain in 2014 of $8 million, and a loss in 2013 of $30 million.

Insurance Coverage
The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of
an insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any differential arising between insurance
recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original
treatment.
Earnings Per Share
The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method,
which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested. The diluted EPS calculations for the year
ended December 31, 2013, includes weighted-average shares of common stock from the assumed conversion of Apache’s
convertible preferred stock.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718,
“Compensation – Stock Compensation.” The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options,
nonvested restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Additionally, the Company also grants cash-based stock
appreciation rights. These plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 12—Capital
Stock. Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures,
over the required service period.
ASC Topic 718 also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as
financing cash flows rather than as operating cash flows. The Company classified $1 million, $35,000, and $1 million as
financing cash inflows in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
Treasury Stock
The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.
New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-16,
which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments
retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines
the amount of the adjustment, including amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The
Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring
inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Entities will continue to apply their existing impairment
models to inventories that are accounted for using last-in first-out and the retail inventory method. Under current guidance, net
realizable value is one of several calculations an entity needs to make to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition
standard, ASU 2014-9. The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards, changes the way companies
recognize revenue from contracts with customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The guidance requires companies
to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB announced a delay in the
effective date of the revenue standard by one year. The deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard is required to be adopted using either the full
retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative
adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet. The Company is currently evaluating the level of effort needed
to implement the standard, the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements, and whether to use
the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach.

2.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. Accordingly, financial information for prior
periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method. In general, under successful
efforts, exploration expenditures such as exploratory dry holes, exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals,
unproved impairments, and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred, versus being capitalized under
the full cost method of accounting. Successful efforts also provides for the assessment of potential property impairments
under ASC 360 by comparing the net carrying value of oil and gas properties with associated projected undiscounted pre-tax
future net cash flows. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future net cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized
costs, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Under the full cost method of accounting, a write-down would be required if
the net carrying value of oil and gas properties exceeds a full cost “ceiling,” using an unweighted arithmetic average of
commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months. In addition, gains or losses, if applicable, are
generally recognized on the dispositions of oil and gas property and equipment under the successful efforts method, as
opposed to an adjustment to the net carrying value of the remaining assets under the full cost method. Apache’s consolidated
financial statements have been recast to reflect these differences. The adjustments for the 2014 consolidated balance sheet
also include assets classified as held-for-sale under the successful efforts method of accounting.
The following tables present the effects of the change to the successful efforts method in the statement of consolidated

3.   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
2015 Activity
Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Limited Sale
In October 2015, Apache sold its 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Limited (YPHPL) for total cash proceeds of
$391 million. The investment in YPHPL was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded
as a component of “Deferred charges and other” in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet and the results of operations
recorded as a component of “Other” under “Revenue and other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations. As of

Egypt Partnership
On November 14, 2013, Apache completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to a
subsidiary of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec). Apache received cash
consideration of $2.95 billion after customary closing adjustments. Apache continues to operate its Egypt upstream oil and
gas business. Apache recorded $1.8 billion of the proceeds as a non-controlling interest, which is reflected as a separate
component of equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. This represents one-third of Apache’s net book value of
its Egypt holdings at the time of the transaction.
Gulf of Mexico Shelf Divestiture
On September 30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties to Fieldwood
Energy LLC (Fieldwood), an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache received cash
consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities. Additionally,
Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed
blocks. The effective date of the agreement was July 1, 2013. Apache recognized a $1.6 billion loss as a result of this
transaction, of which approximately $632 million was associated with goodwill.
Canada LNG Project
In February 2013, Apache completed a transaction with Chevron Canada Limited (Chevron Canada) under which each
company became a 50 percent owner of the Kitimat LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership (PTP), and
644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Under the terms of the transaction, Apache acquired
additional interest in the LNG plant, PTP, and other related assets from Chevron, and Chevron separately purchased interests
in Apache's undeveloped acreage and associated upstream assets. Apache received a net payment from the transaction of
$396 million after post-closing adjustments. Proceeds associated with the divested undeveloped acreage and upstream
assets were approximately $644 million, and the Company recognized a gain of $398 million.

 $ 61  $ 3  $ —  $ 58
Projects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling
are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development.
Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects.
Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December
31, 2015, primarily relate to the Aviat discovery in the North Sea. The projects associated with the Aviat discovery are
comprised of exploration and appraisal drilling activities. The suspended exploratory well costs are pending as additional
costs are being incurred to execute a development plan designed to deliver fuel gas to the Forties field, substantially reducing
operating costs and extending field life by replacing diesel fuel usage.

5.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Objectives and Strategies
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production.
Apache manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude
oil and natural gas production. When appropriate, the Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments,
including swaps and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. As of
December 31, 2015, Apache had no open commodity derivative positions.

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar
activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the
expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-
adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent
future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is
made to the oil and gas property balance.
Accretion expense for 2015 and 2014 includes discontinued operations of $13 million and $27 million, respectively, which
are included in “Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in the statement of consolidated operations.
During 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded $68 million and $171 million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting
from Apache’s active exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties,
platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period.

8.    DEBT
Overview
All of the Company’s debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and
interest. The indentures for the notes described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s
ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon certain
changes in control, all of these debt instruments would be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the holders. None
of the indentures for the notes contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
In September 2015, the Company fully redeemed its $500 million 5.625% notes due in 2017 and its $400 million 1.75% notes
due in 2017. The notes were redeemed pursuant to the provisions of each respective note’s indenture. Apache paid the
holders an aggregate of $939 million in cash reflecting principal and the premium to par, and an additional $8 million in
accrued and unpaid interest.

Fair Value
The Company’s debt is recorded at the carrying amount, net of unamortized discount, on its consolidated balance sheet. The
carrying amount of the Company’s commercial paper and uncommitted credit facilities and overdraft lines approximate fair
value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. Apache uses a market approach to determine the
fair value of its fixed-rate debt using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2
fair value measurement).

Total Debt
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which requires debt
issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. The Company
adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the changes retrospectively for all periods presented. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had debt issuance costs of $61 million and $67 million, respectively, classified
as a long-term asset as a component of "deferred charges and other" on the balance sheet that have been netted against
"long-term debt" in these financial statements.
Money Market and Overdraft Lines of Credit
The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft lines of credit that are used from time to time for working
capital purposes. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there was no outstanding balance on Apache’s lines of credit.
Unsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities
In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache’s
two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million
letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may
be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial
paper program. In connection with entry into the $3.5 billion facility, Apache terminated $5.3 billion in commitments under
existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2015, aggregate available borrowing capacity under this credit facility was $3.5
billion.
At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a
margin or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. At December 31, 2015, the margin over LIBOR was 1.0
percent. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at per annum rate on total commitments, which at December 31, 2015
was 0.125 percent of the total $3.5 billion in commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s
senior long-term debt rating.
The financial covenants of the credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater
than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-
downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015.
F-28
APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-
related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary
assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’
liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s
consolidated assets, or approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability
to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of
non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
There are no clauses in the facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
material adverse changes. The credit facility agreement does not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in
the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and
terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its U.S. or Canadian
subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable
judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity
and terminate lending commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified
pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility as of December 31, 2015.
In February 2016, Apache entered into a three-year letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, with options
to increase commitments to £1.075 billion and extend the term by one year. The facility is available for letters of credit and
loans to cash collateralize letter of credit obligations to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The
facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s $3.5
billion revolving credit facility. Commissions are payable on outstanding letters of credit and borrowings bear interest (at a
base rate or LIBOR), plus a margin. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on
Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating. The Company has not requested any letters of credit or borrowings under
this facility as of the date of the Previously Filed Annual Report. This facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit
needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions.
Commercial Paper Program
The Company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up
to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity
under the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no commercial paper
outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $1.6 billion in commercial paper outstanding.
Subsidiary Notes – Apache Finance Canada
Apache Finance Canada has approximately $300 million of publicly traded notes due in 2029 that are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. For further discussion of subsidiary debt, please see Note 18—Supplemental

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,” which requires all
companies to classify deferred tax assets, liabilities, and related valuation allowances as noncurrent on the balance sheet
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption allowed. Apache has elected to adopt the
accounting standard for the year ended December 31, 2015 and as a result, all deferred tax assets, liabilities, and related
valuation allowances are classified as noncurrent on Apache Corporation’s December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.
Prior consolidated balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted.
Net deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows:

In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream
assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of $560 million.
Pursuant to its plan of divestiture of these assets, Apache recorded a deferred income tax liability of $560 million on
undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
In 2014, Apache evaluated its permanent reinvestment position and determined that undistributed earnings from certain
foreign subsidiaries located in Apache’s Australia, Egypt, and North Sea regions will no longer be permanently reinvested.
As a result of this change in position, the Company recorded $560 million of U.S. deferred income tax expense on
undistributed earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested as a component of continuing operations. In
addition, the Company recorded $311 million and $225 million of U.S. deferred income tax expense on foreign earnings that
were distributed to the U.S. in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company’s Canadian subsidiaries do not currently have
undistributed earnings.
In 2015, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015 that provides tax relief to exploration and development (E&P)
companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective
January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related
to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.
The Company has recorded an increase in valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets, primarily driven
by asset impairments. The Company has assessed the future potential realization of these deferred tax assets and has
concluded that it is more likely than not that these foreign deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic
conditions and expectations for the future.

In 2015, the Company recorded a $19 million reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the current year. In 2014, the

absolute certainty, and differences between what has been recorded and the eventual outcomes may occur. The Company
believes that it has adequately provided for income taxes and any related interest and penalties for all open tax years.
Apache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign

10.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal Matters
Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and
regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of approximately $29 million for all legal contingencies that are
deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information known
about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ
from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be
material to Apache’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material
matters that Apache believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the
matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the
loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Argentine Claims
On March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ operations
and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the
past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have
agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of $100 million. The
indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss
sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the
indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider
claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification
obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to $67.5 million pursuant to the terms
and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer.
Louisiana Restoration 
Louisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming that
operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises,
including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to their original condition, regardless of the
value of the underlying property. From time-to-time restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts
that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each
of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material, except as noted.
Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment
against Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.
On July 24, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Board of Commissioners of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority – East
v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company et al., Case No. 2013-6911 was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans,
State of Louisiana, in which plaintiff on behalf of itself and as the board governing the levee districts of Orleans, Lake Borgne
Basin, and East Jefferson alleges that Louisiana coastal lands have been damaged as a result of oil and gas industry activity,
including a network of canals for access and pipelines. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief in the form of
abatement and restoration based on claims of negligence, strict liability, natural servitude of drain, public nuisance, private
nuisance, and breach of contract – third party beneficiary. Apache has been indiscriminately named as one of many
defendants in the lawsuit. In 2014 the Louisiana state government passed a law (SB 469) clarifying that only entities
authorized under the Coastal Zone Management Act may bring litigation to assert claims arising out of the permitted activities.
Plaintiff is not one of those authorized entities. On February 13, 2015, the federal court entered judgment in favor of
defendants dismissing all of plaintiff’s claims with prejudice on various grounds, and plaintiff has appealed. The overall
exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible,
Apache intends to continue to vigorously oppose the claims, including by defending against plaintiff’s appeal of the federal
court’s judgment.

On November 8, 2013, Plaquemines Parish filed three lawsuits against Apache and various other oil and gas producers in

996; Parish of Plaquemines v. Apache Oil Corporation et al., Docket No. 610; and Parish of Plaquemines v. HHE Energy
Company et al., Docket No. 60-983. On or about February 4, 2016, Cameron Parish filed six new lawsuits against Apache
and various other oil and gas producers in the Parish’s 38th Judicial District Court, captioned Parish of Cameron v. BEPCO,
L.P., et al., Docket No. 10-19572; Parish of Cameron v. BP America Production Company et al., Docket No. 10-19576; Parish
of Cameron v. Apache Corporation (of Delaware) et al., Docket No. 10-19579; Parish of Cameron v. Atlantic Richfield

and Parish of Cameron v. Auster Oil and Gas, Inc., et al, Docket No. 10-19582. Many similar lawsuits have been filed against
other oil and gas producers in Parishes across south Louisiana. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that certain
of defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in
violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules,
orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that
defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek,
among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable state law within the coastal zone, the payment
of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its
original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. On November 21, 2015, the Plaquemines
Parish Council voted to drop all of that Parish’s lawsuits, and as a result Apache anticipates that the Parish’s claims will be
dismissed. The Cameron Parish lawsuits are pending. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible,
Apache intends to vigorously oppose these claims.
In a case captioned State of Louisiana and the Cameron Parish School Board v. Apache Corporation et al., Docket No. 10-
18672, in the 38th Judicial District Court, Parish of Cameron, State of Louisiana, plaintiffs alleged that defendants’ oil and gas
exploration and production activities contaminated plaintiffs’ property. Plaintiffs sought damages in the range of $7 million to
$96 million, plus exemplary damages, costs, and fees. Apache, a defendant in the case, acquired its interest in the oil and
gas operations on plaintiffs’ property from the former operator, defendant Davis Oil Company, and subsequently sold the
interest to defendant Wagner Oil Company (Wagner). Apache has settled with plaintiffs on confidential terms, including for an
exchange of consideration that is not material to Apache. Apache claims indemnity from, and has reserved all of its rights
against, Wagner.
Australia Gas Pipeline Force Majeure 
In June 2008, Company subsidiaries reported a pipeline explosion in Western Australia that interrupted deliveries of natural
gas to customers under various long-term contracts. The civil lawsuits concerning the pipeline explosion, all of which were
filed in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, have been resolved fully and dismissed on confidential terms, including for
an exchange of consideration that is not material to Apache. All matters relating to the Australia gas pipeline force majeure
are concluded.
Apollo Exploration Lawsuit
In a case captioned Apollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. & SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation, Cause
No. CV50538 in the 385th Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, in a Second Amended Petition on February 27,
2015, plaintiffs allege damages in excess of $1.1 billion relating to certain purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases,
and areas of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties,
Texas. Apache believes that plaintiffs’ claims lack merit, and further that plaintiffs’ alleged damages are grossly inflated.
Apache will vigorously oppose the claims.
Escheat Audits
In September 2010, the State of Delaware, Department of Finance, Division of Revenue (Unclaimed Property) (Delaware),
notified Apache Corporation that Delaware’s consultant, Kelmar Associates (Kelmar), will examine Apache’s books and
records and those of its subsidiaries and related entities to determine compliance with Delaware Escheat Laws. After more
than five years of review, on January 13, 2016, Delaware confirmed that the Company has no liability for the disbursements
property category for transaction years 2004 through 2009, which is a change in the Company’s favor from Delaware’s
September 2015 assessment in the amount of $237,000. Delaware has advised the Company that Kelmar’s review for this
property category is not complete for transaction years 1986 through 2003, and is still in process for other property types and
years as well. While reserving all rights, the Company will continue to cooperate fully with Delaware until the review is
complete. The Company’s exposure for the remainder of the Delaware audit is not currently determinable. At least 30 other
states have retained their own consultants and have sent similar audit notifications. The scope of each state’s audit varies. It
is possible that one or more of the audits could extend to all 50 states.

Burrup-Related Gas Supply Lawsuits
In a case captioned Pankaj Oswal v. Apache Corporation, No. WAD 389/2013, in the Federal Court of Australia, District of
Western Australia, plaintiff asserted claims against the Company under the Australian Trade Practices Act alleging, among
other things, that the Company induced him to make investments covering construction cost overruns on the Burrup Fertilisers
ammonia plant in Western Australia (the Burrup plant), which was completed in 2006. Plaintiff sought damages in the amount
of $491 million USD. On the eve of a trial that was to commence on February 9, 2015, plaintiff decided to discontinue his
lawsuit. On March 18, 2015, the court entered a final order dismissing the case. The lawsuit is concluded in the Company’s
favor.
The Western Australia lawsuit is one of a number of legal actions involving the Burrup plant. Pankaj Oswal’s shares, and
those of his wife Radhika Oswal, together representing 65 percent of Burrup Holdings Limited (BHL, as it was then known,
which owns Burrup Fertilisers), were offered for sale by externally-appointed administrators in Australia as a result of events
of default on loans made to the Oswals and associated entities by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ).
As part of the sale process, on January 31, 2012, a Company affiliate, Apache Fertilisers Pty Ltd (AFPL), acquired a 49
percent interest in BHL (now known as Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd, YPHPL), while Yara Australia Pty Ltd (Yara) increased
its interest in YPHPL from 35 percent to 51 percent. On October 28, 2015, Yara and its related bodies corporate acquired all
of the shares of AFPL. Yara operates the ammonia plant and is proceeding with development of a technical ammonium
nitrate (TAN) plant in the Burrup Peninsula region of Western Australia to be developed by a consortium including YPHPL.
The old gas sale agreement to supply natural gas to the ammonia plant, and to which a former Company subsidiary was a
party, has been modified with, among other things, new pricing, delivery quantities, and term.
YPHPL share ownership and the modified gas sale agreement continue to be the subject of ongoing litigation in Australia. In
cases captioned Radhika Oswal v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited & Ors, No. SCI 2011 4653, and
Pankaj Oswal v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited & Ors, No. SCI 2012 1995, in the Supreme Court of
Victoria, the Oswal plaintiffs seek to set aside the YPHPL share sales, void the modified gas sale agreement, and recover
damages in the range of $833 million to $2.274 billion (plus interest, costs, and fees) allegedly resulting from the sale of their
shares at undervalue. The cases are presently set for trial commencing May 2016. The Company is a named defendant and
is also defending Apache Energy Limited (now known as Quadrant Energy Australia Limited) and Apache Northwest Pty Ltd
(now known as Quadrant Northwest Pty Ltd). Yara has assumed full conduct and control of the defense of AFPL (now known
as Chemical Holdings Pty Ltd). Apache believes that plaintiffs’ claims lack merit, and further that plaintiffs’ alleged damages
are grossly inflated. Apache will vigorously oppose the claims.
 
Environmental Matters
The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of
pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the
Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we
believe is customary in the industry, although we are not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes
in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood
that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters,
incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a
significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties,
depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition,
require the seller to remediate the property to Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the
property. The Company’s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable
to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved
for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In Apache’s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to
training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $52
million. Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 2015 that have not been provided for or
would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance however,
that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered
on the Company’s properties.

With respect to the leak of produced water discovered on June 1, 2013, from a below ground pipeline in the Zama Operations
area in northern Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator completed its investigation of the incident and issued an administrative
penalty to Apache Canada Ltd. (ACL) in the amount of $16,500 CAD. The June 2013 leak resulted from a pinhole feature in
the outer polyethylene liner of the composite flex line.
On October 19, 2015, the Crown served ACL with a summons and information containing charges relating to a leak of
produced water in the Zama area that occurred on or between October 3 and October 25, 2013. The October 2013 leak
occurred following damage to a riser by an independent external force. The seven-count charge could result in the levying of
a fine. On January 18, 2016, the Crown served ACL with a summons and information containing charges relating to a
separate leak of produced water in the Belloy Field operating area that occurred on or about January 20, 2014. The January
2014 leak occurred following the collapse and failure of an internal polyethylene liner on a water injection pipeline. The five-
count charge could result in the levying of a fine. ACL will respond to the charges in due course. While the exposure related
to these incidents is not currently determinable, the Company does not expect the economic impact of these incidents to have
a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
LNG Divestiture Dispute
In respect of the purchase by Woodside of the Company’s interest in the Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG projects and
accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves from the Company and its subsidiaries, the base purchase price is subject to
adjustment in accordance with the terms of the applicable sale and purchase agreement. Woodside has notified the
Company and its subsidiaries that it seeks purchase price adjustments in the net amounts of $175 million (for working capital
adjustments), which the Company and its subsidiaries believe is time-barred, and $214 million (for all other adjustments). To
the extent the parties are unable to resolve their differences, the disputes will be referred to an independent accounting expert
and/or court proceedings for final determination under the terms of the applicable sale and purchase agreement. The
Company believes that under the terms of the sale and purchase agreements, Woodside’s requests for payment of purchase
price adjustments lack merit; therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability associated with this dispute.

11.    RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings
plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement
savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to 50 percent of
eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of 8 percent
of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company, at its discretion, annually contributes 6 percent
of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan
and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit
the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-
qualified retirement/savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to
50 percent of each employee’s base salary, up to 75 percent of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee
contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the
401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.
Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified
retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of 20 percent for every
completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.
Additionally, Apache Canada Ltd. and Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as required under the
laws of Canada and the U.K., respectively.
The aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement/savings
plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $77 million, $107 million, and $123 million for 2015, 2014,
and 2013, respectively.
Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees
of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and
final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the
acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.
Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements.
Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65 or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided
the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions
adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes
eligible for Medicare.

As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the accumulated benefit obligation for the U.K. Pension Plan was $169 million,
$183 million, and $160 million, respectively.
Apache’s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a non-related trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets
in a blend of equity securities and low-risk debt securities. The Company intends that this blend of investments will provide a
reasonable rate of return such that the benefits promised to members are provided. The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target
an ongoing funding level of 100 percent through prudent investments and includes policies and strategies such as investment
goals, risk management practices, and permitted and prohibited investments. A breakout of previous allocations for plan asset
holdings and the target allocation for the Company’s plan assets are summarized below:

Common Stock Dividend
The Company paid common stock dividends of $1.00 per share in 2015, $0.95 per share in 2014, and $0.77 per share in
2013.
Stock Compensation Plans
The Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. On May 5, 2011, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2011 Omnibus
Equity Compensation Plan (the 2011 Plan), which is intended to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives.
The 2011 Plan provides for the granting of Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards,
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, or any combination of the foregoing. A total of 18.0
million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2011 Plan as of December 31, 2015. Previously approved
plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2011
Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2011 Plan.
For 2015, 2014, and 2013, stock-based compensation expensed was $100 million, $148 million, and $136 million ($65
million, $95 million, and $94 million after tax), respectively. Costs related to the plans are capitalized or expensed based on
the nature of each employee’s activities. A description of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related costs

Stock Options
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had issued options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under one
or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in 2000 and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option Plans), as well as the
2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan), and the 2011 Plan discussed above (together, the Omnibus
Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises; however, under the 2000 Stock
Option Plan, shares of treasury stock are used for employee stock option exercises to the extent treasury stock is held. Under
the Stock Option Plans and the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache’s
common stock on the date of grant. Prior to 2016, options generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year period and
expire 10 years after granted. The Omnibus Plans and all of the Stock Option Plans, except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan,
were submitted to and approved by the Company’s shareholders.

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding, expected to vest, and
exercisable is 4.5 years, 6.9 years, and 4.1 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding,
expected to vest, and exercisable at year-end was nil.
The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was approximately $3 million, $13 million and $4
million, respectively. The cash received from exercise of options during 2015 was approximately $16 million. The Company
realized an additional tax benefit of approximately $973,767 for the amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost
recognized in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized
was $5 million, which will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options.
In February 2016, the Company issued 872,574 options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock to eligible
employees under the 2011 Plan. The total compensation cost of $9 million is estimated to be recognized over a three years
vesting period of these options.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The Company has restricted stock and restricted stock unit plans for eligible employees including officers. The programs
created under the Omnibus Plans have been approved by Apache’s Board of Directors. In 2015, the Company awarded
2,976,562 restricted stock units at a weighted-average per-share market price of $61.65. In 2014 and 2013, the Company
awarded 3,046,744 and 3,098,029 restricted stock units at a weighted-average per-share market price of $86.87 and $82.95,
respectively. The value of the stock issued was established by the market price on the date of grant and is being recorded as
compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, $90 million ($58 million after tax), $93
million ($60 million after tax), and $82 million ($53 million after tax), respectively, was charged to expense. In 2015, 2014, and
2013, $48 million, $43 million, and $30 million was for exploration and development activities, respectively. As of
December 31, 2015, there was $217 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 4,570,203 unvested restricted
stock units. The weighted-average remaining life of unvested restricted stock units is approximately 1.1 years.
 
The fair value of the awards vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $149 million, $138 million, and $88
million, respectively. A summary of restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2015, is presented below.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
In February 2016, the Company issued 2,881,924 shares of restricted stock units at a weighted-average per-share market
price of $41.24 under the 2011 Plan to eligible employees. The total compensation cost of $119 million is estimated to be
recognized over a three year vesting period of these restricted stock units.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Stock Units
To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver competitive returns to the Company’s stockholders, the
Company has granted conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. The ultimate number of shares awarded from
these conditional restricted stock units is based upon measurement of total shareholder return of Apache common stock as
compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Should any restricted stock units be awarded
at the end of the three-year performance period, 50 percent of restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an
additional 25 percent will vest on succeeding anniversaries of the end of the performance period. Grants from the total
shareholder return programs were outstanding at December 31, 2015, as described below:
In January 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2013 TSR Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. In January
2013 eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 1,232,176 units. In May 2013, the
Company’s Board of Directors cancelled 918,016 awards under the 2013 Performance Program for nonexecutive
employees. A total of 108,217 awards were outstanding at December 31, 2015, from which a minimum of zero and a
maximum of 216,434 units could be awarded.
In January 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2014 TSR Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. In January
2014 eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 157,406 units. A total of 63,995
awards were outstanding at December 31, 2015, from which a minimum of zero and a maximum of 127,990 units could be
awarded.
•
•
The fair value cost of the awards was estimated on the date of grant and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably
over the vesting terms. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, $648,000 ($418,000 after tax), $18 million ($11 million after tax), and
$27 million ($17 million after tax), respectively, was charged to expense. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, $267,000, $7 million,
and $13 million was for exploration and development activities, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, there was $4.7 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 172,212 unvested conditional restricted stock units. The weighted-average
remaining life of the unvested conditional restricted stock units is approximately 1.8 years.

The fair value of each conditional restricted stock unit award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo
simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a three-year continuous risk-free
interest rate; (ii) a constant volatility assumption based on the historical realized stock price volatility of the Company and
the designated peer group; and (iii) the historical stock prices and expected dividends of the common stock of the
Company and its designated peer group.

Business Performance Restricted Stock Units
Beginning in 2015, Apache issued a new business performance program to certain eligible employees with 50 percent of the
shares payout based upon the TSR program payout model as described above, and the remaining 50 percent of the shares
based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives will be calculated
at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted
stock units awarded. The actual amount of shares awarded will be between zero and 150 percent of target. The business
performance shares will immediately vest 50 percent at the end of the three-year performance period, with the remaining 50
percent vesting at the end of the following year.
In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2015 Business Performance Program, pursuant to the
2011 Plan. Eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 602,304 units. A total of
500,972 units were outstanding as of December 31, 2015, from which a minimum of zero and a maximum of 751,458 shares
could be awarded. The fair value cost of the awards was estimated on the date of grant and is being recorded as
compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. During 2015, $3.4 million ($2.2 million after tax) and $1.4 million were
charged to expense and for exploration and development activities, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, there was $29
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 500,972 unvested conditional restricted stock units. The weighted-
average remaining life of the unvested conditional restricted stock units is approximately 2.4 years.

restricted stock unit totaling 855,263, with the ultimate number of restricted stock units to be awarded ranging from zero to a
maximum of 1,710,526 units. The grant date fair value per award was $36.55.

Oil and Gas Operations
The following table sets forth revenue and direct cost information relating to the Company’s oil and gas exploration and
production activities. Apache has no long-term agreements to purchase oil or gas production from foreign governments or
authorities. In the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets,
and as such the results of Australia oil and gas assets have been classified as discontinued operations.

Oil and Gas Reserve Information
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids (NGLs)
that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and
gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The
Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest”
method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in
the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program
using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is
based. Economically producible means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to
exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be
recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been
field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the
formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different
traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: 1) performance-based methods; 2) volumetric-based
methods; and 3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer
reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support
for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to
enhance the certainty of our reserve estimates.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and
should not be construed as being exact.

(1)    2015, 2014, and 2013 include total proved reserves of 101 MMboe, 93 MMboe, and 90 MMboe, respectively, attributable
to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.
 
During 2015, Apache sold a combined 385 MMboe through several divestiture transactions: 55 MMboe in Canada, 328
MMboe in Australia, and 2 MMboe in the North Sea. The Company added 7 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through
purchases of minerals in-place and 117 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 53
MMboe in North America, primarily associated with our drilling programs in the Canadian liquid-rich gas targets of Duvernay
and Montney formations and Permian Basin drilling for Wolfcamp, Yeso, Lower Spraberry, and Bone Spring formations. The
Company also had additional drilling success in the Woodford, Canyon Lime, Marmaton, and Eagle Ford formations in the
MidContinent/Gulf Coast region.

onshore exploration and appraisal activity in the West Kalabsha, Shushan, and Khalda concessions. Egypt also continued
development of the Ptah, Berenice, and Razzak fields during 2015. The North Sea offshore region contributed 24 MMboe
from exploration success in the Callater discovery and continued development in the Beryl, Forties, and Nevis fields.
During 2015, Apache also had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 365 MMboe. Changes in
product prices accounted for 339 MMboe, lease ownership changes accounted for 16 MMboe, and engineering and
performance revisions totaled 10 MMboe.
Approximately 9 percent of Apache’s year-end 2015 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not
producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or
zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are
considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric
calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow
depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these
reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 16, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”

Future Net Cash Flows
Future cash inflows as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and
gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual
arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs
with no escalation.
The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of
income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax
deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information
does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized
disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.

Continuing operating expenses for 2015 include non-cash asset impairments totaling $2.1 billion, $660 million, $4.1
billion, and $5.1 billion in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. Continuing operating expenses
for 2014 include non-cash asset impairments totaling $115 million, $162 million, $123 million, and $8.7 billion in the first,
second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively.
The sum of the individual quarterly net income per common share amounts may not agree with full-year net income per
common share as each quarterly computation is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during that period.
