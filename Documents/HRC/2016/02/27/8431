<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the second submitted to the Human Rights Council by the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, since her 
appointment in June 2009. The report begins by presenting the activities carried out by the 
Special Rapporteur in 2010, to focus subsequently on some aspects of the multi-faceted 
relationship between gender and the judiciary, within the broader context of the 
administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>2. The report focuses on two main thematic clusters. Within the thematic cluster on 
gender and the administration of justice, the report addresses major obstacles to women&#8217;s 
pathways to justice, including the feminization of poverty as well as laws, policies and 
practices that discriminate against women, and sets out the conditions required for the 
effective realization of women&#8217;s right to access to justice. Within the thematic cluster on 
gender and the judiciary, the report focuses on the conditions for developing a gender-
sensitive judiciary, and the role of the judiciary in advancing women&#8217;s human rights. The 
Special Rapporteur also presents a number of good practices and makes recommendations 
to Governments, the international community and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>3. The activities of the Special Rapporteur are carried out in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 8/6. Human Rights Council Resolutions 12/3 and 15/3 provide 
further thematic guidance for the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Country visits and communications with Member States 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since her appointment to the mandate in June 2009, the Special Rapporteur has 
requested invitations to visit the following countries: Argentina, Bulgaria, Colombia, 
Guinea-Bissau, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Mexico, Mozambique, the Philippines, 
Romania and Turkey. She has visited Colombia,1 Mexico,2 and Mozambique.3 She plans to 
visit Bulgaria and Romania in May 2011. She has also been invited to visit Turkey and 
Guinea-Bissau. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Governments of those 
States that have responded positively to her requests for visits and urges Governments that 
have not yet provided a response to do so. 
</p>
<p>5. From 1 January 2010 to 15 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 114 
communications alleging violations of human rights in the context of her mandate to 48 
Member States and one to another actor. Of the communications that were sent, 97 were 
urgent appeals and the remaining 17 were letters of allegation. A summary of all 
communications sent from 16 March 2010 to 15 March 2011 is included in 
A/HRC/17/30/Add.1.

 3 A/HRC/17/30/Add.2. </p>


<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. From 12 to 14 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Congress of the 
Latin American Federation of Magistrates (FLAM) in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where she 
gave a speech and facilitated a section on the independence of the judiciary in the region.  
</p>
<p>7. On 21 April she was the keynote speaker on &#8220;Human Rights and Judicial 
Independence&#8221; at the International Seminar on Human Rights and Judicial Independence 
organized by the Association of Judges for Democracy and the Center for Justice and 
International Law, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. 
</p>
<p>8. From 11 to 15 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 10th Biennial 
International Conference of the International Association of Women Judges, where she 
presented a statement entitled &#8220;Terrorism and global security: threats to the independence 
of the judiciary in a changing world&#8221;, in Seoul, Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>9. On 3 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur addressed a side event on &#8220;Protective 
measures for judges and lawyers&#8221;, organized by Lawyers for Lawyers and Lawyers Rights 
Watch Canada, in collaboration with Judges for Judges and the International Commission 
of Jurists (ICJ) at the 14th session of the Human Rights Council at the United Nations 
Office in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>10. On 4 June the Special Rapporteur chaired a side event on &#8220;Capacity building and 
human rights training as a fundamental pillar for judicial independence&#8221;, convened by the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in cooperation with the Permanent 
Missions of Brazil and Hungary at the 14th session of the Human Rights Council at the 
United Nations Office in Geneva.   
</p>
<p>11. On 25 June the Special Rapporteur attended an event organized by Judges for Judges 
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, speaking on the issue of &#8220;The Effective Role of the Special 
Rapporteur and NGOs&#8221; and participated in a panel focusing on different cases around the 
world in which the independence of the judiciary had been compromised.  
</p>
<p>12. From 28 June to 2 July, the Special Rapporteur participated in the seventeenth 
meeting of mandate holders of the special procedures, held in Geneva (28 June - 2 July). 
</p>
<p>13. On 29 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in the &#8220;Attention to 
Victims of Terrorism and Other Violent Crimes&#8221; training course, organized by the Spanish 
Cooperation Training Centre in Montevideo, Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>14. On 22 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur submitted her annual report to the 
General Assembly4 on the role of judicial actors in ensuring accountability for human rights 
violations and combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>15. On 1 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur gave some of the opening remarks  at 
the International Summit of High Courts, organized by the Court of Cassation of Turkey 
and the United Nations Development Programme, in Istanbul, Turkey. 
</p>
<p>16. From 7 to 11 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur attended the annual meeting 
of the International Association of Judges, in Dakar, Senegal. 
</p>
<p>17. On November 12, she participated in the Solemn Session of signing the constitution 
of the International Union of Portuguese-Speaking Judges  with a speech on the exchange 
of best practices as a way to strengthen the administration of justice and the independence 
of the judiciary, in Praia City, Cape Verde. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b> III. Gender and the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>18. Developing a gender-sensitive judicial system is a prerequisite for the full and non-
discriminatory realization of human rights for all, and the achievement of gender equality 
on the ground. Despite important progress over the past few decades, globally women have 
yet to be considered as key actors in the administration of justice, and their equality before 
the law and the courts has yet to become a reality in many countries.   
</p>
<p>19. Many gender-specific obstacles that stand in the way of women's equality in the 
administration of justice include the feminization of poverty as well as laws, policies and 
practices that discriminate against women. These factors manifestly limit women's ability to 
seek redress and resort to tribunals in their quest for justice. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The feminization of poverty and the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>20. Discrimination based on sex is often at the root of women&#8217;s poverty5 as this is 
commonly the result of exclusion, and the absence of equal opportunities between women 
and men. This is also frequently an element that exacerbates vulnerability for certain groups 
of women such as asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants and those belonging to minorities 
and indigenous peoples, who frequently struggle not to be left on the outskirts of society.  
</p>
<p>21. Historical denial of autonomy, lack of access to education and support services, 
together with women&#8217;s minimal participation in decision-making processes have also had 
the detrimental effect of leaving women at the periphery of societies. Additional factors that 
exacerbate the so-called &#8220;feminization of poverty&#8221; include harmful practices, the absence of 
economic opportunities for women, gender inequalities in economic power-sharing, 
unequal distribution of unremunerated work between women and men, lack of 
technological and financial support for women&#8217;s entrepreneurship, unequal access to, and 
control over, capital, particularly land and credit, and access to labour markets.   
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that deep economic inequalities 
continue to seriously hamper women&#8217;s human rights and are a common obstacle for 
women's access to justice. She also notes that socio-economic conditions and, sometimes 
stereotyping,6 are obstacles faced by the great majority of women around the globe when 
attempting to enforce their rights. This is the case in countries where women may find 
themselves widowed and heads of households with no property rights, including the right to 
inherit the property of their deceased husbands, which they have lived in for years. As a 
result, they may be displaced from their land, and left behind without adequate housing and 
means to generate income for themselves and their children.7  
</p>
<p>23. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the consequences of 
judicial rulings which enforce laws that discriminate against women. Unsatisfactory divorce 
settlements, courts' refusals to grant emergency financial relief when victims of domestic 
violence apply for a civil court protection order, and judicial decisions that do not 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Several studies and surveys indicate that poverty is becoming increasingly feminized, that is, an 
</p>
<p>increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s poor are female. See, inter alia, Valentine M. Moghadam, &#8220;The 
&#8216;Feminization of Poverty&#8217; and Women&#8217;s Human Rights&#8221;, SHS Papers in Women&#8217;s Studies/Gender 
Research, No. 2 (UNESCO, July 2005), p. 2.  
</p>
<p> 6 A stereotype is a generalized view or preconception of attributes or characteristics possessed by, or 
the roles that are or should be performed by, members of a particular group. See Rebecca J. Cook and 
Simone Cusack, Gender Stereotyping: Transnational Legal Perspectives, (University of Pennsylvania 
Press 2010), p. 9. 
</p>
<p> 7 See, for example, A/HRC/14/31/Add.1, paras. 18 and 20. </p>


<p>recognize, for example, women's rights to an effective judicial remedy, contribute to an 
increase in the feminization of poverty.  
</p>
<p>24. In many countries, a lack of access to the formal justice system, sometimes due to 
economic reasons, demonstrates that women's access to justice is frequently through 
traditional or community-based justice mechanisms, and sometimes through alternative 
dispute resolution mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>25. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the availability of those mechanisms in 
some States, and acknowledges their advantages in terms of proximity, costs and efficiency, 
she wishes to draw attention to the need to establish oversight mechanisms to ensure that 
traditional, community and alternative justice mechanisms uphold human rights norms and 
effectively protect and empower women. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that, in some instances, traditional or community-based justice mechanisms 
reinforce gender stereotypes and disregard gender considerations and women&#8217;s rights. 
Furthermore, in most places, they are constituted by male elders, and sometimes reportedly 
apply a male-biased interpretation of customary laws.8 
</p>
<p>26. In line with the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that, under 
international law and human rights standards, States have the obligation to remove socio-
economic barriers which impede access to justice.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Laws, policies and practices that discriminate against women 
</b></p>
<p>27. The most comprehensive international treaty focusing explicitly on the rights of 
women is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women,9 which sets out measures required for the elimination of any &#8220;distinction, 
exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of 
impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of 
their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field&#8221;.10 
It enshrines the minimum standards that States must uphold for every woman under their 
jurisdiction to enjoy human rights without discrimination and recognizes the particular risk 
of women to discrimination in specific circumstances due to gender roles and stereotypes 
within the public and private spheres.11  
</p>
<p>28. Under the Convention, States parties have the obligation to take all appropriate 
measures, including legislative measures, to modify or abolish customs and practices which 
discriminate against women.12 States are further required to take steps to eliminate 
prejudices and change practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority 
of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.13 States parties to the 
Convention are obliged to ensure that its provisions and principles are fully reflected and 
given legal effect in relevant domestic legislation, as well as through competent national 
tribunals and other public institutions14 and through the issuance of sanctions where

<p>appropriate.15 The Convention is therefore an essential instrument to ensure gender equality 
and that the administration of justice is free from discrimination.  
</p>
<p>29. Despite the comprehensive legal framework and some progress made, major gender-
specific obstacles remain to ensuring women&#8217;s effective protection and the realization of 
women's right to access to justice. These include laws that discriminate against women; 
policies, plans and programmes that disregard the goal of gender equality; and the 
persistence, in some countries, of practices that discriminate against or are harmful to 
women.  
</p>
<p>30. In certain countries, laws, policies, plans and programmes disregard the goal of 
gender equality and exclude, or seek to exclude women (and not men in similar conditions) 
from entitlements, opportunities, or benefits, for example, when laws or policies give the 
right of final decision in the exercise of parental rights and duties to fathers but deny this to 
mothers.  
</p>
<p>31. Some areas where the achievement of equality appears to be a challenge still today 
include education, labour, land property, inheritance and family law (e.g. alimony, child 
custody, the right to divorce, and property division rights). Some examples of laws that 
discriminate against women include those that prohibit women from entering certain 
occupations or professions, such as performing jury duty or certain duties within the 
military.   
</p>
<p>32. In certain countries, the lack of recognition of equal rights of women and men, or 
even the institutionalization of inequality, seriously hampers women&#8217;s access to justice. 
This is the case of male guardianship, when women must have the backing of a male 
member of their family in order to have access to justice.16 In some cases women are not 
allowed to file a complaint, serve as witnesses or appear in court without the agreement of a 
male member of the family, or being accompanied by a male guardian. This is of particular 
concern, for example, in cases of domestic violence where the guardian and the alleged 
perpetrator may be one and the same. This is also a serious concern in cases of rape and 
other forms of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), mainly affecting women, which 
are connected with shame for the family, and may result in a male guardian not facilitating 
access to justice. 
</p>
<p>33. In other countries, gender equality is recognized by law but is not reflected in 
practice.  Sometimes harmful practices and prejudices continue to be at the root of the most 
serious, routine violations of women&#8217;s right to equality before the courts and the principle 
of non-discrimination. For example, crimes against women committed in the name of 
&#8220;honour&#8221; are sometimes not effectively sanctioned as they are sometimes wrongly 
considered a cultural or institutionalized practice and therefore mildly penalized or not 
sanctioned by criminal law). In other countries, crimes against women are not prosecuted or 
suspects can easily be exonerated of penal liability, for example when a rapist marries, or 
offers to marry, the victim (in some extreme cases even when the victim is a minor).  
</p>
<p>34. While acknowledging progress made in addressing SGBV17, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to recall that under international law and human rights standards, States are obliged 
to protect women from violence, which is a violation of human rights.18 In her view, 
</p>
<p>

 16 See for example, CEDAW/C/SAU/CO/2, para. 21; CEDAW/C/ARE/CO/1, para. 47.

</p>
<p>against women, Criminal Justice Handbook Series (New York, 2010), p. 2.  
 18 See, inter alia. A/HRC/7/4, paras. 55-58 and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, general recommendation No.19, on violence against women, 1992. </p>


<p>preventing the recurrence of SGBV, including by protecting victims and witnesses of 
gender-based discrimination and re-victimization, and ensuring that SGBV in its multiple 
forms constitutes criminal offences are prerequisites for overcoming impunity, and 
guaranteeing women&#8217;s protection, and equal access to courts and tribunals.19 Some of the 
steps that should be undertaken by States include granting victims of violence the access to 
immediate means of redress and reparation and ensuring the prosecution, punishment and 
rehabilitation of perpetrators. Moreover, States should ensure that mechanisms for 
prosecuting and punishing SGBV perpetrators are available, effective and sensitive to the 
special needs of women victims.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur further invites States to give serious consideration to the 
updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, adopted by the General 
Assembly in 2010.   
</p>
<p>36. In light of the above, courts and tribunals should play a key role in the elimination of 
laws and practices that discriminate against women. As highlighted by the honourable 
Justice of Appeal A.E.N. Mpagi-Bahigeine, referring in 2010 to the practice of female 
genital mutilation: &quot;it is now incumbent upon the judiciary to play the very important role 
in completely eliminating any form of violence against women including female genital 
mutilation. The judiciary being part of the State machinery is enjoined to address this issue 
aggressively whenever it comes before court by involving innovative and progressive 
interpretation of the laws. Failure to do so would be tantamount to a breach by the State of 
its international obligations&quot;.20  
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions required for the effective realization of women&#8217;s right to 
access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>37. In previous instances, this mandate has highlighted that the legal complexity and 
richness of the concept of access to justice lies in the fact that it is both a right in itself and 
the means of restoring the exercise of rights that have been disregarded or violated.21 As an 
indispensable component of specific rights such as the right to liberty and to personal 
safety, it is closely linked to the right to effective judicial protection (fair trial or due 
process),22 the right to an effective remedy23<b> </b>and the right to equality.24 The effective 
realization of the right to access to justice is directly related to the institutional and material 
conditions in which the justice administration system operates, and the factors affecting that 
operation and access to justice.25  
</p>
<p>38. The legal recognition of women's rights, gender equality and the right to effective 
judicial protection are prerequisites for women's right to access to justice. The right of 
women to effective judicial protection entails the recognition of women's right to an 
</p>

<p>effective remedy and fair trial guarantees. Laws, plans, policies or programmes that do not 
give women and men the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an 
independent and impartial court or tribunal previously established by the law are 
discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>39. Remedies should be available and adequate, and therefore, gender-sensitive. These 
are basic conditions for the effective realization of women's right to access to justice. 
Women should therefore be knowledgeable of their rights and of all mechanisms that are 
available to them to seek redress. The State is under the obligation to ensure that those 
mechanisms are accessible to women and that redress is provided with impartiality and 
without discrimination, in particular on the ground of gender. States are therefore obliged 
not to obstruct the right of access to judicial and other remedies against violations of human 
rights, and to remove all obstacles (be they legal, social, cultural, economic or other) that 
prevent or hinder the possibility of access to justice by women.  
</p>
<p>40. Affirmative action, including temporary special measures,26 by States should aim to 
guarantee access to justice on an equal footing by means, for example, of the granting of 
legal aid and assistance for the purposes of securing the effectiveness of this right. Women 
should therefore receive adequate legal aid and counsel as may be required according to 
their specific situation.   
</p>
<p>41. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to insist on the need to establish within 
the State a system to provide adequate legal aid and counsel, with specific focus on women 
from vulnerable backgrounds. In specific circumstances, this system may include for 
example, free public defence for facilitating access to justice by the poor. Adequate legal 
aid and counsel impact positively on other fair trial rights, including the right of equality of 
arms, as the unequal economic or social status of the litigants is usually translated into the 
unequal possibility of defence in trial.27   
</p>
<p>42. The judicial system should enjoy independence and impartiality in the adjudication 
and determination of the most adequate type of redress or compensation to violations of 
women's rights and the State apparatus should have the capacity to enforce orders, judicial 
decisions and other agreements and settlements that advance gender equality and ensure 
women's rights protection. Moreover, the judiciary should enjoy the full cooperation of law 
enforcement officials specially trained on gender issues and women&#8217;s human rights so as to 
uphold accountability.  
</p>
<p>43. States should show their serious resolve, commitment and political will to empower 
women, put an end to discrimination and violence against women, and achieve gender 
equality and advance women&#8217;s protection. Some of the indicators of the State commitment 
to take all steps that are necessary to achieve gender equality include the creation of an 
environment where the rule of law can flourish, together with gender-oriented policy 
analysis, mainstreaming gender in the planning of courses of action to follow in line with 
the international obligations of the State, gender-sensitive justice reform initiatives, and 
marshalling of resources for ensuring gender-sensitive administration of justice. Where 
capacity gaps remain (e.g. lack of human, financial or other resources), the Special 
Rapporteur encourages international cooperation and technical assistance to help in 
building the capacities of Governments, and other stakeholders to identify and address 
gender-specific barriers for the full enjoyment of human rights, filling in protection gaps 
and providing effective remedies and mechanisms for reparation and redress. 
</p>
<p>  
 26  See Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 4.1. 
 27 See A/HRC/8/4, para. 21. </p>


<p>44. Furthermore, the system of administration of justice should take into consideration 
the predominant gender role of women as caretakers, whether of children or elderly parents. 
An administration of justice system which does not take this into account (i.e. 
assistance/relief in taking care of children or other dependants) results in women not being 
able to seek justice.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Gender and the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>45. From a rule of law perspective, achieving gender equality and empowering women 
not only requires a legal system that is consistent with international human rights norms 
and standards. It also requires an independent judiciary able to exercise its role to uphold 
the rule of law and make all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, 
accountable to gender-sensitive laws. An independent, impartial and gender-sensitive 
judiciary therefore plays a crucial role in advancing women&#8217;s human rights, achieving 
gender equality and ensuring that gender considerations are mainstreamed into the 
administration of justice. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers have a special duty at all times to 
be alert to any sign of violence against women, whether State-sponsored, institutional, 
State-tolerated, community violence or violence in the private sphere. The legal protection 
of women must be scrupulously applied in the face of religious, cultural or other local 
customs that may resist the view that a woman&#8217;s life is of equal value to that of a man.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur refers hereinafter to the conditions required to develop a 
gender-sensitive judiciary and the role of the judiciary in advancing women's human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Developing a gender-sensitive judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>47. Developing a gender-sensitive judiciary within the broader context of the 
administration of justice should be a priority for the State. States should therefore 
endeavour to evaluate the structure and composition of the judiciary to ensure adequate 
representation of women and create the conditions necessary for the realization of gender 
equality within the judiciary and for the judiciary to advance the goal of gender equality. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Ensuring adequate representation of women in the judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>48 The trust that societies and women themselves may have in the judiciary is essential 
if courts and tribunals are to be responsive to women&#8217;s needs and protect women&#8217;s human 
rights. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur shares the position expressed by the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, according to which the 
only way to ensure women's perspectives in the administration of justice, including in 
judgments delivered by national tribunals, is through women&#8217;s life experience and therefore 
through the appointment of women judges who also represent the diversity of society and 
who are therefore able to tackle judicial issues with fitting sensitivity.28 
</p>
<p>49. Reflecting the diversity of societies is therefore essential to building trust in the 
judicial system and ensuring that women's experiences and specific needs are taken into 
consideration in all judicial affairs. It is clear that women resorting to courts may feel that 
the judiciary is closer to them when it is composed of fair and impartial judges who 
represent the diversity of society. Women, in particular those belonging to minorities or 
underrepresented groups, should therefore be adequately represented in the judiciary.   
</p>
<p>  
 28 See Statement by Ms. Navanethem Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>International Association of Women Judges, Jubilee Biennial Conference, Seoul, 12 May 2010. </p>


<p>50. The importance of ensuring adequate representation of women in public offices has 
been recognized at the international level, inter alia, in the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 29 and the Beijing Declaration and Platform 
for Action.30 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts by international and 
regional courts and tribunals for the inclusion of adequate gender representation as a 
criterion for the selection of judges.31   
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the fact that equal representation of 
women in the judicial system also includes the defence counsel. In this regard, she wishes 
to draw attention to the creative approach adopted by the International Criminal Court, 
when it was found that in January 2010 that only 61 of the total of 335 counsel registered to 
practise before the Court were women, and less than four per cent of counsel were African 
women. To bridge this gap the Court, in cooperation with the International Bar Association, 
launched the campaign &quot;Calling African Female Lawyers&quot;.32 This innovative effort has 
resulted in an increase in the number of female African counsel on the defence counsel list 
and these female lawyers have also been provided with relevant training.33 
</p>
<p>52. Increasing steps to ensure the equal representation of women and men in the judicial 
system is essential. Where challenges exist in identifying female legal professionals to be 
appointed as judges, prosecutors or included in the list of defence counsel, creative 
strategies, including broadening outreach and networking activities, should be 
implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Mainstreaming gender within the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>53. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, mainstreaming gender within the judiciary implies 
that the multiple roles of women and men are taken into consideration in the conduct of 
business within the judiciary, including in the day-to-day operations and the overall 
planning of the judicial sector. For example, data collection should be sex-disaggregated to 
guide efforts to plan and build sectorial strategies and gender-neutral language should be 
preferred in the rulings, minutes and briefing notes to avoid reproducing and promoting a 
male-centred vision of the world. 
</p>
<p>54. Efforts should be strengthened to ensure that women are not only considered as 
victims or clients within the judiciary, but also as key actors in the administration of justice. 
Women should also be seen as legal professionals with strengths and capacities to 
contribute to the integrity of the justice system.   
</p>
<p>55. In this regard, judges and all judicial staff should be adequately trained and 
sensitized to treat female judges as competent and impartial judges who are committed to 
exercising independent judgement and are capable of taking on cases in all areas of the law. 
The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets that in some instances female judges are considered 
</p>
<p>  
 29 For example, article 7 (b) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women recognizes women's right &#8220;to perform all public functions at all levels.&#8221; 
 30 See Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Strategic objective G.1., para. 190 (a). 
 31 See, inter alia, article 14.3 of the Protocol on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights; Rule 14 of the European Court of Human Rights Rules of Court; Article 36.8 (a) (iii) 
of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

geographical representation and gender balance in the recruitment of staff of the International 
Criminal Court, document No. ICC-ASP/9/30, December 2010, para. 4. </p>


<p>&quot;a soft touch&quot; and therefore are not allocated cases of political, social or economic 
importance on the sole basis of gender stereotyping. 
</p>
<p>56. Developing a gender-sensitive judiciary therefore also implies addressing gender 
stereotyping, which is one of the State obligations under the Convention.34 Stereotyping is 
directly related to the adoption and/or implementation of laws, policies and practices that 
discriminate against women.   
</p>
<p>57. States should therefore strive to create the necessary conditions for the 
mainstreaming of gender in the judiciary, for example, through raising awareness among 
judges and court officials on women&#8217;s human rights and the prohibition of non-
discrimination and carrying out a mapping of major issues affecting women as users of the 
judiciary (for example as victims in the civil and criminal jurisdictions; as witnesses, 
particularly in cases of SGBV; and as offenders). Likewise, States and academic 
institutions should consider including courses on gender mainstreaming and women's 
human rights as part of the legal studies curricula. 
</p>
<p>58. Including knowledge of women&#8217;s human rights and demonstrated commitment to 
the goal of gender equality should be considered as requirements in the selection and 
appointment of judges and justices. Proposed lists of judicial candidates, appointments and 
promotions should ensure adequate representation of women and minorities at all levels in 
the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The role of the judiciary in advancing women's human rights  
</b></p>
<p>59. The judiciary is broadly entrusted to guarantee that State obligations stemming from 
international human rights law are enforced in national courts and tribunals, and therefore 
that rights are enjoyed without discrimination, including on the ground of sex.   
</p>
<p>60. Judges exercise this important role whenever they ensure fair and equal access to 
justice and fair trial guarantees. This role is also expected to be exercised by judges 
whenever they are requested to resolve disputes between parties, when they deliberate on 
cases, devise procedures to be applied in courts, and in general when they interpret the law.   
</p>
<p>61. In light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur wishes to provide several examples 
of cases decided by international, regional, and national judicial instances over recent years, 
which illustrate the key role played by judges at the national, regional and international 
levels in advancing women&#8217;s protection through the use of international norms and 
standards, and the various tools offered by the international human rights machinery. For 
example, treaty bodies have also issued general recommendations, comments or 
observations which States may use as a guide to interpret the rights enshrined in the 
conventions and ensure common understanding and greater respect for women&#8217;s human 
rights. Some examples include the two general observations issued by the Human Rights 
Committee on article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights35 and the 
general comment issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 
article 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.36 
</p>
<p>62. The special procedures of the Human Rights Council have also provided legal 
analysis and doctrinal positions which States may use as a guide to interpret the scope of 
</p>
<p>  
 34 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 2(f). 
 35 See general comment No. 4 on equal enjoyment of civil and political rights by men and women and 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 28 on the equality of rights between men and women. 
 36 See general comment No. 16 on the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights.   </p>


<p>the existing legal and policy frameworks and ensure a common ground of understanding for 
the protection of women&#8217;s human rights. These may also complement the existing legal and 
policy framework, for example, on reparations to women who have been subjected to 
violence37 and on a gender-sensitive interpretation of torture.38  
</p>
<p>63. Regarding impunity and the need to incorporate a gender perspective in the 
administration of criminal justice, in Gonz&#225;lez et al. (&quot;Cotton Field&quot;) v. Mexico,39 the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights determined that the longstanding failure to investigate, 
prosecute, or prevent sex crimes and other heinous crimes against women and girls in 
Ciudad Ju&#225;rez over the past fifteen years violated the obligations of Mexico under the 
American Convention of Human Rights, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women and international human rights 
norms, such as those contained in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women. It also stressed that the State is obliged to combat 
impunity by all available means and that the absence of a complete and effective 
investigation into the facts constitutes a source of additional suffering and anguish for the 
victims, who have the right to know the truth about what happened.40  
</p>
<p>64. In the &quot;Cotton Field&quot; case the Court ordered that the State should effectively conduct 
the criminal proceedings that were under way and, if applicable, those that might be opened 
in the future, to identify, prosecute and punish the perpetrators and masterminds of the 
crimes committed against the victim, inter alia, by ensuring that the investigation should 
include a gender perspective; undertake specific lines of inquiry concerning sexual assault, 
which must involve lines of inquiry into the corresponding patterns in the area; regularly 
provide the victims' next of kin with information on progress in the investigation, and give 
them full access to the case files, and the investigation should be carried out by officials 
who are highly trained in similar cases and in dealing with victims of discrimination and 
gender-based violence.41   
</p>
<p>65. Regarding the State obligation to prevent violations and discrimination against 
women, in Carmichele v. Minister of Safety and Security,42 the Constitutional Court of 
South Africa noted the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women that &quot;States may &#8230; be responsible for private acts if they 
fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts 
of violence, and for providing compensation&quot;.43 The Court further stressed that South Africa 
should prohibit all gender-based discrimination that has the effect or purpose of impairing 
the enjoyment by women of fundamental rights and freedoms and take reasonable and 
appropriate measures to prevent the violation of these rights.44 
</p>
<p>66. Regarding the State obligation to eliminate discrimination against women, in 
Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court of India45 held that by ratifying the 
Convention, India had accepted legal obligations to eliminate discrimination against

<p>women, which required ensuring their protection from sexual harassment in the workplace 
in a case where the local officials failed to investigate the gang rape of a social worker 
campaigning against child marriage. The Court also drew on general recommendation 19 of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to formulate a set of 
guidelines on sexual harassment to bind private and public employers pending the 
introduction of suitable legislation.   
</p>
<p>67. Regarding violence against women as a gender-based form of discrimination, in 
Opuz v. Turkey,46 the European Court of Human Rights, drawing on the work of the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women and views adopted by the Committee in 
several petitions relating to domestic violence, decided for the first time that gender-based 
violence is a form of discrimination under the European Convention on Human Rights. In 
Prosecutor v. Kunarac,47 the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 
drawing on comparative law, expert analysis and advice contained in reports of the Special 
Rapporteur on torture as well as the former Commission on Human Rights, concluded that 
rape and other forms of sexual assault against women held in detention were a particularly 
ignominious violation of the inherent dignity and right to physical integrity of the human 
being, and that accordingly they constituted an act of torture.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur applauds all these, and many other decisions in which 
national and regional courts and tribunals have drawn on human rights standards and the 
contributions made by the international human rights mechanisms to uphold respect for 
women&#8217;s human rights over recent decades. She further encourages information-sharing on 
case law across jurisdictions, countries and regions and invites international organizations 
to support efforts by Governments, High Courts, civil society, women's organizations and 
other stakeholders to make available to the judiciaries and the general public case-law 
decisions which advance women's protection worldwide. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress the importance of increasing efforts to 
exchange information on the ways and means in which stakeholders, including 
Governments, civil society organizations, international and regional organizations, the 
private sector and others, are seeking to uphold their commitment to the realization of 
gender equality in the administration of justice, and the protection of women&#8217;s human 
rights in the judicial system. In her view, information-sharing is an essential tool to help 
States to fill in policy and protection gaps at all levels.   
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the important role of women's 
associations, which contribute to the exercise of women's right of association, and are 
instrumental actors in gender mainstreaming, capacity-building efforts and know-how 
exchange. She commends information-sharing efforts by civil society and women's 
associations, particularly concerning the worldwide gender justice observatory48 and the 
Jurisprudence of Equality Programme Decisions49 and encourages know-how exchange 
among women judges and lawyers from a diversity of legal and judicial systems.

<p>71. The Special Rapporteur further encourages legal professionals, lawyers&#8217; 
associations, civil society organizations and academic institutions worldwide to continue 
strengthening avenues of dialogue and exchange of information among judges, lawyers, 
prosecutors, auxiliaries of justice, law schools, national human rights institutions and civil 
society. She also praises and encourages the continued collaborative efforts of High Courts 
at the global and regional levels. In this regard, she welcomes the timely development of 
judicial diplomacy50 and encourages legal professionals in general, and High Court 
magistrates in particular, to continue working towards legal integration and knowledge-
sharing across countries, regions and beyond. 
</p>
<p>72. In light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight some examples 
of initiatives, activities and policies that have been brought to her attention and that reflect 
the commitment of stakeholders to the realization of gender equality and the protection of 
women&#8217;s human rights in the administration of justice. She hopes that these examples will 
serve to inspire others in developing a gender-sensitive approach in the administration of 
justice at large, contributing to women&#8217;s daily enjoyment of human rights worldwide. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Working to improve women&#8217;s access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur has been encouraged by several initiatives undertaken by 
international organizations51 to help States and other stakeholders to improve women&#8217;s 
access to justice. She commends the mainstreaming of gender in the work of the World 
Bank in particular, through its research and development programme Justice for the Poor 
(J4P). The gender approach to this programme aims to develop strategies to address gender 
inequalities, inter alia, by identifying the underlying concepts and power structures at the 
root of women&#8217;s exclusion.   
</p>
<p>74. She also welcomes the work of the United Nations Development Programme 
through its global programme on Rule of Law and Access to Justice. The gender focus of 
this global programme includes the protection of women&#8217;s human rights and access to legal 
services while seeking to improve justice service delivery and enforce the law with 
particular attention to the poor.  
</p>
<p>75. At the national level, the Special Rapporteur applauds the establishment of legal 
information services on the rights of women within the judiciary. This is the case of the 
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg where the judiciary provides free information once a week on 
family law (divorce and separation); domestic violence; filiation and parental authority; 
sexual abuse and discrimination.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Developing a gender-sensitive administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to the importance of the various 
international and regional human rights mechanisms that remind States of their obligation 
to ensure women's access to justice. She especially draws attention to the work of treaty

procedures of the Human Rights Council, in particular the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, who has included in several of her thematic 
and country-specific reports considerations on the rights of women victims of violence52 
and the work of the Commission on the Status on women and its Expert Groups Meetings, 
for example on good practices in legislation on violence against women.53   
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur commends the establishment of the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and its 
operationalization, which will strengthen the ability of the United Nations to support States 
in the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women worldwide. She 
also commends the establishment of a working group to address discrimination against 
women, in law and in practice as a special procedure of the Human Rights Council54 and 
the efforts made by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to this end. 
</p>
<p>78. At the regional level, she welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteurship on the 
Rights of Women of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in particular, the 
study on access to justice for women victims of violence in the Americas55 and the work of 
the Special Rapporteur on the rights of women of the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples' Rights, in particular, the study on gender equality in the national legislations of 
Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which 
contains statistical data and examples of cases of women's discrimination and abuse that 
have been brought before the Courts.56 
</p>
<p><b> C. Developing a gender-sensitive judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur praises, inter alia, the Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina 
for leading a gender mapping of the justice sector (March 2010)57 and establishing the 
Women's Bureau (Oficina de la Mujer) in June 2010. She especially welcomes the fact that 
this newly established Bureau is aimed at formulating and implementing gender-sensitive 
policies within the judiciary. This includes facilitating women's access to justice, inter alia, 
through training on gender mainstreaming throughout the country. She encourages the 
judicial system of Argentina, together with international organizations and other 
stakeholders, to continue cooperating in this endeavour.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur commends efforts undertaken at the regional level to 
develop a gender-sensitive judiciary across countries and regions. She especially welcomes 
the final declaration of the VI Ibero-American Summit of Presidents of Supreme Courts and

for the development and implementation of the project of institutional strengthening and 
gender mainstreaming (&#8220;Fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad y la perspectiva de 
g&#233;nero&#8221;)60 and invites the Permanent Forum of Supreme Courts of Mercosur to consider 
adopting a gender approach, including staffing, training and academic exchange efforts.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Ensuring adequate representation of women in the judiciary   
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur especially welcomes initiatives to promote the participation 
of women in the conduct of public affairs, seeking to increase the representation of women 
in publicly elected office, including the legislature, as well as in high-ranking civil service 
positions and the judiciary, in accordance with international standards.61 She especially 
welcomes efforts undertaken over the past two decades, inter alia, in a number of Latin-
American, African and Asian countries that have adopted quotas to increase the 
representation of women mostly in parliament62 and in some instances in all public offices 
including the judiciary.63 The Special Rapporteur invites States to monitor the compliance 
of all State institutions with these laws and encourages the judicial power to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that women and men are equally represented in the judicial 
systems at all levels. Further study on the adequate representation of women in the 
judiciary is required.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82<b>. The system of administration of justice plays a crucial role in the effective 
protection of women&#8217;s human rights, the empowerment and development of women 
and the advancement of gender equality. The Special Rapporteur highlights the 
importance of an adequate legal and policy framework for the protection and 
empowerment of women and the achievement of gender equality, including through 
the ratification of international human rights instruments and other relevant legal 
instruments and their translation into effective laws, policies and programmes at the 
national level. An independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession and the integrity of the judicial system based on equal gender opportunities 
are essential prerequisites to effectively protect women&#8217;s human rights and ensure 
that the administration of justice is free from discrimination on the ground of gender. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> In the Special Rapporteur's view, developing a gender-sensitive justice system 
involves mobilizing the full range of processes, mechanisms, laws and policies in place 
within the structure of the State to strive to ensure women&#8217;s human rights and achieve 
gender equality in the society. A truly independent, impartial, transparent and solid 
judiciary and legal profession must be aligned with the international legal and policy 
framework on women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality so that it can truly strive

<p>84.<b> There is no doubt as to the crucial role played by courts and tribunals in the 
adherence to the rule of law at the national, regional and international levels and the 
advancement of women&#8217;s protection. International norms and standards may be

<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> As discussed throughout the report and despite progress made, many 
challenges remain to ensure that the administration of justice, including that the 
judiciary effectively protects women's human rights and strives for the achievement of 
gender equality. Several issues of concern warrant further attention, cooperative 
effort and protection-sensitive and human rights-tailored responses. In light of the 
foregoing the Special Rapporteur wishes to put forth a number of general 
recommendations for further consideration and action:  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Developing a gender-sensitive administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> States should effectively promote and protect the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all, in particular those of women, in conformity with the 
Charter of the United Nations and international human rights law obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> States that have not yet done so should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify and incorporate the applicable legal and policy framework on 
women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality, including the elimination of 
discrimination and violence against women, into their national laws, plans, policies 
and programmes, and their bilateral and regional agreements regarding the justice 
sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Review their national and regional laws and policies in order to 
harmonize them with the international legal framework on the protection of women, 
with particular attention to the goal of eliminating discrimination against women, and 
achieving gender equality, including equal representation of women and men in public 
office;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Include gender considerations in the elaboration and implementation of 
national development frameworks, poverty reduction strategies, human rights action 
plans and programmes and strategies for human rights education and the 
advancement of women's rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Adopt and develop programmes and policies to address significant gaps 
on women's protection in social policies and other areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Promote the participation of women (and men) from various segments of 
society, as key actors within the justice sector in their roles as judges, prosecutors, 
lawyers, legal counsel and court administrators;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Develop procedures, policies and practices that are gender-tailored to 
promote equal access to justice for all, in formal, informal and alternative justice 
systems, as well as in transitional justice mechanisms and other mechanisms to 
adjudicate rights. </b></p>


<p>88.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to avail themselves of the expertise 
of relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the technical 
cooperation and assistance of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, and other relevant agencies to complement ongoing efforts to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Assist in conducting a comprehensive gender assessment of the justice 
system to identify challenges, gaps and opportunities and determine further areas of 
technical assistance and cooperation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Assist in the design of gender-sensitive interventions (including capacity-
building efforts) in the justice sector to integrate gender considerations in both civil 
and criminal justice systems;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Assist in the development of indicators and the determination of 
baselines for gender mainstreaming across the justice sector. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages international and regional organizations, 
technical cooperation agencies and bilateral and multilateral donors to continue 
contributing to build the capacities of Governments, and other stakeholders, to 
identify gender-specific barriers for the full enjoyment of human rights and tailor 
gender-sensitive responses to discrimination and violence against women, including 
effective remedies and mechanisms for reparation and redress. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages civil society organizations and national 
human rights institutions, and other stakeholders to establish partnerships with States 
to help them in addressing gender-specific barriers to the access of justice and develop 
a gender-sensitive administration of justice.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Developing a gender-sensitive judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The judiciary and the bodies in charge of their administration and oversight 
should:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Incorporate gender considerations in the day-to-day operations and 
overall planning of the judicial sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Collect and use sex-disaggregated data in the planning and building of 
sectorial strategies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Use and promote the use of gender-neutral language whenever possible 
in the rulings, minutes and briefing notes, so as to avoid reproducing and promoting a 
male-centred vision of the world;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Redouble efforts to ensure that women are not only considered as 
victims or clients within the judiciary, but also as key actors in the administration of 
justice, as legal professionals with strengths and capacities to contribute to the 
integrity of the justice system;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Include knowledge of women's human rights and demonstrated 
commitment to the goal of gender equality as requirements in the selection and 
appointment of judges and justices at all levels. Proposed lists of judicial candidates 
for appointments and promotions should ensure adequate representation of women 
and minorities at all levels within the judicial system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Create equal conditions based on merit for appointment of judges to any 
kind of courts, not only family and children courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Create the conditions necessary for the mainstreaming of gender in the 
judiciary, for example through raising awareness among judges and court officials on 
women's human rights and the prohibition of non-discrimination and carrying out a </b></p>


<p><b>mapping of major issues affecting women as users of the judiciary (e.g. as victims in 
the civil and criminal jurisdictions; as witnesses, particularly in cases of SGBV; and as 
offenders); 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Take all necessary steps to ensure a systematic gender analysis of the 
judicial sector, and the incorporation of a gender perspective in the administration of 
justice. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> National courts and tribunals should resort more actively to the use of 
comparative law and the tools available at the international level, including 
international customary law, international treaties, treaty bodies' jurisprudence, the 
conclusions and recommendations stemming from the universal periodic review 
(UPR) mechanism and expert analysis and advice contained in reports of thematic or 
country-specific special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> Judges and all judicial affairs staff should be adequately trained and sensitized 
on gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights and on strategies to avoid gender 
stereotyping.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Other recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations, in collaboration with all 
United Nations Agencies when appropriate, to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Compile the legal analysis and doctrinal positions by the Special 
Procedures of the Human Rights Council together with the recommendations adopted 
within the framework of the universal periodic review mechanism and the practice of 
treaty bodies, in contributing to make the human rights principles of equality and 
non-discrimination a reality in women's daily lives, with a view to making them 
available to judiciaries across countries and regions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Compile, in collaboration with all United Nations Agencies, the legal 
analysis and doctrinal positions developed by the United Nations system, with a view 
to making them available to the judiciaries across countries and regions. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
