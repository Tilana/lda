 Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>about incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence 
</p>
<p>against persons based on their religion or belief in all regions of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>any advocacy of discrimination or violence on the basis of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Strongly deploring </i>all acts of violence against persons on the basis of their religion 
</p>
<p>or belief, as well as any such acts directed against their homes, businesses, properties, 
</p>
<p>schools, cultural centres or places of worship, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>about actions that wilfully exploit tensions or target individuals on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of 
</p>
<p>violence in many parts of the world, including cases motivated by discrimination against 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to religious minorities, in addition to the negative projection of the 
</p>
<p>followers of religions and the enforcement of measures that specifically discriminate 
</p>
<p>against persons on the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the valuable contribution of people of all religions or beliefs to 
</p>
<p>humanity and the contribution that dialogue among religious groups can make towards an 
</p>
<p>improved awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>that working together to enhance implementation of existing legal 
</p>
<p>regimes that protect individuals against discrimination and hate crimes, increase interfaith 
</p>
<p>and intercultural efforts, and to expand human rights education are important first steps in 
</p>
<p>combating incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence against individuals on the 
</p>
<p>basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the continued serious instances of derogatory 
</p>
<p>stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, as well as programmes and agendas pursued by extremist organizations and groups 
</p>
<p>aimed at creating and perpetuating negative stereotypes about religious groups, in particular 
</p>
<p>when condoned by Governments; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that incidents of religious intolerance, discrimination 
</p>
<p>and related violence, as well as of negative stereotyping of individuals on the basis of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, continue to rise around the world, and condemns, in this context, any 
</p>
<p>advocacy of religious hatred against individuals that constitutes incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hostility or violence, and urges States to take effective measures, as set forth 
</p>
<p>in the present resolution, consistent with their obligations under international human rights 
</p>
<p>law, to address and combat such incidents; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns </i>any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual or 
</p>
<p>electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes </i>that the open public debate of ideas, as well as interfaith and 
</p>
<p>intercultural dialogue, at the local, national and international levels can be among the best 
</p>
<p>protections against religious intolerance and can play a positive role in strengthening 
</p>
<p>democracy and combating religious hatred, and convinced that a continuing dialogue on 
</p>
<p>these issues can help overcome existing misperceptions; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes </i>the speech given by Secretary-General of the Organization of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Conference at the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council, and draws on his 
</p>
<p>call on States to take the following actions to foster a domestic environment of religious 
</p>
<p>tolerance, peace and respect, by: </p>


<p> (<i>a</i>) Encouraging the creation of collaborative networks to build mutual 
</p>
<p>understanding, promoting dialogue and inspiring constructive action towards shared policy 
</p>
<p>goals and the pursuit of tangible outcomes, such as servicing projects in the fields of 
</p>
<p>education, health, conflict prevention, employment, integration and media education; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Creating an appropriate mechanism within Governments to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>identify and address potential areas of tension between members of different religious 
</p>
<p>communities, and assisting with conflict prevention and mediation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Encouraging training of Government officials in effective outreach strategies; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Encouraging the efforts of leaders to discuss within their communities the 
</p>
<p>causes of discrimination, and evolving strategies to counter these causes; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Speaking out against intolerance, including advocacy of religious hatred that 
</p>
<p>constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Adopting measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on 
</p>
<p>religion or belief<b>;</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Understanding the need to combat denigration and negative religious 
</p>
<p>stereotyping of persons, as well as incitement to religious hatred, by strategizing and 
</p>
<p>harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and international levels through, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, education and awareness-building; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) Recognizing that the open, constructive and respectful debate of ideas, as 
</p>
<p>well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local, national and international levels, 
</p>
<p>can play a positive role in combating religious hatred, incitement and violence; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon </i>all States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To take effective measures to ensure that public functionaries in the conduct 
</p>
<p>of their public duties do not discriminate against an individual on the basis of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To foster religious freedom and pluralism by promoting the ability of 
</p>
<p>members of all religious communities to manifest their religion, and to contribute openly 
</p>
<p>and on an equal footing to society; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To encourage the representation and meaningful participation of individuals, 
</p>
<p>irrespective of their religion, in all sectors of society; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To make a strong effort to counter religious profiling, which is understood to 
</p>
<p>be the invidious use of religion as a criterion in conducting questionings, searches and other 
</p>
<p>law enforcement investigative procedures; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages </i>States to consider providing updates on efforts made in this 
</p>
<p>regard as part of ongoing reporting to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>States to adopt measures and policies to promote the full respect 
</p>
<p>for and protection of places of worship and religious sites, cemeteries and shrines, and to 
</p>
<p>take measures in cases where they are vulnerable to vandalism or destruction; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls for </i>strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue for the 
</p>
<p>promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights and diversity of religions and beliefs.
