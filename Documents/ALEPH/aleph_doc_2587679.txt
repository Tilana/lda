Report of independent registered
public accounting firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Vale S.A.
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Vale S.A. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2013, and
the related condensed consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows and of stockholders’ equity for the three-month and
six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for them to be in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB).
As discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting to
reflect the revised employee benefits standard effective January 1, 2013 and, retrospectively, adjusted the financial statements as of December 31, 2012
and for the period ended June 30, 2012.

9
Vale S.A. (“Vale”, “Group”, “Company” or “We”) is a publicly-listed company with its headquarters at number 26 of Graça Aranha Avenue, in downtown of
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with shares traded on the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo (“BM&F BOVESPA”), New York (“NYSE”), Paris (“NYSE Euronext”) and
Hong Kong (“HKEx”).
Company is principally engaged in the research, production and sale of iron ore and pellets, nickel, fertilizer, copper, coal, manganese, ferroalloys, cobalt,
platinum group metals and precious metals. Company also operates with of energy, General Cargo logistic and steel.
The information by business segment is presented in note 25.
2.                                     Summary of the Main Accounting Practices and Accounting Estimates
a)                                    Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Vale (“Interim financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with the standard IAS
34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
The interim financial statements has been measured using the historical cost convention adjusted to reflect the fair value of available for sale financial
assets, and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) measured at fair value through the profit or loss.
These condensed interim financial statements have been reviewed, not audited. However, principles, estimates, accounting practices, measurement
methods and standards adopted are consistent with those presented in the financial statements as of December 31, 2012, except as otherwise disclosed.
These interim financial statements were prepared by Vale to update users about relevant information presented in the period and should be read with the
annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012.
We evaluated subsequent events through August 5, 2013, which is the date of approval by the executive board, the interim financial statements.
b)                                     Functional currency and presentation currency
The financial statements of each group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(“functional currency”), which in the case of the Parent Company is the Brazilian Real (“R$” or “BRL”).
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Parent Company, using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of
the transaction or the measurements. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the exchange rate of
the end of the period of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, as financial income or expense.
The net income and balance sheet of all Group entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows: (i) The assets and liabilities for each Statement of Balance Sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the
Statement of Balance Sheet date; (ii) income and expenses for each Statement of Income are translated at the average exchange rates, except in
specific transactions that, considering their relevance, are translated at the rate at the dates of transactions and; (iii) the components for each
Stockholders’ equity are translated at the rate at the dates of transactions. All resulting exchange differences are recognized in a separate component of
the Stockholder’s equity, named “Cumulative Translation Adjustment”, transferred to the income statement when the sale of investments.

In March 2013, the Company suspended the implementation of the Rio Colorado project in Argentina. The current underlying project parameters are not
sufficiently favorable to assure the project meets the Company´s capital allocation and value creation targets. The Company will continue honoring its
commitments related to the concessions and reviewing alternatives to enhance the project outcome in order to determine prospects for future project
development. Based on an analysis of current expected returns and projected investments, the Company has concluded that no impairment provision is
required at this time. This matter continues to be closely monitored by management.
The net property, plant and equipment given in guarantees for judicial claims in June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 correspond to US$87 and US$96,
respectively.
The table below shows the movement of property, plant and equipment during the period:

We review the potential tax impact associated with undistributed earnings of each our subsidiaries and affiliates. For those subsidiaries in which
undistributed earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely, no deferred tax is recognized. Undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries
and affiliates for which no deferred income tax has been recognized for possible future remittances to the parent company totaled approximately
US$26,400 in Six-month period ended in June 30, 2013 and US$ 26,800 at December 31, 2012. These amounts are considered to be permanently
reinvested in the Company’s international business. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with
these amounts. If we did determine to repatriate these earnings, there would be methods available to us, each with different tax consequences. There
would also be uncertainty as to timing and amount, if any, of foreign tax credits that would be available, as the calculation of the available foreign tax
credit is dependent upon the timing of the repatriation and projections of significant future and uncertain events. The wide range of potential outcomes that
could result due to these factors, among others, makes it impracticable to calculate the amount of tax that hypothetically would be recognized on these
earnings if they were repatriated.

28.                              Gold stream transaction
In February 2013, the Company entered into a gold stream transaction with Silver Wheaton Corp. (“SLW”) to sell 25% of the gold extracted during the life
of the mine as a by product of Salobo copper mine and 70% of the gold extracted during the next 20 years as a by product of the Sudbury nickel mines.
In March 2013 we received up-front cash proceeds of US$1.9 billion, plus ten million warrants of SLW with exercise price of US$65 exercisable in the next
ten years, which fair value is US$ 100. The amount of US$1,330 was received for the Salobo transaction and US$ 570 plus the ten million warrants of
SLW were received for the Sudbury transaction.
In addition, as the gold is delivered to SLW, Vale will receive a payment equal to the lesser of: (i) US$400 per ounce of refined gold delivered, subject to
an annual increase of 1% per year commencing on January 1, 2016 and each January 1st thereafter; and (ii) the reference market price on the date of
delivery.
This transaction was bifurcated into two identifiable components of the transaction being: (i) the sale of the mineral rights for US$337 and, (ii) the services
for gold extraction on the portion in which Vale operates as an agent for SLW gold extraction.
The result of the sale of the mineral rights, was estimated in the amount of US$244 and was recognized in the income statement under Other operating
expenses, net, while the portion related to the provision of future services for gold extraction, was estimated at US$ 1,393 and is recorded as deferred
revenue (liability) and will be recognized in the statement of income as the service is rendered and the gold extracted.
The deferred revenue will be recognized in the future based on the units of gold extracted compared to the total reserve of proven and probable gold
reserves negotiated with SLW.
Defining the gain on sale of mineral interest and the deferred revenue portion of the transaction requires the use of critical accounting estimates as follow:
· Discount rates used to measure the present value of future inflows and outflows;
· Allocation of costs between the core products (copper and nickel) and gold based on relative prices;
· Expected margin for the independent elements (sale of mineral rights and service for gold extraction) based on our best estimative.
Changes in the assumptions above could significantly change the initial gain recognition.

29.                              Commitments
a)                           Nickel project — New Caledonia
In regards to the construction and installation of our nickel plant in New Caledonia, we have provided guarantees in respect of our financing arrangements
which are outlined below. In connection with the Girardin Act tax - advantaged lease financing arrangement sponsored by the French government, we
provided guarantees to BNP Paribas for the benefit of the tax investors regarding certain payments due from Vale Nouvelle-Calédonie S.A.S. (“VNC”),
associated with the Girardin Act lease financing.  Consistent with our commitments, the assets were substantially complete as of December 31, 2012. We
also committed that assets associated with the Girardin Act lease financing would operate for a five year period from then on and meet a specified
production criterion which remains consistent with our current plans. We believe the likelihood of the guarantee being called upon is remote.
In October 2012, we entered into an agreement with Sumic, a stockholder in VNC, whereby Sumic agreed to a dilution in their interest in VNC from 21% to
14.5%. Sumic originally had a put option to sell to us the shares they own in VNC if the defined cost of the initial nickel project, as measured by funding
provided to VNC, in natural currencies and converted to U.S. dollars at specified rates of exchange, exceeded US$4.6 billion and an agreement could not
be reached on how to proceed with the project. On May 27, 2010 the threshold was reached and the put option discussion and decision period
was extended. As a result of the October 2012 agreement, the trigger on the put option has been changed from a cost threshold to a production threshold.
The put option has been deferred to the first quarter of 2015 which is the earliest that it can be exercised.
b)                           Nickel Plant — Indonesia
During 2012, our subsidiary PT Vale Indonesia Tbk ( PTVI), a public company in Indonesia, submitted its strategic growth plan to the local government as
part of the process for the renewing its license for the Contract of Work (CoW). During the process, the government identified the following points for
renegotiation: (1) size of the CoW area; (2) term and form of CoW extension; (3) financial obligations (royalties and taxes); (4) domestic processing and
refining; (5) mandatory divestment; and (6) priority use of domestic goods and services.  As part of the ongoing CoW renegotiations, PTVI submitted an
updated growth strategy to high level government officials in June 2013. Until the renegotiation process is complete, PTVI is unable to fully determine to
what extent the CoW will be affected.  The operations of PTVI and the implementation of the growth strategy are partially dependent on the result of the
renegotiation of the CoW.
c)                            Nickel Plant — Canada
On March 28, 2013, Vale Canada, Vale Newfoundland & Labrador Limited (“VNLL”) and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (“Province”) entered
into a Fifth Amendment to the Voisey’s Bay Development Agreement, which governs all of our development and operations in the Province.  Under the
amendment, the Company has obtained additional time to complete the construction of the Long Harbour Processing Plant and reaffirmed its commitment
to construct an underground mine at Voisey’s Bay, subject to certain terms and conditions.   To maintain operational continuity at the Voisey’s Bay mine
pending the completion of the construction and ramp-up of the Long Harbour Processing Plant, the Province has agreed to exempt an additional 84,000
tonnes of nickel-in-concentrate from the requirement to complete primary processing in the province, over and above the previous 440,000 limit.  These
exports may take place between 2013 and 2015.   Additionally, during this period, if Vale Canada imports up to 15,000 tonnes of nickel-in-matte for early
stage processing at the Long Harbour Processing Plant, then Vale Canada may be permitted a further exemption from the primary processing
requirements, on a tonne-for-tonne basis.   Vale has agreed to make certain payments to the Government in relation to the additional exemption utilized
each year.  In addition, Vale will build up a contingent liability, secured by letters of credit and other security, based on the additional exemption utilized in
each year, which may become due and payable in the event that certain commitments in relation to the construction of the underground mine are delayed
or not met.
In the course of our operations we have provided letters of credit and guarantees in the amount of US$846 that are associated with items such as
environment reclamation, asset retirement obligation commitments, insurance, electricity commitments, post-retirement benefits, community service
commitments and import and export duties.
d)                           Participative stockholders’ debentures
During the period, there was no issuance of new debentures, or any change in the par value or the indicators affecting debentures issued.
On June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 the value of the debentures at fair value totaled US$1,783 and US$1,653, respectively. The Company paid on
April 2013 the amount of US$7 as semi-annual compensation.

e)                            Operating lease
In July 2013, the Agencia Nacional de Transporte Terrestre (ANTT), under Resolution 4.131, authorized the subsidiary of general cargo, Ferrovia Centro-
Atlântica S.A. (FCA) to return 3.800 km of track, which makes up the railroad under their current contract, 7 tracks are considered uneconomical and 6
tracks are economically viable.  In contrast, FCA has commitment to invest in its regular rail US$411 (R$934 million), over the remaining period of the
concession.
f)                             Concession Contracts and Sub-concession
The contractual basis and deadlines for completion of concessions rail and port terminals are unchanged in the period.
g)                           Guarantee issued to affiliates
The Company provided corporate guarantees, within the limits of its participation, a line of credit acquired by associate North Energy from BNDES, Caixa
Economica Federal and Banco BTG Pactual. On 30 June, 2013 and December 31, 2012 the amount guaranteed by Vale was US$282 and US$92,
respectively.
