This  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”),  prepared  as  at  March  10,  2010  focuses  on  the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and pertains to known risks and uncertainties relating to the oilfield services
sector. This discussion should not be considered all-inclusive, as it does not include all changes regarding general
economic, political, governmental and environmental events. Additionally, other events may or may not occur
which could affect Precision Drilling Trust (the “Trust” or “Precision”) in the future. In order to obtain an overall
perspective, this discussion should be read in conjunction with the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Information and Statements” and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. The
effects  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  arising  from  differences  in  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  (“GAAP”)  between  Canada  and  the  United  States  are  described  in  Note  21  to  the  Consolidated
Financial Statements. Additional information relating to the Trust, including the Annual Information Form, has
been filed with SEDAR and is available at www.sedar.com.

This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking information and statements, including statements relating to matters that are
not historical facts and statements of our beliefs, intentions and expectations about developments, results and events which will or
may occur in the future, which constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities
legislation  and  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  “safe  harbor”  provisions  of  the  United  States  Private
Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  (collectively  the  “forward-looking  information  and  statements”).  Forward-looking
information and statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate”, “could”, “should”, “expect”, “seek”, “may”, “intend”,
“likely”, “will”, “plan”, “estimate”, “believe” and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook.

All such forward-looking information and statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our
experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we
believe  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  These  statements  are,  however,  subject  to  known  and  unknown  risks  and
uncertainties  and  other  factors.  As  a  result,  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  could  differ  materially  from  those
expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking information and statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that
any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking information and statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so,
what benefits will be derived therefrom. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the impact of general
economic conditions in Canada and the United States; world energy prices and government policies; the availability of credit and
equity globally to both Precision and the oil and gas companies that are its customers; consumer confidence and the duration of
any recessionary period; industry conditions, including capital spending decisions; priority placed on high-performance rigs in
resource  plays;  the  adoption  of  new  environmental,  taxation  and  other  laws  and  regulations  and  changes  in  how  they  are
interpreted  and  enforced;  the  impact  of  initiatives  by  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  and  other  major
petroleum exporting countries; the effect of weather conditions on operations and facilities; fluctuations in the demand for well
servicing,  contract  drilling  and  ancillary  oilfield  services;  the  existence  of  operating  risks  inherent  in  well  servicing,  contract
drilling and ancillary oilfield services; volatility of oil and natural gas prices; oil and natural gas product supply and demand;
fluctuations in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development activities; risks inherent in the ability to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet current and future obligations; increased competition; our ability to enter into, and
the terms of future contracts; consolidation among our customers; risks associated with technology; political uncertainty, including
risks  of  war,  hostilities,  civil  insurrection,  instability  or  acts  of  terrorism;  the  lack  of  availability  of  qualified  personnel  or
management;  credit  risks;  increased  costs  of  operations,  including  costs  of  equipment;  the  effect  of  the  Canadian  federal
government’s SIFT rules; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our proposed conversion to a corporation; fluctuations in
interest rates; stock market volatility; safety performance; foreign operations; foreign currency exposure; dependence on third
party suppliers; opportunities available to or pursued by us; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
These risk factors are discussed in the Annual Information Form and Form 40-F on file with the Canadian securities commissions
and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and the website of the
U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  at  www.sec.gov,  respectively.  Except  as  required  by  law,  Precision  Drilling  Trust,

OVERVIEW
For the first time in Precision’s operating history, which stretches back over five decades, 2009 revenues and assets in the
United States exceed those in Canada. This is the result of Precision’s strategy to grow and diversify its operating presence
into  growth  markets  that  reward  high  performance  capabilities.  Precision  is  now  positioned  in  most  of  the  emerging
resource or shale plays throughout North America. Through steps taken over the past two years, Precision is positioned
to benefit from rising customer demand brought about through industry advances in horizontal drilling and multi-stage
completion techniques.
Precision entered 2009 having just closed the acquisition of Grey Wolf, Inc. (“Grey Wolf”). The Trust’s long-term debt was
substantially increased due to the acquisition. Because of the then deteriorating market conditions, Precision’s priorities for
2009 were to:
1.  improve the balance sheet;
    2   integrate Grey Wolf; and 
    3.  continue to provide high performance, high value service to customers.
Fiscal 2009 was a very difficult year for the oil and gas service sector. The global banking and general economic distress
that started in 2008 continued into 2009, leading to significantly reduced oil and gas commodity prices. This resulted in
reduced spending by Precision’s customers and led to the sharpest decline in drilling and well service activity since the
early 1980s. Despite improvements in late 2009, demand for oilfield services throughout the year was significantly below
the peak levels seen in 2007 and early 2008.
Nevertheless, Precision was able to deliver on all three of its priorities during the year.
1.  First, with regard to the balance sheet, Precision was able to reduce long-term debt throughout the year and lowered
the Trust’s debt to total capitalization ratio to 0.22 at December 31, 2009 from 0.37, a year earlier. This improvement
was accomplished through a series of measures that included Trust unit issuances, debt refinancing and through
internally generated cash flow that was used to reduce debt. These transactions were accomplished in spite of some
of the toughest times in the equity and debt markets in the past two decades. These transactions were necessary to
improve the capital structure of the Trust and to position the Trust for growth in 2010 and beyond.
2.  The integration of Grey Wolf was substantially completed during 2009. Personnel were realigned, and information
and operating system decisions and implementations were planned and executed during the year. Precision’s supply
chain support system was expanded into the United States with the opening of Grey Wolf Supply mid-year which
is now supplying all of the United States rigs. Maintenance and manufacturing processes and systems are being
established in the United States and 2010 should provide additional cost savings from these activities.

3.  The people of Precision continue to perform at a very high level. Precision continues to deliver our customers the
high performance, high value service that they have come to expect. Safety of our people is the top core value for
Precision, and 2009 produced the best safety record in Precision’s history. Precision is not resting on our 2009
results and the Trust continues to move towards “Target Zero” which is Precision’s goal of no work place incidents.
Precision is proud to be one of the contractors of choice for several major and large independent exploration and
production companies in North America. In fact, Precision earned “Contractor of the Year” honours from a major
oil company for its United States operations during 2009.

VISION AND STRATEGY
Precision’s vision is to be recognized as the high performance, high value provider of services for global energy exploration
and development. Precision’s people, systems and rigs are capable of drilling and servicing customer requirements with
consistent results which reduces the cost and risk for our customers. Precision’s unique combination of superior people,
critical size, drilling technology, vertical integration and superior business systems provides a strong competitive advantage
for the Canadian and United States markets and for international expansion.
Precision’s strategy is aligned for and dedicated to growth. The organic growth into the United States in 2007 and 2008
was the first step in the growth outside of Canada. This was followed by the acquisition of Grey Wolf in late 2008. The
improvement of the balance sheet and debt restructuring during 2009 was the next step. The proposed conversion to a
corporation will help facilitate Precision’s growth plans. Priorities for 2010 are changed from 2009 as Precision is in a
position to again seize market growth opportunities. Those opportunities are expected to come in the form of new build
Super Series® rigs, existing rig upgrades, international deployment of assets and the potential acquisition of additional
assets. Precision’s corporate and competitive growth strategies are designed to optimize resource allocation and differentiate
Precision from the competition.
Precision also expects that during 2010 the Trust will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow it
to have the financial flexibility to manage its growth plan going forward. This flexibility is expected to be in the form of
cash on the balance sheet as well as access to the Trust’s debt facilities. Precision is very cognizant of the cyclicality of the
oilfield services industry and will be prudent in the use of financial resources.
In terms of business segments, Precision sees growth for its Contract Drilling Services’ land drilling rig fleet. The growth
opportunities are less obvious for the Completion and Production Services’ service rig fleet due to excess equipment capacity
in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”) and throughout North America. However, with challenge comes
opportunity  to  consolidate  smaller,  less  efficient  competitors  and  to  seize  opportunities  to  expand  services  to  address
rig-less completions and production work associated with many horizontal wells.

During 2010, Precision will continue to build on its high performance, high value vision. Further improvements in safety, assets
and systems are planned, as customers demand ever increasing performance as they develop the technically challenging
unconventional shale plays. Precision will continue to internally develop and challenge its people to seize opportunities.
OUTLOOK 
The effects of a weak global economy and resulting low energy commodity prices continued throughout most of 2009. While
the economy has begun to show initial signs of stabilization and oil pricing has recovered from its low, there remains
considerable demand uncertainty for both oil and natural gas and this has led to low underlying customer demand for oilfield
services. There are signs in the market that these trends may be reversing as Precision is seeing higher customer demand
in all of its service areas. However, the rate and duration of this improvement in demand cannot be determined at this time.
Moving into the first quarter of 2010, industry fundamentals for natural gas are beginning to show modest improvements.
Storage levels for natural gas in the United States have moved down into the range of the last five year’s storage levels
and natural gas prices are slightly higher than they were a year ago and considerably higher than the third quarter of
2009. Supplies of natural gas, especially from unconventional resource plays in Texas and Louisiana, came on line in late
2008 and early 2009 from drilling activity which peaked in 2008. A significant portion of these wells, and the associated
gas production gains, are subject to high depletion rates and the reduction in drilling is beginning to show in the decreases
in recently reported production levels.

Despite this recent improvement, uncertainty remains for the United States natural gas markets, as concerns over consumption
and the global economy continue to overshadow lower Canadian imports and the drop in active North American rigs
drilling for natural gas. Based upon the latest available data, United States natural gas supply has declined modestly from
peak levels achieved in mid 2009 and Precision expects the supply of natural gas to show additional declines over the
next several quarters as active gas rig counts remain relatively low. Subject to demand volatility, this should lead to higher
commodity prices and support a continued recovery in gas drilling activity.
While equipment utilization levels are beginning to improve for both of Precision’s business segments, Contract Drilling
and Completion and Production Services, there still remains competitive price pressure on all of Precision’s service offerings.
During the last nine months in the United States, there has been a steady increase in the number of drilling rigs operating
and as such Precision is seeing modest dayrate increases on recent spot market contracts. In Canada, there has been a
recent  seasonal  increase  in  rigs  working  that  is  exceeding  early  2009  levels.  In  both  Canada  and  the  United  States,
virtually all of Precision’s Tier I rigs are working as compared with about 60% of the Tier II rigs and 20% of the Tier III
rigs. Precision expects low Tier III utilization to persist into 2010 and potentially longer depending on natural gas pricing
recovery.  Customers  have  provided  very  little  visibility  regarding  their  oilfield  service  plans  and  expenditures  for  the
summer  2010  drilling  season  in  Canada.  In  the  United  States,  Precision  expects  the  working  rig  count  to  continue  to
modestly improve as we move through 2010, subject to changes in commodity prices.

Precision continues to carry a strong portfolio of term customer contracts that help mitigate the effects of the downturn.
Precision expects to have an average of approximately 75 drilling rigs under day work term contracts in North America
in the first quarter of 2010 and an average of 71 for the second quarter. These term contract totals include four rigs in the
United States that are currently not working but receiving margin revenue from customers. In Canada, a term contracted
rig generates about 200 to 250 utilization days a year due to the seasonal nature of well access whereas in most regions
of the United States Precision expects about 350 utilization days per year from a term contract drilling rig.
For 2010, Precision expects to have an average of approximately 34 drilling rigs in Canada under term contracts, 31 in
the United States and one in Mexico, for a total of 66 for the full year. For the 2011 calendar year, Precision expects an
average of approximately 37 drilling rigs to be generating revenue under existing term contracts, with 20 in Canada and
17  in  the  United  States.  Precision’s  contracts  continue  to  be  honoured  by  its  customers  although  in  some  cases,  term
revisions have been negotiated within original economic terms or paid out. Precision currently expects that additional term
contracts for existing equipment will be entered into during 2010 as there are current negotiations with several customers
in Canada and the United States.
Precision expects to keep non-expansion capital expenditures at low levels. For 2010, Precision expects to have capital
expenditures  of  $75  million,  which  includes  $50  million  in  sustaining,  upgrade  and  infrastructure  expenditures  and
$25 million is planned for performance enhancements to improve the Tier classification of 10 to 15 drilling rigs during
the year. Currently, there are potential market opportunities to construct several new rigs and Precision may allot new
expansion capital subject to customer term contract economics.
Despite persistent market uncertainty and near term challenges, the future of the global oilfield service industry remains
promising. Precision has positioned its rig fleet in most of the onshore growth basins in North America and this is expected
to provide an opportunity to demonstrate its value to customers through delivery of high performance, high value services
that deliver lower customer well costs and strong relative margins to Precision.

MD&A
Precision operates in an inherently challenging cyclical industry; the energy services business. There are a number of
business risks associated with the volatility of an industry that is dependent on global oil economics and the more regional
energy source, natural gas. The key risks are referenced later in this report.
To excel in this environment, Precision operates through a business model to control risk and optimize performance. The
model is directly linked to competitive strategy and is evidenced by Precision’s operating capabilities. Both business segments
deploy assets and services that are capital intensive, technology oriented and people dependant. The combination thereof
provides a level of service to customers that dictates a company’s brand and reputation. The essential elements of service
also include safety and environmental considerations. These factors in combination lead to operating proficiency and
profitability  throughout  the  business  cycle.  Invariably  they  also  lead  to  growth  opportunities  to  diversify  and  increase
market share.
Through this section, management is presenting its views of Precision’s business and the resources needed to succeed.
Understanding the oil and gas industry and the factors that impact demand for oilfield services is important to assess risk
factors that affect Precision’s long-term strategy and financial performance.
FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ENERGY SERVICES INDUSTRY
Management believes that hydrocarbon energy sources, oil and natural gas, are low cost energy sources and there is a
continuing global dependency to replace existing production levels which will remain viable for decades. Alternate energy
sources are necessary, but will take time and technology for improved economics and infrastructure to develop.
The shift from conventional to unconventional oil and natural gas production requires higher capacity equipment and
technical expertise. The gradual steady shift in the drilling of more horizontal wells and fewer vertical wells is evidence of
this trend.
Multi-stage horizontal completion techniques are re-opening many basins to renewed drilling in North America. This is
an emerging development that is gaining credibility, an exciting opportunity for industry to extract greater production from
known resource regions previously thought to be uneconomical.
Global Markets
Global economic growth and prosperity drives energy consumption. Crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas are the
most dominant and versatile sources of energy in developed countries while crude oil and coal are the dominant sources
of energy in developing countries. Oil and its by-products are currently the most important fuel for the transportation
industry  as  there  are  few  alternatives  that  can  compete  economically.  Oil  and  natural  gas  are  major  fuel  sources  for
generating heat and electricity and are critical building blocks for countless consumer products.

The impact of the recent economic recession in many economies has led to a decrease in global energy demand and oil
and natural gas commodity pricing for most of 2009. As a result, there has been a significant decline in capital investment
directed towards energy exploration and development.
Looking longer term, the worldwide population continues to grow and is expected to rise 1.0% per year causing higher
energy demand into the future. From a reference year of 2006, energy consumption is projected by the United States
government Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) to increase 44% by 2030 with oil, natural gas and coal meeting
approximately 83% of global demand, as depicted in the graphs below. World oil consumption is predicted to rise about
1.0%  per  year  during  this  period  due  largely  to  growing  demand  in  China,  India  and  other  developing  countries.
Delivering reliable and affordable energy for these fast-growing and upwardly mobile populations is a major challenge,
with security of supply an important theme. The EIA is forecasting natural gas consumption increases of 1.6% on average
per annum to 2030 as rising oil prices and environmental considerations increase the demand for natural gas as an
alternative fuel in industrial and electrical sectors in developed and developing economies.

Commodity prices over the last two years have moved lower with the economic crisis of 2008 and have staged a recovery
as demand and supply fundamentals tightened. As highlighted in the following chart, oil prices have recovered since the
first quarter of 2009 while natural gas has languished until very recently. This has partially mitigated the steep decline in
customer demand associated with natural gas wells as natural gas pricing continues to be relatively low due to high United
States underground storage levels and domestic production.

Natural gas prices in North America have been below most global price points for liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and
LNG  imports  to  the  United  States  market  have  remained  at  relatively  low  levels.  LNG  is  a  fungible  commodity  the
movement of which is subject to demand fluctuations with supply trending to high priced markets, such as Europe and
Asia. In North America, LNG is an important future source of supply that could offset production declines from mature
reservoirs and help meet future natural gas demand. However, higher domestic natural gas production from shale gas
reservoirs, such as the Barnett in Texas, has reduced the need for LNG and Canadian imports.
North American Markets
The  economics  of  the  oilfield  service  industry  are  linked  to  these  global  fundamentals  in  combination  with  regional
opportunities. Important regional drivers for the industry in North America include the underlying hydrocarbon make-up
of the various basins and the existence of established, competitive and efficient service infrastructure.
As  commodity  prices  vary  so  does  industry  cash  flow  to  fund  exploration  and  development,  especially  the  pace  of
investment in unconventional production. Increasingly, the benefits of new drilling and completion technology, along with
improved economics, have driven customers to drill more complex wells in emerging and well-known basins throughout
North  America.  Precision  has  expanded  its  rig  count  in  many  of  these  areas  and  is  poised  to  benefit  from  further
improvements as fundamentals strengthen and customer demand increases. As depicted in the map of North America,
Precision’s drilling rig fleet is positioned in virtually every resource play from northern Canada to the southern United States.

Economic Drivers
Providing oil and natural gas products to consumers involves a number of players, each taking on different risks in the
exploration, production, refining and distribution processes. Exploration and production companies, Precision’s customers,
assume the risk of finding hydrocarbons in reservoirs of sufficient size to economically develop and produce. The economics
are  dictated  by  the  current  and  expected  future  margin  between  the  cost  to  find  and  develop  hydrocarbons  and  the
eventual price of these products; the wider the margin, the greater the incentive to undertake these risks.
Exploration  and  development  activities  include  acquiring  access  to  prospective  lands,  seismic  surveying  to  detect
hydrocarbon bearing structures as well as faults and traps within the structure, drilling wells and completing successful
wells for production. Exploration and production companies hire oilfield service companies to perform the majority of
these tasks. The revenue of an oilfield service company is part of the finding and development costs for an exploration
and production company.
The economics of an oilfield service company are largely driven by the price of crude oil and natural gas realized by its
customers. Since oil can be transported relatively easily, it is priced in a global market influenced by an array of economic
and political factors while natural gas continues to be priced in continental markets.
As previously noted, drilling dynamics have changed with recent technological advancements in fracturing, stimulation
and horizontal drilling that have brought about a paradigm shift from the development of conventional to the development
of unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs in North America. This is especially prevalent in the exploitation of existing
and emerging shale gas plays in the United States where pipeline takeaway capacity improvements have occurred. The
application of these new technologies in unconventional drilling in North America has provided significant productivity
gains in certain United States shale gas plays.
These  technological  improvements  are  evident  in  the  proportion  of  wells  drilled  using  directional  and  horizontal  well
programs. As shown in the graph below, the trend in Canada away from vertical wells to the more demanding requirements
of directional/horizontal well programs is very consistent. Precision’s rig fleet in Canada has been engaged by customers
on these wells to a greater degree than industry, demonstrating Precision’s high performance capabilities.

Technological innovations have been a major factor in the natural gas production increase for the United States. These
productivity gains have reduced the reliance on Canada as a source of natural gas supply. The following graph reflects the
natural gas production increases realized since early 2006 in the United States as new technologies have been employed
to enhance and bring forward the productive life of unconventional natural gas wells.

However, lower Canadian drilling levels for natural gas targets have been in play for a longer period and the decline in
production is clearly evident. The lower drilling activity in Canada was influenced by reduced consumption in the United
States and by low cost new production growth from shale gas basins in the United States. The graph below depicts the
decline in Canadian natural gas production due to factors previously discussed and compounded by Alberta government
royalty changes.

Drilling Rig Activity in Canada and the United States
The United States active drilling rig count increased from about 1,400 rigs in 2005 to a peak of about 1,950 rigs in late
2008. The economic downturn led to a low in 2009 of about 800 active drilling rigs before recovering to about 1,200
by year-end. With recent economic stability and improving commodity prices, Precision’s high performance drilling rig
fleet in the United States has been the first to experience a recovery in activity. Within Canada, the cyclical nature of the
oilfield services business due to seasonality factors and low commodity pricing continues to affect the demand for drilling
rig services. Due to declining volumes of natural gas exports to the United States, higher pipeline transportation costs have
further deteriorated producer economics.
Here  again,  customers  require  cost  efficiency  in  all  aspects  of  their  finding  and  development  costs  and  lead  toward
increased demand for high performing assets. The demand for premium rigs is further supported by a higher level of
operating  specifications  associated  with  increased  exploitation  of  unconventional  resource  basins  in  North  America.
Demand for high performing drilling rigs continues to grow and garner premium pricing while displacing underperforming
rigs in the process.

capability make Precision a versatile provider of high performance, high value services to its customers. Precision’s fleet
can drill virtually all types of on-shore conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas wells in North America.
Precision’s service rigs provide completion, workover, abandonment, well maintenance, high pressure and critical sour
gas well work and well re-entry preparation across the WCSB. The rigs are supported by three field locations in Alberta,
two in Saskatchewan, one in Manitoba and one in British Columbia.
Snubbing  units  complement  traditional  natural  gas  well  servicing  by  allowing  customers  to  have  work  done  on  wells 
while they are pressurized and production has been suspended. Precision has two types of snubbing units – rig assist and
self-contained. Self-contained units do not require a service rig on site and are capable of snubbing and performing many
other well servicing procedures.
Inventory of Ancillary Equipment
Precision has a large inventory of equipment, including portable top drives, loaders, boilers, tubulars and well control
equipment, to support its fleet of drilling and service rigs to meet customer requirements. Precision also maintains an
inventory of key rig components to minimize downtime in the event of equipment failures.
In support of drilling rig operations, LRG Catering supplies meals and provides accommodation for rig crews at remote

Upgrade capital spending has been reduced over the past three years as activity has been overweighted to high capability
equipment and challenging conditions have limited economics associated with upgrade opportunities. Precision continues
to upgrade essential elements like tubulars and engines on drilling rigs and the freestanding of certain service rigs.
Employees
As a service company, Precision is only as good as its people. An experienced, competent crew is a competitive strength
and is highly valued by customers. To recruit field employees, Precision uses centralized personnel hiring, orientation and
training programs in Canada. In the United States, these functions are managed on a more decentralized basis to align
with regional labour and customer service requirements. Precision works to ensure its ability to meet future field personnel
requirements through programs like its “Toughnecks” recruiting program.
Information Systems
Precision’s commitment to maintain a fully integrated enterprise-wide reporting system has improved business performance
through  real-time  access  to  information  across  all  functional  areas.  All  of  Precision’s  divisions  operate  on  a  common
integrated system using standardized business processes for finance, payroll, equipment maintenance, procurement and
inventory control.
Precision continues to invest in information systems that provide competitive advantages. Electronic links between field and
financial systems provide accuracy and timely processing. This repository of rig data improves response time to customer
enquiries. Rig manufacturing projects benefit from scheduling and budgeting tools as economies of scale can be identified
and leveraged as construction demands increase.

KEY PERFORMANCE DRIVERS
Customer economics are dictated by the current and expected margin between the price at which hydrocarbons are sold
and the cost to find and develop those products. Some of the key business, customer and industry indicators that Precision
monitors are:
Safety Management
Precision’s culture is built on the foundation of a Target Zero attitude. Precision believes that the workplace and organization
can be free from injuries, equipment damage and adverse environmental impact. Safety performance is a fundamental
contributor to operating performance and the financial results Precision generates. Safety is tracked through an industry
standard recordable frequency statistic which is measured to benchmark successes and identify areas for improvement.
Precision has continued to improve its safety management by tracking and measuring all injuries regardless of severity.
Even minor injuries can be a leading indicator for the potential of a more serious incident.
Environmental Management
Precision has long been aware of the necessity to develop key solutions in order to minimize energy waste and, through
the use of AC Electric power generation and variable frequency drive technologies, Precision achieves efficiency over
conventional methods. Precision’s rigs are equipped with heat generation equipment which allows a higher energy of heat
output per amount of energy used, in accordance with more efficient heat distribution during winter months, while providing
flexible heat dissipation in warmer months. Precision has always been a leader in vertical integration and committed 
to improving operations. This includes retrofit power applications which are equipped with higher efficiency engines for
maximum effectiveness. Precision’s equipment, supplies, and technology are continually reviewed to improve life cycles,
reduce energy, and lessen the impact of disposal.
Management of byproducts in daily operations is essential to the quality of lives for all individuals, and as part of its “down
to earth” approach, Precision is aware of the critical importance that must be placed on the issues of climate change and
atmospheric disturbance. Precision is addressing this issue of climate change through feasibility studies on the use of natural
gas injection and exhaust treatment systems on diesel engines, which effectively reduces the CO2 levels released into the
atmosphere.  At  the  same  time,  we  participate  in  the  recycling  of  all  oils  used,  and  have  implemented  our  own  spill
containment devices for use under equipment and around areas of high exposure. Our electric rigs can also be modified
to function on “high-line power” allowing for zero local emissions.
Precision is committed to developing solutions that support a sustainable society, which includes research on alternative
methods for fuel types in power and heat generation, “reduced footprint” and “zero disturbance” rig designs, developing
waste energy recovery systems and reduced move loads per rig.
Operating Efficiency
Precision  maximizes  the  efficiency  of  operations  through  equipment  proximity  to  work  sites,  operating  practices  and
versatility.  Reliable  and  well  maintained  equipment  minimizes  downtime  and  non-productive  time  during  operations.
Information  is  gathered  from  daily  drilling  log  records  stored  in  a  database  and  analyzed  to  measure  productivity,
efficiency and effectiveness. This analysis of downtime is integral as a measure of operating effectiveness.

Key factors which contribute to lower customer well costs are:
쮿   Mechanical downtime is minimized through preventative maintenance programs, detailed inspection processes, an
extensive fleet of strategically placed spare equipment, an in-house supply chain, and regular equipment upgrades; and
쮿   Non-productive time, or move, rig-up and rig-out time, which is minimized by decreasing the number of truck loads
per rig, using lighter truck loads, and using mechanized equipment for safer and quicker rig operations.
Customer Demand 
Precision’s fleet is geographically dispersed to meet customer demands. Relationships with customers, industry knowledge
and new well licenses provide Precision with the information necessary to evaluate its marketing strategies. The ability to
provide customers with some of the most innovative and advanced rigs in the industry increases the value of the rig to 
the customer as they can reduce total well cost. Industry rig utilization statistics are also tracked to evaluate Precision’s
performance against competitors.
Workforce
Precision closely monitors crew availability for field operations. Precision focuses on providing a safe and productive work
environment, opportunities for advancement and added wage security through programs to retain employees. Precision
relies heavily on its safety record and reputation to attract and retain employees as industry manpower shortages are often
experienced in peak operating periods. In 2008, the successful recruiting program, Toughnecks, was initiated to help
mitigate these issues.
Financial Performance
Precision maximizes revenue without sacrificing operating margins. Key financial information is unitized on a per day or
per hour basis and compared to established benchmarks and past performance. Precision evaluates the relative strength of
its financial position by monitoring its working capital and debt ratios. The Company’s 2009 focus was to reduce long-term
debt while preserving strong profit margins. Returns on capital employed are monitored and incentive compensation is
linked to returns generated compared to established benchmarks.
Specific measures, which represent in summary form the effectiveness of the factors above, are used to reward executives
and eligible employees through incentive compensation plans. These measures include:
쮿   Safety performance – total recordable incident frequency per 200,000 man-hours: 
         Measure against prior year performance and current year industry performance in Canada and the United States,
as applicable.
쮿   Operational performance – rig down time for repair as measured by time not billed to customer:
         Measure against predetermined target of available billable time.
쮿   Key field employee retention – senior field employee retention rates:
         Measure against predetermined target of retention.
쮿   Financial performance – return on capital employed calculated as a percentage of operating earnings (before non-
cash decommissioning charges) divided by total assets less current liabilities:
Measure against predetermined target percentage.
쮿   Financial  performance  –  unit  value  performance  for  year  against  industry  peer  group,  adjusted  for  dividends  or
distributions.
Measure against predetermined selection of competitors in peer group.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT 
The oilfield services business is inherently cyclical in nature. Precision employs a disciplined approach to minimize costs
through operational management practices and a variable cost structure, and to maximize revenues through term contract
positions  with  a  focus  of  maintaining  a  strong  balance  sheet.  This  operational  discipline  provides  Precision  with  the
financial flexibility to capitalize on strategic acquisition and internal growth opportunities at all points in the business cycle.
Operating within a highly variable cost structure, Precision’s upgrade and maintenance capital expenditures are tightly
governed by and highly responsive to activity levels with additional cost savings leverage provided through Precision’s
internal  manufacturing  and  supply  divisions.  Expansion  capital  for  new  rig  build  programs  require  2  –  5  year  term
contracts in order to mitigate capital recovery risk. Until Precision has better visibility of a recovery within the oilfield
services sector capital expenditures will be limited to $75 million in 2010.
In  managing  foreign  exchange  risk,  Precision  matches  the  currency  of  its  debt  obligations  with  the  currency  of  the
supporting operations cash flows. Interest rate risk is minimized through hedging activities and by reducing debt.
Precision expects to remain in compliance with financial covenants under its secured facility and expects to have complete
access to credit lines during 2010. As at December 31, 2009 the Trust complied with the covenants under the secured
facility. Precision successfully amended certain financial covenant terms of the secured facility to provide greater flexibility.
Due to the fact that attractively priced term contracts are expiring and the spot market and utilization, while improving,
have not returned to prior levels, rolling 12 month EBITDA performance may be lower over coming quarters, Precision
expects  to  carry  significant  cash  to  preserve  optimal  liquidity.  The  Trust  will  consider  further  voluntary  long-term  debt
reduction as industry fundamentals stabilize and operating cash flow forecasts become clear.
Access to certain capital markets, especially the United States high yield debt market, have opened considerably over the
past three quarters and Precision may consider opportunities to gain greater financial flexibility and lower cost of debt
over the current blended cost of approximately 8.4%.
Precision began 2009 with a US$1.2 billion senior secured credit facility (the “Secured Facility”) that was guaranteed by
the Trust and was comprised of US$800 million of term loans and a US$400 million revolving facility and a US$400 million
unsecured bridge credit facility (the “Unsecured Facility” and, together with the Secured Facility, the “Credit Facilities”)
that was also guaranteed by the Trust. The Credit Facilities funded the cash portion of the acquisition and refinanced the
pre-closing Precision bank debt and certain pre-closing debt obligations of Grey Wolf. The Unsecured Facility was used
in the repurchase of US$262 million principal amount of Grey Wolf convertible notes tendered for repurchase by holders
under a change of control offer made in the first quarter of 2009.
In April 2009, Precision completed a private placement of $175 million principal amount of 10% senior unsecured notes
(the “Senior Notes”). The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to reduce the obligations of Precision
under the Unsecured Facility.
During the second quarter of 2009, Precision fully repaid the Unsecured Facility and completed syndication of the Secured
Facility.
As  at  December  31,  2009  after  giving  effect  to  payments,  prepayments,  commitment  reductions  and  reallocations
between the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility during the year the Secured Facility consisted of:
쮿   a term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of $289 million (the “Term Loan A Facility”);
쮿   a term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $422 million (the “Term Loan B Facility”); and
쮿   a revolving credit facility in the amount of US$260 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

Secured Facility
The Secured Facility contains a number of affirmative covenants as well as a number of covenants that, among other
things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Trust’s, Precision’s and their subsidiaries’ ability to: (i) incur additional
indebtedness; (ii) sell assets; (iii) pay dividends and distributions (including by the Trust to Unitholders) or purchase the
Trust’s, Precision’s or their subsidiaries’ capital stock or trust units; (iv) make investments or acquisitions; (v) incur liens on
their assets; (vi) enter into mergers, consolidations or amalgamations; and (vii) make capital expenditures.
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Secured Facility:
쮿   a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 as at the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of
the Trust, except that such maximum ratio is 3.50 to 1.00 for any such period ending after December 31, 2009 and
on or prior to December 31, 2011;
쮿   a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Trust, except
that such minimum ratio is 2.75 to 1.00 for any such period ending after December 31, 2009 and on or prior to
December 31, 2011;
쮿   a  minimum  fixed  charge  coverage  ratio  for  any  period  of  four  consecutive  fiscal  quarters  of  the  Trust  beginning
March 31, 2009 of: (i) 1.00 to 1.00 for any such period ending on or prior to December 31, 2010; and (ii) 1.05 to
1.00 for any such period ending after December 31, 2010;
쮿   the following amounts are required to be used as prepayments of the term loans: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of
any incurrence of debt by the Trust, Precision or their subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions); (ii) 100% of the net
cash proceeds of certain sales or other dispositions of any assets belonging to the Trust, Precision or their subsidiaries,
except to the extent the Trust, Precision or their subsidiaries use the proceeds from the sale or disposition to acquire,
improve or repair assets useful in their business within a specified period; and (iii) 75% of the Trust’s annual excess
cash flow, which percentage will be reduced to 50%, 25% and 0% if the Trust achieves and maintains a consolidated
leverage  ratio  of  less  than  2.00  to  1.00,  1.25  to  1.00,  and  0.75  to  1.00,  respectively.  In  addition  to  mandatory
prepayments, Precision has the option to prepay the loans under the Secured Facility generally without premium or
penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs for Eurodollar rate loans;
쮿   limits on distributions based on 20% of the Trust’s operating cash flow before changes in working capital, provided
that 50% of operating cash flow generated in excess of certain base case projections will also be permitted to be paid
as distributions, subject to an overall cap of 30% of aggregate operating cash flow before changes in working capital;
쮿   covenants that limit the Trust’s capital expenditures above an agreed base-case, allowing for certain exceptions; and
쮿   the  Trust,  Precision  and  their  material  subsidiaries  organized  in  Canada  or  the  United  States  (other  than  certain
excluded subsidiaries) and each other subsidiary that becomes a party to the collateral documents (collectively, the
“Subsidiary Guarantors”) have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets (with certain exceptions)
that are located in Canada or the United States as collateral, secured by a perfected first priority lien, subject to certain
permitted  liens.  In  addition,  the  Trust  and  the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  have  guaranteed  the  obligations  of  Precision
under the Secured Facility.
The Secured Facility also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
The interest rate on loans under the Secured Facility denominated in United States dollars is, at the option of Precision,
either a margin over an adjusted United States base rate (the “ABR rate”) or a margin over a Eurodollar rate (“libor”).
The interest rate on loans denominated in Canadian dollars is, at the option of Precision, a margin over the Canadian
prime rate or a margin over the bankers’ acceptance rate. Certain of the margins on the Revolving Credit Facility are
subject to reduction based upon a leverage test.

M A N A G E M E N T ’ S   D I S C U S S I O N   A N D   A N A LY S I S
The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a commitment fee of 0.60% (subject to reduction based on a leverage test) on
the unused portion; a fee on the outstanding amount of the letters of credit denominated in United States dollars equal to
the margin applicable to the Eurodollar rate; and a fee on the outstanding amount of the letters of credit denominated in
Canadian dollars equal to the margin applicable to the bankers’ acceptance rate (subject to reduction for non-financial
letters of credit). Up to US$200 million of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for letters of credit in United States
dollars and/or Canadian dollars.
During the second quarter of 2009, Precision entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to fix the libor rate at 1.7%
on US$250 million of the Term Loan A Facility (with scheduled reductions in the balance through September 2013) and
paid US$2.1 million for a libor interest rate cap of 3.25% on US$350 million of the Term Loan B Facility (with scheduled
reductions in the balance through December 2013). The net amount owing under the interest rate derivative contracts is
settled quarterly. At December 31, 2009 the change in fair value of these interest rate derivative contracts was $0.4 million.
The Term Loan A Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 10% of the principal
amount in 2010 and 2011, 15% of the principal amount in 2012 and 2013, with the balance payable on December 23,
2013, the final maturity date. Due to prepayments made in 2009 the required principal payment for 2010 is nominal.
The Term Loan B Facility is repayable in quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 5% of the principal
amount (after giving effect to reallocations of amounts between the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility) with
the balance payable on September 30, 2014, the final maturity date. Due to the prepayments made in 2009 the required
principal payment for 2010 is nil.
Unsecured Senior Notes
The unsecured Senior Notes, issued on April 22, 2009, have an eight-year term, with one-third of the initial outstanding
principal amount payable on each of the 6th, 7th and 8th anniversaries of the closing date of the private placement.
Interest on the Senior Notes is 10% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, provided that Precision is able, in certain
circumstances, to defer the payment of that interest for as much as two years, in which case the interest rate is increased
to 12% and interest becomes payable on both the principal amount of the Senior Notes and the amount of the deferred
interest, until the deferred interest is paid in full. The Senior Notes are unsecured and have been guaranteed by the Trust
and each subsidiary of the Trust that guaranteed the Secured Facility.
The terms of the Senior Notes contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions,
the Trust’s, Precision’s and their subsidiaries’ ability to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) sell assets; (iii) pay dividends
and distributions (including by the Trust to Unitholders) or purchase the Trust’s, Precision’s or their subsidiaries’ capital stock
or trust units; (iv) make investments or acquisitions; (v) incur liens on their assets; (vi) enter into mergers, consolidations or
amalgamations; and (vii) make capital expenditures.
The Senior Notes also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Terms of the Senior Notes also require Precision to use a specified percentage of excess cash flow to repay indebtedness
under  the  Secured  Facility  in  circumstances  where  the  Trust’s  consolidated  debt  to  capitalization  ratio  (following  the
conversion of the Trust to a corporation) as at the last day of any fiscal year is in excess of 0.30 to 1.00, in addition to
the prepayments from excess cash flow required to be made under the Secured Facility.

General
The terms of the documents governing the Credit Facilities contain provisions that in effect ensure that the lenders have
priority as to payment over the unitholders in respect to the assets and income of the Trust and its subsidiaries. Therefore,
under  certain  conditions,  amounts  due  and  owing  to  the  lenders  under  the  Credit  Facilities  must  be  paid  before  any
distributions can be made to unitholders.
As at December 31, 2009, approximately $711 million was outstanding under the Secured Facility and approximately
$175 million was outstanding under the Senior Notes. The Revolving Credit Facility may be redrawn by Precision in the
future to fund capital expenditures or for other corporate purposes.
During 2009 the Trust generated cash from continuing operations of $505 million and the issuance of Trust units for net
proceeds  of  $413  million.  The  cash  generated  was  used  to  purchase  property  plant  and  equipment  net  of  disposal
proceeds and related non-cash working capital of $204 million, repay long-term debt of $565 million, pay additional
finance charges of $22 million, pay an income tax reassessment of $7 million, and make cash distributions to unitholders
of $27 million. This was offset by a $24 million unrealized foreign exchange loss on holding foreign cash.
The Trust exited 2009 with a long-term debt to long-term debt plus equity ratio of 0.22 compared to 0.37 in 2008 and
a ratio of long-term debt to cash provided by continuing operations of 1.48 compared to 3.98 in 2008.
In addition to the Secured Facility and the Senior Notes, Precision also has an uncommitted operating facility of $25 million
which is utilized for working capital management and the issuance of letters of credit.
Precision’s contractual obligations are outlined in the following table:

In February 2009 Precision announced the suspension of cash distributions for an indefinite period. The suspension of
distributions  was  taken  in  response  to  lower  financial  operating  performance  and  allowed  Precision  to  increase  debt
repayment capability and balance sheet strength. Precision initiated a number of cost reduction and cash generation plans
in 2009 designed to strengthen its capability to reduce net long-term debt and improve its underlying credit quality and
capital structure. The near-term management strategy involves retaining sufficient funds from available distributable cash
to  repay  debt  and  finance  upgrade  capital  expenditures  as  well  as  working  capital  needs.  Planned  asset  growth  will
generally be financed through existing debt facilities or cash retained from continuing operations.

For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2009,  net  earnings  were  $162  million  or  $0.63  per  diluted  unit,  a  decrease  of
$141 million or 47% compared to $303 million or $2.23 per diluted unit for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net
earnings decreased due to the loss from decommissioning rigs, increased financing charges and lower utilization rates
throughout North America partially offset by growth in Precision’s rig fleet in the United States. Earnings were supported
by high-margin term contracts and a $123 million foreign exchange gain, but these favourable factors did not offset lower
earnings from the sharp reduction in equipment utilization and customer pricing compared to 2008 results. Rig utilization
days for 2009 were 5% higher than the prior year due to fourth quarter 2008 acquisition growth in Precision’s United
States operations. EBITDA for 2009 totaled $407 million, a 7% decrease from $437 million in 2008.
The industry and Precision experienced declining utilization during 2009 as customer spending was dramatically reduced
because of lower oil and natural gas prices. For the year, West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil averaged US$61.83
per barrel versus US$99.67 in 2008 and Henry Hub natural gas averaged US$3.92 per MMBtu versus US$8.84 in 2008.
On Canadian markets the average price for AECO natural gas one-year forward was $5.26 per MMBtu in 2009 compared
to $8.74 in 2008.

Currency exchange rates can impact commodity prices and have always had an impact on industry fundamentals in the
Canadian market. Precision reports its financial results in Canadian dollars and currency translation can result in significant
foreign exchange gains or losses on operations outside Canada and United States dollar denominated monetary positions.
At  December  31,  2009  Precision  reported  a  U.S.  dollar  net  monetary  liability  position  of  $570  million.  During  2009
Precision reported a $123 million foreign exchange gain as a result of the Canadian dollar appreciating 17% against the
U.S. dollar.
During 2009 there were about 8,250 wells drilled in western Canada on a rig release basis, a 50% decline from the
16,441 drilled in 2008, while total industry drilling operating days decreased by 42% to about 78,000. The average
industry drilling operating days per well in 2009 was 9.5 compared to 8.2 in 2008. In the United States, for 2009, a total
of approximately 36,250 industry wells were drilled representing a 38% decrease from the 58,229 wells drilled in 2008.

The Canadian drilling industry is subject to seasonality with activity peaking during the winter months in the fourth and
first quarters. As temperatures rise in the spring, the ground thaws and becomes unstable. Government road bans severely
restrict activity in the second quarter in Canada before equipment is moved for summer drilling programs in the third
quarter. These seasonal trends typically lead to quarterly fluctuations in operating results and working capital requirements.
In contrast the activity in the United States is not subject to the same level of seasonal interruptions and therefore operating
results and working capital fluctuations are more subtle.

FOURTH QUARTER 2009
For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009 Precision recorded a net loss of $25 million or $0.09 per diluted unit
compared to net earnings of $92 million or $0.66 per diluted unit in the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarter
Precision decommissioned 38 drilling rigs, 30 well servicing rigs and nine snubbing units resulting in a non-cash loss on
asset decommissioning of $82 million and a net loss per diluted unit after tax of $0.20.
Revenue of $286 million in the fourth quarter was 15% lower than the prior year period. The decrease was due to low
natural gas prices that led to a sharp reduction in the demand for drilling and servicing of natural gas wells. The decrease
was partially mitigated by Precision’s 2008 expansion initiatives through organic and acquisition growth in the United
States onshore contract drilling rig market. Precision marketed an average United States fleet of 159 drilling rigs during
the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to a fleet of 40 drilling rigs in 2008. Revenue in Precision’s Canadian Contract
Drilling Services division decreased 37% while revenue declined 38% in the Canadian-based Completion and Production
Services segment compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The mix of drilling rigs under term contracts and on technically
advanced well-to-well programs supported relatively strong average rig dayrate results in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Drilling rig utilization days (spud to rig release plus move days) in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2009 were 6,595,
a decrease of 27% compared to 9,066 in 2008. Drilling rig activity for Precision in the United States was 82% higher
than  the  same  quarter  of  2008  due  to  acquisition  growth  in  December  2008.  Prior  to  the  acquisition  of  Grey  Wolf,
Precision did not have any drilling rigs operating internationally in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 172 utilization
days in the current quarter from operations in Mexico. Service rig activity declined 24% from the prior year period, with
the service rig fleet generating 60,108 operating hours in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 79,507 hours in
2008  for  utilization  of  29%  and  38%,  respectively.  The  reduction  was  the  result  of  lower  service  rig  demand  due  to
decreased drilling activity and spending on production maintenance of existing wells.
The Trust reported EBITDA for the fourth quarter of $93 million compared with $135 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.
Consistent  with  the  previous  quarter,  Precision’s  term  contract  position,  a  highly  variable  operating  cost  structure  and
economies achieved through vertical integration of the supply chain and maintenance facilities served to limit the declines.
In the Contract Drilling Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased by 8% to $239 million while
EBITDA decreased by 24% to $89 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in revenue was due to lower
activity and dayrates partially offset by acquisition growth in late December 2008. Accordingly, the decline in EBITDA
was due to lower rig utilization and lower customer pricing, partially mitigated by Precision’s strong term contract position.
The reduction was further mitigated through fixed cost reductions and vertical business support in Canada, aided by the
addition of supply chain management in United States operations during the second half of 2009.
During  the  fourth  quarter  the  Contract  Drilling  Services  segment  recognized  a  loss  of  $68  million  related  to  the
decommissioning of 38 drilling rigs. Depreciation for the quarter was $14 million higher than 2008 due to the increase
in United States activity and asset mix associated with higher performance Tier I and II rig utilization and acquisition
growth. The segment applies the unit of production method in calculating rig depreciation expense.

In the Completion and Production Services segment, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased by 38% from the
comparable quarter of 2008 to $49 million while EBITDA declined by 51% to $13 million. The decrease in revenue and
EBITDA is attributed to the decline in industry activity as customers reduced spending in response to sharply lower oil and
natural gas commodity prices.
Service rig activity declined 24% from the prior year period, with the service rig fleet generating 60,108 operating hours
in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 79,507 hours in 2008 for utilization of 29% and 38%, respectively. The
reduction was the result of lower service rig demand due to decreased drilling activity and spending on maintenance of
existing wells. New well completions accounted for 28% of service rig operating hours in the fourth quarter compared to
36% in the same quarter in 2008. Well completions in Canada in the fourth quarter were down 75% from the same
quarter in 2008.
In  the  fourth  quarter  the  Completion  and  Production  Services  segment  recorded  a  $14  million  loss  related  to  the
decommissioning of 30 well servicing rigs and nine snubbing units. Depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2009 was higher
than the prior year period due to a gain on disposal of property recorded in 2008. The segment applies the unit of
production method in calculating well servicing rig depreciation expense.
Total operating costs increased from 54% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 59% in 2009 due to an increase in
United States based turnkey operations where the drilling contractor is responsible for a larger scope of costs with a
commensurate increase in revenue, and the impact of fixed costs and lower average dayrates.
General and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $24 million, an increase of $5 million over the
prior year. The increase was due to the growth in the United States operation.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $35 million compared with $23 million in the
same  period  on  2008.  The  increase  is  attributable  to  the  increased  United  States  contract  drilling  operation  and
depreciation recorded on a higher asset base.
Net financing charges of $34 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $27 million higher than the prior year. Included
in financing charges is $14 million for the amortization of deferred financing costs which includes an $8 million charge
associated with the voluntary debt prepayments in the fourth quarter of 2009. Interest on long-term debt in the quarter
was  $21  million  and  reflected  reduced  debt  levels  that  resulted  from  refinancing  activities  throughout  the  year.  The
increase in interest expense over the prior year is attributable to higher long-term debt associated with the acquisition of
Grey Wolf.
In the fourth quarter of 2009 capital expenditures were $14 million, a decrease of $85 million over the same period in
2008 and included $6 million on expansionary initiatives and $8 million on the upgrade of existing assets.

Business  lines  are  organized  in  two  segments  to  align  with  the  dynamics  of  customer  markets  and  processes.  This
encompasses the initial drilling of oil and natural gas wells, Contract Drilling Services, and the subsequent completion and
workover  of  wells  to  optimize  production  volumes,  Completion  and  Production  Services.  These  segments  have  been
integrated with internal support infrastructure to optimize customer service delivery and lower costs.
An integral element in Precision’s North American operations is vertical integration through internal supply procurement
and distribution that supports rig operations and all other Precision businesses. This support serves to efficiently handle a
high volume of transactions and channel supplier relationships to enhance product quality selection and standardization.
Information system automation has streamlined the procurement, supply distribution and decision making process.
Precision also has an equipment manufacturing, repair and certification division that supports rig operations. This division
provides rig manufacturing capabilities and engineering to facilitate new rig construction and the upkeep of operating
assets. Specialized machining, skilled tradesmen and management has allowed Precision to optimize its capital allocation
through quality workmanship, project planning, retention of intellectual property and cost savings.
Precision’s vertical integration is further complemented by rig manufacturing engineering in the drilling division. Rigs built by
Precision are designed for greater safety and operating efficiency to deliver well cost savings to customers. High performance
drilling rigs combine high mobility, automated pipe handling, advanced control systems, minimal environmental impact,
and highly trained crews.
CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES 
Precision began operating in western Canada as a land drilling contractor in the 1950s. A combination of new equipment
purchases and acquisitions over the last 21 years has expanded fleet capacity and added complementary businesses. For
the past decade, Precision has been Canada’s largest oilfield services provider and with the acquisition of Grey Wolf in
2008 is the second largest North American land drilling contractor.
Precision currently comprises 25% of the Canadian land drilling market, about 6% of the United States market and has
an emerging international presence.
Precision’s rigs are marketed in three classes: Tier I, Tier II and Tier III. Tier I drilling rigs are high performance, of newer
design  and  manufacture,  capable  of  drilling  directionally  or  horizontally  more  efficiently,  are  highly  mobile  requiring
fewer  trucking  loads  and  often  include  the  following  capabilities:  highly  mechanized  tubular  handling  equipment;
integrated top drive or top drive adaptability; advanced mechanical, silicone controlled rectifier (SCR), and AC power
distribution and control efficiencies; electronic control of the majority of operating parameters; specialized drilling tubular;
and high-capacity mud pumps. Tier I drilling rigs are better suited to meet the challenges of complex customer resource
exploitation requirements in the North American shale and unconventional plays.
Tier II drilling rigs are high performance rigs where new equipment and modifications have been applied to improve
performance and enhance directional and horizontal drilling capability. Improvements include: some mechanization of
tubular handling equipment; top drive adaptability; mechanical or SCR type power systems; increased hook load and or
racking capabilities; upgraded power generating, control systems and other major components; and high-capacity mud
pumps. Tier II rigs are usually less mobile than Tier I rigs.
Tier III includes rigs which still provide an acceptable level of performance but would require major equipment upgrades
to meet the criteria of a Tier II or Tier I rig. Tier III rigs are typically conventional mechanical rigs with limited mechanization
and limited directional capability and are particularly well suited for less challenging drilling programs.

Rig tiers are not an indication that a rig from a different tier does not have the capabilities to provide an acceptable level
of service but rather to distinguish among rigs where improvements have been effectively applied to provide an increased
level of performance through the application of various advanced equipment and associated technologies.
Following is a chart of Precision drilling rigs by tier classification as at December 31, 2009:

2009 Compared to 2008
The Contract Drilling Services segment generated revenue of $1,031 million in 2009, 27% more than the $809 million in
2008. An increase in drilling activity resulting mainly from Precision’s acquisition in December 2008 of Grey Wolf was
offset by lower customer demand on an industry wide basis and corresponding lower average day rates in both Canada
and the United States.
Operating earnings of $211 million decreased by $92 million or 30% from $302 million in 2008 and was 20% of revenue
in 2009 compared to 37% in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to lower revenue and the decommissioning of 38 drilling
rigs during the fourth quarter resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings of $68 million. Operating expenses were 56%
of revenue in 2009 compared to 53% in 2008 mainly due product mix and the associated higher percentage of United
States activity. General and administrative expense was higher in the year due to the full year impact of the Grey Wolf
acquisition. Depreciation expense, most of which is calculated on the unit of production method, doubled over the prior
year due to slightly higher overall utilization days and a mix towards Tier I and Tier II drilling rigs with a significantly
higher cost base.
Capital expenditures for the Contract Drilling Services segment in 2009 were $183 million and included $163 million to
expand the underlying asset base and $20 million to upgrade existing equipment. The majority of the expansion capital
was associated with Precision’s 2008 rig build program where 16 rigs were completed for operations in the United States
and Canada.
Canadian Drilling division revenues decreased $188 million or 33% to $378 million from $566 million in 2008. Low oil
prices in the first quarter and depressed natural gas price throughout 2009 resulted in about 8,250 wells drilled in Canada,
its lowest wells drilled since 1992. Although industry total well count fell by 50% last year, horizontal drilling held up as
operators exploited tight oil and natural gas plays with horizontal well bores and multi-stage fractures.
Precision’s Canadian 2009 year end rig count declined to 203 from 220 in 2008 due in part to the decommissioning of
26 Tier III rigs at year end. The industry drilling rig fleet was reduced to about 800 drilling rigs at the end of 2009 and
operating day utilization decreased to 25%, a 17 percentage point decline. Industry operating days in Canada decreased
to 78,005 mainly due to continued uncertainty about future natural gas commodity prices.
Average drilling rig utilization day rates for Precision rigs in Canada increased by 9% in 2009. Proportionately more
activity from Precision’s contract rigs and Tier I rigs which typically receive a dayrate premium was offset by competitive
pricing in the spot market.
Canadian Drilling operating earnings as a percent of revenue decreased by 12 percentage points to 25% of revenue in
2009 primarily due to the decommissioning of 26 rigs and lower customer demand. Normalized for the loss on asset
decommissioning, higher dayrates combined with costs saving initiatives allowed for Canadian Drilling operating earnings
percentage to be maintained.
The United States drilling division revenues increased $418 million or 220% over 2008 to $608 million. Drilling rig activity
was 183% higher in 2009 due to the acquisition growth in December 2008.
Average drilling rig utilization day rates in the United States decreased 8% in 2009 from 2008. The decrease in rates
was marginal due to a reduction in term contracted rigs and margin contributions from idle but contracted rigs.

EBITDA generated from United States operating activities of $216 million increased $124 million or 134% from $92 million
in 2008 primarily due to an increase in activity from the rig fleet growth during 2008, primarily with the acquisition of Grey
Wolf in December 2008. Operating expenses increased from 49% of revenue in 2008 to 59% in 2009. The increase was
mainly due to higher maintenance and repair costs for the rig fleet compared to the relatively new rig fleet during 2008,
fixed costs spread over lower activity levels and a decrease in average drilling rates due to a more competitive environment.
LRG Catering activity and revenue fell by 44% and 40% respectively in 2009 as operators sought economic alternatives
to on-site accommodations. To achieve greater cost control, LRG brought the purchasing and warehousing of its grocery
items in-house.
Rostel Industries and Columbia Oilfield Supply divisions provided valuable support, best measured by the efficiencies and
contributions made to Precision through cost savings. Rostel’s expertise provided Precision control over rig construction
and enhanced cost control. Columbia leveraged its volume purchasing advantage and supplier relationships to provide
timely and reliable supplies to keep Precision’s rigs operating and allows Precision to standardize product use and quality.
2008 Compared to 2007
The Contract Drilling Services segment generated revenue of $809 million in 2008, 17% more than the $694 million in
2007. The increase was due to a nearly four-fold increase in our United States rig activity that was partially offset by
lower than average day rates in both Canada and the United States.
Operating earnings of $302 million increased $16 million or 6% from $286 million in 2007 and were 37% of revenue
in 2008 compared to 41% in 2007. The increase is mainly due to greater United States activity.
Capital expenditures for the Contract Drilling Services segment in 2008 were $203 million and included $163 million to
expand the underlying asset base and $40 million to upgrade existing equipment. The majority of the expansion capital
was associated with Precision’s 2008 rig build program where 18 rigs were being constructed for operations in the United
States and Canada.
Canadian  Drilling  division  revenues  decreased  $16  million  or  3%  over  2007  to  $566  million  due  to  a  decrease  in
customer demand mainly in the fourth quarter as the global economic slowdown took hold.
Canadian Drilling operating earnings decreased by 14% over 2007 due to lower activity and pricing in the first half of
2008 and higher depreciation expense for the year due to a change in rig mix and higher cost base associated with high
performance deeper rigs.
The United States drilling division revenues increased $139 million or 273% over 2007 to $190 million. The increase was
due to strong utilization and the addition of 17 rigs through organic growth and the inclusion of Grey Wolf for eight days
in 2008. Drilling rig activity in 2008 was up 5,908 utilization days or 282% overall compared to 2007.
United States operating earnings of $73 million increased $48 million or 192% from $25 million in 2007 primarily due
to an increase in activity from the rig fleet growth during 2008. Operating expenses increased from 42% of revenue in
2007 to 49% in 2008. The increase was mainly due to higher maintenance and repair costs for the rig fleet compared to
the relatively new rig fleet during 2007.

COMPLETION AND PRODUCTION SERVICES
Precision’s Completion and Production Services completes wells that have been drilled and provides maintenance services
to wells that have been placed into production. The underlying well program parameters determine the type of service rig
and ancillary services best suited to workover a particular well. Service rigs are versatile and capable of working on both
oil  and  natural  gas  wells.  Design  and  technological  improvements  have  made  equipment  offerings  more  competitive
through efficiency gains and wide market appeal to a broad range of well requirements.
Precision’s service rigs and snubbing units each comprise about 20% of their respective Canadian markets. In addition to
completing and servicing wells with rigs, the segment offers snubbing services to wells while pressurized, a broad mix of
rental equipment and wastewater treatment for remote accommodations.

2009 Compared to 2008
The Completion and Production Services segment revenue decreased by $132 million to $176 million mainly due to the
decline in industry activity as customers reduced spending in response to sharply lower oil and natural gas prices.
Operating earnings decreased by $75 million or 87% and was 6% of revenue in 2009 compared to 28% in 2008 due
mainly to lower service activity during the year and a $14 million charge for the decommission of 30 service rigs and
nine  snubbing  units.  Operating  expenses  increased  from  61%  of  revenue  in  2008  to  70%  in  2009.  On  an  hourly
operating basis, costs increased due to higher crew wages and lower equipment utilization resulted in increased daily or
hourly operating costs associated with fixed operating cost components. Depreciation expense for the year decreased 25%
from the prior year due to lower operating activity.
Capital spending in 2009 of $3 million, down 88% from $24 million in 2008, included capital to complete the construction
of a service rig and two wastewater treatment units, and for service rig and snubbing unit upgrades.
The Precision Well Servicing division revenue decreased by $102 million or 43% over 2008 to $135 million as operating
rates moved downward in conjunction with reduced activity levels. Price decreases established in the first quarter of 2009
impacted operating rates for all of 2009.
With a lag between the drilling and completion of a well, the industry reported 9,348 well completions in 2009, 52%
lower than the 19,340 well completions in 2008. There are currently about 180,000 producing wells within the WCSB
which has sustained an ongoing maintenance demand to ensure continuous and efficient production.
Industry fleet capacity in 2009 was slightly lower with approximately 1,050 compared to about 1,100 rigs at the end of
2008. High industry capacity coupled with a significant decrease in well completions and lower workover activity kept
market pricing competitive. There was also a rising number of wells where rig-less or coiled tubing methods are employed.
Live Well Service division revenue for 2009 was $10 million as activity decreased by 52% over 2008 due to weak natural
gas prices and a shift from customer demand away from rig-assist units to self-contained snubbing units.
Precision Rentals division revenue decreased to $26 million, which was $15 million or 37% lower than 2008 as activity
was impacted by lower drilling and well servicing activity. Each of Precision Rental’s three major product lines; surface
equipment, tubulars equipment, and wellsite accommodations, experienced year-over-year declines in rates which was
brought on by excess industry equipment and pricing pressures.
The Terra Water Systems division generated revenue of $5 million in 2009 compared to $6 million in 2008, a decrease
of 18%.

2008 Compared to 2007
The Completion and Production Services segment revenue decreased by $19 million to $309 million mainly due to a
decline in industry completion and production activity.
Operating earnings decreased by $15 million or 14% and was 28% of revenue in 2008 compared to 31% in 2007 due
mainly to lower service activity during the year. Operating expenses increased from 56% of revenue in 2007 to 61% in
2008. The margin decrease was primarily attributed to crew wage rate increases in October 2008 and lower equipment
utilization which resulted in higher daily or hourly operating costs associated with fixed operating cost components.
Capital spending in 2008 of $24 million, down 11% from $27 million in 2007, included $7 million for expansion capital
and $17 million for the replacement of transporter trucks, doghouses, snubbing unit trucks, drill pipe for rental tanks and
a new operating facility. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2008 six service rigs and support equipment were acquired
from a third party for $16 million.
The Precision Well Servicing division revenue decreased by $23 million or 9% over 2007 to $237 million as operating
rates moved downward in conjunction with reduced activity levels. Price decreases established in the fourth quarter of
2007 impacted most of 2008 with an upward adjustment in the fourth quarter. Operating earnings decreased by 25%
over 2007. Costs were higher due to increased crew wages and fuel costs. Capital expenditures in 2008 included the
construction a new service rig, continuation of long-term plans to upgrade and standardize equipment and completion of
a new operating facility.
Live Well Service activity increased by 10% over 2007 with revenues of $24 million due to higher activity from self-contained
units which generate higher operating rates than rig-assist snubbing units. In 2008, Live Well added a self-contained unit
and a rack and pinion unit to the fleet.
Precision Rentals generated revenues of $42 million, which was $3 million or 6% lower than 2007. Each of Precision
Rental’s three major product lines experienced year-over-year revenue declines due to low utilization from excess industry
capacity and lower pricing.
The Terra Water Systems division generated revenue of $6 million in 2008 compared to $5 million in 2007, an increase
of 28%.
CORPORATE AND OTHER ITEMS
2009 Compared to 2008
Corporate and Other Expenses 
Corporate and other expenses were in-line with the prior year at $35 million.
Foreign Exchange
The foreign exchange gain for the current year was $123 million compared to a gain of $2 million in the prior year. The
increase was the result of translation gains on United States dollar denominated debt and the weakening of the U.S. dollar
relative to the Canadian dollar offset marginally by losses on the translation of foreign dollar denominated monetary
assets. At the start of 2009, 92% of the long-term debt was denominated in U.S. dollars whereas as a result of repayments
and refinancing through the year as at the end of 2009, 78% of the debt was denominated in U.S. dollars.
Financing Charges
Net financing charges of $147 million increased by $133 million compared to 2008. This increase was attributable to
the higher average debt outstanding during 2008 compared to the prior year and the interest associated with the new
credit facilities as part of the Grey Wolf acquisition completed December 23, 2008. Included in financing charges is the
amortization of debt issue costs for $26 million compared to $1 million in 2008.

Income Taxes
The Trust’s effective income tax rate, before enacted tax rate reductions, on earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes was nil in 2009 compared to 11% in 2008. The year-over-year decrease in the effective income tax rate
was largely due to a foreign exchange gains and income taxed at lower rates.
The Trust incurs taxes to the extent there are certain provincial capital taxes, as well as taxes on the taxable income, of its
underlying subsidiaries. In addition, future income taxes arise from differences between the accounting and tax basis of
the Trust and its operating entities’ assets and liabilities.
2008 Compared to 2007
Corporate and Other Expenses
Corporate and other expenses increased by $7 million or 43% from 2007 to $35 million. This increase was primarily due
to a $4 million long-term incentive plan accrual in 2008 compared to a $4 million recovery in 2007. Increased foreign
exchange losses on the translation of United States dollar denominated debt resulting from a strengthening United States
dollar were incurred in 2008.
Finance Charges
Net finance charges of $14 million increased by $7 million compared to 2007. This reduction was primarily attributable
to the higher average debt outstanding during 2008 compared to 2007 and the interest associated with the credit facilities
as part of the Grey Wolf acquisition.
Income Taxes
The Trust’s effective income tax rate, before enacted tax rate reductions, on earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes was 11% in 2008 compared to 8% in 2007. The comparatively low effective income tax rate was primarily
a result of the shifting of the income tax burden of the Trust to its unitholders. The year-over-year increase in the effective
income tax rate was largely a result of taxes associated with Precision’s United States operations.
During 2007 the Government of Canada passed legislation to reduce the federal income tax rates to 15% by 2012. These
enacted tax rate reductions resulted in a $22 million future tax recovery in 2007, with no comparable recovery in 2008.
Discontinued Operations
A  $3  million  gain,  net  of  tax,  on  discontinued  operations  was  recorded  in  2007.  The  gain  arose  on  the  receipt  of
additional consideration associated with a 2005 business divestiture.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
This  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Precision’s  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  is  based  on
Precision’s consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. These principles
differ in certain respects from United States GAAP and these differences are described and quantified in Note 21 to the
consolidated financial statements.
The Trust’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation
of the financial statements requires that certain estimates and judgments be made that affect the reported assets, liabilities,
revenues  and  expenses.  These  estimates  and  judgments  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Anticipating future events cannot be done with
certainty, therefore, these estimates may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired and as the Trust’s
operating environment changes.
Following are the accounting estimates believed to require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and which
are the most critical to Precision’s reporting of results of operations and financial positions.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable
Precision  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations  of  its  customers  and  grants  credit  based  upon  past  payment  history,
financial condition and anticipated industry conditions. Customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for
doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations and overall industry conditions. Precision’s history of bad
debt losses has been within expectations and generally limited to specific customer circumstances. However, given the
cyclical nature of the oil and natural gas industry in Canada, the current state of debt and equity markets and the inherent
risk of successfully finding hydrocarbon reserves, a customer’s ability to fulfill its payment obligations can change suddenly
and without notice. In cases where creditworthiness is uncertain, services are provided on receipt of cash in advance, on
receipt of a letter of credit, on deposit of monies in trust or services are declined.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Long-lived  assets,  which  include  property,  plant  and  equipment,  intangibles  and  goodwill,  comprise  the  majority  of
Precision’s assets. The carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. This requires Precision to forecast future
cash flows to be derived from the utilization of these assets based upon assumptions about future business conditions 
and technological developments. Significant, unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for
impairment in the future. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Precision completed its assessment and concluded that there
was no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill.

M A N A G E M E N T ’ S   D I S C U S S I O N   A N D   A N A LY S I S
Depreciation and Amortization
Precision’s property, plant and equipment and its intangible assets are depreciated and amortized based upon estimates
of useful lives and salvage values. These estimates may change as more experience is gained, market conditions shift or
new technological advancements are made.
Income Taxes
The Trust and its subsidiaries follow the liability method which takes into account the differences between financial statement
treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions, assets and liabilities. Future tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Valuation allowances are established to reduce future tax assets when
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized. Estimates of future taxable income and
the  continuation  of  ongoing  prudent  tax  planning  arrangements  have  been  considered  in  assessing  the  utilization  of
available tax losses. Changes in circumstances and assumptions and clarifications of uncertain tax regimes may require
changes to the valuation allowances associated with Precision’s future tax assets.
The business and operations of Precision are complex and Precision has executed a number of significant financings,
business  combinations,  acquisitions  and  dispositions  over  the  course  of  its  history.  The  computation  of  income  taxes
payable as a result of these transactions involves many complex factors as well as Precision’s interpretation of relevant tax
legislation and regulations. Precision’s management believes that the provision for income tax is adequate.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
New  Canadian  accounting  standards  were  released  in  2009  with  an  effective  date  of  January  1,  2011  with  early
adoption permitted:
쮿   Section 1582 “Business Combinations” will require most assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent
consideration to be measured at fair value and that all acquisition costs to be expensed.
쮿   Section  1602  “Non-controlling  Interests”  will  require  that  non-controlling  interests  be  recognized  as  a  separate
component of equity and that net earnings be calculated without a deduction for non-controlling interest.
쮿   Section 1601 “Consolidated Financial Statements” establishes standards for the preparation of consolidated financial
statements.
The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the new Sections, 1582, 1602, and 1601 and will consider if the standards
should be adopted in 2010. These new Canadian standards are aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) therefore early adoption would eliminate adjustments in the transition to IFRS.
TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
Precision is required to report its financial results in accordance with IFRS from January 1, 2011, the changeover date set
by Accounting Standards Board (AcSB). IFRS compliant comparative financial information for one year will be required
on the effective date, therefore the transition date for adoption of IFRS is January 1, 2010.
Good project management practices are essential for a successful transition. Precision has established an IFRS project
team and a Steering Committee to oversee the work performed by the project team. The project team provides quarterly
status updates to the Steering Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Key stakeholders within the
company are kept informed of the project status via project reports and an internal newsletter. Training to the various
groups impacted by the transition is being imparted on a formal and informal basis throughout the course of the project.

A preliminary diagnostic assessment conducted by Precision had highlighted five key areas of impact to financial reporting
namely; capital asset componentization; financial statement disclosure; provisions; asset impairments; and IFRS 1 “First
Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” (“IFRS 1”). Additional assessments performed by the project
team, determined that differences between Canadian GAAP and IFRS with respect to provisions does not have a significant
impact to Precision’s financial reporting process as the IFRS standards exist at this time. It was further established that
income tax standards under IFRS will have a relatively greater impact on Precision’s financial reporting process.
With respect to the key areas of impact to Precision’s financial reporting process, following is a status update:
Capital Assets
Componentization
Under IFRS, each separate component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation
to  the  total  cost  of  the  item  shall  be  depreciated  separately.  Canadian  GAAP  provides  no  guidance  on  the  cost  of  a
component  and  the  replacement  of  components,  and  is  less  specific  than  IFRS  about  the  level  at  which  component
accounting is required. Under Canadian GAAP, Precision depreciated each major asset as one item. As an example,
under Canadian GAAP Precision depreciates an entire drilling rig as one item whereas under IFRS Precision has identified
three separate components which will be depreciated using the unit of production method but with separate and distinct
lives. To accommodate the new component accounting requirement, modifications were made to the Precision’s Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) system. All changes to the ERP system have been completed and tested.
Precision will also implement a new idle asset depreciation policy to depreciate assets that are idle for a period of time.
The parameters of the policy are currently being established.
The change to componentization and an idle asset depreciation policy will result in an increase to depreciation and
amortization expense which is currently being quantified.
Accounting policy choice
Under IFRS, an entity can choose either the cost model or the revaluation model as its accounting policy and shall apply
that policy to an entire class of property, plant and equipment. Precision has opted for the cost model for recognition and
measurement of ongoing asset transactions after its adoption of IFRS in 2011. In addition to the above accounting policy
choice, IFRS 1 grants an optional election, whereby an entity can measure the carrying amount of an item of property,
plant and equipment at the date of transition on the basis of fair value, to alleviate the need to rebuild historical records
of property, plant and equipment as if IFRS provisions had always been used by Precision. Precision has opted to not use
the fair value election and is rebuilding historical cost records under IFRS provisions.
Asset qualification criteria
Under IFRS, the qualification criterion for capital expenditure has now been expanded beyond betterment to include all
material costs whereby future economic benefits will flow to the entity. Effectively, this requirement redefines Precision’s
policy with respect to capital versus repairs and maintenance. The existing policy prohibits the replacement of existing
equipment unless it qualifies as betterment. IFRS will require Precision to capitalize replacement parts and service costs
except those that pertain to the day-to-day operation of the asset.

Financial Statement Disclosure
With IFRS and Canadian GAAP both being principle based frameworks, there are minimal differences in the general
principles for preparation of financial statements. However there are differences between classification of items and nature
and extent of notes disclosures required under IFRS. IFRS prescribes minimum content requirements for balance sheet
(called Statement of Financial Position) and also requires classification of expenses as either by nature or by function.
Precision  is  currently  reviewing  the  detailed  requirements  for  presentation  of  financial  statements  under  IFRS.  Sample
financial statements will be drafted thereafter and reviewed by the Steering Committee.
Income Taxes
In October 2009, after reviewing the numerous comment letters received from the constituents, the International Accounting
Standards  Board  (IASB)  decided  not  to  finalize  the  income  tax  exposure  draft  into  a  new  Income  Taxes  standard.
Therefore, it is currently anticipated that the existing IAS 12 – Income Taxes standard will be applicable to Precision at
adoption of IFRS.
An impact assessment of differences between incomes taxes under Canadian GAAP and IFRS has been completed and is
currently being analyzed to address the identified differences.
Impairments
The definition of an asset group under Canadian GAAP and IFRS is a key difference between the two standards. Under
IFRS, a cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that
largely are independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups thereof. As a result of this, impairment testing under
IFRS will be performed at a lower level in the entity as compared to Canadian GAAP. Precision’s individual assets do not
have independent cash flows and there is a high degree of interchangeability between individual assets. Therefore, under
IFRS Precision anticipates assessing impairment by grouping assets in various categories with each category defined as
a CGU. There are a number of other differences between the actual impairment test under Canadian GAAP and IFRS.
The most significant difference is that the asset impairment under IFRS test is one step based and it is discounted. The IFRS
project team is finalizing Precision’s impairment test model, considering the requirements under IFRS. The new impairment
model will first be used for testing asset impairment at the date of transition.
IFRS 1 – First Time Adoption
Generally on first time adoption of IFRS, an entity is required to retrospectively apply all IFRS standards. The process to
restate  all  Canadian  GAAP  accounting  records  since  inception  of  the  entity  into  IFRS  would  be  an  enormous  task.
Recognizing this major impediment to adopting IFRS, the standard setters developed IFRS 1. This standard provides some
relief from the full retrospective application in the form of mandatory and optional exemptions. Precision has identified
the IFRS 1 elections and is completing the calculations to estimate the impact on the financial statements.
A potentially significant election available relates to business combinations (IFRS 3). IFRS 1 allows Precision not to restate
business combinations prior to the date of transition to IFRS or an earlier date as elected by Precision. There are a number
of other optional elections available to Precision that are being assessed as part of the transition to IFRS.

oveRvieWoFBusinessRisKs
The discussion of risk that follows is not a complete representation. Additional information related to risks is disclosed in
the 2009 Annual Information Form filed with SEDAR and available at www.sedar.com. Also refer to the “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Statements” on page 3.
Certain activities of Precision are affected by factors that are beyond its control or influence. The drilling rig, camp and
catering, service rig, snubbing, rentals, wastewater treatment and related service businesses and activities of Precision in
Canada and the drilling rig, camp and catering and rentals business and activities of Precision in the United States are
directly affected by fluctuations in exploration, development and production activity carried on by its customers which, in
turn, is dictated by numerous factors including world energy prices and government policies. The addition, elimination or
curtailment of government regulations and incentives could have a significant impact on the oil and natural gas business
in Canada and the United States. These factors could lead to a decline in the demand for Precision’s services, resulting in
a material adverse effect on revenues, cash flows, earnings and cash distributions to unitholders.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices
Precision sells its services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Macroeconomic and geopolitical
factors associated with oil and natural gas supply and demand are prime drivers for pricing and profitability within the
oilfield services industry. Generally, when commodity prices are relatively high, demand for Precision’s services are high,
while the opposite is true when commodity prices are low. The markets for oil and natural gas are separate and distinct.
Oil is a global commodity with a vast distribution network. As natural gas is most economically transported in its gaseous
state via pipeline, its market is dependent on pipeline infrastructure and is subject to regional supply and demand factors.
However, recent developments in the transportation of LNG in ocean going tanker ships have introduced an element of
globalization to the natural gas market. Crude oil and natural gas prices are quite volatile, which accounts for much of
the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business.
To partially mitigate the risk associated with demand for our services Precision maintains as variable a cost structure as it
can while continuing to enable it to provide the level of service expected of its customers.
Business is Seasonal and Highly Variable
In Canada and the northern part of the United States, the level of activity in the oilfield service industry is influenced 
by seasonal weather patterns. During the spring months, wet weather and the spring thaw make the ground unstable.
Consequently, municipalities and counties and provincial and state transportation departments enforce road bans that
restrict the movement of rigs and other heavy equipment, thereby reducing activity levels and placing an increased level
of importance on the location of Precision’s equipment prior to imposition of the road bans. The timing and length of road
bans is dependent upon the weather conditions leading to the spring thaw and the weather conditions during the thawing
period.  Additionally,  certain  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  areas  are  located  in  areas  of  western  Canada  that  are
inaccessible, other than during the winter months, because the ground surrounding or containing the drilling sites in these
areas consists of terrain known as muskeg. Until the muskeg freezes, the rigs and other necessary equipment cannot cross
the terrain to reach the drilling site. Moreover, once the rigs and other equipment have been moved to a drilling site, they
may become stranded or otherwise unable to relocate to another site should the muskeg thaw unexpectedly. Precision’s
business results depend, at least in part, upon the severity and duration of the winter season.

43
Customer Merger and Acquisition Activity
Merger  and  acquisition  activity  in  the  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  and  production  sector  can  impact  demand  for
Precision’s services as customers focus on internal reorganization activities prior to committing funds to significant drilling
and capital maintenance projects.
To partially mitigate the risk associated with customer dependency, Precision strives to maintain a broad client base and
diversified geographic positioning.
Workforce Availability 
Precision may not be able to find enough skilled labour to meet its needs, which could limit its growth. As a result, Precision
may have problems finding enough skilled and unskilled laborers in the future if demand for its services increases. If
Precision is not able to increase its service rates sufficiently to compensate for similar wage rate increases, its operating
results may be adversely affected.
To mitigate labour risk Precision closely monitors crew availability for field operations. To retain and attract field personnel
Precision focuses on initiatives that provide a safe and productive work environment, opportunity for advancement and
added wage security. Precision works to ensure future field personnel requirements through programs like its “Toughnecks”
recruiting program.
Credit Market Conditions May Adversely Affect Business
The ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating
performance of the Trust, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial,
business and other factors beyond its control. The credit markets have recently experienced and continue to experience
adverse conditions. Continuing volatility in the credit markets may increase costs associated with debt instruments due to
increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks, or affect the Trust’s, or third parties it seeks to do business with,
ability to access those markets. The Trust may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient
to permit it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness.
In  addition,  there  has  been  substantial  uncertainty  in  the  capital  markets  and  access  to  financing  is  uncertain.  These
conditions  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  industry  in  which  the  Trust  operates  and  its  business,  including  future
operating results. Precision’s customers may curtail their drilling programs, which could result in a decrease in demand
for drilling rigs and a reduction in dayrates, reduction in the number and profitability of turnkey jobs and/or utilization.
In addition, certain customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers, including the Trust, in the event they are
unable to access the capital markets to fund their business operations.
Access to Additional Financing
Precision may find it necessary in the future to obtain additional debt or equity financing through the Trust to support
ongoing operations, to undertake capital expenditures, to repay existing indebtedness or to undertake acquisitions or
other business combination transactions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to Precision
when needed or on terms acceptable or favourable to Precision. Precision’s inability to raise financing to support ongoing
operations or to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt repayments or other business combination transactions could
limit Precision’s growth and may have a material adverse effect upon Precision.
To mitigate credit and financing risks Precision regularly assesses its credit policies and capital structure. Management
believes Precision currently maintains sufficient liquidity as described in its liquidity and capital management earlier in 
this report.

Technology
Complex drilling programs for the exploration and development of remaining conventional and unconventional oil and
natural gas reserves in North America demand high performance drilling rigs. The ability of drilling rig service providers to
meet this demand will depend on continuous improvement of existing rig technology such as drive systems, control systems,
automation, mud systems and top drives to improve drilling efficiency. Precision’s ability to deliver equipment and services
that are more efficient is critical to continued success. There is no assurance that competitors will not achieve technological
improvements that are more advantageous, timely or cost effective than improvements developed by Precision.
To  attempt  to  mitigate  this  risk  Precision  has  an  experienced  internal  engineering  department  that  works  closely  with
operations and marketing on equipment design and improvements.
Competitive Industry
The contract drilling business is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, and the drilling contracts Precision
competes for are usually awarded on the basis of competitive bids. Management believes pricing and rig availability are
the  primary  factors  considered  by  Precision’s  potential  customers  in  determining  which  drilling  contractor  to  select.
Management believes other factors are also important. Among those factors are:
쮿   the drilling capabilities and condition of drilling rigs;
    쮿   the quality of service and experience of rig crews;
    쮿   the safety record of the contractor and the particular rig;
    쮿   the offering of ancillary services;
    쮿   the ability to provide equipment adaptable to, and personnel familiar with, new technologies and drilling techniques;
and
쮿   the mobility and efficiency of rigs.
Capital Overbuild in the Drilling Industry
Because of the long life nature of drilling equipment and the lag between the moment a decision to build a rig is made
and the moment the rig is placed into service, the number of rigs in the industry does not always correlate to the level 
of demand for those rigs. Periods of high demand often spur increased capital expenditures on rigs, and those capital
expenditures  may  exceed  actual  demand.  Management  believes  that  there  is  currently  an  excess  of  rigs  in  the  North
American  oil  and  gas  industry  in  relation  to  current  levels  of  demand.  This  capital  overbuild  could  cause  Precision’s
competitors to lower their rates and could lead to a decrease in rates in the oilfield services industry generally, which
would have an adverse effect on the revenues, cash flows and earnings of the Trust.
To mitigate the risk associated with industry competitiveness and capital overbuild, Precision has comprehensive strategic
planning to align resource allocation, investment and competitiveness.
Tax Consequences of Previous Transactions Completed by Precision
The business and operations of Precision are complex and Precision has executed a number of significant financings,
business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions over the course of its history. The computation of income taxes payable
as a result of these transactions involves many complex factors as well as Precision’s interpretation of relevant tax legislation
and regulations which Precision believes to be correct. Management also believes that the provision for income tax is
adequate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.
However, there are a number of tax filing positions that can still be the subject of review by taxation authorities who may
successfully  challenge  Precision’s  interpretation  of  the  applicable  tax  legislation  and  regulations,  with  the  result  that
additional taxes could be payable by Precision and the amount payable without penalties could be up to $400 million as
of December 31, 2009. Any increase in tax liability would reduce the net assets of and funds available to the Trust.

Environmental 
There is growing concern about the apparent connection between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change. The issue
of energy and the environment has created intense public debate in Canada and around the world in recent years that is
likely to continue for the foreseeable future and could potentially have a significant impact on all aspects of the economy
including the demand for hydrocarbons and resulting in lower demand for Precision’s services.
Precision  maintains  a  comprehensive  insurance  and  risk  management  program  to  protect  its  assets  and  operations.
Precision monitors and complies with current environmental requirements.
United States Dollar Exchange Exposure
Precision’s operations in the United States have revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in United States
dollars. As a result Precision’s income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flow are impacted by changes in
exchange rates between Canadian and United States currencies.
쮿 Translation of United States Subsidiaries
    Precision’s United States operations are considered self-sustaining operations and are translated into Canadian dollars
using the current rate method. Under this method, the assets and liabilities of Precision’s operations in the United States
are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates and the
unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income, a component of Unitholders’ equity. As a
result, changes in the Canadian to United States dollar exchange rates could materially increase or decrease Precision’s
United States dollar denominated net assets on consolidation which increase or decrease Unitholders’ equity. In addition,
under certain circumstances Canadian GAAP requires foreign exchange gains and losses that are accumulated in
other comprehensive income to be recorded as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings. Precision’s
United States operations generate revenue and incur expenses in United States dollars and the United States dollar
based earnings are converted into Canadian dollars for purposes of financial statement consolidation and reporting.
The conversion of the United States dollar based revenue and expenses to a Canadian dollar basis does not result in
a foreign exchange gain or loss but does result in lower or higher net earnings from United States operations than
would have occurred had the exchange rate not changed. If the Canadian dollar strengthens versus the United States
dollar,  the  Canadian  dollar  equivalent  of  net  earnings  from  United  States  operations  will  be  negatively  impacted.
Precision does not currently hedge any of its exposure related to the translation of United States dollar based earnings
into Canadian dollars.
쮿 Transaction Exposure
    Precision has long-term debt denominated in United States dollars. This debt is converted at the exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet dates with the resulting gains or losses included in the statement of earnings as “foreign exchange”.
If the Canadian dollar strengthens versus the United States dollar, Precision will incur a foreign exchange gain from the
translation of this debt. Currently, Precision has not designated any of this debt as a hedge against the net asset position
of its self-sustaining United States operations. The vast majority of Precision’s United States operations are transacted
in United States dollars. Transactions for Precision’s Canadian operations are primarily transacted in Canadian dollars.
However, Precision occasionally purchases goods and supplies in United States dollars for Canadian operations. These
types of transactions and foreign exchange exposure would not typically have a material impact on the Canadian
operations’ financial results.
When Precision acquired Grey Wolf the debt was drawn in U.S. dollars which provided a natural hedge for the U.S. dollar
settled operations. Other than natural hedges that arise from day-to-day operations, Precision monitor’s foreign exchange
changes but does not currently maintain an active foreign currency hedge program.

Safety Risk
Standards for the prevention of incidents in the oil and gas industry are governed by service company safety policies and
procedures, accepted industry safety practices, customer specific safety requirements, and health and safety legislation.
Management  believes  that  Precision’s  drilling  and  well  servicing  businesses  are  highly  competitive  with  numerous
competitors. A key factor considered by Precision’s customers in selecting oilfield service providers is safety. Deterioration
in Precision’s safety performance could result in a decline in the demand for Precision’s services and could have a material
adverse effect on its revenues, cash flows and earnings of the Trust.
Through its Target Zero program Precision maintains a comprehensive training and assessment program designed to work
towards a vision of no work place incidents resulting in injury.
Dependence on Third Party Suppliers
Precision sources certain key rig components, raw materials, equipment and component parts from a variety of suppliers
located in Canada, the United States and overseas. Precision also outsources some or all services for the construction of
drilling and service rigs. While alternate suppliers exist for most of these components, materials, equipment, parts and
services, cost increases, delays in delivery due to high activity or other unforeseen circumstances may be experienced.
Precision maintains relationships with a number of key suppliers and contractors, maintains an inventory of key components,
materials, equipment and parts and orders long lead time components in advance. However, if the current or alternate
suppliers are unable to provide or deliver the necessary components, materials, equipment, parts and services, any resulting
delays by Precision in the provision of services to its customers may have a material adverse effect on Precision’s business,
revenues, cash flows, prospects and earnings of the Trust.
To mitigate this risk Precision maintains relationships with a number of key suppliers and uses internal procurement operations
when appropriate.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed with, or submitted to, securities regulatory authorities is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified under Canadian and United States securities laws. The information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As  of  December  31,  2009,  an  evaluation  was  carried  out,  under  the  supervision  of  and  with  the  participation  of
management,  including  the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of
Precision’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under the rules adopted by the Canadian securities regulatory
authorities and by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on that evaluation, the President and
Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  the  design  and  operation  of  Precision’s  disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as at December 31, 2009.
During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2009,  there  were  no  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Precision’s internal control over financial reporting.
It should be noted that while Precision’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that the
Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective, they do not
expect that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors
and  fraud.  A  control  system,  no  matter  how  well  conceived  or  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

non-gAApMeAsuRes
Precision  uses  certain  measures  that  are  not  recognized  under  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to
assess  performance  and  believe  these  non-GAAP  measures  provide  useful  supplemental  information  to  investors.
Following are the non-GAAP measures Precision uses in assessing performance.
EBITDA
Management believes that in addition to net earnings, earnings before interest, taxes, loss on asset decommissioning,
depreciation and amortization and foreign exchange (“EBITDA”) as derived from information reported in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings and Retained Earnings (Deficit) is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of
the results generated by Precision’s principal business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed,
the  impact  of  foreign  exchange,  how  the  results  are  taxed,  how  funds  are  invested,  how  non-cash  depreciation  and
amortization charges or how non-cash decommissioning charges affect results.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings under GAAP as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings and Retained Earnings (Deficit) to EBITDA.

Operating Earnings
Management believes that in addition to net earnings, operating earnings as reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings  and  Retained  Earnings  (Deficit)  is  a  useful  supplemental  measure  as  it  provides  an  indication  of  the  results
generated by Precision’s principal business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed, the impact
of foreign exchange or how the results are taxed. Operating earnings as calculated by Precision was changed in the year
and it now excludes the effects of foreign exchange. The revised calculation is a better reflection of results from operations
without consideration as to how results were impacted by foreign exchange.
