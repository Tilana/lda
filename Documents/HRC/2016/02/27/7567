<p><b>  Preliminary report of the Independent Expert on the human

</p>
<p><i> Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In this report, the Independent Expert supplements the oral update submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on 26 March 2014. She reports on her two visits to the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic undertaken from 4 to 14 March and from 10 to 18 April 2014. In this 
</p>
<p>context, the Independent Expert held talks with leading political figures and the transitional 
</p>
<p>authorities, in particular the transitional Head of State. She also met with the members of 
</p>
<p>the diplomatic corps, the commander-in-chief of the French forces, the representatives of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations specialized agencies, the African Union, international non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, civil society organizations, women, young people and community leaders.  
</p>
<p> She began her second visit on the day of adoption of Security Council resolution 
</p>
<p>2149 (2014) in which the Council set up the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 
</p>
<p>Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and decided to transfer 
</p>
<p>the responsibilities of the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic (MISCA) to MINUSCA.  
</p>
<p> During her first visit, the Independent Expert noted that the right to life, security and 
</p>
<p>physical integrity was being violated by assassinations, summary executions and cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman and degrading treatment. In addition, the exercise of civil and political rights, 
</p>
<p>more particularly freedom of opinion and religion, freedom of movement and freedom to 
</p>
<p>choose one&#8217;s place of residence, were considerably constrained by the deterioration of the 
</p>
<p>security situation, impunity and the fragility of State institutions.

</p>
<p> Overcrowding and the prevailing insecurity in Bangui prison, together with the lack 
</p>
<p>of appropriate detention facilities in the rest of the country and the weaknesses of the 
</p>
<p>judicial system and the ineffectiveness of the criminal justice system, hamper the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice and the fight against impunity. This situation is regarded as one of 
</p>
<p>the root causes of the instability threatening social peace and undermines efforts at dialogue 
</p>
<p>and intercommunal reconciliation.  
</p>
<p> Breaches of international humanitarian law were reported to the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>during her two visits: forced displacements of the civilian population, particularly Muslims, 
</p>
<p>destruction of property essential to the survival of the population (health centres, schools, 
</p>
<p>residential dwellings, fields), attacks against the civilian population in some parts of the 
</p>
<p>country, rapes and other forms of sexual violence, and the recruitment of minors by armed 
</p>
<p>groups. The weakness of the State institutions and the fragility of the rule of law conduced 
</p>
<p>to a general climate of fear and insecurity, as well as a feeling of distrust and suspicion 
</p>
<p>which perpetuated the vicious cycle of violence in the country.  
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert noted that, despite the wish expressed by the transitional 
</p>
<p>authorities to combat impunity effectively and ensure that the Government&#8217;s writ runs 
</p>
<p>throughout the country, serious obstacles remain given the inadequacy of resources, the 
</p>
<p>lack of security for judges, courts and places of detention, the inadequacy of public 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and the delays in the deployment of public service staff.  
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert noted the development of local intercommunity 
</p>
<p>reconciliation initiatives in Bangassou. She received reports of similar initiatives launched 
</p>
<p>by the residents of the third arrondissement of Bangui and of some towns in the interior. 
</p>
<p>She also received reports of the existence of pockets of stability in the south-west, in Boda 
</p>
<p>and Berb&#233;rati, and in the north-west, in Bozoum. On the economic and social level, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert noted that the crisis experienced by the Central African Republic since 
</p>
<p>December 2012 has led to the collapse of economic activity, paralysed the Government 
</p>
<p>administration and given rise to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis with nearly one 
</p>
<p>quarter of the population being displaced or reduced to refugee status. 
</p>
<p> The economic recovery remains dependent on the normalization of security 
</p>
<p>conditions, the return of displaced persons and refugees and the gradual recovery of 
</p>
<p>economic activity, particularly in the agricultural and trade sectors. The precariousness of 
</p>
<p>the economic situation seriously compromises the enjoyment of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, although the Independent Expert noted the reopening of some schools, 
</p>
<p>particularly in Bangui and Bangassou.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted under Human Rights Council resolutions 24/34 of 27 
</p>
<p>September 2013 and S-20/1 of 20 January 2014, in which the Independent Expert is 
</p>
<p>requested to submit a preliminary report to the Council at its twenty-sixth session. In the 
</p>
<p>present report, the Independent Expert gives an account of the human rights situation based 
</p>
<p>on observations made and information collected during her two visits to the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic, undertaken from 4 to 14 March 2014 and from 10 to 18 April 2014. The report 
</p>
<p>contains the recommendations included in her oral update (A/HRC/25/CRP.2) presented at 
</p>
<p>the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council on 26 March 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert began her mandate with a mission to Geneva from 25 to 28 
</p>
<p>February 2014, during which she held talks with the Permanent Representative of Gabon in 
</p>
<p>his dual capacity as Representative of Gabon and President of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>for 2014, the Permanent Representative of the Central African Republic to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), the Permanent Representatives of France, Chad and the 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo and the Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States of 
</p>
<p>America, together with his team for the Central African Republic. She also met with the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative of the African Union (AU), the Permanent Representative of the 
</p>
<p>European Union (EU) and human rights experts, in order to hear their points of view. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert also had meetings with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and several units of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR).  
</p>
<p>3. During her first visit to the Central African Republic, in addition to talking to high-
</p>
<p>ranking officials from the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic (BINUCA), the Independent Expert met with the transitional Head of 
</p>
<p>State, the Minister of Public Health, Social Affairs and Humanitarian Action, the Secretary 
</p>
<p>of State for Rural Development, the Minister of National Education, Higher Education and 
</p>
<p>Scientific Research and the Minister of Communication and National Reconciliation. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert also had discussions with the Chief of Staff of the Minister of Justice, 
</p>
<p>the public prosecutor and his deputies, leading politicians, elements of the ex-Seleka and 
</p>
<p>anti-Balaka movements, women parliamentarians, the network of women leaders, the 
</p>
<p>network of national human rights NGOs, young persons and displaced persons at the 
</p>
<p>Mpoko camps and at the airport. She also talked to the Representative of the African Union 
</p>
<p>(AU), the Head of the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic (MISCA), the Ambassadors of France, Morocco, Cameroon, the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation and China to the Central African Republic, the Representative of the European 
</p>
<p>Union (EU), the commander of Operation Sangaris and representatives of the International 
</p>
<p>Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the humanitarian community and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies. 
</p>
<p>4. During that initial mission, she visited several sites, such as Ngaragba prison, where 
</p>
<p>she was shown the cells and talked to nine detainees. She also visited the Mpoko 1 and 2 
</p>
<p>displaced persons camps. Outside Bangui, she visited Kaga-Bandoro, where she spoke with 
</p>
<p>MISCA representatives. She also talked to 26 minor children saved by MISCA following 
</p>
<p>an attack on the convoy that was transporting them northwards. Those children, four of 
</p>
<p>whom have been reunited with their father, are currently being sheltered at the MISCA 
</p>
<p>compound with the assistance of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the 
</p>
<p>NGO Save the Children, while awaiting news of their parents and possible transfer to an 
</p>
<p>appropriate reception facility. At Kaga-Bandoro, she had a chance to meet with the local 
</p>
<p>commander, a former Seleka member, and with members of the anti-Balaka movement. She 
</p>
<p>found from those meetings that, despite their belligerence, the victims of which were more </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>often than not civilians, the leaders of the two groups consult each other from time to time, 
</p>
<p>in order to resolve their problems. She also had productive meetings with the members of 
</p>
<p>the humanitarian community of Kaga-Bandoro, who are doing remarkable work under the 
</p>
<p>guidance of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
</p>
<p>5. For her second visit, the Independent Expert wished to focus on the interior of the 
</p>
<p>country. She had, therefore, initially planned to visit the regions of Bangassou, Nd&#233;l&#233;, 
</p>
<p>Bouar, Bossangoa and Berb&#233;rati and to enquire about the human rights situation and local 
</p>
<p>intercommunal reconciliation initiatives. However, owing to a lack of logistical resources, 
</p>
<p>including jet fuel, the Independent Expert was only able to visit Bangassou. She held 
</p>
<p>meetings with a number of politicians and various transitional officials, including the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister Delegate and Legal 
</p>
<p>Adviser to the Office of the President of the Republic, as well as with local elected 
</p>
<p>officials, the diplomatic corps, the commander of the Sangaris force, representatives of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations specialized agencies, the acting Special Representative of the Secretary- 
</p>
<p>General of the United Nations for the Central African Republic, the Representative of the 
</p>
<p>African Union (AU), human rights defenders, religious leaders and influential figures in 
</p>
<p>Bangui. She also undertook a mission to the interior, more specifically Bangassou, where 
</p>
<p>she met the main actors involved in intercommunal reconciliation initiatives. She also 
</p>
<p>visited the PK12 district of Bangui, where she held talks with the municipal authorities, and 
</p>
<p>the KM5 district, where she spoke with Muslim religious leaders. 
</p>
<p>6. Throughout her mission, the Independent Expert collected information on 
</p>
<p>developments affecting the human rights situation and the state of implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in her oral update of 26 March 2014, including on the fight 
</p>
<p>against impunity and intercommunal reconciliation initiatives. That visit enabled her to 
</p>
<p>collect testimonies from local communities and associations and the local, municipal and 
</p>
<p>religious authorities and in particular, to obtain information about local intercommunal 
</p>
<p>reconciliation initiatives. Working with the transitional authorities, she was able to gauge 
</p>
<p>the progress made in restoring the authority of the State and in combating impunity through 
</p>
<p>the authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the criminal justice system, redeploy administrative staff 
</p>
<p>and operationalize public institutions and services. 
</p>
<p>7. An analysis of the situation shows that human rights violations continue to be 
</p>
<p>committed. Although the number of killings is falling, not a day goes by without reports of 
</p>
<p>acts of violence resulting in deaths or injuries in Bangui or in the interior. Intercommunal 
</p>
<p>conflict and fighting between former Seleka members and anti-Balaka militias give rise to 
</p>
<p>abuses and acts of extreme violence. In March 2014, the Independent Expert noted that the 
</p>
<p>overall situation in the Central African Republic continued to be marked by intercommunal 
</p>
<p>tensions grounded in social, political, religious and economic issues, reflecting 
</p>
<p>geographical and cultural differences. Unfortunately, these tensions lead to serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations during systematic and violent intercommunal attacks. Abuses continue to 
</p>
<p>be perpetrated, including killings and the forced displacement of mainly Muslim 
</p>
<p>communities from their places of origin. Such attacks are followed by reprisals against 
</p>
<p>communities considered by Muslim civilians or former Seleka rebels to be Christian. In 
</p>
<p>many cases, Christian populations also act in reprisal for attacks blamed on Muslims or the 
</p>
<p>former Seleka. The clashes currently occurring in the hinterland between these two armed 
</p>
<p>groups, who do not hesitate to attack the MISCA and Sangaris international forces, have led 
</p>
<p>to a worsening of the security situation, to the detriment of the civilian populations who 
</p>
<p>bear the brunt of these attacks. 
</p>
<p>8. In the present report, the Independent Expert describes the evolving human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in the Central African Republic, including the relevant influencing factors, and 
</p>
<p>assesses the measures taken by national actors and international partners. The Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert concludes the report with recommendations to the national and international actors </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p>regarding the action needed to strengthen the capacity to respond to human rights violations 
</p>
<p>and breaches of international humanitarian law in the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>9. The Independent Expert thanks the Government of the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>and, in particular, the transitional Head of State, Ms. Catherine Samba-Panza, for her 
</p>
<p>helpfulness and her cooperation. She also thanks all those persons in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic and elsewhere, including the members of the diplomatic corps and the 
</p>
<p>commanders of the Sangaris and MISCA international forces, who provided her with 
</p>
<p>information relevant to her mandate. She wishes to thank in particular the United Nations 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies, MISCA, BINUCA/the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 
</p>
<p>Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and their human rights 
</p>
<p>sections for their constant support. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overall situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and security situation 
</b></p>
<p>10. Several interlocutors have claimed that the Central African Republic bears the scars 
</p>
<p>of coups d&#8217;&#233;tat, mutinies and recurrent poor governance that have led to insecurity, political 
</p>
<p>instability and potential repercussions on peace and stability in the subregion. They all 
</p>
<p>agree that the political, socioeconomic and structural crises that have plagued the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic for decades have as their main causes: nepotism, corruption, disparities 
</p>
<p>between the regions, social inequalities, weak rule of law, injustice and poverty. Under 
</p>
<p>previous regimes, in particular that of Mr. Fran&#231;ois Boziz&#233;, human rights violations are said 
</p>
<p>to have been committed with complete impunity. 
</p>
<p>11. Since gaining independence, the Central African Republic has never experienced 
</p>
<p>stable and sustainable political governance. The Central African State exists only in the 
</p>
<p>capital, Bangui; the hinterland has always been, and remains, fertile ground for the 
</p>
<p>proliferation of weapons and armed groups of all kinds. The authority of the State and the 
</p>
<p>functioning of the public institutions, including the judicial bodies, have never effectively 
</p>
<p>extended to the entire country. The Central African Republic has, therefore, always been a 
</p>
<p>fragile entity and the current crisis, which began with the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 24 March 2013,1 is 
</p>
<p>merely the overt manifestation of successive tensions that for so long have not been 
</p>
<p>appropriately addressed. 
</p>
<p>12. The inability of the ex-Seleka coalition, the new ruling power, to protect the 
</p>
<p>population from the worst excesses of rogue elements from within its own ranks, as well as 
</p>
<p>the numerous human rights violations attributed to those elements, led to the formation of 
</p>
<p>self-defence militias, the anti-Balaka (anti-machete in the Sango language), in order to 
</p>
<p>protect the population. However, the anti-Balaka allegedly turned out to be even more 
</p>
<p>murderous, in turn carrying out unprecedented human rights violations. The clashes 
</p>
<p>between ex-Seleka and anti-Balaka forces, which still mainly claim civilian victims, have 
</p>
<p>gone beyond the political dimension and developed into religious and intercommunal strife, 
</p>
<p>most seriously affecting the Muslim minority. This portentous development undoubtedly 
</p>
<p>signifies a new chapter in a country previously marked by essentially inter-ethnic disputes. 
</p>
<p>13. Since the resignation, in January 2014, of the transitional President from the ex-
</p>
<p>Seleka coalition, Mr. Michel Djotodia, and the election of Ms. Catherine Samba-Panza to 
</p>
<p>the office of transitional Head of State, the armed groups do not seem to have heeded the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The former Seleka coalition (mainly made up of Muslims) seized power following the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 
</p>
<p>24 March 2013. </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>numerous calls for political dialogue and national reconciliation. The security situation 
</p>
<p>remains precarious and the new transitional authorities are working, among other things, to 
</p>
<p>combat impunity by re-establishing the criminal justice system, in order to send a clear 
</p>
<p>message to all those who, in one way or another, incite young people to violence. 
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the international forces&#8217; efforts, the deteriorating security situation and the 
</p>
<p>increasing violence have forced local populations, and the Muslim community in particular, 
</p>
<p>to flee their homes or the country, either unaided or with the assistance of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations. This makes it essential not only to strengthen security and 
</p>
<p>civilian protection measures, but to establish a dialogue between all the actors, in order to 
</p>
<p>halt the intercommunal violence, consider appropriate solutions and initiate or support 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation measures. 
</p>
<p>14. Bangassou, in the south-east of the Central African Republic, is the administrative 
</p>
<p>centre of the prefecture of Mbomou. In that town, where the mayor is a Muslim woman, a 
</p>
<p>religious forum and a mediation committee have been set up. Both of those bodies, which 
</p>
<p>have very few resources, are working to maintain peace and social cohesion between the 
</p>
<p>Muslim and Christian communities. The mediation committee, formed in April 2013, in the 
</p>
<p>wake of the assumption of power by the former Seleka, was reorganized in October 2013 
</p>
<p>and now has statutes and internal regulations. The committee, which is supported by the 
</p>
<p>religious forum, holds seminars in nearby towns and plans to extend its coverage to the 
</p>
<p>whole of the prefecture of Mbomou provided it is given the necessary resources. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic situation 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to an assessment of the economic situation carried out by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2013, the destruction of the economic fabric 
</p>
<p>of the country following the crisis resulted in the mass displacement of populations; the 
</p>
<p>deterioration of security and health conditions; food insecurity; the wastage of natural 
</p>
<p>resources; and the freezing of funding for development projects. As a consequence, exports 
</p>
<p>of goods have fallen and the country has been suspended from the Kimberley Process and 
</p>
<p>the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The crisis has led to a collapse of 
</p>
<p>economic activity, paralysed the Government and caused an unprecedented humanitarian 
</p>
<p>crisis. The gross domestic product (GDP) contracted sharply (by about 36 per cent) in 2013, 
</p>
<p>as all sectors of economic activity experienced downturns. Inflation accelerated to 6.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent in 2013, compared with 5.9 per cent in 2012. Government revenues fell by more than 
</p>
<p>half to 5.7 per cent of GDP, while the external current account deficit virtually doubled to 
</p>
<p>10.4 per cent of GDP.2 
</p>
<p>16. That situation explains the irregular payment, at least four months in arrears, of 
</p>
<p>public officials&#8217; salaries. A slight economic upturn is forecast for 2014, with a GDP growth 
</p>
<p>rate of 1.5 per cent. This is contingent on the normalization of the security situation, the 
</p>
<p>return of displaced persons and the gradual revival of economic activity, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>agricultural and trade sectors. Such a context does not bode well for the enjoyment of those 
</p>
<p>economic and social rights that depend closely on the revival of the economy.

</p>
<p><b> III. Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>17. According to the Human Rights and Justice Section of BINUCA/MINUSCA, over 
</p>
<p>the past four months, almost 348,046 persons originating from Cameroon, Chad, the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Republic of the Congo, who had been living in 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic for generations, have fled the violence there in order to seek 
</p>
<p>refuge in those neighbouring countries. Given that most of those persons no longer have 
</p>
<p>ties, or support in their countries of origin, they are extremely vulnerable and need food aid. 
</p>
<p>The number of displaced persons reportedly stands at more than 900,000, and some 1.6 
</p>
<p>million Central Africans out of a population of 4.5 million require humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
</p>
<p>and its partners, there will be further population movements by the end of 2014. Those 
</p>
<p>forecasts are all the more worrying given that the Independent Expert was informed, during 
</p>
<p>her first visit, that only US$ 65 million of the US$ 550 million pledged following a 
</p>
<p>humanitarian appeal had been mobilized. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights: violations of the rights to life, security and 
</b></p>
<p><b>physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>18. During her first visit, the Independent Expert found violations of the rights to life, 
</p>
<p>security and physical integrity, which took the form of assassinations, summary executions, 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, overcrowding in Bangui prison, poor conditions of 
</p>
<p>detention, and insecurity in prisons and places of detention. She received reports that the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of most of these violations were ex-Seleka, anti-Balaka and elements of the 
</p>
<p>Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) and that most of the violations were committed by anti-
</p>
<p>Balaka against Muslim groups. On her second visit, she found that human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>albeit fewer of them, were still occurring. Daily acts of violence attributed to ex-Seleka, 
</p>
<p>anti-Balaka, or other criminal groups destroy property and kill or injure persons in Bangui 
</p>
<p>or the interior of the country. Threats of anti-Balaka and ex-Seleka violence still weigh 
</p>
<p>heavily on the capital and the rest of the country. The security situation remains precarious. 
</p>
<p>While MISCA and Sangaris forces have been deployed outside the capital, their numbers 
</p>
<p>are insufficient to secure the entire territory of the Central African Republic. The European 
</p>
<p>Union has deployed the European Union-led military mission EUFOR CAR to take over 
</p>
<p>from Sangaris forces at Bangui airport.  
</p>
<p>19. Since 24 March 2013, the crisis in the Central African Republic has claimed 
</p>
<p>thousands of victims, although it is difficult to estimate the total number since in some, 
</p>
<p>mostly Muslim communities, the dead are buried immediately. In December 2013, attacks 
</p>
<p>by anti-Balaka and reprisals by ex-Seleka forces claimed a particularly alarming number of 
</p>
<p>victims. According to the report of the mission deployed to the country by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 12 to 24 December 2013, at least 
</p>
<p>1,000 persons were killed and hundreds wounded between 5 and 6 December 2013 in 
</p>
<p>Bangui alone, while the Central African Red Cross reported more than 1,500 deaths. 3 
</p>
<p>Violence of this kind has continued to produce a steady flow of victims. Three Muslims 
</p>
<p>were reportedly killed on 7 March 2014 by anti-Balaka in the Combattant district of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3  Oral report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights at the twentieth special 
</p>
<p>session of the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic, held on 20 January 2014. </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Bangui. These extrajudicial executions were followed on 8 March 2014 by the deaths of 
</p>
<p>four alleged members of anti-Balaka militias, who were reportedly killed by Muslims.  
</p>
<p>20. At least 20 persons were killed on the night of 27 to 28 March 2014 in Bangui 
</p>
<p>during a grenade attack at a funeral wake. On 14 April 2014, the discovery of four bodies of 
</p>
<p>persons of the Christian faith, including three from the same family (father, mother and 
</p>
<p>daughter), was reported to the Human Rights and Justice Section of BINUCA/MINUSCA. 
</p>
<p>These persons were reportedly killed by ex-Seleka in the Bimbo district of the sixth 
</p>
<p>arrondissement of Bangui. Fighting between anti-Balaka, ex-Seleka and other armed groups 
</p>
<p>continues to produce civilian casualties in the interior of the country. Crimes continue to be 
</p>
<p>committed, such as the murder of the parish priest of Paoua in the Bossangoa (North) 
</p>
<p>diocese, abb&#233; Christ Formane Wilibona, who was said to have been killed on Thursday, 17 
</p>
<p>April 2014 by armed Fulani herders affiliated to ex-Seleka rebels. In Dekoa, clashes 
</p>
<p>between ex-Seleka and anti-Balaka reportedly resulted in 30 deaths on 9 April 2014. 
</p>
<p>21. Since the deployment of MISCA and Sangaris forces pursuant to Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 2127 (2013), the number of reported killings has decreased, but it remains 
</p>
<p>worryingly high as the Independent Expert was able to observe during her second visit.  
</p>
<p>22. Incidents in Bangui and in the interior of the country have not abated, as evidenced 
</p>
<p>by the clashes between armed groups, the attack against the M&#233;decins sans fronti&#232;res health 
</p>
<p>centre in Nanga Boguila on 26 April 2014, which resulted in 22 deaths, and the attack on a 
</p>
<p>humanitarian convoy in Dikissou on 28 April 2014, which left 2 dead. The violence, which 
</p>
<p>continues mainly because of the proliferation of firearms and light weapons in camps for 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons in Bangui and the hinterland, calls for emergency security 
</p>
<p>measures. The continued presence of weapons in the hands of criminals generates violence; 
</p>
<p>it is a constant threat to the right to security and peace and impedes development and 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; participation in decision-making processes affecting their daily lives.  
</p>
<p>23. The right to human security, in particular physical security, freedom of movement 
</p>
<p>and freedom to choose one&#8217;s residence, continues to be violated. This has been the case in 
</p>
<p>the PK12, KM5 and Boda districts where Muslims are unable to leave their homes without 
</p>
<p>the risk of being shot dead by the anti-Balaka. As a result, there are no longer any Muslims 
</p>
<p>in Bossangoa, while in Boda the Muslims that remain, despite being protected by the 
</p>
<p>Sangaris and/or MISCA forces, lack basic necessities that neither protection force can 
</p>
<p>provide. They live under the constant threat of anti-Balaka violence and are forcibly 
</p>
<p>confined to their neighbourhoods which they cannot leave to buy food.  
</p>
<p>24. In the hinterland, clashes between the anti-Balaka, who are trying to gain ground, 
</p>
<p>and the ex-Seleka, who are resisting, and between those groups and MISCA or the French 
</p>
<p>Sangaris forces, who are trying to disarm them, place the civilian population in an 
</p>
<p>intractable situation. The Independent Expert was informed of several incidents that 
</p>
<p>occurred in April 2014. On 22 April 2014, at Grimari, there were clashes between anti-
</p>
<p>Balaka and ex-Seleka forces; on the same day, in Bouca, attacks attributed to the ex-Seleka 
</p>
<p>led humanitarian workers to take refuge in MISCA camps before being evacuated to 
</p>
<p>Bossangoa; in Batangafo, ex-Seleka reportedly carried out kidnappings; in Paoua, many 
</p>
<p>villages were burned and looted during the first weeks of April; in Kaga Bandoro, fires, 
</p>
<p>rapes of women and child abductions attributed to the Fulani have been reported in the 
</p>
<p>surrounding villages; in Boda and in the Lobaye prefecture, physical assaults and rapes 
</p>
<p>were reported by NGOs, and in Mobaye, Alindao and Kembe in Basse Kotto, atrocities 
</p>
<p>were committed. The climate of insecurity and intercommunal tension tinged with 
</p>
<p>sectarianism all across the country limit freedom of opinion and expression, and above all 
</p>
<p>religious freedom. In some parts of the country, it is almost impossible to practise one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>religious beliefs for fear of acts of violence, ill-treatment or elimination. Women and 
</p>
<p>children are often the victims of these abuses, as well as older persons, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and persons with HIV/AIDS. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p>25. Although there is still a shortage of information regarding the scale of the violent 
</p>
<p>acts committed against women and girls since the beginning of the crisis, various 
</p>
<p>international and local organizations have identified rape and other forms of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence as the most prevalent of these acts, which are committed by both ex-Seleka and 
</p>
<p>anti-Balaka. The organizations stress that women and girls are particularly vulnerable, and 
</p>
<p>have suffered rape, abduction, sexual slavery and other forms of gender-based violence. In 
</p>
<p>December 2013, medical sources at the Castor hospital in Bangui informed the mission 
</p>
<p>deployed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that 
</p>
<p>they had treated more than nine victims of rape committed by armed groups since 5 
</p>
<p>December 2013; they added that the actual number of victims was higher. The mission has 
</p>
<p>also received other reports from medical sources and from NGOs indicating that, since 
</p>
<p>December 2013, a clinic in Bossangoa has treated five or six women victims of rape each 
</p>
<p>month. The reports indicate that the actual number of cases is far higher. For safety reasons, 
</p>
<p>many victims have moved and have been unable to access medical care, psychological 
</p>
<p>support and other vital services. Others are reluctant to come forward for fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>The situation is particularly serious in the interior of the country where victims have almost 
</p>
<p>no access to health care and basic assistance. Many cases are not reported and the true 
</p>
<p>extent of sexual violence in the Central African Republic is not clear. The scale of this 
</p>
<p>serious crime committed against women and girls must be assessed as a matter of urgency 
</p>
<p>and appropriate measures taken to help the victims and punish the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>26. During her first visit, the Independent Expert found that the education system has 
</p>
<p>not been spared. As they advanced towards Bangui, the ex-Seleka occupied and looted all 
</p>
<p>schools along the way. This is a violation of the right to education, given that the majority 
</p>
<p>of schools were forced to close for several months as a result. During her second visit, she 
</p>
<p>noted that some schools had reopened, at least in Bangui and Bangassou, although the 
</p>
<p>majority of State schools in Bangui and other parts of the country remained closed.  
</p>
<p>27. There is a real concern that the economic situation, which continues to deteriorate 
</p>
<p>owing to the lack of security, will stifle the limited progress noted in the education system. 
</p>
<p>The continued disturbances and tensions and the hazards associated with the rainy season 
</p>
<p>could reduce freedom of movement even further and prevent the effective resumption of 
</p>
<p>commercial, agricultural and pastoral activities, which are a source of income for the 
</p>
<p>majority of Central Africans. The resulting loss of revenue will greatly limit access to food, 
</p>
<p>basic social services and adequate living conditions; much of the population will therefore 
</p>
<p>descend into poverty and will be dependent on emergency relief and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance. 
</p>
<p>28. The Minister of Health informed the Independent Expert during her first visit that 80 
</p>
<p>per cent of health facilities had been destroyed and that only the humanitarian organizations 
</p>
<p>could handle emergencies. In the interior, health centres are looted either by the belligerents 
</p>
<p>or by the local populations. They have neither the health professionals nor the medicines 
</p>
<p>required to provide primary health care. Women give birth in appalling conditions and 
</p>
<p>many die in childbirth. The rate of HIV/AIDS in the country is high. It is said to be higher 
</p>
<p>among girls because of reported rapes. The destruction of health centres and the theft of 
</p>
<p>medical equipment and medicines has eroded and decimated the health system across much 
</p>
<p>of the country. The few health facilities still functioning lack resources and may no longer 
</p>
<p>be able to meet demand.  </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Breaches of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>29. The cycle of violence into which the country has been plunged gives rise to serious 
</p>
<p>breaches of international humanitarian law. The Independent Expert was informed during 
</p>
<p>her first visit of attacks committed by unidentified armed groups in Bangui, and especially 
</p>
<p>in the interior of the country, targeting civilians and the goods essential to their survival, as 
</p>
<p>well as humanitarian workers or their ambulances. The level of cruelty was such that some 
</p>
<p>patients were reportedly slaughtered in their hospital beds and medicines were looted. Such 
</p>
<p>insecurity forces humanitarian workers to rein back their activities and jeopardizes the lives 
</p>
<p>of internally displaced persons unable to access the necessary assistance. These acts seemed 
</p>
<p>to have abated during the second visit of the Independent Expert. 
</p>
<p>30. In March 2014, the Independent Expert in her oral update stressed that the constant 
</p>
<p>fear of attacks against civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and by anti-Balaka and ex-Seleka 
</p>
<p>in the hinterland, and clashes between these two groups across the country, were a threat to 
</p>
<p>human rights. Several districts of Bangui and other regions of the country have lost their 
</p>
<p>Muslim populations, who have been forced to flee. Muslims living in the PK12 district of 
</p>
<p>Bangui left the city on 28 April 2014. Some Muslims remain in the KM5 district. During 
</p>
<p>her second visit, the Independent Expert met with members of that Muslim community who 
</p>
<p>revealed the difficulties they faced in convincing Muslims to stay in the district owing to 
</p>
<p>the restrictions imposed on their freedom of movement. She also noted that the mosque 
</p>
<p>housed many Muslims seeking refuge from other districts in Bangui. Despite the presence 
</p>
<p>of international forces in the area, Muslims could not leave their neighbourhood for fear of 
</p>
<p>being attacked by the anti-Balaka who watched closely for the slightest sign of movement 
</p>
<p>in order to attack them. The Independent Expert had been told of a similar situation during 
</p>
<p>her visit to the PK12 district at a time when Muslims were still living there. Two incidents 
</p>
<p>confirm that these fears are justified. On 28 April 2014, an attack on a convoy heading 
</p>
<p>north left two persons dead, and three Muslims were killed in the KM5 district by anti-
</p>
<p>Balaka on 29 April 2014. 
</p>
<p>31. Currently, thousands of persons, mostly Muslims, rely solely on the protection of the 
</p>
<p>international MISCA, Sangaris and EUFOR CAR forces. The Independent Expert stressed 
</p>
<p>that some communities were virtually inaccessible in Bangui and other parts of the country, 
</p>
<p>and that humanitarian assistance only reached them with great difficulty. The Muslims in 
</p>
<p>Boda had been in this situation during her initial visit. The attack against the M&#233;decins sans 
</p>
<p>fronti&#232;re health centre in Nanga Boguila on 26 April 2014, which left 22 dead, and the 
</p>
<p>attack on a humanitarian convoy in Dikissou on 28 April 2014, which left 2 dead, were of a 
</p>
<p>nature as to be in violation of common article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions of 12 
</p>
<p>August 1949. On her second visit, the Independent Expert was informed that the Muslims 
</p>
<p>in Boda had finally received humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Fragility of the State and technical assistance and capacity-
building requirements 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert was informed during the course of her two visits that the 
</p>
<p>root causes of the crisis lay in the failure by successive governments to uphold civil and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic rights and in the marginalization of some of the northern regions of the 
</p>
<p>country, and of the Muslim religious minority in particular. 
</p>
<p>33. The Independent Expert was told that even the non-Muslim majority, which 
</p>
<p>seemingly benefited from administrative and social services, had also often been 
</p>
<p>marginalized because of nepotism and injustices committed under some of the successive 
</p>
<p>regimes. Hence, the root causes of the conflict are to be found in the inequalities maintained 
</p>
<p>by successive governments through their often discriminatory public policies. These social </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p>factors have eroded trust between Central Africans and have led to a gradual shredding of 
</p>
<p>the country&#8217;s social fabric. According to the persons with whom the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>spoke, this crisis is political rather than social or religious in nature. It broke out in a 
</p>
<p>context of State failure and absence of the rule of law as a result of persistent poor 
</p>
<p>governance. This weakness of State authority and institutions is a deeper and more 
</p>
<p>insidious structural cause of the crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Weakness of State authority and of the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>34. The foundations for the gradual re-establishment of the rule of law were laid with 
</p>
<p>the assistance of the international community, in particular the countries of Central Africa 
</p>
<p>and the adoption by the National Transitional Council of a Transitional Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Charter on 5 July 2013, which was promulgated by the Head of State on 18 July 2013. The 
</p>
<p>Charter takes as its frame of reference the Libreville political agreement of 11 January 2013 
</p>
<p>and the decisions of the third and fourth summits of Heads of State and Government of the 
</p>
<p>Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) of 3 and 18 April 2013. The 
</p>
<p>transitional authorities, which operate on the basis of this Charter, have begun to take steps 
</p>
<p>to restore State authority in all 16 prefectures of the Central African Republic, but most of 
</p>
<p>the regional prefects are still in Bangui owing to the insecurity in their respective 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions. Administrative infrastructure, including official residences, has been 
</p>
<p>destroyed. Some deputy prefects but very few prefects are in place. For the time being, the 
</p>
<p>administration operates with only very limited resources and mainly in Bangui, Bambari, 
</p>
<p>Berb&#233;rati and Bouar. In Bangassou, the Independent Expert met with the acting prefect who 
</p>
<p>received her under a tree for lack of a suitable office or accommodation. He acts as the 
</p>
<p>deputy prefect for several districts, exercising administrative and police functions with the 
</p>
<p>support of MISCA. The region also benefits from the concerted efforts of citizens and 
</p>
<p>religious leaders who work tirelessly, and with limited resources, to maintain cohesion 
</p>
<p>between communities. 
</p>
<p>35. Interviews conducted by the Independent Expert during her two visits revealed that 
</p>
<p>the security of persons and goods throughout the country is a priority for Central Africans, 
</p>
<p>as it is a prerequisite for upholding other rights. The Independent Expert noted that, while 
</p>
<p>restoring State authority throughout the country is one of the concerns expressed, security 
</p>
<p>was seen by her interlocutors as a key requirement for any solution to the crisis. The 
</p>
<p>fighting that erupted in December 2013 has given rise to a sense of total insecurity among 
</p>
<p>the Muslim population, forcing them to congregate in one area, leave the capital for the 
</p>
<p>north, or leave the country altogether. In this regard, the transitional measures provided for 
</p>
<p>in Security Council resolution 2149 (2014) are of paramount importance given the need for 
</p>
<p>a multidimensional international presence to act as a deterrent capable of protecting 
</p>
<p>civilians, promoting restoration of the rule of law and supporting efforts to promote human 
</p>
<p>rights, intercommunity reconciliation, security sector reform and disarmament of armed 
</p>
<p>groups. 
</p>
<p>36. As reaffirmed in that resolution, all perpetrators of international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and human rights violations and abuses must be brought to justice, and some of the acts 
</p>
<p>committed are of a nature as to constitute crimes under the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, to which the Central African Republic is a party. This view is 
</p>
<p>shared by all stakeholders in the Central African crisis and, first and foremost, by the 
</p>
<p>transitional authorities. </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>37. Impartiality and independence are two of the defining characteristics of an effective 
</p>
<p>justice system which forms part of an efficient public service. According to most of the 
</p>
<p>persons interviewed, these two elements have often been lacking in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic. The judicial and prison system requires strengthening and the criminal justice 
</p>
<p>system must be re-established across the country in the interests of the sound administration 
</p>
<p>of justice. Regarding the fight against impunity, the transitional authorities have taken steps 
</p>
<p>to restore the criminal justice system by establishing units to investigate human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. The placement under judicial supervision of the self-proclaimed anti-Balaka 
</p>
<p>coordinator on 17 April 2014 is an example of the efforts made by the transitional 
</p>
<p>authorities in this regard. Efforts are also being made to reopen prisons and detention 
</p>
<p>centres and to train the police, the gendarmerie and justice officials. The country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>judiciary, police force and prison system lack the necessary human, financial and material 
</p>
<p>resources for the proper functioning of justice. Clear examples of the challenges facing the 
</p>
<p>transitional authorities include securing detention centres and ensuring the safety of judges 
</p>
<p>and of courthouses during trials. On 3 March 2014, anti-Balaka elements stopped a public 
</p>
<p>hearing against three of their members, and on 4 March 2014 the gendarmerie intervened to 
</p>
<p>prevent the kidnapping of a registrar by the anti-Balaka. On 6 March 2014, during her visit 
</p>
<p>to the central prison in Bangui, the Independent Expert almost witnessed the escape of nine 
</p>
<p>anti-Balaka detainees. She later learned that all of the 11 detainees in the central prison in 
</p>
<p>Bangui, who were former members of the Central African Armed Forces associated with 
</p>
<p>the anti-Balaka, had escaped. There is also the issue of protecting witnesses and victims, 
</p>
<p>which is an essential part of any effective policy to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>38. Moreover, most of the judicial infrastructure has been destroyed, and the number of 
</p>
<p>judicial officers, judges and registrars in both Bangui and the rest of the country is 
</p>
<p>insufficient. At the time of the Independent Expert&#8217;s second visit, there were 211 judges in 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic, 20 of whom had been reduced to non-active status. She 
</p>
<p>subsequently learned that, in addition to the courts in Bangui, those courts in Berb&#233;rati and 
</p>
<p>Bambari were operational. MISCA and the Sangaris force also increased their assistance to 
</p>
<p>the police for the arrest of criminal suspects, particularly military personnel. According to 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice officials, this international assistance is required, because it helps to 
</p>
<p>overcome the bias currently shown by most of the Central African security forces. 
</p>
<p>BINUCA has trained more than 40 prison governors, but they lack practical experience in 
</p>
<p>establishing prison management systems. The international community also supports the 
</p>
<p>training of police officers and registrars, but the needs are such that the efficacy of such 
</p>
<p>action is limited. 
</p>
<p>39. The provision of pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensation for victims, including 
</p>
<p>collective reparations as an aspect of social justice, has never been addressed in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic. The transitional authorities with whom the Independent Expert spoke 
</p>
<p>advocated the use of transitional justice as a means of stepping up the fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity and better providing for individual and collective reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Independent Expert was informed that, at the request of the transitional 
</p>
<p>Government, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights provided assistance 
</p>
<p>for the establishment of a national human rights commission in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p>human rights (the Paris Principles).4 When the conflict broke out in December 2012, the 
</p>
<p>law establishing the commission was awaiting parliamentary approval. This structure will 
</p>
<p>serve as a focal point between the Human Rights and Justice Section of MINUSCA and the 
</p>
<p>Government as part of efforts to strengthen human rights capacity and dialogue. An 
</p>
<p>effective national human rights commission could contribute to capacity-building and the 
</p>
<p>development of mechanisms to promote and protect human rights in the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Observations and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> The Independent Expert observed that human rights violations are continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the Central African Republic, although the number of reported killings has fallen. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The threat posed by anti-Balaka and former Seleka elements continues to weigh on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the capital and the rest of the country. The Independent Expert again condemns these 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and reiterates that the instigators and perpetrators of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts cannot remain unpunished. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>As the Independent Expert emphasized in her oral update in March 2014, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority of the State outside the capital, Bangui, remains weak. The country lacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate security institutions, and justice cannot be implemented without a legitimate 
</b></p>
<p><b>force to maintain law and order. Some interlocutors described the Central African 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic as a failed, bankrupt State or a State in name only. Be that as it may, what 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Independent Expert observed during her two visits was a country that has faced 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetual armed conflict since independence and has never received adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention from the international community. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>Combating impunity remains the priority for the transitional authorities as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as for most of the interlocutors. The training needs of judicial personnel have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been mentioned. There is also the issue of the safety of judges and other judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>personnel. The lack of security for judges, trial venues and places of detention, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lack of suitable facilities are serious obstacles to combating impunity effectively. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Independent Expert took note of ongoing initiatives at the Ministry of Justice to 
</b></p>
<p><b>rebuild the criminal justice system and establish investigation units to combat 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity nationwide. She also took due note of the technical assistance which 
</b></p>
<p><b>international partners such as France, the European Union and the specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies of the United Nations have begun providing to the different ministries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, with the exception of the central prison of Bangui, not a single prison is 
</b></p>
<p><b>operating in the interior of the country, because they have been either destroyed or 
</b></p>
<p><b>emptied of their prisoners since the outbreak of the crisis, or again simply because 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are dilapidated. Problems of prison administration and security persist, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the central prison of Bangui. 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Independent Expert again observed that the insecurity and violence for 
</b></p>
<p><b>which the armed groups in the Central African Republic are responsible are 
</b></p>
<p><b>hindering the new authorities</b>&#8217;<b> efforts to combat impunity. Indeed, in the absence of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme to disarm and demobilize all those groups, and as long as judges live in 
</b></p>
<p><b>fear and the security of victims and witnesses is not assured, it will be difficult to 
</b></p>
<p><b>administer justice. In addition, despite the efforts made by the international forces, 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4  General Assembly resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993, Annex. </p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>the feeling of insecurity experienced by the population, especially the Muslim 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, is such that it is of the utmost urgency to strengthen security, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disarmament and demobilization measures, as well as to initiate a dialogue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation activities at the local and national levels. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>The placement under judicial supervision of members of the anti-Balaka or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prominent figures with close ties to them attests to the transitional Government</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>determination to send a strong signal to those who wish to continue destabilizing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country. This shows that the perpetrators of the violations who are arrested are, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the most part, young people, not the real instigators of the violence, who may still be 
</b></p>
<p><b>at large. Arresting those persons and bringing them to trial would demonstrate a 
</b></p>
<p><b>genuine resolve to combat impunity and shed light on the crimes committed with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>view to determining responsibility for them. In that context, the work of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Commission of Inquiry, currently in the Central African Republic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>would be of great value. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>Re-establishing government authority over the entire country would make it 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible to restore the confidence of the population groups who feel abandoned. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>important that the existing resources, even if they are inadequate, be used to deploy 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrators and other public servants. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>The Independent Expert has been repeatedly told of the transitional 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities</b>&#8217;<b> determination to protect human rights and prevent violations of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, and their awareness of the weakness of the State and its administration. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>presents an opportunity for dialogue and technical assistance, provided that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community fulfils its pledge to provide the country with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian and military personnel in accordance with Security Council resolution 2149 
</b></p>
<p><b>(2014). The realization of the need for transitional justice also affords an opportunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>for technical cooperation. The limits of the State</b>&#8217;<b>s capacity are recognized by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities themselves, and by all stakeholders; thus, if security and the authority of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the State are to be restored, bolder and more rigorous interim measures will be 
</b></p>
<p><b>required. The idea of the need for a Marshall Plan for the Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>was again raised during the Independent Expert</b>&#8217;<b>s second visit. Economic recovery, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the fight against impunity, the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>success of political processes, including elections and national reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives, are dependent on such interim measures and on the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant Security Council resolutions. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The nature of the crisis and the lack of resources have an impact on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of local human rights defenders and on the authority of the State, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>begins and ends in Bangui, the capital, where its presence is also limited. It is obvious 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the country</b>&#8217;<b>s current human rights structures are inadequate to meet the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enormous needs in the areas of deterrence, monitoring and capacity-building. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Strengthening their presence and their deployment nationwide is therefore crucial. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that MINUSCA has been given a human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights framework with sufficient human and financial resources to enable it to lend 
</b></p>
<p><b>support to the national effort and contribute effectively to the protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of human rights in the Central African Republic. 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>On the basis of the information collected, the Independent Expect is able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>conclude once again that the root causes of the current crisis have more to do with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>structural problems that have beset the country for decades. Regional disparities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against certain population groups have bred discontent, causing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict to spread throughout the Central African Republic and creating the risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional contagion because of the country</b>&#8217;<b>s geostrategic situation. The problem has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been compounded by recurrent failings of governance and the inability of one </b></p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p><b>Government after another to promote national cohesion and respect for the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest through a neutral, impartial and transparent administrative system accessible 
</b></p>
<p><b>to all. The Independent Expert noted that the crisis is multifaceted and that its causes 
</b></p>
<p><b>are primarily political and socioeconomic. However, it also has intercommunal and, 
</b></p>
<p><b>indeed, sectarian aspects that criminal or terror groups could be tempted to exploit in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to plunge the country and even the subregion into chaos. In addition, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>presence of ex-Seleka elements outside Bangui, their apparent mobilization in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>north of the country, the threats by some of them to create a North Central African 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic and the statements of some Islamist groups about the fate of the country</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>Muslims constitute a serious risk of conflict that could lead to the partition of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country and undermine its territorial integrity. The clashes between the anti-Balaka 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ex-Seleka forces are confirmation that measures to disarm and demobilize those 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups also remain a priority. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The resettlement of Muslims away from their places of residence or even 
</b></p>
<p><b>outside the Central African Republic became an acute issue, in particular during the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert</b>&#8217;<b>s second visit. The question arose as to whether the Muslim 
</b></p>
<p><b>populations should be allowed to leave their towns or the country on account of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>threats to their safety and their physical integrity or whether they should be kept 
</b></p>
<p><b>where they were, since, despite the protection of international forces, they could not 
</b></p>
<p><b>leave without running the risk of being killed by the anti-Balaka. After much 
</b></p>
<p><b>hesitation, the humanitarian actors chose the former option, accompanying convoys of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Muslims to neighbouring countries or to other parts of the Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>where they would feel safer. This humanitarian solution involves security risks, as was 
</b></p>
<p><b>shown by the attack on a convoy on 28 April 2014. Muslims are also exposed to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>risk of not being well received in their places of destination and of being unable to 
</b></p>
<p><b>recover their property should they decide to return, not to mention the risk of de facto 
</b></p>
<p><b>partition of the country. It is clearly impossible to prevent individuals from exercising 
</b></p>
<p><b>their right to freedom of movement and to choose their place of residence, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>when they do not feel safe, but in view of the risks it would be wise to take into 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration the opinions of the persons concerned, to act on a case-by-case basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, above all, to take all necessary measures to protect them if they decide to stay or 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure the safety of humanitarian convoys. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Although noteworthy progress has been made in ensuring the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, with the reopening of schools in some locations, the economic situation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which continues to worsen, is likely to hinder that progress and significantly interfere 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the enjoyment of other economic and social rights, especially during the rainy 
</b></p>
<p><b>season. The prevailing insecurity makes it difficult for farmers to engage in 
</b></p>
<p><b>agricultural or pastoral activities. If nothing is done to put an end to this situation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>create the conditions for a strong agricultural recovery, the country could find itself 
</b></p>
<p><b>facing a food crisis in the medium term. In this context, the enjoyment of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>work and to satisfactory living conditions remains limited. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>At the national level, implementation of the reconciliation strategy and action 
</b></p>
<p><b>plan, presented by the Minister of Communication and National Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the Independent Expert</b>&#8217;<b>s first visit, began with an attempt to include all 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. Local reconciliation initiatives have been launched in the interior, as in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bangassou, and there are pockets of social cohesion, albeit with very few resources, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bangui, Boda, Mbaiki, Berb&#233;rati and Bozoum. Such strategies are important for 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysing the root causes of the crisis and devising appropriate solutions. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives, which deserve to be supported, strengthened and replicated, demand a 
</b></p>
<p><b>response from the transitional authorities and all the political leaders, who should 
</b></p>
<p><b>take advantage of the opportunity to undertake awareness-raising missions and </b></p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase contact with local populations. They also demand a response from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community, which could help back these initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>In her oral update, the Independent Expert encouraged all the country</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and progressive forces to become involved in the dialogue and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation at the national and local levels. She regards the initiative taken in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bangassou as a good practice that could inspire similar initiatives, since it shows that 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue and reconciliation must be inclusive and involve all communities, if they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>to enhance their credibility, their effectiveness and their potential for restoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>intercommunal trust. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Independent Expert wishes to remind all those who use young people and 
</b></p>
<p><b>incite them to commit human rights violations that the international community will 
</b></p>
<p><b>not tolerate such acts and that no violation of human rights will go unpunished. There 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be no justification for incitement to violence. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that the regional dimension of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>crisis, which she referred to in her oral update, was taken into account in paragraph 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 of Security Council resolution 2149 (2014). She also welcomes the fact that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution envisaged the creation of an international mechanism that would include 
</b></p>
<p><b>key stakeholders. As she emphasized in her oral update in March, it will be important 
</b></p>
<p><b>to hold a stakeholders</b>&#8217;<b> conference once the situation is stabilized, in order to devise a 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy for sustainable development and, above all, to implement a suitable road 
</b></p>
<p><b>map. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>As the Independent Expert emphasized in her oral update, it is important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>make concerted efforts as quickly as possible to save the Central African Republic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which, after years of what it has perceived as neglect, is currently on the brink of 
</b></p>
<p><b>chaos. The despair visible in the eyes of a civilian population traumatized by violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>is particularly eloquent and demands a response from the entire international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community. In that respect, the Independent Expert welcomes the creation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>MINUSCA but wishes to emphasize the urgent need for transitional measures before 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Mission is effectively established on 15 September 2014. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The people of the Central African Republic, particularly the young, the elderly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities, women and children, are the main victims of the acts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence committed by armed groups, armed militias, bandits and other criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups. There is an urgent need to focus efforts on security, on justice in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat impunity, and on intercommunal reconciliation and management of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>machinery of government. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>To this end, the Independent Expert recommends as follows: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) <i>To the people of the Central African Republic</i>: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The Independent Expert urges all prominent Central Africans in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country or abroad, including political figures, to take a public stand against 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and impunity and in favour of national reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) She invites all Central Africans to expand their horizons, to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>healing and to work for the restoration of a culture of togetherness. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) <i>To the transitional authorities</i>: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The Independent Expert urges the Government to continue making 
</b></p>
<p><b>every effort to restore peace and security for all in all areas of the Central </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.14-03816 
</p>
<p><b>African Republic, as the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural rights depends on peace and security. To that end, she endorses the 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive national programme for truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) She also encourages all national authorities to undertake frequent visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the regions in order to raise awareness, set the tone for reconciliation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>back local intercommunity reconciliation initiatives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) She calls upon the Government to do its utmost to develop a national and 
</b></p>
<p><b>community level reconciliation strategy, while taking account of human rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the regional dimension of the crisis and the role that the countries of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>subregion could play in the search for a lasting solution to the Central African 
</b></p>
<p><b>crisis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) She encourages it to undertake the mapping of local initiatives in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>area of conflict mediation, prevention and resolution, as well as reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to promote them as model initiatives for the entire country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) She also encourages it to continue making efforts to pay the salaries of 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil servants in order to ease tensions and facilitate access to economic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>social rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) She urges it to develop a programme of psychotherapeutic support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance to victims, including victims of sexual violence and young people 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved in the armed conflict, and to set up multipurpose centres, especially in 
</b></p>
<p><b>rural areas, for the development of programmes of awareness-raising and 
</b></p>
<p><b>education for a culture of peace and human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) She encourages it to take all necessary steps to set up a national human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights commission, in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(viii) She welcomes the creation of the Special Investigation Unit and 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages the Government to make every effort to make it effective and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop a national strategy to combat impunity, including the setting up of 
</b></p>
<p><b>community radio stations, getting them on-air and ensuring their national 
</b></p>
<p><b>ownership; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) She encourages the Government to continue rebuilding the judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure and to proceed with the swift redeployment of judges to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>duty stations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) She also encourages it to continue cooperating with the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces in order to protect civilians, to provide non-discriminatory assistance to 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims, to disarm all armed groups and militias which possess arms illegally 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to undertake a rapid reform of the security sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xi) She calls on it to take all necessary steps for the effective deployment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>local administrators (prefects and subprefects), in order to help re-establish the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority of the State over the entire country, and to continue its efforts to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reopen schools and restore normal working conditions in hospitals and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>health centres; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xii) She urges it to develop a strategy for the return of displaced persons and 
</b></p>
<p><b>refugees to their respective neighbourhoods, villages and towns; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(xiii) She recommends that the Government should initiate, with all the 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties to the crisis, a consensual process of disarmament, demobilization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>reintegration and security-sector reform and ensure its implementation. </b></p>


<p>GE.14-03816 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>59. The Independent Expert recommends that the ex-Seleka and anti-Balaka 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements and other armed groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Immediately cease acts of violence and violations of human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law in their spheres of influence, put an end to the

<p><b> (b) Renounce violence by adhering to disarmament programmes and the

<p><b>Republic in order to avoid liability to prosecution and penalties. 
</b></p>
<p><b>60. The Independent Expert recommends that the international community:

<p><b> (b) In the framework of urgent transitional measures and before the

</b></p>
<p><b>support the Government in the implementation of human rights treaty body
