birth or other status,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms, inter 
alia, the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal 
respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all in accordance with the Charter, other instruments relating to human rights, and 
international law, and that the universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond 
question,

<p><i> Reiterating</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that all human rights must be treated in a fair 
and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that, while the 
significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and 
religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, all States, regardless of their political, 
economic and cultural systems, have the duty to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of

</p>

<p><i> Reaffirming </i> that all cultures and civilizations in their traditions, customs, religions 
and beliefs share a common set of values that belong to humankind in its entirety, and that 
those values have made an important contribution to the development of human rights 
norms and standards,  
</p>

universal human rights norms and standards,

</p>

</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Recognizes</i> that the better understanding and appreciation of these values 
contribute to promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes</i> the important role of family, community, society and educational 
institutions in upholding and transmitting these values, which contributes to promoting 
respect for human rights and increasing their acceptance at the grass roots, and calls upon 
all States to strengthen this role through appropriate positive measures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare a study
