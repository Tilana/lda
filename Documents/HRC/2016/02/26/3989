<p><b>  17/&#8230; The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health is a human right as reflected in, inter alia, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as, with respect 
to non-discrimination, in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that 
such a right derives from the inherent dignity of the human person, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 15/22 of 30 September 2010 and all 
resolutions and decisions on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and 
the Commission on Human Rights, and Council resolution 12/24 of 2 October 2009 on 
access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia, 
establishes that States should take, at the national level, all measures necessary for the 
realization of the right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity 
for all in their access to basic resources, such as health services, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recalling further</i> the ministerial declaration on implementing the internationally 
agreed goals and commitments with regard to global public health, of the 2009 high-level 
segment of the Economic and Social Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full realization of 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, including through access to medicines that are safe, effective, affordable and 
of good quality, in particular essential medicines, vaccines and other medical products, and 
to health-care facilities and services, still remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, 
especially for those living in poverty, this goal remains remote, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States 
to ensure access for all, without discrimination, to medicines, in particular essential 
medicines, that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and 
civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create 
favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and 
effective enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical 
and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the Agreement does 
not and should not prevent members of the World Trade Organization from taking 
measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, while reiterating the 
commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of members of the World Trade 
Organization to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for 
all; and further recognizes, in this connection, the right of members of the World Trade 
Organization to use, to the full, the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which 
provide flexibility for this purpose, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of 
poverty, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned also</i> that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases 
constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, and 
aware that there is a need to respond to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and 
chronic respiratory diseases, which represent a leading threat to human health and 
development, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the annual report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;1 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recalls</i> that development and all human rights are interdependent and 
mutually reinforcing and, in that regard, recognizes the progressive realization of the right 
of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health as one of the central aspects of development, as reflected in health-related 
internationally agreed development goals, in particular the Millennium Development Goals, 
taking into account the social determinants of health particular to each society; 
</p>

<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to continue to assist developing 
countries in promoting the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including through financial and 
technical support and training of personnel, while recognizing that the primary 
responsibility for promoting and protecting all human rights rests with States; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To integrate the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable

Development Goals, recognizing, in that regard, the critical role of strengthening health 
systems; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To ensure that information on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the

mandates, to pay particular attention to the impact of development programmes on the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including 
through the collection and sharing of good practices and the strengthening of national 
capacities; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the expert consultation on 
access to medicines as a fundamental component of the right of everyone to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, held on 11 October 2010;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/17/43. </footnote> 
</p>

<p> (<i>g</i>) To address the potential negative impacts of intellectual property rights on 
the availability and affordability of medicines, including by taking full advantage of the 
flexibilities provided for in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights, and to assess the human rights impact prior to the adoption of additional 
commitments, recognizing that intellectual property protection is important for the 
development of new medicines, as well as the concerns about its effects on prices; 
</p>

<p> (<i>h</i>) To promote the transfer of technology and investment in research and 
development to developing countries, as appropriate;  
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To apply measures and procedures for enforcing intellectual property rights

effective and good-quality medicines, and to provide for safeguards against the abuse of 
such measures and procedures; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes </i>the innovative funding mechanisms that contribute to the 
availability of vaccines and medicines in developing countries, such as the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the GAVI Alliance and the International Drug 
Purchase Facility, UNITAID, and calls upon all States, United Nations agencies and 
programmes and relevant intergovernmental organizations, within their respective 
mandates, and encourages relevant stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, to

of, and equitable and affordable access to safe, effective and good-quality medicines for 
non-communicable diseases, and to address the challenges arising from the high costs and 
the long duration of treatment; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to prepare, in consultation 
with States Members of the United Nations, United Nations agencies and programmes,
