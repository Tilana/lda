David Cather, Chief Executive Officer, commented:
"The first six months of the year have been positive for Avocet and the gold mining sector as a
whole. After a sustained period of weakness, gold prices improved by 25% during H1 2016,
leading to improved margins for producers, and renewed investor interest. At Inata, we managed
to sustain production levels and reduce costs, generating sufficient cashflow to meet the mine's
financing obligations. Meanwhile, discussions with potential finance partners for the Tri-K project
have moved towards resolution, and I hope to be able to provide a full update in due course".

NOTES TO EDITORS
Avocet Mining PLC ("Avocet" or the "Company") is an unhedged gold mining and exploration
company listed on the London Stock Exchange (ticker: AVM.L) and the Oslo Børs (ticker:
AVM.OL). The Company's principal activities are gold mining and exploration in West Africa.
In Burkina Faso the Company owns 90% of the Inata Gold Mine. The Inata Gold Mine poured its
first gold in December 2009 and produced 74,755 ounces of gold in 2015. Other assets in
Burkina Faso include five exploration permits surrounding the Inata Gold Mine in the broader
Bélahouro region. The most advanced of these projects is Souma, some 20 kilometres from the
Inata Gold Mine.
In Guinea, Avocet owns 100% of the Tri-K Project in the north east of the country. Drilling to date
has outlined a Mineral Resource of 3.0 million ounces, and in October 2013 the Company
announced a maiden Ore Reserve on the oxide portion of the orebody, which is suitable for heap
leaching, of 0.5 million ounces. As an alternative, the potential exists to exploit the entire 3.0
million ounce Tri-K orebody via the CIL processing method. An exploitation permit was awarded
for Tri-K on 27 March 2015.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW
The last few years have been extremely tough for the mining sector as a whole, with junior gold
miners such as Avocet particularly affected by market conditions. By the end of 2015, the gold
price had fallen from a peak of approximately US$1,900 per ounce in September 2011 to just
US$1,062 per ounce. This fall put a great deal of pressure on Inata, the Company's operating
mine in Burkina Faso (whose 2015 cash costs had been US$1,052 per ounce), and reduced the
NPV of the Company's Tri-K project in Guinea and its Souma project in Burkina Faso at a time
when investment was sought for both.
These pressures were felt across the industry as a whole, with producers often responding by
high-grading operations, while investors restricted their focus onto larger-scale projects with
more certain returns. For Avocet, this meant that refinancing was particularly difficult, and
expensive.
A business review was announced in December 2013, which aimed to attract investment in, or
realise value from, the Group's assets. However, the mining sector in 2014 and 2015 proved
extremely uncompromising, and despite initial discussions with a number of parties, little
substantive progress was achieved.
Since the start of 2016, the market has begun to show tentative signs of life, not least in response
to an increase in the gold price, which by 30 June 2016 had risen some 25%. A number of
financing and business combination transactions have also been announced in the West African
gold mining space in recent months.
Burkina Faso - Inata Gold Mine and Souma Resource
At Inata, a number of measures had already been undertaken to reduce the cost base in
response to lower gold prices, and an increase in spot rates provided a welcome benefit to gross
margins. The mine continues to face numerous challenges, ranging from operational risks such
as equipment availability and variability of recovery levels, to supply chain concerns such as the
ongoing exposure to key creditors withholding critical supplies, as well as the fact that the mine
has trade creditors of US$31.4 million and financial liabilities of US$31.5 million.
However, during the first six months of the year, the mine produced 41,614 ounces at a cash cost
of US$913 per ounce, and generated Net Cashflow from Operations of some US$11.0 million,
with which it was able to reduce the mine's financial indebtedness.
This represents a considerable achievement by the Inata team, and there is cause for cautious
optimism for the future of Inata.
At the end of 2015, the life of mine had been expected to come to an end in 2017, however work
undertaken in the year has extended this to 2019. Satellite deposits also exist which, for a
modest amount of drilling, may provide further mill feed to extend this mine life still further.
However, costs are expected to be higher in the second half of 2016. This is a result of a
combination of factors but particularly waste mining volumes increasing in order to access high
grade ore at depth in North pit. This ore is known to be carbonaceous and will therefore require
processing through the Carbon Blinding Circuit ('CBC') which will in turn require additional
reagents and an increase in power. There will also be an increase in ore haulage costs from the
newly opened Filio pits which are 7-8 kilometres from the process plant. Therefore in spite of H1
cash costs of US$913 per ounce, the overall cash cost forecast for the year of US$950-1050 per
ounce remains unchanged, together with production guidance of 75-85,000.
The Souma deposit, a 0.7 million ounce resource located approximately 20km to the east of
Inata, is likely to be a source of ore which could be trucked to the plant for processing. The
Company is currently in advanced discussions with financiers with a view to securing the US$5-
7 million needed to complete the drilling and test work to support the feasibility study needed for
a mining permit application.
Tri-K project in Guinea
In the 2015 Annual Report released in April, we explained that the Company was in ongoing
talks with regard to financing the Tri-K project in Guinea. Under the Guinean Mining Code, there
are some important deadlines in relation to the mining permit, which was awarded on 27 March
2015: the Government has the right to impose penalties of approximately US$100k per month if
construction has not commenced within 12 months of the date of the award of the permit; and if
construction has not commenced after 18 months (ie by 27 September 2016), the Government
has the right to withdraw the permit.
Despite the approach of this deadline, the Company is in advanced talks with interested parties
and expects to be able to announce a deal before this time. The Government has been kept
abreast of all discussions in this regard, and have indicated their support for the transaction
details under consideration.
The Company is aware that not only will a financing deal on Tri-K provide a road map to
developing the project into an operating mine, but it will also ensure that the Company is able to
retain its interests in Guinea, which are secured in favour of an affiliate of Elliott Management.
The loss of these assets could therefore have a significant and negative effect on the Going
Concern of the Company - see Note 1 to the accounts for further details.
Further details regarding these discussions will be announced in the coming weeks.
Corporate and head office
During the first half of the year, Inata remained unable to provide funding to pay for head office
and corporate costs, largely due to the need to service its own external debt obligations, in
particular a short-term loan with Coris bank entered into in November 2015. As a consequence,
the Company was forced to obtain an additional US$1.5 million of debt funding from an affiliate of
its largest shareholder, Elliott Management, bringing the total balance owed to Elliott to US$25.0
million at 30 June 2016.
As the majority of this funding is secured over the Company's Guinean assets, it is clear that the
successful conclusion of the Tri-K financing negotiations is key to addressing this debt. In the
near term, a portion of any cash consideration from the disposal may be applied to reducing the
debt; longer term, it is anticipated that the Company will realise value from its interest in a larger,
successful gold mine, either through a disposal of its residual interest, or preferably through
access to a portion of the cashflows from a producing asset.
The repayment of the Coris loan by July 2016 meant that, although the final tranche of Elliott
funding of US$200k was drawn down on 25 July 2016, the Company expects to be able to draw
funding from the Inata mine to cover head office and corporate costs until the completion of the
Tri-K transaction, details of which are expected to be announced before the end of September.
2016 has also been a busy year for the Company in terms of corporate actions, with a number of
matters being put to shareholders for approval. Some of these have been driven by compliance,
including the need to approve the adoption of FRS 101 in the 2015 accounts, and the share
consolidation exercise chiefly driven by the need to comply with minimum share price
requirements of the Oslo Børs.
Conclusion
The Company has continued to operate during a difficult period which has now lasted for several
years. Much work remains to be completed, including financing negotiations over the Tri-K
project in Guinea and the Souma deposit in Burkina Faso, while the Inata gold mine remains
exposed to a number of operational and supply chain risks. With a US$25 million loan repayable
on demand due to Elliott Management, the Company remains in an uncertain financial position,
particularly in the event of the Tri-K transaction not reaching a successful conclusion.
There is, however, cause for cautious optimism in all these areas, particularly if the gold price
remains strong. 2016 has so far proved a challenging but successful year, and we hope this
progress will continue for the rest of the year and beyond.

In view of the Inata mine's excellent safety record in the past, it was particularly regrettable that
the first half of 2016 saw a lost time injury to an employee, with another lost time injury occurring
in July 2016. In order to reinvigorate the safety culture, a programme of re-inducting all
employees and contractors on the company's safety protocols and procedures has been
implemented.
Gold production of 41,614 ounces was achieved during the first half of 2016. The overall
recovery of 93% was as a result of the ore treated being exclusively oxide and relatively soft in
nature which afforded high throughput rates in the mill. Head grades were higher than Q1 at
1.32g/t, however ore mined needed to be supplemented by blending marginal grade stockpiled
ore of circa 0.8g/t into the mill.
Cash costs have remained on a downward trend with the average cost of production of US$913
per ounce being achieved. The second half of the year, however, is expected to see higher costs
as a result of significant waste stripping taking place in North pit to access the remaining high
grade but highly variable carbonaceous ores, and the longer haul routes for ore to be transported
from the newly opened but remote Filio pit, which is located some 8 kilometres from the mill.
The guidance for the full year in 2016 remains at 75-85,000 ounces, with cash costs of between
US$950 and US$1,050 per ounce.
FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Total gold sold in H1 2016 amounted to 42,752 ounces, compared with 39,740 in the first half of
2015. This factor, combined with average realised gold prices of US$1,213 per ounce being
slightly higher than H1 2015 (US$1,203 per ounce), translated into an increase in revenue of
US$4.0 million, or 8%, from US$47.8 million in H1 2015 to US$51.8 million in the first half of
2016.
Gross margin increased from a US$6.6 million loss in H1 2015 to a profit of US$7.6 million in H1
2016, partly due to the increase in revenues mentioned above, but also partly due to cost
reduction measures at the Inata mine, as well as the reduction in depreciation charge resulting
from the impairments applied to the mine's assets in 2015.
The impairments of US$30.1 million recognised in H1 2015 were not repeated in H1 2016, as no
triggers for impairment were identified.
EBITDA, an indicator of underlying cash generation which excludes working capital movements,
showed a profit of US$6.9 million compared to a loss in H1 2015 of US$2.9 million.  However,
net cash generated by operating activities, after interest and tax, was US$9.4 million, compared
to US$6.7m in H1 2015, with the variance reflecting working capital movements during the
respective periods.
With the focus on cash conservation, capex was kept low in the period at just US$0.1 million (H1
2015: US$2.7 million). No exploration costs were capitalised during the period.
Two new Elliott loans of US$0.75 million and US$0.6 million were drawn down between January
and June.
Capital repayments under the Ecobank loan facility totalled US$5.0 million.  Capital repayments
under the Coris Bank loan facility totalled US$7.1 million, while the Ecobank VAT facility
payments (net of further advances) totalled US$1.7 million.
On 9 June 2016 the shareholders approved a 10:1 consolidation of the Company's shares, in
order to comply with minimum share price requirements of the Oslo Børs.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which are unaudited, have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard 34 as
adopted for use in the European Union.  This condensed interim report does not include all the
notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report.  Accordingly, this condensed
report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015,
which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and any
public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.
The financial information set out in this interim report does not constitute statutory accounts as
defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006.  The unaudited condensed financial
statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been drawn up using accounting
policies and presentation expected to be adopted in the Group's full financial statements for the
year ending 31 December 2015.  The accounting policies are not different to those set out in note
1 to the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, with the
exception of certain amendments to accounting standards or new interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board, which were applicable from 1 January 2016.  These
have not had a material impact on the Group.
The Company's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are
available on the Company's website www.avocetmining.com. The auditor's report on those
financial statements was qualified with respect to physical stock contained in ore stockpile, in
circuit and in finished goods of $11.5m included within inventory of$17.3m as disclosed in note
18 of the Company's statutory financial statements.  The company also received an emphasis of
matter relating to going concern and the carrying value of the Tri-k asset, refer to notes 1 and15 of
the Company's statutory financial statements.
Going Concern
Elliott Loans
The Company has debts totaling US$25.0 million which it owes to Manchester Securities Corp,
an affiliate of Elliott Management at 30 June 2016 (see note 12).
Since 2014, the cashflow shortages resulting from gold prices and lower production at the Inata
mine meant that the Company has relied primarily on loan financing from Elliott in order to meet
its running costs of its head office and Guinea administrative functions. During 2016, the
Company drew down new loans totaling US$1.55 million (of which US$1.35 million was during
the first 6 months) for such purposes.
These loans represent short-term facilities with high interest rates (between 11% and 14%). All of
these loans are repayable on demand, and if repayment was requested by Elliott, the Company
would be unlikely to be able to raise the external finance it would need to settle these obligations.
However the Company believes that the most likely means that these loans will be repaid is
through a financing deal in respect of the Tri-K project, over which the majority of the loans are
secured. The terms of such a deal remain subject to contract (see below), however are expected
to result in a combination of a cash payment together with an earn-in, in return for Avocet ceding
a majority interest in the project to a third party.
This would allow a portion of the loan to be repaid immediately, with the balance potentially able
to be repaid either out of the cash generated by an asset in production at the Tri-K site, or a
subsequent sale of the residual interest in the project.
Provided Elliott believe that the prospects of repayment under the existing structure are
reasonable, Avocet's management believe that they will not exercise their right to demand the
repayment of the loans, as this might have a damaging effect on the Company's assets, and
prospects, in both Guinea and Burkina Faso.
However there can be no certainty that Elliott will remain supportive, particularly if the
discussions around Tri-K become protracted or less likely to lead to a satisfactory outcome. In the
event that their support was withdrawn, the Company would need to agree funding from an
alternative source at short notice, which is likely to be extremely challenging, if indeed possible
at all.  If Elliot exercises its rights to demand repayment and the loans cannot be refinanced, the
Group would cease to be a going concern and would likely enter an insolvency process.
Ability to secure financing for Tri-K
Since 2013, the Company has been actively pursuing funding for its Tri-K project in Guinea. A
Feasibility Study for this project was submitted in September 2013, which outlined a heap leach
operation with a capex of approximately US$88 million. Since then, work has been undertaken to
revise the design of the project with the result that the capex estimation has now reduced to
approximately US$60 million.
A mining permit for the project was awarded on 27 March 2015.
Financing discussions in 2014 and 2015 were made more challenging by the slump in the
mining sector, which resulted in many institutions restricting their focus to larger and more
profitable projects, in jurisdictions with a lower perceived risk. In addition, the ebola crisis in West
Africa meant that many potential investors were unable or unwilling to undertake site visits
necessary for their due diligence procedures.
Nevertheless, interest in the project picked up in the latter part of 2015 and into 2016, buoyed by
an increase in the gold price.
At the present time, the Company is in advanced discussions with a preferred party, with a view
to concluding a partial disposal of the asset in return for a consideration including a cash element
and an earn-in element. Such a deal would leave Avocet with a minority share in an expanded
project that would be ready to commence construction.
However, until a deal has been formally concluded with a preferred financing partner, there can
be no guarantee that the Tri-K project will be funded.
Loss of Tri-K permits
The Tri-K mining permit was awarded on 27 March 2015. Under Article 34 of the Guinea mining
code, if construction of the mine has not commenced within 12 months of the date of the award,
the government has the right to impose penalties, and if construction has still not commenced
after a further 6 months, the government may withdraw the permit.
No such construction activity has commenced in respect of this permit, and there is therefore a
risk that the Company may incur penalties (of approximately US$100k per month of delay) and
even lose the permit after 27 September 2016.
The Company has been in regular contact with the Guinean authorities with regard to this matter,
and in particular has pointed to the delays in attracting the necessary financing resulting from the
global slump in the mining sector, as well as the 2014-2015 ebola crisis (which prevented
potential investors visiting the site).
Senior members of the Guinean government have expressed understanding, and have indicated
that they would remain sympathetic provided Avocet could demonstrate progress with regard to
securing financing for the project (see above).
The government has been actively involved in discussions with Avocet's preferred interested
party, and has given indications that provided a transaction can be agreed before 27 September
2016, it would not exercise its right to withdraw the permits after this date.
The Company believes it will be in a position to agree and announce such a transaction by this
date. However, if a delay were introduced for any reason, the Company would need to
renegotiate with the Government of Guinea. Under such circumstances, there could be no
guarantees that the Government would not exercise its right to withdraw the permit which would
likely have a significant and negative effect on the Group's going concern position.
Gold price
The profitability of both the Tri-K project and the Inata gold mine (including surrounding deposits)
depends on the gold price.
The cash costs at Inata during 2015 and into 2016 have ranged between US$900 and US$1,100
per ounce, and therefore a modest fall in gold prices from current levels would result in margins
becoming extremely tight, which would make the servicing of the mine's debts and creditors
challenging.
The Company has no control over the gold price, and is not in a position to enter into any
hedging arrangements in view of its financial difficulties.
The rise in the gold price since January 2016, however, has given cause to believe that the
decline in spot prices seen between 2012 and 2015 may be at an end.
Nevertheless, it remains clear that a sustained fall in the gold price would put severe pressure on
the operations at Inata, and would also threaten the economic viability of the Tri-K project - as
well as the Avocet Group as a whole.
Support from Inata's creditors
The Inata gold mine at the end of June 2016 had approximately US$31.4 million in trade
creditors, and a further US$31.5 million in bank and other debt facilities. Many of the balances
owing to suppliers are overdue, and the mine has faced a number of demands to bring balances
within credit limits.
There can be no guarantee that one or more creditors might not refuse to allow critical supplies to
be delivered to the mine, or might otherwise initiate legal action that could disrupt operations.
Inata's management have spent a considerable amount of time discussing the mine's
predicament with key suppliers, pointing to the fact that the best means to ensure creditors are
repaid is to allow supplies to continue to be made, and for the mine to produce gold.
The recent uptick in gold prices, together with improved production plans and lower operating
costs, are encouraging developments for Inata's creditors and wider stakeholders, however
production challenges and an increase in costs are anticipated in the second half of 2016 which
may increase creditor pressure.
Souma permit
The future of the Inata gold mine beyond 2018 will rely upon the successful completion of a
Feasibility Study for the Souma deposit, located 20km east of the Inata plant.
The work needed to complete the study, which is expected to cost between US$5-7 million, must
be completed in order for an application for a mining permit to be submitted by July 2018.
The Company is currently in negotiation with its financiers with regards to the funding of this
activity. However, until any financing package is negotiated, there can be no guarantee that this
funding will be made available.
Conclusion
The above areas of risk represent material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the
ability of the Group to continue as a Going Concern and that it may be unable to realise all of its
assets and discharge all of its liabilities in the normal course of business. Nevertheless, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that these risks can be managed, or will not come to
pass, and accordingly the Financial Statements have been prepared on a Going Concern basis
and do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a
Going Concern.
Estimates
Certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements involve the
use of judgement and/or estimation. These are based on management's best knowledge of the
relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience. However, judgements and
estimations regarding the future are a key source of uncertainty and actual results may differ from
the amounts included in the financial statements.
In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by
management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2015, with the exception of those highlighted in the exceptional items and
impairments notes to these financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Avocet Mining PLC is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have a financial,
operational or reputational impact on the Group.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group at the yearend were set out in detail in the
Directors and Governance section of the Annual Report 2015 (pages 14-16), and have not
changed significantly since. Key headline risks relate to the following:
·      Withdrawal of financial support by Elliott Management
·      Ability to complete financing transaction in respect of Tri-K
·      Loss of Tri-K permits
·      Gold prices
·      Adverse action taken by creditors of the Inata mine
·      Loss of Souma permit
·      Operating issues at Inata
·      Civil unrest and terrorism
The Annual Report 2015 is available on the Group's website www.avocetmining.com.
2.   Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires the disclosure of certain information in respect of reportable operating
segments.  One of the criteria for determining reportable operating segments is the level at which
information is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the
purposes of making economic decisions.  In this report, operating segments for continuing
operations are determined as the UK, Burkina Faso operations (which includes the Inata gold
mine as well as exploration activity within the Inata and wider Bélahouro licence areas), and
Guinea (which includes the Tri-K project and its support functions).

The number of shares with voting rights reduced in the period as a result of the 10:1 share
consolidation which came into effect on 10 June 2016. There were no other movements in share
capital in the period.
As the strike price of all share options in issue was below the market share price, in calculating
the diluted earnings per share the effect of share options in issue has been ignored for the 6
months ended 30 June 2016 and for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015.

Impairments at 30 June 2016
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, at each reporting date the Company assesses
whether there are any indicators of impairment of non-current assets. When circumstances or
events indicate that non-current assets may be impaired, these assets are reviewed in detail to
determine whether their carrying value is higher than their recoverable value, and, where this is
the result, an impairment is recognised.  Recoverable value is the higher of value in use (VIU)
and fair value less costs to sell.  VIU is estimated by calculating the present value of the future
cash flows expected to be derived from the asset cash generating unit (CGU). Fair value less
costs to sell is based on the most reliable information available, including market statistics and
recent transactions. The Inata mine has been identified as the CGU. This includes all tangible
non-current assets, intangible exploration assets, and net current assets excluding cash.
No impairments were recognised during the six months to 30 June 2016. In spite of a rally in the
gold price, there remain sufficient uncertainties around production and cashflows to suggest that
a reversal would not be appropriate at the present time. The Company intends to complete a full
Life of Mine production plan before the year end, which will form the basis of the impairment
review at 31 December 2016.
Impairments at 30 June 2015
In June 2015, Avocet recognised a US$30.6 million impairment of non-current mining assets in
respect of the Inata Gold Mine driven by changes to the Life of Mine Plan (LoMP).
When calculating the VIU, certain assumptions and estimates were made. Changes in these
assumptions can have a significant effect on the recoverable amount and therefore the value of
the impairment recognised. Should there be a change in the assumptions which indicated the
impairment, this could lead to a revision of recorded impairment losses in future periods. The key
assumptions used at that time are outlined below:
Assumption Judgements
Timing of
cash flows
Cash flows were forecast over the current life of
the mine, which showed mining activities to
continue until April 2017, with a further four
months during which stockpiles would be
processed and rehabilitation costs would be
incurred.
 Production costs were forecast based on
detailed assumptions, including staff costs,
consumption of fuel and reagents, maintenance,
and administration and support costs.

Sensitivity
 An extension or shortening of the
mine life would have resulted in a
corresponding increase or
decrease in impairment, the extent
of which it was not possible
to quantify.
 A change of 10% in production

attributable by US$15.1 million1.

A discount rate of 20% (pre-tax) was used in the

Avocet's cost of capital, adjusted for specific risk
factors related to Inata including liquidity and
production risks.
 The life of mine plan in place at the time showed
total gold production of 0.21 million ounces.
assumption would have varied the
pre-tax impairment recognised in
the year by US$18.1 million1.
 An increase in the discount rate of
five percentage points would have
decreased the pre-tax impairment
recognised in the year by
US$0.1million1.
 A 10% change in ounces produced
would have varied the pre-tax
impairment recognised in the year
by US$18.1 million1.

The First Loan was entered into in March 2013 in order to finance the feasibility study for the Tri-
K project, as well as corporate activities. Although due to be repaid on 31 December 2013, the
financial circumstances of the Company at that time meant that this repayment could not take
place, and the loan, together with accrued interest, remains outstanding. The loan is secured
over the Tri-K project, and has an interest rate of 11%.
The Second Loan was initially entered into as a US$1.5 million unsecured facility in January
2015. This facility was increased by US$750k in January 2016 and again by US$800k in April
2016 in order to provide working capital for corporate and head office activities during 2016. The
last tranche of this facility was drawn down on 25 July 2016. This loan has an interest rate of
14%.
The Third Loan was entered into in August 2015 to repay an unsecured facility of US$1.5 million,
and to provide a further US$700k of working capital for the second half of 2015. This loan is
secured over shares in various group subsidiaries, intra-group loans, and gold inventory at the
Inata mine. It carries an interest rate of 12%.
As all three loans are on demand, they have been classified under Current Liabilities.
Ecobank Inata loan
At 30 June 2016, a loan balance of US$26.3 million was due in respect of a medium term loan
facility with Ecobank Burkina Faso ("Ecobank"), which was drawn down in October 2013.  The
loan amount was provided and held in FCFA, which is the legal currency of Burkina Faso. The
Ecobank loan was provided to the Company's 90% subsidiary, Société des Mines de Bélahouro
SA ("SMB"), which owns the Inata mine.
The Ecobank facility has a five year term and bears an interest rate of 8% per annum.  Ecobank
has the right to secure the balance against certain of the assets of SMB. Monthly debt service
payments of 0.6 billion FCFA (currently equal to US$1.1 million) comprising interest and
principal will continue for the 60 month duration of the loan. The facility requires that an amount
equal to two months' payments, 1.3 billion FCFA (currently equal to US$2.1 million), be held as a
debt service reserve account. Subject to the debt service reserve account requirement, there are
no restrictions on SMB's use of loan proceeds or cash flow generated, including the transfer of
funds from SMB to Avocet for corporate purposes. The Ecobank loan facility has no hedge
requirement.
During H1 2016, payments totalling US$6.4 million were made in respect of this loan, which was
made up of US$5.0 million in loan repayments, US$1.2 million of interest, and US$0.2 million in
VAT charged on interest. The weighted average interest on the loan during the year was 8.0%.
The facility is recognised at amortised cost and the amounts due within twelve months are
included as current US$13.6 million with the remaining balance of US$12.7 million included as
non-current.
Ecobank VAT loan
Avocet's Burkinabe subsidiary SMB has an arrangement with Ecobank to allow short term
funding to be drawn down, secured against recoverable VAT balances. Under the terms of this
agreement, SMB is able to receive funding in the amount of 80% of any VAT balances that have
been confirmed by the government of Burkina Faso, but for which actual payment has not yet
been received, up to an aggregate maximum of approximately US$8.0 million (4 billion FCFA). 
The balance drawn down as at 30 June 2016 under this facility was US$2.3 million.
During H1 2016, advances under this facility amounted to US$1.0 million, while US$2.7 million
was repaid out of the proceeds of VAT reclaimed in the period.
Coris bank Inata loan
At 30 June 2016, a loan balance of US$1.5 million was due in respect of a short term loan facility
with Coris Bank International ("Coris Bank"), which was drawn down in November 2015.  The
loan amount was provided and held in FCFA, which is the legal currency of Burkina Faso. The
Coris Bank loan was provided to the Company's 90% subsidiary, Société des Mines de
Bélahouro SA ("SMB"), which owns the Inata mine.
The Coris Bank facility has a 6 month term and bears an interest rate of 10% per annum.  The
Coris bank loan facility has no hedge requirement.
During H1 2016, payments totalling US$7.4 million were made in respect of this loan, which was
made up of US$7.1million in capital repayments, and US$0.3 million of interest. The weighted
average interest on the loan during the year was 10%.
The facility is recognised at amortised cost and as the amounts are due within twelve months,
they are included as current. This loan was fully repaid in July 2016.
Warrants over Company shares
During 2013, 4 million warrants over shares in Avocet Mining PLC were issued to the Elliott
Lender as consideration for the First Loan facility. These warrants had a strike price of GBP 0.40
each.  Of these, 3 million expired on 3 June 2016, and the remaining warrants, which, following
the 10:1 share consolidation in June 2016, were reduced to 100,000 in number at an increased
strike price of GBP 4.00, are due to expire on 2 September 2016.
Finance lease liabilities
Also included within other financial liabilities are liabilities in respect of assets held under finance
lease, US$0.6 million of which is included within current financial liabilities, and US$0.7 million
is included within non-current financial liabilities.
13.  Deferred tax
As at 30 June 2016, the Group increased its deferred tax liability by US$0.1 to US$1.8 million in
relation to the withholding tax (WHT) that would be due in Burkina Faso on settlement of
intragroup management fee invoices.

16.  Contingent liabilities
PT Lebong Tandai claim
In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, note 30 to the financial statements
contains a description of Indonesian law suits brought by PT Lebong Tandai against Avocet and
other parties. The Company is unaware of any new developments in the Indonesian case since
the publication of the Annual Report on 26 April 2016.
The Board remains confident that all the actions taken in respect of the transaction have been in
accordance with prevailing rules and regulations and there are no grounds for any such legal
action by PT LT. As any financial settlement with PT LT is considered to be remote, this matter
does not constitute a contingent liability, however the matter is disclosed in these financial
statements to replicate statements already made by the Company.
The buyer, J&Partners, has notified Avocet that in the event PT LT was successful in actions
against J&Partners, J&Partners would make a claim for damages against Avocet. The basis for
the claim would be that Avocet had breached a warranty in the sales agreement, which is
governed by English law, in which it stated that it was selling the assets free of encumbrance.
Avocet strongly disagrees that there was any such breach and initiated arbitration in the English
courts to have any such claim dismissed.
The arbitration hearing took place in London in January 2015 and the arbitrator's verdict was
delivered in December 2015.  Although the verdict was partial and certain areas remained
unresolved, the Company does not believe there to be any further contingent liabilities with
regard to the arbitration.
Claim for Repayment of VAT
In March 2016, the Company received notification from HM Revenue and Customs that its VAT
registration status had been challenged on the grounds that its management fees were not
considered taxable supplies due to not having been fully settled in cash. The Company believes
that these were valid taxable supplies in respect of bona fide services performed by Avocet
Mining PLC on behalf of its subsidiaries (notably the Inata gold mine), and the non-payment was
the result of temporary cashflow shortages and other restrictions in connection with its
subsidiary's loan facilities. In the event that the VAT registration were to be held to be invalid
(which the Board considers a remote possibility), the total VAT reclaimed that would be
repayable by the Company would be approximately £950k (US$1.25 million).
