<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Honduras was held at the 8th meeting, on 4 November 2010. The 
delegation of Honduras was headed by the Vice-President of the Republic of Honduras, 
Mar&#237;a Antonieta Guill&#233;n de Bogr&#225;n. At its 12th meeting, held on 8 November 2010, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Honduras. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Honduras: Thailand, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Honduras: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/HND/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HND/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HND/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland was transmitted to 
Honduras through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation recalled the commitment of Honduras and noted that the 
country had ratified several core international and regional human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>6. During the general elections held in November 2009, the people of Honduras had 
exercised their right to auto-determination and their civic duty to resolve conflicts through 
democratic mechanisms. In that regard, the people of Honduras had demonstrated to the 
international community that they embraced democracy as the best system for guaranteeing 
governance by the people. A Government of unity and reconciliation had been established. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation referred to the participation of a high-level inter-institutional 
delegation in the interactive dialogue of the universal periodic review of Honduras, as well 
as the opportunity that this provided to assess progress and evaluate challenges and 
opportunities in the promotion and protection of human rights and also contribute to the 
process of dialogue and national consultation on various thematic areas of concern to all 
human beings. 
</p>
<p>8. Honduras reaffirmed its commitment to respecting and protecting the dignity of the 
human being. A strategy for the promotion of, respect for and observance of human rights 
as a national objective had been set out in the new &#8220;Vision for the Country &#8211; Plan for the 
Nation&#8221;, which was the result of a broad consultation among civil society, academia, </p>


<p>political parties and other key national actors. For the first time, a human-rights-based 
public policy and a national human rights plan of action would be implemented in the 
country, through the recently established State Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>9. In line with that policy, an open and standing invitation had been issued to all 
mechanisms and special procedures of the United Nations and the Organization of 
American States, including an invitation to the Office of the High Commissioner to open an 
office in the country. The goal of Honduras was to promote good practices and better 
monitoring for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. Honduras indicated that the main and most pressing challenge was the need to 
ensure the protection of the right to life. The delegation referred to the violence affecting 
the country as a result of organized crime. The delegation described actions being taken to 
address that situation, but recognized that there was still work to be done and noted the 
need to define a strategy for guaranteeing the security of citizens as a human right.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation indicated that Honduras had complied with all commitments 
undertaken within the framework of the Guaymuras Dialogue and the Tegucigalpa-San Jos&#233; 
Accord, among which was the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the main human rights issues, as raised by the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and specific Rapporteurs, the delegation noted that Honduras had taken a 
series of actions to address them. The delegation provided information about, inter alia, 
measures to address impunity, to strengthen the independence and capacity of the Office of 
the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights, and to ensure that the national police respected 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. Honduras also referred to actions taken to comply with obligations arising from the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two Optional Protocols, among which had 
been the establishment of legal, institutional and policy frameworks to address the problem 
of the sexual and commercial exploitation of children and child labour. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation also noted challenges and the need to address poverty and strengthen 
the capacities of State institutions, and highlighted the need for support and technical 
assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding the situation of women in Honduras, the delegation described the legal 
and institutional framework and referred to gender-related policies and programmes to 
address the challenges faced by women, including the problem of violence, access to justice 
and political participation, as well as femicide. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation referred to other priority areas to be addressed as part of the national 
human rights plan of action, such as the comprehensive attention that should be accorded to 
persons with disabilities, and the promotion and protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender groups, migrants and ethnic groups. Information on efforts to protect the right 
to health and to promote the right to education and food security was also provided by the 
delegation. 
</p>
<p>17. Honduras recognized the reality of the problem of racism and racial discrimination 
and its direct impact on the effective enjoyment of their human rights by indigenous and 
Afro-Honduran peoples. 
</p>
<p>18. In September 2009, Honduras had received a visit by the Subcommittee on the 
Prevention of Torture, which had recommended that the infrastructure of the penitentiary 
centres in Honduras be improved. The delegation reported that the Council of Ministers had 
already issued an Executive Decree allocating approximately $35 million for improving 
infrastructure and equipment at nine centres. The legislation providing for the national 
preventive mechanism referred to in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against </p>


<p>Torture had been adopted, and the President and other high-level public officials had 
condemned the practice of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation also recognized the need to make further efforts to harmonize 
domestic legislation with international human rights standards regarding the issue of 
enforced disappearance. Concerning allegations of arbitrary detention, Honduras also 
recognized that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office could improve its performance in terms of 
the monitoring of the security forces. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation expressed concern about the allegations concerning threats and 
aggression against journalists, social communicators and human rights defenders, and 
called on them to report such practices to the relevant national bodies with a view to 
prevention, investigation and the punishment of those found responsible. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the murder of nine journalists, the delegation reported that the evidence 
resulting from the investigations relating to two cases had been presented in court and that 
the investigations relating to two other cases were being completed. Honduras had 
requested assistance from other countries to support the investigations. However, Honduras 
noted that, in the two cases presented in court, there was no evidence indicating that the 
crimes had been politically motivated or that State agents had been involved. The State, 
however, assumed its responsibility for investigating and bringing to justice those 
responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue, 44 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>23. France referred to the appeal by a group of Special Rapporteurs for measures 
guaranteeing the security of journalists. It noted the concerns of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women regarding the persistence of violence against 
women. France also raised the issue of Honduras as a country of origin, destination and 
transit in relation to victims of human trafficking, mainly for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. India welcomed institutional reforms and efforts to harmonize domestic legislation 
with international standards. It commended Honduras for having acceded to most core 
international human rights instruments. It referred to the reform of the health sector, the 
measures taken in the field of education, the implementation of social housing programmes, 
and the focus placed on the right to a healthy environment. India encouraged Honduras to 
implement its migration policy. 
</p>
<p>25. Indonesia appreciated the efforts made by Honduras to stabilize the country and 
undertake the necessary democratic reforms following the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of June 2009. 
Indonesia welcomed the setting up of the Truth Commission, as well as the role played by 
the Office of the National Commissioner for Human Rights, the establishment of the 
Institute for Children and the Family, and the attention given to vulnerable groups. 
Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Poland welcomed the progress made by Honduras in bringing its legislation into line 
with international standards. It noted the increasing crime rates and the lack of adequate 
judicial protection and redress for victims. Poland inquired about the steps Honduras 
intended to take to reduce impunity and improve judicial mechanisms so that they ensured 
the independent, timely and effective protection of citizens. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Azerbaijan commended the establishment of the Truth Commission, the invitation to 
special procedures, and the measures taken to promote women&#8217;s rights. It inquired about </p>


<p>the possibility of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Azerbaijan welcomed the action plans to 
combat the commercial sexual exploitation of children and child labour. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>28. Mexico noted that the reports on Honduras clearly reflected the major institutional 
challenges in improving the human rights situation, which had been affected by the 
breakdown of the democratic constitutional order in June 2009. It commended the 
investigation of human rights violations, including the 250 complaints collected by the 
Office of the Special Prosecutor. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Canada welcomed Honduras&#8217; efforts to strengthen human rights and move toward 
national reconciliation, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the 
appointment of a Special Prosecutor for Human Rights and the creation of a new Ministry 
of Justice and Human Rights. It commended Honduras for  extending an open invitation to 
international human rights organizations, including OHCHR and the Organization of 
American States. Canada noted allegations of intimidation, harassment and death threats 
against members of civil society. Canada expressed concerns towards the sharp increase in 
murders of women and journalists, and its negative impact on freedom of expression in 
Honduras. Canada noted that many of the perpetrators have not been brought to justice.  
Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Ireland welcomed the voluntary commitments made by Honduras as well as the 
standing invitation to special procedures. It was concerned about the restrictions on 
freedom of expression, the situation of human rights defenders, and the violent deaths of 
women. Ireland asked about measures to tackle violence against women and to deal with 
increasing violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups. Ireland 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. While recognizing encouraging developments in the field of human rights, such as 
the creation of a Ministry of Human Rights and the announced creation of a Commission 
against Impunity, Germany asked what administrative and legal measures had been adopted 
to end torture and ill treatment by law enforcement officials. Germany also asked for 
information about support programmes for the victims of gender-based or sexual violence, 
trafficking and sexual exploitation. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. The Netherlands expressed concern over the human rights violations committed 
during and after the political crisis of June 2009, which had gone unpunished. It also 
expressed concern about the prevalence of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons and the inadequate response by law enforcement officials. The 
Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. The Holy See welcomed the efforts made to preserve democracy and re-establish the 
rule of law. It commended Honduras for its national human rights institution and welcomed 
efforts to protect the right to life. The Holy See encouraged Honduras to move forward on 
the path of reconciliation. The Holy See made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Hungary considered the abolishment of the death penalty as a sign of respect for 
human rights. It noted with appreciation the reforms aimed at preventing and eradicating 
torture, but underscored the persistent occurrence of the torture and ill treatment of 
detainees. While noting that effective interaction between society and the State was an 
essential factor, Hungary indicated that that goal was hindered by the lack of independence 
of the judiciary. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Brazil underlined the fact that its participation in this interactive dialogue did not 
alter the present political relations between Honduras and Brazil. It noted with satisfaction 
that Honduras was party to most international human rights instruments and had extended a </p>


<p>standing invitation to special procedures. It recognized Honduras&#8217; interest in hosting an 
office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It noted with concern 
the increasing violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, children and 
young people in situations of social vulnerability and the related impunity for such crimes.  
Brazil expressed concern at the increasing threats against human rights defenders, 
journalists, magistrates and political opponents.  Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Slovakia praised the abolition of the death penalty in 1957. It expressed concern 
about restrictions on freedom of expression, the vulnerability of journalists, and the killing 
of eight journalists in 2010. Slovakia considered the dismissal of three judges and a 
magistrate as an unacceptable attack on the independence of the judiciary. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Sweden expressed concern at reports of torture and ill treatment in prisons and 
detention centres in the aftermath of the violation of the constitutional order. Sweden was 
also concerned about reported allegations of the disproportionate and excessive use of force 
by the police and military in response to the widespread demonstrations that had occurred 
since June 2009. It asked for information about actions taken to investigate those 
allegations and to hold accountable those responsible. Sweden also expressed concern at the 
increasing homicide rate, especially regarding journalists, and asked about measures taken 
in that regard. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. In responding to questions raised, the delegation indicated that the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission had been established as part of the Guaymuras Dialogue&#8211;
Tegucigalpa-San Jos&#233; Accord of 30 October 2009. The Commission had independence in 
carrying out its legal mandate. Its main goal was to present to the people of Honduras a 
report that, it hoped, could be finished during the first trimester of next year. The reports on 
events that had occurred before and after 28 June 2009 would help to prevent similar crises 
and put forward constructive recommendations that would strengthen the country&#8217;s 
institutions and democratic development and the defence and guarantee of human rights. 
Honduras was also striving to establish the facts surrounding the incidents and find a 
channel for national reconciliation. In its mandate, it was recognized that it was important 
and necessary to have the political will to implement recommendations, particularly those 
that could strengthen the institutional framework of the State and the protection of human 
rights. The State Secretariat of Justice and Human Rights had recently established the 
relevant working sectors and would follow up on the recommendations of the Commission. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the allegations of impunity, the delegation pointed out that 22 cases 
had been prosecuted. A budget had been allocated, and more resources should be assigned, 
to support a programme for strengthening the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human 
Rights, including the recruitment and training of staff of the Office, which would carry out 
independent investigations. The delegation noted that there was the political will to 
investigate and punish those responsible. 
</p>
<p>40. The delegation also noted that the State recognized the importance of freedom of 
expression and the press, and its fundamental role in the consolidation and development of 
democracy. It was also aware that the necessary measures should be adopted to ensure that 
journalists could carry out their work. In that regard, the delegation noted that the 
Constitution and other legislation guaranteed freedom of expression, including collecting, 
receiving and disseminating information and ideas, without any censorship. Honduras 
regretted the murders of journalists and social communicators, and investigations were 
being conducted by the State Secretariat of Security and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, as 
noted in the national report. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to protecting the right to life and security of journalists and human 
rights defenders, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission had issued 341 </p>


<p>precautionary measures, of which 253 had been agreed with the beneficiaries. Other 
security measures had also been implemented by the State Secretariat of Security. 
</p>
<p>42. Concerning impunity, the delegation stated that Honduras had recently asked the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations to support the establishment in the country of an 
international commission against impunity, which would act as an element of technical 
back-stopping in investigations related to certain cases that they knew had given rise to 
many concerns at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>43. Haiti welcomed the participation of civil society in the preparation of the national 
report. It inquired about the measures Honduras intended to take to turn the National 
Human Rights Commission into a genuine mechanism for protecting human rights. Haiti 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. The United Kingdom welcomed the work done to create a multi-party Government 
of reconciliation after the unsettling events of 2009, as well as the establishment of the 
Truth Commission and the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and the issuance of a 
standing invitation to the special procedures mechanisms. It encouraged Honduras to tackle 
incidents of political repression and to increase consultation with civil society. The United 
Kingdom expressed concern at the reports of extrajudicial killings, particularly of children, 
and called upon Honduras to ensure prosecutions. Furthermore, it inquired about measures 
to protect journalists and human rights defenders. The United Kingdom made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Australia welcomed the 2010 increase in the national police budget and the 
appointment of a high-level human rights adviser to assist the President. It noted, however, 
that much had to be done to improve the human rights situation, especially to reduce the 
high homicide and femicide rates. Australia expressed its support for the recommendation 
of the Organization of American States that there be a continued investigation into the high 
murder rate, especially with regard to journalists and human rights activists. It asked 
Honduras to take steps to end threats and attacks on the population and to fully support 
human rights institutions. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Italy welcomed the issuance of a standing invitation to international human rights 
mechanisms and the willingness to host an office of OHCHR. Italy asked about the role of 
the &#8220;unlawful associations&#8221; (<i>maras </i>or <i>pandillas</i>) regarding the sexual exploitation of 
women and trafficking. Italy expressed concern at the carrying out of torture and ill 
treatment against detainees by police forces, as well as the excessive use of force during the 
political crisis last year. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay clarified that its participation in the dialogue could not be seen as an 
explicit or implicit recognition of the Government of Mr. Porfirio Lobo Sosa. Uruguay 
expressed its deep concern about reported restrictions on freedom of expression and the rule 
of law; the intimidation, mistreatment and killing of journalists and human rights activists 
that had occurred after the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat; and the impunity surrounding the killings of 
juveniles. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Thailand expressed its support for Honduras in undertaking poverty eradication 
policies as a way to prevent the abuse and exploitation of women and children. Thailand 
welcomed the country&#8217;s various laws and policies aimed at preventing human trafficking, 
and applauded Honduras for its attempt to promote human rights education and training. 
Thailand expressed its readiness to explore ways to promote South-South cooperation with 
Honduras, and noted the possibility of sharing practices as part of a victim-centred 
approach to combating human trafficking. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. China recognized Honduras&#8217; implementation of its international obligations, the 
establishment of the Truth Commission and the Ministry for Justice and Human Rights, and </p>


<p>the issuance of a standing invitation to international human rights mechanisms. Owing to 
financial and technical restraints, Honduras continued to face difficulties in its judicial 
development and provision of social security. China called on the international community 
to increase financial and technical assistance to Honduras in order to support the country&#8217;s 
capacity to better protect and promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>50. The United States of America welcomed the investigations into the killings of 
journalists since March 2010 and congratulated Honduras on having created the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights and the Secretariat for the Development of Indigenous and Afro-
Honduran Peoples. It was concerned about the killings, intimidations and abuses of persons 
belonging to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The United States made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Republic of Korea asked for information about the activities of the Truth 
Commission. It acknowledged Honduras&#8217; significant progress in promoting and protecting 
women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. It asked about the challenges Honduras was facing in the 
fight against crime and the measures it was planning to take to overcome them. The 
Republic of Korea made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>52. Spain recognized Honduras&#8217; efforts to overcome the negative impact on human 
rights caused by the political crisis of June 2009. It welcomed the issuance of a standing 
invitation to special procedures, the request to host an OHCHR office and the establishment 
of a Truth Commission. Spain noted the persistent situation of impunity in Honduras. Spain 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Austria expressed concern about discrimination against indigenous minorities, Afro-
descendant and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. It inquired about measures 
taken to protect the lands of indigenous communities and to address discrimination against 
minorities in the labour market. It was also concerned about increasing attacks against 
human rights defenders and about the climate of impunity and corruption. Austria made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. The Czech Republic expressed concern about the increasing homicide rate in 
Honduras, especially with regard to the situation of journalists. It underlined the need to 
combat impunity and to better protect the rights of most vulnerable groups. The Czech 
Republic made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Panama recognized the efforts made by Honduras to overcome the challenges it 
faced in the promotion and protection of human rights. It welcomed the establishment of 
the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights as well as the National Human Rights Plan of 
Action. Panama praised Honduras for the issuance of a standing invitation to the special 
procedures mechanisms.  Panama made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Guatemala highlighted the establishment of the Truth Commission, the standing 
invitation extended to special procedures and the request for the establishment of an 
OHCHR presence. It noted with interest initiatives on migration and gender-based violence, 
welcomed measures to eradicate child labour, and asked Honduras to share its practices. It 
requested information about measures to compensate families for the lack of revenues 
derived from child labour, and on measures to harmonize domestic legislation with 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p>57. Costa Rica noted with satisfaction the efforts devoted to the process of national 
reconciliation and unity. It also identified some positive aspects in the field of human 
rights, including measures to combat discrimination and violence against women, as well as 
actions to protect children and adolescents. Costa Rica encouraged Honduras to continue 
efforts to strengthen its judicial system. Costa Rica made recommendations. </p>


<p>58. The delegation expressed appreciation for the recognition voiced by some 
delegations with regard to the efforts of Honduras to become a party to the core 
international human rights instruments. Honduras had also been harmonizing its domestic 
legal framework with international human rights norms and standards. It recognized, 
however, that there was still much to be done, and the State Secretariat of Justice and 
Human Rights would have this responsibility. The delegation reported that the National 
Congress was considering the possibility of abolishing the legislation on states of 
emergency, as it was incompatible with the Constitution. Article 209 of the Criminal Code, 
which regulated the crime of torture, was also being reviewed with a view to its 
harmonization with international human rights standards. Other draft projects currently 
being studied by the National Congress included the draft law on the judiciary, the Council 
of the Judiciary and the Judicial Service Act. Honduras was also promoting the 
incorporation of new legal institutions into the domestic legal framework, including the 
incorporation into the new Criminal Code of crimes recognized under international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation further reported on specific measures taken for the implementation of 
precautionary measures, as noted earlier. Among these measures was an emergency 
telephone line to contact the police, as well as additional patrolling by police and police 
escorts. Honduras again referred to the security situation that was affecting the entire 
region, owing mainly to its geographic location. 
</p>
<p>60. Since 28 June 2009, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights had dealt 
with six cases of proven abuse against the media by police and military authorities. Other 
cases were being investigated. The State was planning a strategy to protect journalists, 
social communicators and human rights defenders with a view to protecting their lives and 
physical integrity, as well as ensuring the effective investigation of such offences. 
Honduras had asked for assistance from other countries to support the investigative 
functions. 
</p>
<p>61. The delegation noted that the State condemned any act of violence against women. 
The Office of the Special Prosecutor for Women was carrying out actions to address the 
problem of domestic violence. Through the State Secretariat of Public Health, assistance 
was being provided to victims of sexual violence and also to aggressors, through special 
programmes involving 18 family counsellors at the national level. The Women&#8217;s Institute, 
through municipal offices, monitored the implementation of the sanctions imposed on 
perpetrators of domestic violence. The Inter-institutional Commission for the Follow-up 
and Implementation of the Domestic Violence Law was also trying to solve the problem of 
violence against women. Honduras had established five shelters at the national level, with 
the support of international cooperation. However, the protection system needed to be 
further strengthened. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the promotion and protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons, Honduras reported that it had provided legal recognition to groups 
defending the rights of such persons. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had also initiated 
judicial actions against State agents who had committed abuse of power, discrimination and 
murder attempts against members of those communities. 
</p>
<p>63.  With regard to indigenous groups and Afro-Honduran peoples, legislative measures 
had been taken to recognize their ancestral rights, and institutions had been created to 
regulate land tenure. The Office of the Special Prosecutor for Ethnic Groups and Cultural 
Heritage was currently investigating a series of allegations involving the crime of 
usurpation and other offences committed against indigenous communities. It was expected 
that the new State Secretariat to address issues regarding ethnic groups would effectively 
ensure the monitoring of the relevant provisions contained in the Constitution and the law. </p>


<p>64. Chile recognized Honduras&#8217; efforts to respond to the challenges that had arisen from 
the political and institutional crisis. It praised the issuance of a standing invitation to 
international human rights mechanisms, the establishment of a National Plan of Action for 
Human Rights and the readiness to open an OHCHR office. It welcomed the creation of a 
Truth Commission. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Colombia welcomed Honduras&#8217; request for the opening of an OHCHR office, which 
reflected the country&#8217;s commitment to the United Nations human rights system. Colombia 
expressed its support for the implementation of the compromise emanating from the 
Guaymuras Dialogue-Tegucigalpa-San Jos&#233; Accord, stressing the importance of the 
creation of the Truth Commission. It highlighted Honduras&#8217; commitment to clearing up the 
cases involving the murder of journalists, and encouraged the country to continue efforts to 
protect them. Colombia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Argentina stated that it did not recognize the Government of Honduras. It noted that, 
given the situation of grave human rights violations, which had increased since the coup 
d&#8217;&#233;tat, it had decided to make a presentation during the interactive dialogue. Argentina 
made recommendations.
