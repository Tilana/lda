<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Australia</b>&#8217;s proposed amendments to the <b>report of the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children 
</b></p>
<p>1. Human trafficking, sexual servitude and slavery are heinous crimes and serious 
violations of human rights.  Since 2003, the Australian Government has had a 
comprehensive whole-of-government strategy in place to combat human trafficking in all 
its forms, including for sexual and labour exploitation.  The measures under this strategy, to 
which the Australian Government has committed more than $A100 million to address the 
full cycle of trafficking from recruitment to repatriation, reflect the four central pillars of 
Australia&#8217;s anti-trafficking strategy: prevention; detection and investigation; prosecution; 
and victim support and protection.   
</p>
<p>2. While Australia is a destination country for trafficking victims, due to our 
geographical isolation and strong border controls the number of people trafficked into 
Australia each year is very low compared with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.  
Though the majority of identified victims have been women trafficked for the purposes of 
exploitation in the sex industry, cases of trafficking for labour exploitation are increasingly 
being identified.  Since 2004, authorities have identified 191 suspected victims of 
trafficking in Australia (as at 15 March 2012).  
</p>
<p>3. Australia&#8217;s response to human trafficking reflects our obligations as a party to the 
<i>United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime</i> (UNTOC) since 2004 
and its supplementary <i>Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children</i> since 2005.  
</p>
<p>4. Australia has strong anti-trafficking laws with severe penalties, including offences 
relating to slavery and human trafficking into, and from, Australia for exploitation, sexual 
services or activities involving debt bondage or confiscation of travel documents.  The 
offences are not limited to trafficking that involves sexual slavery or sexual servitude.  
Additional offences apply for trafficking within Australia and specific offences apply to 
trafficking in children.  Maximum penalties range from 12 months&#8217; imprisonment for debt 
</p>
<p>bondage, to 25 years&#8217; imprisonment for slavery and trafficking in children.   The Australian 
</p>
<p>Government is currently considering legislative reform to ensure that the broadest range of 
exploitative behaviour is captured and criminalised, including by introducing new offences 
of forced labour and forced marriage.   
</p>
<p>5. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has dedicated officers targeting human 
trafficking.  Since 2004 the AFP&#8217;s Human Trafficking Team has carried out more than 320 
</p>
<p>investigations into allegations of trafficking-related offences, resulting in 14 convictions (as 
at 15 March 2012).   
</p>
<p>6. The Australian Government provides comprehensive assistance for suspected 
trafficking victims through its Support for Trafficked People Program (Support Program) 
which helps clients to meet their basic needs of safety, food, accommodation, and mental 
and physical health and well-being.  It also provides opportunities for clients to learn skills 
and to support themselves after they leave the Support Program, whether returning home or 
staying in Australia.   
</p>
<p>7. Australia also has in place a People Trafficking Visa Framework (Visa Framework) 
which enables people who are suspected victims of trafficking to remain lawfully in 
Australia if they do not already hold a valid visa.  The Visa Framework includes a visa that 
allows trafficking victims and immediate family members to stay in Australia permanently 
if the victim has assisted with an investigation or prosecution of an offender and if the 
victim would be in danger if returned to their home country.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>8. Australia has taken an active role in international efforts to combat human 
trafficking, including as Co-Chair of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in 
Persons and Related Transnational Crime.  The Australian Government, primarily through 
AusAID, funds a number of specific activities to combat human trafficking in the South 
East Asian region, and addresses violence against women and children.  In 2011-12, 
Australia will provide $A4.8 billion in international development assistance, mainly in the 
Asia-Pacific region, to help reduce poverty and promote sustainable development, which 
reduces people&#8217;s vulnerability to trafficking and sexual and labour exploitation.  Targeted 
</p>
<p>initiatives to combat human trafficking include the Asia Regional Trafficking in Persons 
Project (ARTIP) which works to strengthen law enforcement, judicial and prosecutorial 
responses to trafficking, and to improve policy, law, research and outreach.   
</p>
<p>9. Human trafficking and slavery are complex crimes and government action is only 
part of the solution. The Australian Government is committed to building strong 
partnerships with the not-for-profit sector.  In 2008, the Government established the 
National Roundtable on People Trafficking as a consultative mechanism between 
Government and non-government organisations (NGOs) on trafficking issues.  Since then, 
the Australian Government has provided $A2.4 million to assist four Australian NGOs to 
provide vital outreach for trafficking victims and to conduct education and awareness 
initiatives on human trafficking.  The Government has also allocated almost $A500,000 to 
two NGOs, two union bodies and an industry association to carry out similar work to 
combat labour trafficking and forced labour in susceptible industries.  The Australian 
Government also funds a range of projects in other countries delivered by NGOs, including 
World Vision, Save the Children and Child Fund, to prevent human trafficking and labour 
exploitation, assist victims and promote child rights and child protection. 
</p>
<p>10. The Australian Government is committed to working with other Australian 
governments including State and Territory governments, as well as foreign governments, 
international organisations (such as the United Nations), and domestic and international 
NGOs to prevent human trafficking, prosecute the perpetrators and protect and support 
victims. 
</p>
<p>11. The Australian Government was pleased to welcome the Special Rapporteur to 
Australia in November 2011 and looks forward to the continuation of the strong partnership 
with the Special Rapporteur.<b>
