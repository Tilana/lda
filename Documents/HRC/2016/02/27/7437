<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48/141, 
</p>
<p>focuses on the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) at the global level and in the field1 from December 2013 to November 
</p>
<p>2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The new four-year planning cycle (2014-2017) began in 2014. At headquarters and 
</p>
<p>in the field, OHCHR embraced the newly defined thematic priorities guided by results-
</p>
<p>based management. These priorities are strengthening international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; enhancing equality and countering discrimination; combating impunity and 
</p>
<p>strengthening accountability and the rule of law; integrating human rights into development 
</p>
<p>and in the economic sphere; widening the democratic space; and early warning and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights in situations of conflict, violence and insecurity. All priorities 
</p>
<p>are cross-cutting and mutually reinforcing. Under the new planning cycle, migration is 
</p>
<p>mainstreamed under the various priorities.  </p>
<p>3. During the period under review, my predecessor undertook missions to the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic, Georgia, Morocco, Nigeria and South Sudan. The Deputy High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner visited Cambodia, Guatemala, the Republic of Moldova and Togo. The 
</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary-General visited Burundi, Iraq and Ukraine. </p>
<p>4. At a time of deepening turmoil worldwide, OHCHR was in great demand: the 
</p>
<p>relentless conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic and spill-over into Iraq; from the conflict in 
</p>
<p>Ukraine to the bloodshed in South Sudan; and, most recently, the spread of Ebola. The 
</p>
<p>period under review has seen a devastating deterioration in human rights.  </p>
<p>5. Rising inequality and the political, economic and social exclusion of marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups undermined the dignity and rights of people in many States, and drove much of the 
</p>
<p>unrest and most of the conflicts reported. Economic, social and cultural rights, as well as 
</p>
<p>the right to development, were affected by austerity policies that disproportionately burden 
</p>
<p>the poor and marginalized, as did corruption; there were failures to prioritize public 
</p>
<p>services, and refusal to recognize people&#8217;s right to participate in decisions that shape their 
</p>
<p>lives. Migrants continued to endure profound suffering, with recent events at sea 
</p>
<p>demonstrating a callous disregard for human life and human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. I must also raise the continued reprisals against those who seek to cooperate with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations in the field of human rights. In the past year, there were multiple examples 
</p>
<p>of Member States and/or their proxies directing personal attacks against special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders, the members of commissions of inquiry, and United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>officers who report on gaps in human rights protection. 
</p>
<p>7. During the period under review, OHCHR conducted monitoring missions, issued 
</p>
<p>public reports on human rights developments in various States, and deployed teams to 
</p>
<p>provide advice on human rights responses in crisis situations. OHCHR provided technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to dozens of States in a broad range of issues, spanning its six thematic priorities. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 As at November 2014, OHCHR supported 67 field presences, comprising 13 country / stand-alone 
</p>
<p>offices, 12 regional offices/centres, the human rights components of 14 United Nations peace 
</p>
<p>missions and 28 human rights advisers, including 10 deployed in June and July 2014 to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations country teams in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra 
</p>
<p>Leone, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia and to the regional United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Group teams for Asia-Pacific and Central America. </p>


<p>The examples of such work included in the present report reflect only a snapshot of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR activities at Headquarters and in the field. 
</p>
<p>8. The final annual reports submitted by my predecessor to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and the General Assembly drew attention to the growing trend of requests for OHCHR 
</p>
<p>support. This trend continued, with the creation of new mandates from intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>bodies, calls for technical assistance from Member States and intensified engagement 
</p>
<p>within the United Nations system in the security, development and humanitarian contexts, 
</p>
<p>including with respect to the Human Rights Up Front plan of action. With regard to the plan 
</p>
<p>of action, which is still in its infancy, the United Nations system is beginning to identify 
</p>
<p>potential problems earlier, and in severe situations human rights are given more system-
</p>
<p>wide attention. Because of the ever-increasing demands placed on OHCHR, however, I 
</p>
<p>must highlight the significant gap between those demands and the capacity available. As a 
</p>
<p>matter of priority, I call for renewed political and financial support from Member States so 
</p>
<p>that OHCHR is able to fulfil its critical mandate. 
</p>
<p>9. With regard to efficiency, OHCHR continued its efforts by establishing a results-
</p>
<p>based management system to ensure that its scant resources are planned and allocated to 
</p>
<p>ensure maximum impact. As an example, the human rights treaty body strengthening 
</p>
<p>process will provide significant regular budget resources through the reinvestment of 
</p>
<p>funding obtained through simplified procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening international human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>10. Human rights mechanisms continued to spotlight a wide range of human rights 
</p>
<p>issues, both thematic and country-specific. They also brought new issues to the fore, 
</p>
<p>provided an early warning function, gave a voice to victims and contributed to the 
</p>
<p>development of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>11. The thematic priorities of OHCHR are strengthened by the parallel work of human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms. Despite various constraints, including of a budgetary nature, it was able 
</p>
<p>to provide adequate support to each mechanism. OHCHR also worked on initiatives that 
</p>
<p>strengthen cooperation among the mechanisms, promoting a holistic approach to 
</p>
<p>implementation; for example, OHCHR advised States on establishing permanent national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for reporting and coordinating follow-up to all human rights recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p>12. The successful conclusion of the treaty body strengthening process was a landmark 
</p>
<p>event. To the credit of Member States, in its resolution 68/268, the General Assembly set 
</p>
<p>out a series of measures to address key challenges faced by the treaty bodies, including the 
</p>
<p>backlog of State party reports and communications, chronic under-resourcing and 
</p>
<p>insufficient compliance with reporting obligations.  
</p>
<p>13. The above-mentioned measures, which will come into effect in 2015, are funded by 
</p>
<p>cost savings and efficiencies made within the system. They include more meeting time and 
</p>
<p>human and financial resources from the regular budget. General Assembly resolution 
</p>
<p>68/268 included capacity-building measures, inter alia, additional staff capacity in OHCHR 
</p>
<p>regional offices,&#8211; to be funded from the regular budget, to assist States parties to fulfil their 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations. The Assembly also encouraged the treat bodies to modernize the 
</p>
<p>treaty body system, to make it more accessible and to foster internal harmonization.  </p>


<p>14. In 2014, OHCHR facilitated the review of<b> </b>147 State party reports by the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, the adoption of views and decisions on more than 100 individual communications, 
</p>
<p>and seven country visits, conducted by the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. 
</p>
<p>15. OHCHR, at Headquarters and in the field, continued to provide technical assistance 
</p>
<p>to support ratification and reporting of, and follow-up to, the recommendations made by 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>16. Three new special procedures mandates were created in 2014 (now totalling 53 
</p>
<p>special procedures): Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic; Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; and Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The Human Rights Council appointed 31 mandate holders. Standing 
</p>
<p>invitations to special procedures rose to 109, although, regrettably, they were not always 
</p>
<p>honoured. 
</p>
<p>17. From January to October, special procedures mandate holders conducted 63 visits to 
</p>
<p>43 States. As at 31 October2014, special procedures had issued 20 urgent appeals, 206 joint 
</p>
<p>urgent appeals, 39 allegation letters and 162 joint allegation letters. The average response 
</p>
<p>rate for the period was around 45 per cent, slightly higher than the rate recorded in 2013 
</p>
<p>(42.9 per cent).  
</p>
<p>18. The thematic and country-specific expertise of mandate holders helped to draw 
</p>
<p>attention to emerging issues such as the use of drones in extraterritorial lethal counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism operations; mass digital surveillance for counter-terrorism purposes; the 
</p>
<p>implications of States&#8217; surveillance of communications on the rights to privacy and to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression; and the implementation of the right to social security 
</p>
<p>through the universal adoption of social protection floors.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Human Rights Council  
</b></p>
<p>19. The Human Rights Council continued to address various urgent and chronic human 
</p>
<p>rights situations. It established (or extended the mandate of, in the case of the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic) commissions of inquiry, and requested OHCHR to conduct investigations. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR continued to support the work of the Council, and its subsidiary bodies, in all 
</p>
<p>aspects. 
</p>
<p>20. At its twenty-sixth session, the Human Rights Council decided, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>26/24, to establish a commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in Eritrea. At its twenty-first special session, in its resolution S-21/1, the Council 
</p>
<p>established a commission of inquiry to investigate all violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the 
</p>
<p>military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether before, during or after.  
</p>
<p>21.  The period under review witnessed a new trend whereby the Human Council 
</p>
<p>requested OHCHR to conduct investigations and to establish field-based structures. In its 
</p>
<p>resolution 25/1, the Council requested the High Commissioner to undertake a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations of human rights by both parties 
</p>
<p>in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission.  
</p>
<p>22. In its resolution S-22/1, the Human Rights Council requested OHCHR urgently to 
</p>
<p>dispatch a mission to Iraq to investigate alleged violations and abuses of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law committed by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and </p>


<p>associated terrorist groups. The Council, in its resolution 26/30, also invited the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to report on the situation of human rights in Ukraine.  
</p>
<p>23. In March 2014, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/25, on the basis of 
</p>
<p>the final report of the commission of inquiry to investigate the systematic, widespread and 
</p>
<p>grave human rights violations committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,2 
</p>
<p>requested OHCHR to set up a field-based structure to follow up on the work of the 
</p>
<p>commission. 
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR organized an increasing number of panel discussions on a broad array of 
</p>
<p>issues &#8211; thereby significantly enriching the deliberations of the Human Rights Council &#8211; 
</p>
<p>such as the death penalty, civil society space, the safety of journalists, female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation, child, early and forced marriage, violence against children, the history teaching 
</p>
<p>and memorialization processes, persons deprived of their liberty, the right to privacy in the 
</p>
<p>digital age, the protection of the family and its members, the role of prevention, use of 
</p>
<p>remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones, commemorating the sixty-fifth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, preventive 
</p>
<p>approaches within the United Nations system, and mainstreaming the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants. A large number of substantive reports by Office of the High Commissioner and 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders were prepared to inform the panel discussions.  
</p>
<p>25. The Office also organized country-related panel discussions at the request of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, including on lessons learned and continuing challenges in 
</p>
<p>combating sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>26. The Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small 
</p>
<p>Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms 
</p>
<p>became operational in January, enabling OHCHR to cover the participation of six 
</p>
<p>Government officials, to install two fellowships for State representatives and to organize 
</p>
<p>two interregional seminars to facilitate participation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>27. In November 2014, the universal periodic review reached the middle of its second 
</p>
<p>cycle. All 112 States scheduled for consideration had participated, most at a high level. 
</p>
<p>Aiming to foster effective implementation, the reviews focused on progress made since the 
</p>
<p>first cycle. The challenge is to follow up on the growing number of recommendations and 
</p>
<p>keeping the overall objective of bringing about impact on the ground.  
</p>
<p>28. The Office prepared documentation to inform review debates and to support States 
</p>
<p>under review. The Trust Fund to facilitate the participation of States in the sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review funded 16 delegates, and OHCHR 
</p>
<p>organized bilateral and cross-regional sessions, including in partnership with the 
</p>
<p>International Organization of la Francophonie and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, to 
</p>
<p>strengthen engagement, including of parliamentarians. Requests for OHCHR support from 
</p>
<p>all regions grew steadily, which were addressed through the Voluntary Fund for Financial 
</p>
<p>and Technical Assistance. The Office assisted States in building their capacity in a variety 
</p>
<p>of areas to allow follow-up, placing emphasis on support for inter-institutional structures, 
</p>
<p>the elaboration of implementation plans and the establishment of tracking systems to 
</p>
<p>monitor implementation. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/25/63. </p>


<p>29. OHCHR supported the United Nations country teams in integrating 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by human rights mechanisms into their programmatic work. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Humanitarian funds  
</b></p>
<p>30.  At its thirty-ninth session, the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Fund for Victims of Torture spelled out the objectives of a renewed strategy and funding 
</p>
<p>that would enable it to respond with better emergency assistance for victims.3 The new 
</p>
<p>vision is characterized by a universal victim-centred approach and impartial outreach, and 
</p>
<p>strives to respond in a fairer manner to both new and long-term needs, and to distribute 
</p>
<p>resources more evenly among all United Nations regions. In 2014, the Fund supported 270 
</p>
<p>projects for a total amount of $7.2 million.  
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR also administers the United Nations Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of 
</p>
<p>Slavery and the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture. In 2014, the Trust Fund supported 35 projects for a total amount of 
</p>
<p>$400,000, whereas the Special Fund disbursed seven grants for a total amount of $232,000. 
</p>
<p>The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples supported the participation of 
</p>
<p>170 representatives of indigenous peoples in human rights mechanisms and in the World 
</p>
<p>Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Progressive development of international law 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Office supported initiatives organized by intergovernmental bodies, the special 
</p>
<p>procedures and the treaty bodies. For example, in the context of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>work continued on a draft declaration on the rights of peasants and people working in rural 
</p>
<p>areas; and in the context of the General Assembly, the Office, jointly with the Department 
</p>
<p>of Economic and Social Affairs, facilitated the fifth session of the Open-ended Working 
</p>
<p>Group on Ageing. 
</p>
<p>33. In the context of the special procedures, the Office supported work on, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone 
</p>
<p>deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before court; and the draft basic 
</p>
<p>principles on the right to effective remedies for trafficked persons. The treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>adopted new general comments and recommendations: for example, the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted general comments on equal recognition before 
</p>
<p>the law4 and on accessibility;5 the Human Rights Committee, on liberty and security of 
</p>
<p>person;6 the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women adopted a joint general recommendation/comment on 
</p>
<p>harmful practices,7 and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women adopted a general recommendation on gender-related dimensions of refugee status, 
</p>
<p>asylum, nationality and statelessness of women.8

<p><b> B. Enhancing equality and countering discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Office assisted Governments in relation to legislation and national plans of 
</p>
<p>action, in increasing awareness and developing the capacity of national actors to address 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and by providing forums 
</p>
<p>for addressing contemporary manifestations of racism.  
</p>
<p>35. Substantive support was provided for the work of the four Durban follow-up 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. I am pleased to note that the international community is converging on ways 
</p>
<p>forward, particularly in combating racism in sports and strengthening the procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. OHCHR also actively contributed 
</p>
<p>to the preparation of the International Decade for People of African Descent commencing 
</p>
<p>in 2015. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR pursued its work on issues relating to freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to the prohibition of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>Follow-up to the Rabat Plan of Action and the implementation of Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 16/18 and 22/31 focused on practical steps at the international and national 
</p>
<p>levels. Events aimed at specific stakeholder groups were organized in Belarus, Jordan, the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation and Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>37. OHCHR embarked on concrete activities to counter the negative and discriminatory 
</p>
<p>perception of migrants. In collaboration with United Nations partners, it is preparing a 
</p>
<p>publication and audiovisual material exploring the human rights challenges faced by 
</p>
<p>migrant domestic workers in an irregular situation. 
</p>
<p>38. In the field, OHCHR assisted the Government of Mauritania in the development and 
</p>
<p>adoption of a road map to address the vestiges of slavery; in Honduras, a human rights 
</p>
<p>advisory team supported the Government in organizing consultations and in drafting a 
</p>
<p>national policy against racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Discrimination on the basis of indigenous or minority status 
</b></p>
<p>39. Conflicts, ranging from those in the Central African Republic to Iraq, have 
</p>
<p>demonstrated how minorities are often the main victims of violence. Stepping up system-
</p>
<p>wide work to combat racial discrimination and to protect minorities is an imperative of 
</p>
<p>human rights and conflict prevention. A key tool in this regard is the guidance note 
</p>
<p>prepared by the United Nations network on racial discrimination and protection of 
</p>
<p>minorities and approved by the Secretary-General. OHCHR provided support to 
</p>
<p>Governments and minority representatives aimed at strengthening legislation on minority 
</p>
<p>rights and addressing key concerns ranging from the protection of religious minorities from 
</p>
<p>violence to advancing the housing rights of Roma. 
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR strengthened its work to protect the rights of indigenous peoples, including 
</p>
<p>in relation to &#8220;development&#8221; projects pursued without their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent. It contributed to the first World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held in 
</p>
<p>September 2014, the results of which gave new impetus to this work. The Conference 
</p>
<p>showed that the close involvement of the persons and groups affected is critical to 
</p>
<p>successful development, and called for improved implementation of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. OHCHR also issued new practical tools to 
</p>
<p>advance the implementation of the Declaration, and continued its indigenous and minority 
</p>
<p>fellowship programme.  </p>


<p><b> 3. Discrimination on the basis of sex 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Office strove to strengthen the capacity of women&#8217;s human rights defenders to 
</p>
<p>monitor instances of gender-based discrimination and participate in the development of 
</p>
<p>public policies to promote women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality (for example, in 
</p>
<p>Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Mali, Senegal and the Sudan (Darfur)). In 
</p>
<p>South-East Asia, OHCHR supported the exchange of experiences among human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders promoting women&#8217;s access to land and productive resources, and published a 
</p>
<p>handbook on the subject with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
</p>
<p>Empowerment of Women (UN-Women).  
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR led efforts to implement its technical guidance on the application of a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity.9 In Malawi, this resulted in an ongoing 
</p>
<p>dialogue between the Government, national stakeholders and the United Nations to 
</p>
<p>examine policies and processes against human rights requirements. In Uganda, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>undertook a comprehensive human rights assessment on maternal and child health. In 
</p>
<p>Mexico, it contributed to the work of a coalition of organizations working at the State level 
</p>
<p>in Jalisco to apply the technical guidance.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Discrimination on the basis of disability 
</b></p>
<p>43. The thematic study on the right of persons with disabilities to education prepared by 
</p>
<p>the Office10 and resolution 25/20 subsequently adopted by the Human Rights Council were 
</p>
<p>instrumental to OHCHR advocacy and technical assistance. The Office played a key role in 
</p>
<p>ensuring that the rights of persons with disabilities were mainstreamed in the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda.  
</p>
<p>44. In October 2014, the OHCHR Regional Office for Europe held its fifth annual event 
</p>
<p>on the rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities. The event provided for bridge-
</p>
<p>building between stakeholders and served as a powerful advocacy platform for the rights 
</p>
<p>and obligations contained in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>45. In the Republic of Moldova, OHCHR continued to support the Government&#8217;s efforts 
</p>
<p>to amend relevant laws and practices in order to implement the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities, in particular with regard to equal recognition before the law, and 
</p>
<p>was instrumental in enabling a number of children with disabilities to enrol in mainstream 
</p>
<p>schools or kindergartens. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Office documented widespread human rights abuses targeting individuals 
</p>
<p>because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. While welcoming the steps taken by 
</p>
<p>many States to address such abuses, concerns remain at attempts made in several States to 
</p>
<p>establish or expand discriminatory legislation in this regard, as well as at the increasing 
</p>
<p>number of attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons and those 
</p>
<p>who speak up in their defence. 
</p>
<p>47. OHCHR continued to engage with Governments and other stakeholders to advance 
</p>
<p>human rights protection for members of the LGBT community, and supported the efforts of 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights mechanisms to the same end. In Ecuador, for example, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR provided technical assistance for an interministerial task force on the rights of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See A/HRC/21/22. 
</p>
<p> 10 A/HRC/25/29. </p>


<p>LGBT persons. In Cambodia, the Office and the United Nations Development Programme 
</p>
<p>jointly organized the country&#8217;s first national conference on the rights of LGBT persons. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR field presences also supported the investigation of allegations of discrimination 
</p>
<p>and violence against LGBT persons and conducted training for civil society on monitoring 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p>48. In 2013, OHCHR launched the Free and Equal campaign, a global United Nations 
</p>
<p>public information campaign designed to promote greater respect for the rights of LGBT 
</p>
<p>persons. Over the past year, the campaign reached more than a billion people and attracted 
</p>
<p>support from leading public figures and celebrities around the world.  
</p>
<p>49. In September 2014, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 27/32 on human 
</p>
<p>rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, in which it reiterated its grave concern at acts 
</p>
<p>of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and 
</p>
<p>requested the High Commissioner to update the previous relevant report11 with a view to 
</p>
<p>sharing good practices. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Combating impunity and strengthening accountability and the rule of 
</b></p>
<p><b>law 
</b></p>
<p>50. Ongoing and new conflicts and natural disasters have highlighted the immense, 
</p>
<p>persistent challenges faced by States in preventing acts of violence and safeguarding the 
</p>
<p>security of those within their jurisdiction. In the wake of these threats to security, some 
</p>
<p>States have rushed to adopt emergency legislation, modify detention policies, revise 
</p>
<p>criminal justice rules and practices and impose limitations to freedoms of expression and 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p>51. OHCHR continued to address complex legal and policy challenges related to these 
</p>
<p>issues, including new technologies. It partnered with the United Nations University in a 
</p>
<p>research project on the application of international human rights law to national regimes 
</p>
<p>overseeing governmental digital surveillance. It also launched an open consultation on the 
</p>
<p>right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance. Drawing on 
</p>
<p>these activities, the Office presented a report to the Human Rights Council and the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly on the right to privacy in the digital age,12 in which it examined the protection 
</p>
<p>afforded to privacy by international human rights law. The issues raised in the report were 
</p>
<p>the subject of a panel discussion on the right to privacy in the digital age held during the 
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh session of the Council.13 
</p>
<p>52. As an active member of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task 
</p>
<p>Force, OHCHR continued to co-chair the Task Force Working Group on Promoting and 
</p>
<p>Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law while Countering Terrorism. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group implements a long-term project on training and capacity-building for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials on human rights, the rule of law and prevention of terrorism, and 
</p>
<p>produced a series of practical basic human rights reference guides. 
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR advanced the global debate on a moratorium on the death penalty, aiming 
</p>
<p>at its abolition. In cooperation with the Governments of Chile, Italy and the Philippines, it 
</p>
<p>organized three global events on the theme &#8220;Moving away from the death penalty&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>regional meetings in Algeria and Indonesia, focusing on deterrence and public opinion, 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practices in the use of the death penalty, and best practices and challenges in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 A/HRC/19/41. 
</p>
<p> 12 A/HRC/27/37. 
</p>
<p> 13 See A/HRC/28/39. </p>


<p>the implementation of a moratorium. OHCHR launched a publication on the topic during a 
</p>
<p>high-level panel discussion at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly,14 with the 
</p>
<p>participation of the Heads of State of Mongolia and Tunisia, the Prime Minister of Italy and 
</p>
<p>a representative of the President of Benin. OHCHR furthermore published a report on the 
</p>
<p>death penalty in Iraq.15  
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR advocated for respect for international human rights standards in cases of 
</p>
<p>individuals facing the death penalty and for the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which contributed to positive 
</p>
<p>developments: Myanmar announced the presidential commutation of all death sentences to 
</p>
<p>life imprisonment; the judiciary in India continued to commute death sentences to lesser 
</p>
<p>punishments; Thailand announced a policy on abolition; Equatorial Guinea introduced a 
</p>
<p>temporary moratorium; Nigeria reconfirmed continuation of the federal moratorium; the 
</p>
<p>United States of America commenced an executive review of execution procedures; 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan announced a review of all death penalty cases; and El Salvador, Gabon and 
</p>
<p>Poland ratified or acceded to the Second Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>55. OHCHR supported the design, establishment and functioning of transitional justice 
</p>
<p>processes from a human rights perspective in more than 25 States. It provided assistance to 
</p>
<p>the truth commissions in Tunisia and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and prepared commentaries on related 
</p>
<p>legislation in Nepal and Mali. The focus remained on ensuring that the rights of victims are 
</p>
<p>central in these processes and that gender considerations are taken into account. These 
</p>
<p>concerns are reflected in the analytical study focusing on gender-based and sexual violence 
</p>
<p>in relation to transitional justice.16 Together with UN-Women, OHCHR led the process of 
</p>
<p>drafting the guidance note of the Secretary-General on reparations for conflict-related 
</p>
<p>sexual violence.17  
</p>
<p>56. OHCHR contributed to strengthening national capacities to protect victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses of serious crimes under international law. It deployed an international expert to 
</p>
<p>Uganda and the Sudan (Darfur) to support the authorities in the establishment of national 
</p>
<p>witness protection programmes and measures.  
</p>
<p>57. OHCHR advised States &#8211; including Grenada, Liberia, Myanmar, Thailand, Trinidad 
</p>
<p>and Tobago and Tunisia &#8211; in the revision of their Constitution or in the development of a 
</p>
<p>new one, to ensure compliance with the highest standards of promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights.  
</p>
<p>58. Supporting efforts to strengthen the administration of justice remains a priority for 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, focusing on the independence of the judiciary and the protection of persons 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty. OHCHR supported the Ombudsman Commission of Papua New 
</p>
<p>Guinea to strengthen its monitoring of places of detention; in Malaysia, it supported the 
</p>
<p>national human rights commission in its work on detention, deaths in custody and 
</p>
<p>accountability of the police; in Mozambique, the national human rights institution 
</p>
<p>conducted its first systematic monitoring of prisons and detention centre thanks to capacity-
</p>
<p>building conducted by the OHCHR Regional Office for Southern Africa; in Kazakhstan, the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia provided technical advice to the newly

<p>established national preventive mechanism; and in Tajikistan, the joint advocacy of the 
</p>
<p>Office and the Ombudsman and civil society led to the establishment of a pilot mechanism 
</p>
<p>to monitor closed institutions.  
</p>
<p>59. OHCHR pursued its involvement in the ongoing review process of the Standard 
</p>
<p>Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and organized a workshop on traditional 
</p>
<p>justice and an expert consultation on military justice. 
</p>
<p>60. In Mexico, OHCHR provided advice on the revision of the military justice code. In 
</p>
<p>Guatemala, it put in place a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the national capacity to 
</p>
<p>fight impunity. Its continued support for the justice sector resulted in an increased 
</p>
<p>application of international human rights standards in judicial resolutions. Through regional 
</p>
<p>judicial roundtables held throughout Cambodia, OHCHR convened judges, prosecutors, 
</p>
<p>lawyers, court clerks and prison and police officials to foster cooperation and improve the 
</p>
<p>delivery of justice. 
</p>
<p>61. As part of ongoing efforts to assist States and other relevant stakeholders to ensure 
</p>
<p>human rights-based governance of migration at international borders, OHCHR released its 
</p>
<p>recommended principles and guidelines on human rights at international borders,18 which 
</p>
<p>translate the international human rights framework into practical border governance 
</p>
<p>measures.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Integrating human rights in development and the economic sphere 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights in development 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Office contributed to ensuring that human rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development, are fully integrated into the Sustainable Development Goals and the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development agenda so that, unlike the Millennium Development Goals, the new 
</p>
<p>global agenda for development is closely aligned with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR efforts included engaging with Member States during the negotiations of the Open 
</p>
<p>Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, organizing high-level events and 
</p>
<p>contributing technical input to United Nations interagency mechanisms supporting the 
</p>
<p>negotiations of Member States. OHCHR consistently called for human rights to be 
</p>
<p>mainstreamed across all goals, targets and indicators and for a universal, balanced 
</p>
<p>framework ensuring freedom from fear and from want for all, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>63. I am encouraged that the outcome document of the Open Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals19 reflects the above-mentioned human rights imperative, 
</p>
<p>and OHCHR will work to preserve these gains while addressing gaps and promoting strong 
</p>
<p>accountability architecture and human rights indicators. 
</p>
<p>64. OHCHR promoted a human rights-based approach to data collection in discussions 
</p>
<p>on the post-2015development agenda. It assisted several States, including C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>Egypt, Morocco and Togo, in integrating human rights indicators into the formulation and 
</p>
<p>impact assessments of national development policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>65. Efforts to integrate human rights into development and the economic sphere also 
</p>
<p>included developing human rights impact assessments, which can be effective in 
</p>
<p>identifying, quantifying and evaluating the ways that trade and investment have an impact 
</p>
<p>on the full spectrum of human rights.

<p>66. OHCHR engaged intensively with the United Nations development system, within 
</p>
<p>the framework of the United Nations Development Group, to mainstream human rights into 
</p>
<p>the system&#8217;s &#8220;fitness for the purpose&#8221; for a transformative post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR chairs the United Nations Development Group -Human Rights Working Group 
</p>
<p>(formerly the Human Rights Mechanism), which promotes interagency policy coherence 
</p>
<p>and joint advocacy, and provides concrete support to resident coordinators and United 
</p>
<p>Nations country teams, including in the context of the Human Rights Up Front initiative, 
</p>
<p>facilitating system-wide sharing of good practices and more systematic engagement with 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Global economic and social issues 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Office enhanced its work on the protection of human rights in economic and 
</p>
<p>social issues, including in the governance of land, the response to the Ebola outbreak and in 
</p>
<p>the context of recent political, economic and social crises. In the report for 2014 submitted 
</p>
<p>to the Economic and Social Council,20 the High Commissioner analysed human rights 
</p>
<p>norms applicable to land.  
</p>
<p>68. With regard to the Ebola outbreak, OHCHR provided an analysis of the human 
</p>
<p>rights dimension, including in terms of responses to the epidemic. Field presences in the 
</p>
<p>countries most affected monitored the human rights impact of the outbreak and promoted 
</p>
<p>integrating human rights into responses.  
</p>
<p>69. In September 2014, OHCHR, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, 
</p>
<p>issued technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate preventable mortality 
</p>
<p>and morbidity of children under 5 years of age.21 The guidance, which will be piloted in 
</p>
<p>selected countries, contains advice on legislation, coordination, planning, budgeting, 
</p>
<p>implementation and international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>70. OHCHR launched an ambitious process aimed at developing a fairer, more effective 
</p>
<p>system of domestic law remedies in cases of gross human rights abuse involving business 
</p>
<p>enterprises with a view to supporting effective implementation of the Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights. An expert study commissioned by OHCHR concluded that the 
</p>
<p>present system of domestic law remedies is patchy, unpredictable, often ineffective and 
</p>
<p>fragile. OHCHR continued efforts to enhance broad implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles, including through stakeholder capacity-building and the development of tools 
</p>
<p>and guidance documents. 
</p>
<p>71. The report of the Secretary-General on the question of the realization of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights in all countries submitted to the Human Rights Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-fifth session22 contained an analysis of access to justice in relation to violations of 
</p>
<p>those rights. OHCHR also worked on the human rights implications of austerity measures 
</p>
<p>and the right to social security. It supported the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which in 2014 was 
</p>
<p>ratified by Belgium, Cabo Verde, Costa Rica, Finland and Gabon.  
</p>
<p>72. OHCHR launched a publication on the economic, social and cultural rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants in an irregular situation that explored the legal content of these rights under the 
</p>
<p>core international instruments and the practical barriers that often prevent irregular migrants 
</p>
<p>from enjoying their rights to education, health, social security, housing, water and 
</p>

<p>sanitation, food and decent work.23 In addition, OHCHR developed a set of human rights 
</p>
<p>indicators specifically related to migrants and their families, with an initial focus on their 
</p>
<p>rights to health, education and decent work.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR conducted capacity-building in monitoring economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights in, inter alia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania and the occupied Palestinian territories, and for 
</p>
<p>the judicial protection of those rights in Guatemala, Madagascar and Montenegro, among 
</p>
<p>others. OHCHR also provided technical support on the right to food in Malawi and the right 
</p>
<p>to health in Togo. In Mexico, OHCHR increased awareness of State institutions and non-
</p>
<p>State actors about international obligations vis-&#224;-vis economic and social rights. In 
</p>
<p>Cambodia, OHCHR assisted indigenous communities in obtaining collective land titles. In 
</p>
<p>the Plurinational State of Bolivia, OHCHR supported the development of human rights 
</p>
<p>indicators on the rights to food, education, health, work and housing and the right of 
</p>
<p>women to live a life free of violence. In the Republic of Moldova, OHCHR worked with 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Health to establish an anti-discrimination commission to examine equality 
</p>
<p>issues in law, policy and practice in the health sector.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Widening the democratic space 
</b></p>
<p>74. Transparent and participative societies based on dialogue, pluralism and tolerance 
</p>
<p>exist where State and non-State actors respect the exercise of rights, including freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association and participation in public life. 
</p>
<p>The exercise of these freedoms is fundamental to fostering dialogue, upholding the rule of 
</p>
<p>law and democracy. 
</p>
<p>75. To commemorate the 20-year review of the implementation of the Beijing 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Platform for Action, OHCHR launched a campaign to give visibility and 
</p>
<p>legitimacy to the work of women human rights defenders, comprising 12 videos to be 
</p>
<p>released via social media on the 12 areas of concern of the Beijing Platform for Action. The 
</p>
<p>OHCHR Regional Office for Central Africa created a regional platform on women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>political participation in the region. In Cambodia, OHCHR organized a workshop for 
</p>
<p>women human rights defenders from the Asia-Pacific region. 
</p>
<p>76. OHCHR conducted human rights training for independent electoral commissions, 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians, civil society actors and media professionals ahead of local elections 
</p>
<p>planned in several African countries between 2014 and 2017. In Thailand, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>monitored human rights in relation to the demonstrations and elections and conducted a 
</p>
<p>human rights analysis of the 2014 interim Constitution, including on issues related to 
</p>
<p>participation in the conduct of public affairs. In Chile, it developed a compilation of 
</p>
<p>national, regional and international standards relating to peaceful protests.  
</p>
<p>77. Pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 24/116, OHCHR organized an expert 
</p>
<p>panel discussion on the safety of journalists at the twenty-sixth session of the Council. It 
</p>
<p>compiled good practices on the protection of journalists, the prevention of attacks 
</p>
<p>committed against them and the fight against impunity for such attacks.24 It also contributed 
</p>
<p>to the first report of the Secretary-General on the safety of journalists and the issue of 
</p>
<p>impunity.25 Together with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization and the Council of Europe, OHCHR co-hosted the third United Nations inter-

<p>agency meeting on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity, at which the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity was reviewed. 
</p>
<p>78. In the field, OHCHR worked with national-level actors to address the human rights 
</p>
<p>issues most relevant to journalists. In Madagascar, it organized a workshop with the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Communication to develop a draft media code; in Guatemala, it provided the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior with technical assistance to establish a protection mechanism for 
</p>
<p>journalists. In Togo, OHCHR organized a workshop to promote the professionalization of 
</p>
<p>the media. In Mexico, it enhanced the capacity of the national protection mechanism to 
</p>
<p>protect human rights defenders and journalists, and provided the authorities with technical 
</p>
<p>advice on providing protection in several documented and monitored cases. The OHCHR 
</p>
<p>Regional Office for West Africa launched a training project for journalists on human rights 
</p>
<p>and human rights reporting and to promote networking among journalists working on 
</p>
<p>human rights. The OHCHR Regional Office for the Middle East, together with OHCHR 
</p>
<p>Tunisia, organized a workshop to build the capacity of civil society actors and journalists to 
</p>
<p>prevent incitement to hatred, using international human rights norms and mechanisms on 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>79. Furthermore, OHCHR field presences strengthened relations with authorities to 
</p>
<p>ensure timely responses to cases and allegations of threats against human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>(in Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico); conducted outreach and training for civil society 
</p>
<p>actors on protection mechanisms (in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
</p>
<p>Guatemala and Mexico); launched public information campaigns, including radio 
</p>
<p>programmes (in Colombia); developed a mentoring scheme for civil society actors (in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo); implemented a protection coordination mechanism of 
</p>
<p>relevant international actors (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo); and strengthened 
</p>
<p>the capacity of civil society organizations in remote regions (in Tajikistan).  
</p>
<p>80. OHCHR provided advisory services on developing human rights education, training 
</p>
<p>policies and curricula (in, inter alia, Colombia, Honduras, the Niger, Timor-Leste and 
</p>
<p>Togo); held introductory workshops for women leaders on human rights and the use of 
</p>
<p>national, regional and international mechanisms to protect women&#8217;s rights (in Madagascar); 
</p>
<p>and translated and disseminated human rights training materials into local languages, and 
</p>
<p>organized a summer school on human rights for lawyers and civil society representatives 
</p>
<p>(in Georgia). 
</p>
<p>81. OHCHR provided advice and support for the establishment of national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions in a number of countries, including Angola, Benin, Botswana, Comoros, the 
</p>
<p>Gambia, Guatemala, Guinea, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Vanuatu and 
</p>
<p>Zimbabwe. Activities in support of national human rights institutions included the 
</p>
<p>identification of gaps in practices and provision of recommendations; support in monitoring 
</p>
<p>cases; training workshops for institution staff on human rights standards and the Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles, handling complaints, and monitoring and investigations; convening consultation 
</p>
<p>meetings of institutions on strategic plans with civil society; joint advocacy on conditions 
</p>
<p>in detention; and the publication of a booklet on obligations of institution members. 
</p>
<p>82. Pursuant to Human Rights Council 24/21, OHCHR organized a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>the importance of the promotion and protection of civil society space at the twenty-fifth 
</p>
<p>session of the Council.26 OHCHR developed procedures to handle allegations of reprisals 
</p>
<p>arising in the context of Human Rights Council meetings, including with respect to 
</p>
<p>recording of incidents. It organized regular briefings of non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>with the President and the Secretariat to follow up on issues related to reprisals and to

<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 See A/HRC/27/33. </p>


<p>exchange good practices and lessons learned. The Office also developed a practical guide 
</p>
<p>for civil society actors entitled &#8220;Civil society space and the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>system&#8221;.27  
</p>
<p>83. All field presences work closely with, and build the capacity of, various civil society 
</p>
<p>actors. The Regional Office for South-East Asia monitored cases of reprisals against human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders and facilitated networking of civil society actors for human rights 
</p>
<p>protection. In Burundi, the Human Rights and Justice Section of the United Nations Office 
</p>
<p>in Burundi supported the establishment of a national human rights observers&#8217; network to 
</p>
<p>monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country. In Uganda, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>conducted joint visits with civil society actors to verify allegations of threats against human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders, and held consultations with civil society actors about strategies to 
</p>
<p>advocate effectively for human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Early warning and protection of human rights in situations of conflict, 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and insecurity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of human rights during violence and conflict  
</b></p>
<p>84. The past year saw increased levels of demand for OHCHR engagement in 
</p>
<p>emergency responses, to support commissions of inquiry or to conduct investigations. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR continued to support or established five commissions of inquiry mandated by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council or the Security Council, and initiated investigations on human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in Sri Lanka and Iraq pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in March 2014, OHCHR deployed a human rights monitoring mission to 
</p>
<p>Ukraine, which as at November had issued eight public reports.  
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR gave regular input for briefings of the Security Council expert group on the 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians in armed conflict, and also provided expertise to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>(MINUSCA), the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in 
</p>
<p>Mali, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, the African Union-United Nations 
</p>
<p>Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the United Nations Mission in Liberia in the 
</p>
<p>development or revision of their strategies and operations for the protection of civilians.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Early warning and preventive action 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Office has become increasingly engaged in the implementation of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Up Front plan of action, which seeks to ensure that the United Nations is aware of 
</p>
<p>potential or emerging human rights crisis situations at the earliest stage, promptly deploys 
</p>
<p>the required resources on the ground to respond and takes preventive action. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>continued to build deployable human rights capacity to meet these needs by expanding its 
</p>
<p>internal and external rapid response roster capacity. 
</p>
<p>87. In terms of early warning, OHCHR pays special attention to violations of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights. Gross and systematic violations can lead to inequality, compound 
</p>
<p>the impact of natural disasters and contribute to triggering social protest, unrest and 
</p>
<p>conflict. OHCHR will therefore continue its work on violations of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights during and after crises, in particular with regard to the protection of the rights 
</p>
<p>to health and to education in situations of conflict.

<p>88. OHCHR was engaged in mediation processes to defuse tensions between authorities 
</p>
<p>and communities; for instance, in Colombia, it participated in several negotiation platforms, 
</p>
<p>at the national and local levels, contributing to peacebuilding and to upholding the rights 
</p>
<p>claimed by social movements.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Human rights, peace and security 
</b></p>
<p>89. Engagement with the Security Council has significantly increased in the past three 
</p>
<p>years. OHCHR thematic and country briefings continued to have a clear focus on 
</p>
<p>prevention and accountability. They helped to shape the response of the Organization to 
</p>
<p>crises, highlighted human rights protection challenges, provided early warning signals and 
</p>
<p>proposed actions. During the period under review, my predecessor briefed the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in a general debate on conflict prevention, and on a number of country situations, 
</p>
<p>in particular in the Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic. I also briefed the Council for the first time in November on the situation in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary-General briefed the Council on Burundi, South Sudan and Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>90. OHCHR worked to enhance the response of the United Nations to the protection 
</p>
<p>crisis in the Central African Republic, and to ensure that protection of human rights was at 
</p>
<p>the core of the MINUSCA mandate. OHCHR supported the deployment of human rights 
</p>
<p>protection and monitoring capacity during the start-up phase of the operation in parallel to 
</p>
<p>planning for a full-fledged human rights component. To support the transition from the 
</p>
<p>African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA) to 
</p>
<p>MINUSCA, OHCHR, alongside the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, trained 
</p>
<p>MISCA contingents on human rights and the protection of civilians. OHCHR also 
</p>
<p>supported UNAMID and the Department in the streamlining of mandated activities. It 
</p>
<p>participated in the strategic review for the revaluation of the United Nations Organization 
</p>
<p>Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), and engaged 
</p>
<p>in the civilian staffing reviews exercise led by the Department of Field Support mandated 
</p>
<p>by Member States for the human rights components of MONUSCO, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Assistance Mission for Iraq and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>91. Based on its experience in integrating human rights into peace and security, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>held a consultative meeting with the Commission of the African Union to identify areas for 
</p>
<p>OHCHR potential support to strengthen human rights integration into African Union peace 
</p>
<p>support operations, including through integration within the United Nations Office to the 
</p>
<p>African Union. OHCHR was also actively involved in the lessons learned exercise on 
</p>
<p>transitions from the African Union peace operations to United Nations peacekeeping 
</p>
<p>operations in the Central African Republic and in Mali, as requested by the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in its resolution 2167 (2014). OHCHR will also engage with the High-level 
</p>
<p>Independent Panel on Peace Operations with a view to advocating for a strengthened role of 
</p>
<p>human rights within peace missions. 
</p>
<p>92. OHCHR supported the implementation of the human rights due diligence policy on 
</p>
<p>United Nations support to non-United Nations security forces, advising United Nations 
</p>
<p>peace missions, United Nations country teams and individual United Nations entities on 
</p>
<p>developing procedures and risk assessments and facilitating lessons learned exercises. The 
</p>
<p>policy effectively allowed principled and effective engagement in situations where the risk 
</p>
<p>of serious human rights violations by regional and national security forces with which the 
</p>
<p>United Nations was partnering was high. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Humanitarian action 
</b></p>
<p>93. OHCHR strengthened its engagement in humanitarian action. It remained engaged 
</p>
<p>with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, particularly with regard to the implementation 
</p>
<p>of its transformative agenda and the handling of level-3 crises. The contribution of OHCHR </p>


<p>to the revision of the Committee&#8217;s terms of reference led to the inclusion of the protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights of persons in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>as an overall objective and principle of the Committee. OHCHR focused on supporting 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Committee&#8217;s protection priority, particularly through its co-chair 
</p>
<p>role, with the task team of the Global Protection Cluster responsible for facilitating said 
</p>
<p>priority.  
</p>
<p>94. In the past year, OHCHR placed 26 human rights officers at the disposal of the inter-
</p>
<p>agency rapid response mechanism to strengthen the operational protection capacity of the 
</p>
<p>system to respond to major crises.  
</p>
<p>95. OHCHR rapid and surge deployments in the context of humanitarian action 
</p>
<p>increased. Missions were dispatched to the Philippines, following typhoon Haiyan; to the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic, in the context of the declaration of the level-3 crisis; to Gaza, 
</p>
<p>following the July crisis; to Ukraine, to support the role of OHCHR as co-chair of the 
</p>
<p>protection sector; and to Mauritania, to support the lead role of OHCHR in the protection 
</p>
<p>sector. OHCHR also took the leadership of two regional protection clusters in the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, and had overall leadership of the 
</p>
<p>protection cluster in Liberia in the context of the Ebola crisis &#8211; in addition to maintaining 
</p>
<p>this role in Haiti, Palestine, Mauritania and the Pacific (as co-lead).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking and related exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>96. Global guidance was developed to promote accountability for sexual and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, followed by concrete activities in the field. In June, the guidance note of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on reparations for victims of conflict-related sexual violence, developed 
</p>
<p>jointly by OHCHR and UN-Women, was launched (see para. 55 above). The 
</p>
<p>implementation of the note was promoted in a number of contexts and resulted in 
</p>
<p>legislative revision (in Kosovo),28 the introduction of a specific reparation programme (in 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Moldova) and pilot assistance programmes for victims (in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo).  
</p>
<p>97. In addition, a protocol for the investigation of gender-motivated killings of women 
</p>
<p>was launched in Latin America and widely disseminated within the region. The protocol 
</p>
<p>aims at providing prosecutors, judges, police officers and forensic experts with practical 
</p>
<p>guidance for investigation and complying with due diligence standards.  
</p>
<p>98. OHCHR launched a study on wrongful gender stereotyping by the judiciary in cases 
</p>
<p>of sexual and gender-based violence. OHCHR Guatemala presented the study to the judicial 
</p>
<p>school, which agreed on a project to review judgements of ordinary and specialized courts 
</p>
<p>and to integrate the issue of gender stereotypes into the curriculum of the judiciary. In the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Moldova, OHCHR supported a process to review prosecutorial guidance in 
</p>
<p>cases of rape, to address harmful gender stereotypes and to ensure objective investigations. 
</p>
<p>99. In Kosovo, OHCHR worked towards the increased and meaningful participation of 
</p>
<p>women in public processes, in particular those related to sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR also supported the implementation of the recommendations of its report on 
</p>
<p>reparations for survivors of sexual violence related to armed conflict.29 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 All references to Kosovo in the present report should be understood to be in full 
</p>
<p>compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), without prejudice to the 
</p>
<p>status of Kosovo.

</i></p>
<p><i>related to the Armed Conflict in Kosovo</i> (Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, OHCHR Stand-alone 
</p>
<p>Office in Kosovo, 2013). </p>


<p>100. OHCHR strengthened the capacity of human rights components of peace missions 
</p>
<p>and fact-finding bodies to investigate sexual and gender-based violence. The three-day 
</p>
<p>training on investigating conflict-related sexual violence was delivered in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo and the Sudan (Darfur).  
</p>
<p>101. In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, a committee of national experts on conflict-related sexual violence, 
</p>
<p>supported by the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>examined several cases of conflict-related sexual violence transmitted by legal aid clinics in 
</p>
<p>order to ensure corrective and judicial measures. The committee was established to 
</p>
<p>elaborate a plan of action to sensitize members of the armed forces and the population on 
</p>
<p>the prevention of and responses to sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>102. OHCHR provided States and civil society actors with technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity development on trafficking and human rights. It supported regional and inter-
</p>
<p>agency frameworks on trafficking, and continued to raise awareness of linkages between 
</p>
<p>trafficking and human rights. 
</p>
<p>103. OHCHR, as co-lead entity of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual 
</p>
<p>Violence in Conflict under Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), continued to provide 
</p>
<p>technical advice and capacity-building assistance to national authorities in addressing 
</p>
<p>accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. Support was provided to the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, 
</p>
<p>Liberia, Somalia and South Sudan.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> Under its overall mandate, OHCHR continued to provide substantive support 
</b></p>
<p><b>to human rights mechanisms with a view to maximizing their efficiency and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness, their responsiveness to all human rights violations and their capacity to 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist States in fulfilling their human rights obligations. OHCHR worked energetically 
</b></p>
<p><b>to fulfil all mandates received from the relevant intergovernmental bodies and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide valuable advice to various stakeholders on a wide array of issues. The Office 
</b></p>
<p><b>delivered a considerable number of technical assistance activities upon the request of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Member States. OHCHR continued its efforts to mainstream human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout the work of the United Nations, including in peace operations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>development and humanitarian action.  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b>  Human rights must be at the core of the work of the United Nations as a whole 
</b></p>
<p><b>and become a full and integral pillar of the Organization. This is supported by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Up Front initiative, designed to strengthen prevention and response in 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations where people are at risk of, or are subject to, violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights or humanitarian law. So very often, at the root of the crises confronted 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the United Nations, we find a complex web of violations of economic, civil, cultural, 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and social rights. Early and coordinated action across the full spectrum of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights would achieve our goal of prevention more effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The world needs a United Nations human rights office that is strong, resilient 
</b></p>
<p><b>and able to act quickly to prevent and respond to human rights challenges. OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p><b>must have the resources to fulfil its broad and critical mandate, including undertaking 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective prevention and delivering support to Member States seeking to overcome 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles, but also detecting and calling attention to human rights violations so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>swift, effective and relevant action may be taken. </b> </p>


<p>107. <b>In the light of the funding shortfall that OHCHR is enduring, partly due to 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandated activities not funded comprehensively by the United Nations regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>budget, the Office has been compelled to reduce the level of its activities for 2015.</b> 
</p>
