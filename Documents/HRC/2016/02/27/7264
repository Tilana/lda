<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p><i>Chair-Rapporteur</i>: Mads Andenas 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In 2014 the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, under its regular procedure, 
</p>
<p>adopted 57 opinions concerning the detention of 422 persons in 30 countries. It also 
</p>
<p>transmitted 136 urgent appeals to 48 Governments concerning 435 individuals. States 
</p>
<p>informed the Working Group that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of 
</p>
<p>detainees. In some cases, detainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>assured that the detainees concerned would be guaranteed a fair trial. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>is grateful to those Governments that heeded its appeals and that took steps to provide it 
</p>
<p>with the requested information on the situation of detainees.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it visited, in 
</p>
<p>particular in respect of its recommendations. Information on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by the Working Group was received from the Government of 
</p>
<p>El Salvador. In 2014, the Working Group visited New Zealand and undertook follow-up 
</p>
<p>visits to Germany and Italy. The reports on these visits are contained in addenda to the 
</p>
<p>present report (A/HRC/30/36/Add.2, 4 and 3, respectively). 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group is also 
</p>
<p>submitting to the Council a report containing the draft basic principles and guidelines on 
</p>
<p>remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or 
</p>
<p>detention to bring proceedings before court (A/HRC/30/37), which were adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group at its seventy-second session. The draft basic principles and guidelines are 
</p>
<p>aimed at assisting Member States in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty. The Working Group also prepared a report on national, regional and international 
</p>
<p>laws, regulations and practices on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before 
</p>
<p>court (A/HRC/27/47).  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> In the present report, the Working Group analyses issues relating to detention in the 
</p>
<p>context of drug control and to peaceful protests and arbitrary detention, and emphasizes the 
</p>
<p>need of remedies for arbitrary detention as an imperative norm of international human 
</p>
<p>rights law. In most cases, including where release is not a remedy, the individual has a right 
</p>
<p>to compensation. Domestic law cannot erect barriers that would limit this right in the form 
</p>
<p>of immunities, jurisdictional limitation, procedural hurdles or defences based on an Act of 
</p>
<p>State doctrine.  
</p>
<p> In its recommendations the Working Group requests States to enforce the protection 
</p>
<p>of every person&#8217;s right to liberty under customary international law and to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>available guarantees and safeguards are extended to cover all forms of deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty, that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer than those 
</p>
<p>prescribed by law, and that such persons are promptly brought before a judge. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends that the Human Rights Council change the title of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group to the Working Group on Arbitrary Deprivation of Liberty and that it 
</p>
<p>request the Working Group to prepare an in-depth analysis of detention as a consequence of 
</p>
<p>international and national drug policies during 2016 and a report on the principles of 
</p>
<p>legality, proportionality, necessity and appropriateness applicable to avoid arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention, during 2017.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the investigation of instances of 
</p>
<p>alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to the standards set forth in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments accepted by the 
</p>
<p>States concerned. The mandate of the Working Group was clarified and extended by the 
</p>
<p>Commission in its resolution 1997/50 to cover the issue of administrative custody of 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers and immigrants. At its sixth session, the Human Rights Council assessed 
</p>
<p>and confirmed the mandate of the Working Group (Council resolution 6/4). On 26 
</p>
<p>September 2013, in its resolution 24/7, the Council extended the Working Group&#8217;s mandate 
</p>
<p>for a further three-year period. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period 1 January&#8211;31 May 2014, the Working Group was composed of 
</p>
<p>Shaheen Sardar Ali (Pakistan), Mads Andenas (Norway), Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), 
</p>
<p>El Hadji Malick Sow (Senegal) and Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine). On 1 June 2014, 
</p>
<p>S&#232;tondji Roland Jean-Baptiste Adjovi (Benin) and Jos&#233; Antonio Guevara Berm&#250;dez 
</p>
<p>(Mexico) started their functions as members of the Working Group, replacing Mr. Sow and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Garret&#243;n, respectively. On 1 August 2014, Seong-Phil Hong (Republic of Korea) 
</p>
<p>started his functions as a member of the Working Group, replacing Ms. Ali. 
</p>
<p>3. During 2014, Mr. Andenas was the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group and 
</p>
<p>Vladimir Tochilovsky its Vice-Chair. At the seventy-second session of the Working Group, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Hong was elected as Chair-Rapporteur, Mr. Guevara Berm&#250;dez as First Vice-Chair and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Adjovi as Second Vice-Chair. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group in 2014 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the period 1 January to 31 December 2014, the Working Group held its 
</p>
<p>sixty-ninth, seventieth and seventy-first sessions. It undertook an official mission to New 
</p>
<p>Zealand, from 24 March to 7 April 2014, and two follow-up visits, one to Germany, from 
</p>
<p>12 to 14 November 2014 and one to Italy, from 7 to 9 July 2014 (see A/HRC/30/36/Add.2, 
</p>
<p>4 and 3, respectively). 
</p>
<p>5. On 24 March 2014, the Government of Nauru cancelled the visit of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group scheduled to take place from 14 to 19 April 2014, owing to &#8220;unforeseen 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8221;. The Government has not yet accepted the new visit dates proposed by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group.  
</p>
<p>6. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group adopted at 
</p>
<p>its seventy-second session the draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and 
</p>
<p>procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to 
</p>
<p>bring proceedings before court. The draft basic principles and guidelines are aimed at 
</p>
<p>assisting Member States in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty, in compliance with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh 
</p>
<p>session a report in which it compiled international, regional and national legal frameworks 
</p>
<p>on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court (A/HRC/27/47). The 
</p>
<p>report was based largely on the responses submitted by a wide range of stakeholders to a 
</p>
<p>questionnaire sent by the Working Group, in which it requested details on the treatment of 
</p>
<p>the right in the respective legal frameworks. </p>


<p>8. The Working Group is submitting to the Human Rights Council at its thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session a separate report containing the draft principles and guidelines (A/HRC/30/37). 
</p>
<p>Mr. Andenas served as the rapporteur for the draft basic principles and guidelines. 
</p>
<p>9. On 1 and 2 September 2014, the Working Group convened a global consultation in 
</p>
<p>Geneva to bring together thematic and regional experts to elaborate on the scope and 
</p>
<p>content of the right to court review of detention, and to allow stakeholders to contribute to 
</p>
<p>the development of the draft basic principles and guidelines. Fifteen regional experts 
</p>
<p>delivered presentations. Government representatives, bodies and agencies of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system, international and regional organizations, national human rights institutions, 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and academia participated actively in the event. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group used the outcome of the consultation to revise its preliminary version of the draft 
</p>
<p>basic principles and guidelines. 
</p>
<p>10. The Working Group continued to update its database (www.unwgaddatabase.org), 
</p>
<p>which was launched in 2011 to facilitate free and public access to the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>opinions on individual cases of detention. The database contains over 600 opinions, 
</p>
<p>available in English, French and Spanish, that have been adopted since the establishment of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group in 1991. The database serves as a practical research tool for victims, 
</p>
<p>lawyers, academics and others preparing cases for submission to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>11. At its seventieth session the Working Group decided to establish a task force, 
</p>
<p>composed of Mr. Tochilovsky, Mr. Adjovi and the secretary of the Working Group, to 
</p>
<p>work intersessionally to put forward suggestions for improvements to the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>procedures and working methods. The task force identified a need to improve 
</p>
<p>communication, both between the Working Group and the parties involved as well as 
</p>
<p>within the Working Group. In order to improve the transparency and availability of 
</p>
<p>information, the Working Group established an internal extranet page, in coordination with 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and 
</p>
<p>updated the Working Group&#8217;s public website. At its seventy-first session, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group decided to amend its standard questionnaire for submitting cases in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the regular communications procedure, in order to include questions related to due process 
</p>
<p>and fair trial.  
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Tochilovsky represented the Working Group at a conference entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Challenges to security and human rights in the Arab region&#8221;, which took place in Doha on 
</p>
<p>5 and 6 November 2014. Mr. Hong represented the Working Group at an expert 
</p>
<p>consultation on the administration of justice through military tribunals, held in Geneva on 
</p>
<p>24 November 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Handling of communications addressed to the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>during 2014 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communications transmitted to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>13. At its sixty-ninth, seventieth and seventy-first sessions, the Working Group adopted 
</p>
<p>a total of 57 opinions concerning more than 422 persons in 30 countries (see the table 
</p>
<p>below).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Opinions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>14. Pursuant to its methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, annex, and Corr.1), the Working 
</p>
<p>Group, in addressing its opinions to Governments, drew their attention to Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights resolutions 1997/50 and 2003/31 and Human Rights Council resolutions 6/4 
</p>
<p>and 24/7, requesting them to take account of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions and, where </p>


<p>necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived 
</p>
<p>of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of the steps they had taken. On the expiry 
</p>
<p>of a two-week deadline, the opinions were transmitted to the relevant sources.

<p>Antonio de Santiago R&#237;os was arrested in flagrant delict; and during his apprehension, the 
</p>
<p>police officers fully observed the principles of legality, lawfulness, objectivity and 
</p>

</p>
<p>response regarding the case of Varnakulasingham Arulanandam (opinion No. 48/2013 (Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka)). In its letter, the Government provided information on the reasons and 
</p>
<p>circumstances of Mr. Arulanandam&#8217;s arrest and detention and on the ongoing court 
</p>
<p>proceedings against him. It stated, inter alia, that Mr. Arulanandam had been promptly

<p>17. By letter dated 26 December 2013, the Government of Libya informed the Working 
</p>
<p>Group that opinion 41/2013 (Libya) contained a number of errors, and refuted that the 
</p>
<p>detention of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was arbitrary. The Government stated, inter alia, that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gaddafi had been investigated by the public prosecutor and charged with a number of 
</p>
<p>crimes under domestic legislation, and that the Libyan authorities were willing and capable 
</p>
<p>of trying Mr. Gaddafi, as evidenced by the case of Abdullah al-Senussi, in which the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court had determined that domestic authorities were willing and 
</p>
<p>genuinely able to investigate the case.  
</p>
<p>18. Concerning opinion 38/2013 (Cameroon) on the detention of Michel Thierry 
</p>
<p>Atangana Abega, the Government of Cameroon, by letter dated 31 January 2014, noted 
</p>
<p>with surprise that it had not been granted a deadline extension of 60 days for the submission 
</p>
<p>of its response. The State further argued that the Working Group should give proper space 
</p>
<p>for the simple, yet fundamental, principle of adversarial debate. It informed the Working 
</p>
<p>Group that Mr. Atangana was in detention for embezzlement of public funds, and that the 
</p>
<p>detention was not politically motivated. The Government expressed regret at the </p>


<p>precipitation surrounding the examination of the case, and it deplored the overall tone of the 
</p>
<p>opinion. 
</p>
<p>19. By note verbale dated 12 March 2014, the Permanent Mission of Paraguay to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Office at Geneva transmitted the additional information requested by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group in paragraph 46 of its opinion No. 31/2013 (Paraguay) on the detention of 
</p>
<p>Luc&#237;a Ag&#252;ero Romero and others. According to the information provided, the preliminary 
</p>
<p>investigation into the case concluded on 9 October 2013 and the judicial process is due to 
</p>
<p>enter the oral phase (hearings); 12 persons have been formally charged and accused and 3 
</p>
<p>persons have been released without charges. It is expected that five of the accused will 
</p>
<p>continue to be held in pretrial detention, six will be held under house arrest and one will 
</p>
<p>await the process at liberty. The Government also provided information concerning the 
</p>
<p>medical attention provided to the detainees who were on a hunger strike. 
</p>
<p>20. By letter dated 25 November 2013, the Government of Tunisia provided a late 
</p>
<p>response on the case of Jabeur Mejri (opinion No. 29/2013 (Tunisia)).  
</p>
<p>21. By letter received on 13 December 2013, the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
</p>
<p>Iran provided a late response on the case of Amir Nema Hekmati (opinion No. 28/2013 
</p>
<p>(Islamic Republic of Iran)). According to the Government, Mr. Hekmati was tried by 
</p>
<p>Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran on charges of cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>Government of the United States of America and its Central Intelligence Agency (the CIA), 
</p>
<p>to work against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Court found Mr. Hekmati 
</p>
<p>guilty of the charges and sentenced him to death. His counsel appealed the judgement and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Hekmati&#8217;s sentence was subsequently reduced to 10 years of imprisonment. His 
</p>
<p>counsel appealed the reduced sentence, but the appellate court upheld the sentence.  
</p>
<p>22. By letter dated 27 January 2014, the Government of Turkmenistan sent additional 
</p>
<p>information on the case of Gulgeldy Annaniyazov (opinion No. 22/2013 (Turkmenistan)).

</p>
<p>of another resident of Ashgabat City in July 2002 for the purpose of illegally crossing the 
</p>
<p>border to travel to the Russian Federation via Kazakhstan. When he returned to 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan in June 2008, he crossed the border without proper documents and permits. 
</p>
<p>The Government considered that the Working Group&#8217;s reasoning was incorrect, as 
</p>
<p>Mr. Annaiyazov&#8217;s case had been properly investigated and his punishment had been 
</p>
<p>determined in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>23. By letter dated 1 July 2014, the Government of Iraq provided a late response on the 
</p>
<p>case of Shawqi Ahmad Omar, explaining the judicial processes leading to Mr. Omar&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention (opinion No. 5/2014 (Iraq)). On 9 October 2014, the Government 
</p>
<p>transmitted a response to OHCHR and the Committee on Enforced Disappearances 
</p>
<p>concerning the case of Mr. Omar (opinion No. 5/2014 (Iraq)), stating that the case could not 
</p>
<p>be considered one of enforced disappearance, because Mr. Omar&#8217;s location of detention had 
</p>
<p>been identified, as mentioned in the previous communications provided by the Iraqi 
</p>
<p>authorities. 
</p>
<p>24. By letter dated 14 July 2014, the Government of the United Arab Emirates provided 
</p>
<p>a late response on the case of Khalifa Rabia Najdi (opinion No. 12/2014 (United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates)), stating that Mr. Nadji had been arrested for &#8220;committing a crime in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Article 180 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, by joining an illegal secret organization 
</p>
<p>opposing the fundamental principles underlying the ruling system and whose aim is to seize 
</p>
<p>power&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>25. By letter dated 13 August 2014, the Government of Jordan provided a late response 
</p>
<p>on the case of Hisham al Heysah and others (opinion No. 53/2013 (Jordan)). </p>

</p>
<p>Bolivia sent a late response regarding the case of Mario Francisco Tadic Astorga (opinion 
</p>
<p>No. 28/2014 (Plurinational State of Bolivia)). In its response, the Government denied all the 
</p>
<p>allegations put forward by the source, including the allegations of torture, and that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Astorga had not had access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>27. By letter dated 30 September 2014, the Government of Bahrain provided a late 
</p>
<p>response regarding the case of Jassim al-Hulaibi (opinion No. 22/2014 (Bahrain)).  
</p>
<p>28. By note verbale dated 20 February 2015, the Government of Thailand submitted a 
</p>
<p>late response regarding the case of Patiwat Saraiyaem (opinion No. 41/2014 (Thailand)). 
</p>
<p>According to the Government, the arrest and detention of Mr. Saraiyaem was in full 
</p>
<p>compliance with international norms, including relevant provisions of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr. Saraiyaem had pleaded guilty on the lese-
</p>
<p>majesty charge on 29 December 2014. If found guilty, he could seek a royal pardon from 
</p>
<p>the King, which had been granted in most lese-majesty cases.  
</p>
<p>29. Concerning opinion No. 50/2014 (United States of America and Cuba), the 
</p>
<p>Government of Cuba pointed out, in a note verbale dated 16 March 2015, that it could not 
</p>
<p>do anything to prevent the use by the Government of the United States of the Guantanamo 
</p>
<p>Bay Naval Base. Although Cuba has sovereignty over its entire national territory, the 
</p>
<p>United States exercises jurisdiction over the territory of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base 
</p>
<p>owing to its illegal occupation. The reply from the Government of Cuba regarding opinion 
</p>
<p>No. 50/2014 is reproduced as received in the annex to the present report. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government of Cuba expressed deep concern over the legal limbo that 
</p>
<p>supported ongoing violations by the Government of the United States of human rights of 
</p>
<p>inmates in the detention centre illegally established at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, 
</p>
<p>including torture and deaths in custody. 
</p>
<p><b>  4. </b>Release of subjects of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions<b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Working Group received information from Governments and sources on the 
</p>

</p>
<p>released on 26 June 2014. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 19 June 2014, magistrates in Istanbul ordered the release of 230 military officers 
</p>
<p>sentenced for plotting to overthrow the Government in the &#8220;Sledgehammer&#8221; trial, 
</p>
<p>following a Constitutional Court ruling on 18 June 2014 that their rights to a fair 
</p>
<p>trial had been violated (opinion No. 6/2013 (Turkey)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Zakaria Mohamed Ali was released on 17 March 2014 and expelled to Somalia 
</p>
<p>(opinion No. 14/2014 (Saudi Arabia)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Michael Thierry Atangana (opinion No. 38/2013 (Cameroon)) was pardoned under a 
</p>
<p>presidential decree on 24 February 2014, a few days after the opinion of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group had been made public. Mr. Atangana has regularly updated the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the enforcement of its three recommendations (release, 
</p>
<p>accountability and reparation). </p>


<p>&#8226; Yorm Bopha, the subject of opinion No. 24/2013 (Cambodia), was released on bail 
</p>
<p>on 22 November 2013. She was arrested again on 21 January 2014 along with other 
</p>
<p>human rights activists for protesting against the imprisonment of 23 persons who 
</p>
<p>had participated in a demonstration by garment factory workers. They were detained 
</p>
<p>for several hours and released after they signed a statement pledging not to 
</p>
<p>participate in illegal activities or protests in the future. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Nguyen Tien Trung, one of the individuals concerned in opinion No. 27/2012 (Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam), is a blogger who was convicted in January 2010 to seven years of 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for alleged subversion against the State. According to the information 
</p>
<p>received, Mr. Trung was released on 12 April 2014 on the basis of his good 
</p>
<p>behaviour, after having served four years in imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cu Huy Ha Vu, the subject of opinion No. 24/2011 (Viet Nam), is a prominent 
</p>
<p>human rights lawyer who was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years in April 
</p>
<p>2011 for allegedly spreading anti-government propaganda. According to the 
</p>
<p>information received, Mr. Vu was released on 5 April 2014 after having served three 
</p>
<p>years in prison, and has left for another country. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 30 September 2014, the relevant source informed the Working Group that human 
</p>
<p>rights defender Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa (opinion No. 33/2014 (Burundi)) was 
</p>
<p>conditionally released from prison on 29 September 2014 on grounds of ill health. 
</p>
<p>The court placed travel restrictions on him and he remains in hospital. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 18 October 2014, the relevant source informed the Working Group that La Ring 
</p>
<p>and Kyaw Hla Aung, subjects of opinions No. 24/2014 (Myanmar) and No. 31/2014 
</p>
<p>(Myanmar), respectively, had been released from prison on 7 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In its opinion 12/2013 (Bahrain), the Working Group found that the detention of 
</p>
<p>Nabeel Abdulrasool Rajab, a prominent Bahraini human rights defender, was 
</p>
<p>arbitrary. Upon completion of his prison sentence, he was released on 24 May 2014, 
</p>
<p>but the Court barred him from leaving the country. He is still facing the charge of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;insulting a public institution and the army&#8221; via Twitter, pursuant to article 216 of 
</p>
<p>the Bahraini Penal Code, an offence punishable by up to six years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; By note verbale dated 27 November 2014, the Government of Argentina informed 
</p>
<p>the Working Group that the High Court of C&#243;rdoba had ordered the end of the 
</p>
<p>preventive detention of Guillermo Luis Lucas, which was subject of opinion 
</p>
<p>No. 20/2013 (Argentina), and had held all the charges brought against him to be 
</p>
<p>without effect. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; By note verbale of 6 January 2015, the Government of Cuba reported that Gerardo 
</p>
<p>Hern&#225;ndez Nordelo, Ram&#243;n Labani&#241;o Salazar and Antonio Herreros Rodr&#237;guez, 
</p>
<p>held in United States federal prisons for 16 years, had been released from detention 
</p>
<p>and had arrived in Havana on 17 September 2014. The Government of Cuba 
</p>
<p>expressed gratitude to the Working Group for its efforts in finding a solution to this 
</p>
<p>case. The Working Group had declared arbitrary the detention of these three 
</p>
<p>persons, as well as the detention of Fernando Gonz&#225;lez Llort and Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez 
</p>
<p>Schweret, in its opinion No. 19/2005 (United States of America). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 6 January 2015, the relevant source informed the Working Group that Khaled El-
</p>
<p>Kazaz, one of the subjects of opinion No. 39/2013 (Egypt), had been released. The 
</p>
<p>charges brought against him had been dropped and his case had been closed. 
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group expresses its gratitude to those Governments that undertook 
</p>
<p>positive actions and released detainees that were subjects of its opinions. However, it also 
</p>
<p>expresses regret that Member States have not fully cooperated in enforcing the opinions. </p>


<p><b> 5. Requests for review of opinions adopted 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Working Group considered the requests made by the Governments concerned 
</p>
<p>for review of the following opinions: No. 39/2013 (Egypt) concerning Mohamed Mohamed 
</p>
<p>Morsi Eissa El-Ayyat and others;  No. 15/2014 (Canada), concerning Michael Mvogo, and 
</p>
<p>No. 10/2014 (Egypt), concerning Mohamed Essayed Ali Rasslan and others.  
</p>
<p>34. After carefully and closely examining the requests for review, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>decided to maintain its opinions, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Reprisal against a subject of an opinion of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Working Group expresses its concern regarding the continued detention under 
</p>
<p>house arrest of Mar&#237;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, the subject of its opinion No. 20/2010 
</p>
<p>(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), who was arrested in 2009 for ordering the conditional 
</p>
<p>release of Eligio Cede&#241;o, the subject of the Working Group&#8217;s opinion No. 10/2009 
</p>
<p>(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela). The Working Group considers the detention of 
</p>
<p>Ms. Afiuni as a measure of reprisal. It reiterates its calls upon the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to immediately release Ms. Afiuni and to provide her 
</p>
<p>with effective and adequate reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Urgent appeals  
</b></p>
<p>36. During the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>sent 136 urgent appeals to 48 Governments concerning 435 individuals. Urgent appeals 
</p>
<p>were sent to the following countries: 
</p>
<p>Bahrain (11); Burundi (1); Cambodia (2); China (11); Congo (1); Cuba (1); Cyprus 
</p>
<p>(1); Egypt (9); Eritrea (2); Ethiopia (6); Fiji (1); France (1); Gambia (1); Iran 
</p>
<p>(Islamic Republic of) (16); Iraq (1); Israel (2); Jordan (1); Kazakhstan (1); Kuwait 
</p>
<p>(1); Kyrgyzstan (1); Mexico (1); Morocco (4); Myanmar (3); Nepal (1); Niger (1); 
</p>
<p>Nigeria (1); Oman (2); Pakistan (2); Panama (1); Qatar (1); Republic of Moldova

</p>
<p>States of America (1); Uzbekistan (1); Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) (3); Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam (5); Yemen (4). 
</p>
<p>A copy of one joint urgent appeal was sent to the United Nations Resident Coordinator in 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Moldova, and one urgent appeal was transmitted to the African Union.  
</p>
<p>37. The full text of the urgent appeals can be consulted in the joint reports on 
</p>
<p>communications.1 
</p>
<p>38. In conformity with paragraphs 22 to 24 of its methods of work, the Working Group, 
</p>
<p>without prejudging whether a detention was arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the 
</p>
<p>Governments concerned to the specific case as reported, and appealed to them to take the 
</p>
<p>measures necessary to ensure that the detained persons&#8217; rights to life and to physical 
</p>
<p>integrity were respected. 
</p>
<p>39. When an appeal made reference to the critical state of health of certain persons or to 
</p>
<p>particular circumstances, such as failure to execute a court order for release, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group requested the Government concerned to take all measures necessary to have the 
</p>

</p>
<p> 1 For communications reports of the special procedures, see 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/CommunicationsreportsSP.aspx. </p>


<p>person concerned released. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group integrated into its methods of work the prescriptions of the Code of 
</p>
<p>Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council relating to 
</p>
<p>urgent appeals and has since applied them. 
</p>
<p>40. During the period under review, the Working Group also sent six letters of 
</p>
<p>allegation to Australia, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Uganda. 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group wishes to thank those Governments that heeded its appeals and 
</p>
<p>that took steps to provide it with information on the situation of the persons concerned, 
</p>
<p>especially the Governments that released those persons. In other cases, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>was assured that the detainees concerned would receive fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Requests for visits 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Working Group has been invited to visit Argentina (follow-up visit), 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, India, Japan, Libya, Malta (follow-up visit), Nauru, Spain and 
</p>
<p>the United States of America, as well as the State of Palestine.  
</p>
<p>43. As indicated in paragraph 5 above, on 24 March 2014 the Government of Nauru 
</p>
<p>cancelled the scheduled visit of the Working Group, and has yet not accepted the new 
</p>
<p>proposed dates for the visit.  
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group has also asked to visit Algeria, the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Kazakhstan, Kenya, 
</p>
<p>Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
</p>
<p>Thailand, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group has also sent requests for follow-up visits to Bahrain, China, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico Nicaragua (limited to Bluefields) and Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Follow-up to country visits  
</b></p>
<p>45. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to 
</p>
<p>address follow-up letters to the Governments of countries it had visited, requesting 
</p>
<p>information on such initiatives as the authorities might have taken to give effect to the 
</p>
<p>relevant recommendations adopted by the Working Group contained in the reports on its 
</p>
<p>country visits (see E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 36). 
</p>
<p>46. In 2014, the Working Group requested information from the Government of 
</p>
<p>El Salvador, which it had visited in 2012. The Government submitted the requested 
</p>
<p>information on 19 May 2015, that is, after the adoption of the present report. It will be 
</p>
<p>considered at the next session of the Working Group and summarized in the next annual 
</p>
<p>report. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the title of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>47. In its resolution 1991/42 establishing the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights did not define the term &#8220;detention&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. The international human rights instruments that protect the right to personal liberty 
</p>
<p>guarantee that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty. The relevant 
</p>
<p>international instruments do not always use the same terminology to refer to deprivation of </p>


<p>liberty: they may use &#8220;arrest&#8221;, &#8220;apprehension&#8221;, &#8220;detention&#8221;, &#8220;incarceration&#8221;, &#8220;prison&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;reclusion&#8221;, &#8220;custody&#8221;, &#8220;remand&#8221; and other terms.  
</p>
<p>49. These different interpretations of the term &#8220;detention&#8221; were resolved by the adoption 
</p>
<p>of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/50, in which the Commission opted for 
</p>
<p>the term &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221;. However, this change of terminology has not been 
</p>
<p>reflected in the title of the Working Group, which often leads to misinterpretation of the 
</p>
<p>mandate of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group requests the Human Rights Council to consider bringing the 
</p>
<p>name of the Working Group into line with resolution 1991/42 by revising it to the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on Arbitrary Deprivation of Liberty.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Follow-up to the joint study on secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group has continued to consider how it can contribute to the follow-up 
</p>
<p>of the joint study on secret detention (A/HRC/13/42) within its mandate. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group will also follow up on its own previous reports and opinions on secret detention and 
</p>
<p>anti-terrorism measures, taking account of subsequent developments, including the length 
</p>
<p>of detention of individuals. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prevention of imminent arbitrary deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group has continued its deliberations on the possibility of transmitting 
</p>
<p>cases to Governments in situations where an individual is at risk of being arrested pursuant 
</p>
<p>to an arrest warrant or detention order issued against him or her and where the resulting 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty is likely to be arbitrary in nature. 
</p>
<p>53. Under its methods of work, the Working Group has no mechanism to address 
</p>
<p>situations where there is sufficiently reliable information that the execution of an order of 
</p>
<p>arrest will inevitably result in arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In effect, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>currently has to wait until the arrest warrant is executed and the person is arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>deprived of his or her liberty.  
</p>
<p>54. However, a preventive mechanism might be applicable in situations where an 
</p>
<p>individual is to be arrested solely because he or she has exercised the fundamental rights or 
</p>
<p>freedoms guaranteed by international human rights law. Similarly, it could apply in 
</p>
<p>situations where an imminent arrest would clearly constitute a violation of international law 
</p>
<p>prohibiting discrimination based on national or ethnic origin, religion, political or other 
</p>
<p>opinion, gender, sexual orientation or other status, and which might result in the equality of 
</p>
<p>human rights being ignored. 
</p>
<p>55. If such a preventive mechanism was available to the Working Group, section V of 
</p>
<p>its methods of work on the urgent action procedure would apply mutatis mutandis to the 
</p>
<p>consideration of communications on imminent arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>56. As regards the action on such communications, two options can be considered: (a) if 
</p>
<p>the Working Group considered that the imminent detention was not of an arbitrary nature, it 
</p>
<p>would render an opinion to that effect, and such an opinion would not prejudge any further 
</p>
<p>consideration by the Working Group of a communication regarding the case on other 
</p>
<p>grounds provided for in the methods of work; and (b) if the Working Group considered that 
</p>
<p>the arbitrary nature of the imminent detention had been established, it would render an 
</p>
<p>opinion to that effect and make recommendations to the Government.  </p>


<p><b> III. Thematic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Detention in the context of drug control 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Drug policies and arbitrary detention 
</b></p>
<p>57. In the light of communications received and findings resulting from country visits, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group notes with concern the increasing, and in some cases, systematic, 
</p>
<p>instances of arbitrary detention as a consequence of drug control laws and policies.2 The 
</p>
<p>Working Group believes it is topical and necessary to further examine the relationship 
</p>
<p>between drug control and arbitrary detention.  
</p>
<p>58. Arbitrary detention for drug offences or use can occur across criminal and 
</p>
<p>administrative settings, particularly when procedural safeguards are absent.3 The Working 
</p>
<p>Group attaches particular importance to the fact that criminal and administrative detention 
</p>
<p>for drug control purposes has a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups, such as 
</p>
<p>women, children, minority groups and people who use drugs.4 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group has expressed its concern about the frequent use of various 
</p>
<p>forms of administrative detention that entail restrictions on fundamental rights, and 
</p>
<p>considers to be worthy of attention detention imposed as a means of controlling people who 
</p>
<p>use drugs, especially when such detentions are framed as health interventions. States have 
</p>
<p>incorporated such detention into national legislation based on perceived notions that drug 
</p>
<p>use in itself endangers the life of the person who uses, as well as the lives of others.5 This 
</p>
<p>translates into administrative drug detention justified on the basis of health grounds, which 
</p>
<p>can lead to involuntary commitment or compulsory drug treatment that is unsupported by 
</p>
<p>either international drug control conventions or international human rights law.6 The 
</p>
<p>Working Group has noted as particularly worrisome instances of arbitrary detention in 
</p>
<p>Brazil7 and East Asia8 in the context of the compulsory confinement of people who are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2  See, for example, Julie Hannah and Nahir de la Silva, &#8220;Human rights, drug control and the UN special 
</p>
<p>procedures: preventing arbitrary detention through the promotion of human rights in drug control&#8221;

<p>(International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, 2015). Available from www.hr-
dp.org/files/2015/02/02/WGAD.FINAL_.30_Jan_2015_.pdf. Of the 64 reports of the Working 
Group, including annual and country reports, 35 have made explicit reference to drug-related 
</p>
<p>practices. 
</p>
<p> 3  See, for example, E/CN.4/1998/44/Add.2, paras. 81 and 97&#8211;99 and A/HRC/27/48/Add.3, paras. 111&#8211;
</p>
<p>119. 
</p>
<p> 4 See, for example A/HRC/16/47/Add.3, A/HRC/4/40/Add.3, A/HRC/27/48/Add.3, 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2004/3/Add.3, A/HRC/10/21/Add.3, E/CN.4/2006/7 and A/HRC/27/48. 
</p>
<p> 5 See, for example, A/HRC/4/40/Add.5, para. 92, E/CN.4/1998/44/Add.2, para. 81, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3, para. 111. 
</p>
<p> 6 Nowhere in the three international drug control conventions (Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 
</p>
<p>1961; Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971; United Nations Convention against Illicit 
</p>
<p>Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988) is compulsory treatment or involuntary 
</p>
<p>commitment for drug use required, and throughout the treaties penal responses and the use of 
</p>
<p>treatment is subject to international and domestic law. For further discussion, see Hannah and de la 
</p>
<p>Silva, &#8220;Human rights, drug control&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 7 In the State of S&#227;o Paulo, compulsory confinement of addicts of crack cocaine and other drugs has 
</p>
<p>been introduced in an effort to bring users on the street into detention. At the time of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group&#8217;s visit to S&#227;o Paulo, 5,335 persons were detained in compulsory confinement. On 4 January 
</p>
<p>2013, the Governor of the State of S&#227;o Paulo announced a new regional plan to fight drug 
</p>
<p>consumption whereby crack users would be put in compulsory psychiatric confinement. To manage 
</p>
<p>confinement, a standing court was established. In a police operation in a neighborhood of S&#227;o Paulo, 
</p>
<p>more than 2,000 crack users were arrested. (See A/HRC/27/48/Add.3, paras. 113&#8211;114.)  </p>


<p>suspected of using drugs. It has been established that detention and forced labour are not 
</p>
<p>scientifically valid means to treat drug dependence.9 Compulsory detention regimes for 
</p>
<p>purposes of drug &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; through confinement or forced labour are contrary to 
</p>
<p>scientific evidence and inherently arbitrary.10 
</p>
<p>60. Drug consumption or dependence is not sufficient justification for detention. 
</p>
<p>Involuntary confinement of those who use or are suspected of using drugs should be 
</p>
<p>avoided.11  
</p>
<p>61. The Working Group is also concerned about the use of criminal detention as a 
</p>
<p>measure of drug control following charges for drug use, possession, production and 
</p>
<p>trafficking. A variety of regional and international human rights instruments establish legal 
</p>
<p>standards for detention based on criminal grounds, including minimum procedural 
</p>
<p>guarantees.
12
</p>
<p> These standards apply equally in cases of criminal detention for drug-related 
</p>
<p>offences. Criminal laws and penal measures pursued under the existing punitive system of 
</p>
<p>international drug control raise important questions of legality, proportionality, necessity 
</p>
<p>and appropriateness.13 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group has determined that pretrial detention regimes, including 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>arraigo</i>&#8221; or other forms of detention to investigate, as well as bail systems, diminish a 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s ability to challenge his or her detention; affect the presumption of innocence; and 
</p>
<p>overwhelm the justice system. Guarantees of equal protection before the law and procedural 
</p>
<p>rights to access to justice, including the exceptionality of pretrial detentions, as well as 
</p>
<p>guarantees of promptness for judicial review and court hearings to determine criminal 
</p>
<p>responsibility, must be ensured, including when individuals are detained for drug-related 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8  There are five re-education through labour centres in Shanghai, including one for women, one for drug 
</p>
<p>addicts, and three others for men. In cases of drug abuse, if it is a first offence, the person will be sent to 
</p>
<p>a rehabilitation centre. In cases of repeated drug abuse, he or she may be sent to a re-education centre. 
</p>
<p>Twenty per cent of cases are for drug-related offences (see E/CN.4/1998/44/Add.2, para. 85). See also

<p>  In a published position on compulsory detention centres in East Asia and Pacific, available from 
</p>
<p>www.unicef.org/eapro/media_18366.html, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund expressed 
concern about &#8220;the use of compulsory detention centres in some countries in the East Asia and Pacific

<p>reasons. As with any form of detention, such individuals must have judicial means to 
</p>
<p>challenge the detention.14 The Working Group has noted in particular that ongoing periodic 
</p>
<p>judicial reviews are necessary to avoid prolonged detentions.15 
</p>
<p><b> B. Peaceful protests and arbitrary detention 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group has received information and communications from different 
</p>
<p>parts of the world on the increase of detentions of persons in the context of peaceful 
</p>
<p>protests that could be considered as arbitrary in conformity with the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>methods of work. Therefore, the Working Group will consider this matter as a topic in its 
</p>
<p>work for 2017 in coordination with other special procedures of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>the regional human rights institutions and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Remedies for arbitrary detention  
</b></p>
<p>64. The duty to comply with international law rests on everyone, including domestic 
</p>
<p>authorities and private individuals. International and domestic law must provide remedies 
</p>
<p>to make international law effective. States are under a positive obligation to provide an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy for violations of international human rights law. The remedy for arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention will regularly be immediate release. In most cases, including those where release 
</p>
<p>is not a remedy, the individual has a right to compensation. This right is firmly grounded in 
</p>
<p>widespread international practice16 and on the <i>opinio juris</i> of States; it is also included in a 
</p>
<p>wide range of international instruments. It is found in the domestic law of almost all States, 
</p>
<p>and breaches are denounced. The right constitutes a general principle of international law, 
</p>
<p>based both in domestic law and its application across sectors of international law and treaty 
</p>
<p>regimes.17 Domestic law, whether constitutional or based on legislation or case law, has a 
</p>
<p>particular role in the field of human rights law where the duties are primarily those of States 
</p>
<p>to individuals. Domestic law is scrutinized in the Human Rights Council and its various 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; indeed, many of those mechanisms have as their main aim the review of 
</p>
<p>domestic law and practice. This produces much evidence of State practice and <i>opinio juris</i>. 
</p>
<p>In addition, declarations and other statements made by States about their own law and its 
</p>
<p>compliance with international law and further reaching human rights standards, and 
</p>
<p>comments and denunciations of other States, serve as additional sources of <i>opinio juris</i>.  
</p>
<p>65. Domestic courts have a particular role in granting tort remedies (<i>responsabilit&#233; 
</i></p>
<p><i>administrative et constitutionnelle</i>). Domestic law cannot erect barriers in the form of 
</p>
<p>immunities, jurisdictional limitations, procedural hurdles or defences based on an Act of 
</p>
<p>State doctrine that would limit the effectiveness of international law. One basis for 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction is the exercise of control over individuals, and under international law it exists 
</p>
<p>whenever an act attributable in the widest sense to a State has an adverse effect on anyone 
</p>
<p>anywhere in the world. Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides 
</p>
<p>that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for

<p>acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law. Article 9 (5) 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights refers to an enforceable right to 
</p>
<p>compensation for unlawful arrest and detention, and article 14 of the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides that 
</p>
<p>each State party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains 
</p>
<p>redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the 
</p>
<p>means for as full rehabilitation as possible, and that in the event of the death of the victim 
</p>
<p>as a result of an act of torture, his dependents shall be entitled to compensation. 
</p>
<p>66. The duty to provide such redress is confirmed as customary international law in the 
</p>
<p>constant jurisprudence of the Working Group. The Working Group points out that the 
</p>
<p>arguments raised and doctrines offered in defence against remedies have to date been only 
</p>
<p>too effective. In terms of actual outcomes, international courts and tribunals and domestic 
</p>
<p>courts have not provided effective remedies. It is contrary to the rule of law and the 
</p>
<p>requirements of an effective international legal order to accept new restrictions that 
</p>
<p>effectively bar remedies in domestic courts, since, under the international law principles of 
</p>
<p>subsidiarity and complementary, the domestic legal orders have the primary responsibility 
</p>
<p>to provide remedies.  
</p>
<p>67. The international law obligation to provide remedies is fulfilled primarily through 
</p>
<p>domestic law. Domestic authorities and States have an obligation to apply tort law in 
</p>
<p>compliance with international law, which provides minimum standards. The emerging 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence of international courts18 and United Nations human rights bodies provides 
</p>
<p>important sources of law or of declarations of the law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Working Group welcomes the cooperation given by States in the fulfilment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of its mandate, in particular with regard to the responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning cases brought to their attention under </b>the Working Group&#8217;s<b> regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure. During 2014, the Working Group adopted 57 opinions concerning 422 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in 30 countries. It also sent 136 urgent appeals to 48 Governments concerning 
</b></p>
<p><b>435 persons. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Working Group welcomes the invitations extended to it to pay official visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>to countries. In 2014 it conducted an official visit to New Zealand, as well as follow-up 
</b></p>
<p><b>visits to Italy and to Germany. The Working Group has received invitations from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments of Argentina (follow-up visit), Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, India, Japan, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Libya, Malta (follow-up visit), Nauru, Spain and the United States of America, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as from the Government of the State of Palestine. It has also requested to be invited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>an additional 35 countries. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Working Group reiterates that timely responses to its letters of allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>under its regular procedure with full disclosure from Member States furthers the 
</b></p>
<p>cause of objectivity in rendering the Working Group&#8217;s <b>opinions. The Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>regrets that, in some cases, Governments do not provide responses, limit their replies 
</b></p>
<p><b>to general information, merely affirm the non-existence of arbitrary detention in the 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18  See, for example, the International Court of Justice in <i>Diallo</i> (Damages), the judgement of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court in <i>The</i> <i>Prosecutor v. Lubanga Dyilo</i> (2012) and the jurisprudence of the

<p><b>country or refer to the constitutional norms preventing arbitrary detention from 
</b></p>
<p><b>occurring, without making direct references to the specific allegations transmitted. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In its deliberation No. 9 concerning the definition and scope of arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>deprivation of liberty under customary international law (see A/HRC/22/44, sect. III), 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group restated its constant jurisprudence on the prohibition of all forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and demonstrated that it is general practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>accepted as law, constituting customary international law and a peremptory norm (<i>jus 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>cogens</i>).  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty applies without territorial 
</b></p>
<p><b>limitations, and to the duties of States where they have effective control and for acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>by their agents abroad. International law does not accept Act of State limitations on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations. In the interactive dialogue at the twenty-second session of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Council, States gave general support for the conclusions in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>deliberation.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In its resolution 20/16, the Human Rights Council encouraged all States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect and promote the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide 
</b></p>
<p><b>without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if 
</b></p>
<p><b>the detention was not lawful, in accordance with their international obligations. In a 
</b></p>
<p><b>separate report (A/HRC/30/37), the Working Group is submitting to the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council the draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to that right, adopted by the Working Group at its seventy-second session. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In the light of communications received and findings resulting from country 
</b></p>
<p><b>visits, the Working Group notes with concern the increasing instances of arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention as a consequence of drug control laws and policies. Compulsory detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>regimes for the </b>purposes of drug &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; through confinement o<b>r forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>labour are contrary to scientific evidence and inherently arbitrary. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Criminal laws and penal measures pursued under the existing punitive system 
</b></p>
<p><b>of international drug control raise important questions of legality, proportionality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessity and appropriateness. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group has received relevant information and communications on 
</b></p>
<p><b>an increase of detentions in the context of peaceful protests. It intends to consider this 
</b></p>
<p><b>matter as a topic in its work for the year 2017. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>States are under a positive obligation to provide an effective remedy for 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of international human rights law. In most cases, the individual has a right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to compensation. That right constitutes a general principle of international law. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The international law obligation to provide remedies is fulfilled primarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>through domestic law. Domestic courts have a particular role in granting tort 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies, and domestic law cannot erect barriers that would limit the effectiveness of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Enforce and protect the right to liberty of every person under customary 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law; </b></p>


<p>(b)<b> Ensure that the guarantees available against arbitrary arrest and 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention are extended to all forms of deprivation of liberty, including house arrest; 
</b></p>
<p><b>re-education through labour; prolonged periods of curfew; detention of migrants and 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers; protective custody; detention for rehabilitation or treatment; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention in transit areas and at border control checkpoints; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer 
</b></p>
<p><b>than those prescribed by law, and that they are promptly brought before a judge; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Remedy arbitrary detention, mainly by immediate release and 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensation as required by international human rights conventions and customary 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law, and assist the Working Group in the follow-up to its opinions in 
</b></p>
<p><b>individual cases. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>All measures of detention should be justified, adequate, necessary and 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportional to the aim sought. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>All persons subjected to a measure of detention should benefit at all stages from 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to a lawyer of her or his choice and to effective legal assistance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>representation. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>All detainees should benefit from all minimum procedural guarantees, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the principle of equality of arms, the provision of adequate time and 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities for the preparation of the defence, proper access to evidence and guarantees 
</b></p>

<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Cuba concerning opinion 
No. 50/2014 
</b></p>
<p>El Gobierno de Cuba no ha podido hacer nada para impedir los diversos usos que el 
</p>
<p>Gobierno de Estados Unidos ha hecho de la Base Naval en Guant&#225;namo, pues aunque el 
</p>
<p>Estado cubano ejerce su soberan&#237;a sobre todo el territorio nacional, son los Estados Unidos 
</p>
<p>los que ejercen jurisdicci&#243;n sobre el territorio de la Base Naval de Guant&#225;namo, mientras 
</p>
<p>dure su ilegal ocupaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>La actual Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica de Cuba repudia y considera ilegales y nulos 
</p>
<p>los tratados, pactos o concesiones concertados en condiciones de desigualdad o que 
</p>
<p>desconocen o disminuyen su soberan&#237;a y su integridad territorial, como es el caso del 
</p>
<p>Convenio para las Estaciones Carboneras y Navales de 1903, que dio lugar a la ocupaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>de esta porci&#243;n del territorio cubano por los Estadas Unidos, y del Tratado de Relaciones 
</p>
<p>entre la Rep&#250;blica de Cuba y los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica de 1934, el cual ratific&#243; la 
</p>
<p>permanencia de la Base Naval de los Estados Unidos en Guant&#225;namo, y desde 1959, el 
</p>
<p>gobierno cubano ha reclamado al gobierno estadounidense la devoluci&#243;n de ese espacio del 
</p>
<p>territorio cubano ocupado ilegalmente contra la voluntad de su pueblo. 
</p>
<p>Los usos que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos ha dado a la Base Naval en 
</p>
<p>Guant&#225;namo ni siquiera est&#225;n previstos en los espurios tratados antes mencionados. 
</p>
<p>El Gobierno de Cuba ha expresado su profunda preocupaci&#243;n por el limbo jur&#237;dico 
</p>
<p>que sustenta la permanente y atroz violaci&#243;n por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de los 
</p>
<p>derechos humanos de los prisioneros confinados en el centro de detenci&#243;n en la ilegal Base 
</p>
<p>Naval de Guant&#225;namo como un centro de torturas y muertes en custodia. 
</p>
