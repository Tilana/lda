<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, including the right to development, are universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
</p>

<p>interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that all human rights must be treated in a fair 
</p>
<p>and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis,

<p>subject to discrimination in the context of realizing their rights in that regard on an equal 
</p>
<p>basis with men<b>,  
</b></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons

<p>to work on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i>, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>

</p>
<p>should take steps to achieve the full realization of that right, including technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques, to achieve steady 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under 
</p>
<p>conditions that safeguard the fundamental political and economic freedoms of the 
</p>
<p>individual, <b> 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>conditions of work,<b>

<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
</p>
<p>realization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually and through 
</p>
<p>international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
</p>
<p>maximum of their available resources, with a view to progressively achieving the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to work, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures, <b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, in particular target 1 (b) of the Goals, to achieve full and productive 
</p>
<p>employment and decent work for all, including women and young people,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that full and productive employment and decent work for all are key 
</p>
<p>elements of poverty-reduction strategies that facilitate the achievement of the 
</p>
<p>internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p>and that they require a multidimensional focus that incorporates Governments, the private 
</p>
<p>sector, civil society organizations, representatives of employers and workers, international 
</p>
<p>organizations and, in particular, the agencies of the United Nations system and the 
</p>
<p>international financial institutions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Encouraging</i> States to pay due consideration to the right to work and the issue of 
</p>
<p>full and productive employment and decent work for all in the ongoing negotiations on the 
</p>
<p>elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, and welcoming the inclusion of the 
</p>
<p>promotion of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all 
</p>
<p>as a proposed stand-alone goal in the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals,1

</p>
<p>an increase of 1.2 million compared with the previous year and of about 31 million

<p>compared with 2007, and highlighting the severe impact that the international economic 
</p>
<p>and financial crisis has had in that regard, 
</p>

</p>
<p>unemployed and that the global youth unemployment rate is around 13.1 per cent, and 
</p>
<p>resolved in that regard to pay particular attention to the realization of the right to work for 
</p>
<p>young people, bearing in mind the fundamental importance of equal opportunities, 
</p>
<p>education and vocational training in the context of realizing the right to work for young 
</p>
<p>people,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underscoring</i> that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national 
</p>
<p>and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive 
</p>
<p>employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development, and that 
</p>
<p>an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the 
</p>
<p>creation of new job opportunities, and reaffirming that opportunities for men and women to 
</p>
<p>obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are 
</p>
<p>essential to ensuring the eradication of hunger and poverty, the improvement of economic 
</p>
<p>and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained economic growth and 
</p>
<p>sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that employment should be a central objective of economic and social 
</p>
<p>policies at the national, regional and international levels for the sustainable eradication of 
</p>
<p>poverty and for providing an adequate standard of living, and emphasizing in that regard 
</p>
<p>the importance of relevant social protection measures, including social protection floors, 
</p>
<p> <i>Encouraging</i> the private sector to continue to exercise its vital role in generating 
</p>
<p>new investments, job opportunities and financing for development and in advancing efforts 
</p>
<p>towards the full realization of the right to work and the promotion of full and productive 
</p>
<p>employment and decent work for all, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the work of the treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in relation to the right to work,  
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging also</i> the work of United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
</p>
<p>particular the International Labour Organization, in supporting the efforts of States to 
</p>
<p>promote full and productive employment and decent work for all and the full realization of 
</p>
<p>the right to work, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>prepare a report in consultation with States, United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes, particularly the International Labour Organization, as well as the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, special procedures, civil society and other relevant stakeholders on the realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to work, in accordance with their respective obligations under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and the relevant major challenges and best practices in that regard, and to 
</p>
<p>submit it to the Human Rights Council prior to its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
