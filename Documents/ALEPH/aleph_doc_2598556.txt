CORPORATE 
 
Acquisition of MGC Pharma (UK) Ltd and Listing on ASX 
During the financial year, the Company successfully completed its relisting on the Australian Securities Exchange 
(ASX)  following  the  acquisition  of  MGC  Pharma  (UK)  Ltd.    The  Company  commenced  trading  on  the  ASX  in 
February 2016 under the ticker code MXC.  
 
$7.5m Placement and Priority Offer to MXC shareholders 
MGC Pharmaceuticals completed a Placement of 113,636,364 ordinary shares at 4.4c, raising $5 million during 
May 2016. The Placement was oversubscribed by sophisticated and professional investors.  On the same terms, 
the Company also offered a Priority Offer to existing eligible shareholders that received a very strong response 
and was closed early, raising the maximum amount of $2.5 million.  
The total $7.5m of new funds raised before costs will allow the Company to execute its business plan and growth 
initiatives,  including  completing  the  construction  of  its  Slovenian  CBD  growing  facility,  as  well  as  funding  its 
genetics and breeding research operations. It also allows MGC Pharma to complete the roll-out its MGC Derma 
cosmetics product line of approximately 50 products, including psoriasis and acne treatment products.  
 
Acquisition of PANAX Pharma 
The Company entered a Binding Heads of Agreement to acquire PANAX Pharma s.r.o (Panax), a Czech Republic 
based medical cannabis company during the year. The acquisition strengthens MGC Pharmaceuticals’ genetics 
credentials  by  providing  access  to  new  strains  of  medicinal  cannabis.  Under  the  agreement,  MGC 
Pharmaceuticals will be issued a 25% equity holding in Panax upfront and will be issued a further 55% equity for 
funding  Panax’s  operational  costs  next  year,  up  to  a  maximum  of  €700,000.  MGC  Pharmaceuticals  holds  the 
rights through an option to acquire the final 20% of Panax for €800,000 in MGC Pharmaceuticals ordinary shares,

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016
Directors’ Report 
 
This acquisition is expected to complete in Q3  2016, following the conclusion of the Company’s due diligence 
processes in the Czech Republic, which have been significantly advanced during the June quarter. 
 
OPERATIONAL 
 
Growing Operations 
The Company received licenses in 2016 from the Slovenian Government, allowing MGC Pharmaceuticals to grow 
industrial cannabis in an outdoor farm near Ljubljana, Slovenia.  These licenses are issued and renewed on an 
annual basis. 
 
The Company successfully planted its first test crops in the Company’s growing farm operation in Slovenia, during 
June  2016.    The  test  crop  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  best  soil  and  growing  conditions  needed  for  high  CBD 
Cannabis Sativa L cultivation and production, for use by MGC Pharmaceuticals as future cosmetics and medicinal 
cannabis raw materials. 
 
The  Company  remains  on  track  to  deliver  its  first  full-scale  European  CBD  harvest  in  2017,  with  its  first 
commercial CBD extract production to follow.  The Company is now planning to commence the construction of its 
GMP/GLP CBD extraction facility for production of API in Slovenia in the December quarter.
Planting first test crop in Slovenia
First Test Crop outside,  Slovenia
In addition, the Company’s pending acquisition of Czech Republic based Panax will be strategic for its European 
CBD  operations,  as  it  assists  its  growing  efforts  and  gives  MGC  Pharmaceuticals  the  right  to  access  a growing 
space  in  the  renowned  Vukoz  Research  Institute  created  by  the  Czech  Ministry  of  the  Environment.  Upon 
completion of the acquisition, MGC Pharmaceuticals intends to immediately commence growing operations in 
the Vukoz facility or other related facilities under strategic agreements held, and being effected by Panax in the 
Czech Republic.

Directors’ Report
New MGC Derma Product Lines
During  the  financial  year,  the  Company  also  launched  its  MGC  Derma  cosmetics  product  range,  as  well  as 
launching  an  online  shop  in  mid-April  that  allows  consumers  to  directly  purchase  its  cosmetics  product  range 
from  the  website.  The  initial  range  of  15  cosmetic  products,  including  facial  serums  and  creams,  eye  serums, 
soaps and toners is now available on the website, with the development of the full range of approximately 50 
CBD based cosmetic products currently underway.  
 
The  Company  has  already  received  its  first  revenues  from  the  www.mgcderma.com  website  and  from  its 
European and Californian exclusive distribution deals.  
 
The  Company  received  a  10%  deposit  of  €30,000  from  its  first  €300,000  order  under  its  new  Californian 
distribution  deal.  The  Californian  distribution  deal’s  first-year  contract  is  worth  approximately  €1.2m  and  the 
Company expects further revenue uplift in the year ahead.  
 
In October 2015, MGC Pharmaceuticals completed Phase 1 testing of its CBD skin care formula demonstrating 
excellent results for patients with Psoriasis. The CBD skin care formula proved to be an effective relief for skin 
suffering from dryness, redness and flaking. The testing has progressed to Phase 2 and Phase 3, the success of 
these tests will allow MGC to release Dermatological Tested products to the market.  
 
Australian operations 
MGC  Pharmaceuticals,  together  with  the  University  of  Sydney  Business  School,  published  Australia’s  first  ever 
White Paper on the medicinal cannabis industry, following changes to legislation by the Australian Government 
that facilitates the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for medical and scientific purposes.  This landmark White 
Paper highlighted the commercial potential of the Australian medicinal cannabis raw material market, estimated 
to  be  worth  $100  –  $150  million  per  annum  currently1.    Also  highlighted  was  the  potential  to  help  tens  of 
thousands  of  patients  suffering  from  a  wide  range  of  medical  conditions  such  as  multiple  sclerosis,  epilepsy, 
cancer and chronic pain.  
 
With the Australian Federal Government introducing new legislation to allow for the supply and cultivation of 
medical  cannabis  by  amending  the  Narcotics  Drugs  Act  1967  to  provide  patients  suffering  from  painful  and 
chronic conditions access to the drug, MGC Pharmaceuticals is well positioned to be a first mover and market 
leader  in  the  Australian  market.    Additionally,  legislative  changes  in  Victoria  and  New  South  Wales  have 
facilitated the possibility of clinical trials with medicinal cannabis, which the Company intends to pursue in the 
coming financial year.

In addition to the appointment with Dr Ross Walker, the Company appointed leading Israeli Paediatric Neurology 
and Paediatric Epilepsy Expert, Professor Uri Kramer, to the Strategic Advisory Board. Professor Kramer will direct

Significant Changes in State of Affairs  
During the financial year the Company undertook significant corporate and asset restructuring as a result of the 
agreement to acquire MGC Pharma (UK) Ltd as detailed in the review of operations.  Through this transition the 
Company became a medicinal cannabis company. 
 
After Reporting Date Events  
On  13  July  2016,  the  Company  announced  Professor  Uri  Kramer,  a  highly  regarded  expert  in  the  field  of 
Paediatric Neurology and Paediatric Epilepsy, is joined the Company as a key technical medical consultant and 
joined the Strategic Advisory Board. 
 
The Company announced on 11 August 2016 that it executed a binding agreement to sell all its interests in, and 
exploration  data  relating  to  the  exploration  work  completed  on  its  Bouroubourou  and  Lingokoto  exploration 
permits in Senegal.  The Company executed this binding agreement with its joint venture project partner Afrigem 
SL, for total cash consideration of AU$500,000.  These funds have now been received by the Company.  
 
On 12 August 2016, the Company announced the issue of 321,849 ordinary shares to Australian consultants Saki 
Partners in lieu of cash for services provided to the Company.  
 
Change in Nature and Scale of Operations 
Following  the  completion  of  the  successful  acquisition  of  MGC  Pharma  (UK)  Ltd,  the  Company  became  a 
medicinal cannabis company. 
 
Environmental Issues 
The  group’s  operations  are  subject  to  various  environmental  laws  and  regulations  under  the  relevant 
Governments’ legislation.  Full compliance with these laws and regulations is regarded as a minimum standard 
for all operations to achieve.  There have been no significant known breaches by the group during the financial 
year. 
 
Future Developments, Prospects and Business Strategies 
The  Company  will  continue  to  pursue  its  policy  of  enhancing  the  prospect  of  greater  returns  to  its  investors 
through  further  strategic  investments  during  the  next  financial  year.  Further  information  about  likely 
developments  in  the  operations  of  the  group  and  the  expected  results  of  those  operations  in  future  financial 
years  has  not  been  included  in  this  report,  because  disclosure  of  the  information  would  be  likely  to  result  in 
unreasonable prejudice to the group.

The Board of MGC Pharmaceuticals Limited believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate and effective in 
its  ability  to  attract  and  retain  the  best  key  management  personnel  to  run  and  manage  the  group,  as  well  as 
create goal congruence between directors, executives and shareholders.  
The Board’s policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for key management personnel of 
the group is as follows:
•
The  remuneration  policy,  setting  the  terms  and  conditions  for  the  key  management  personnel,  was 
developed and approved by the Board.
•  All key management personnel receive a base salary (which is based on factors such as length of service
and experience), superannuation, fringe benefits, options and performance incentives.  
The  Board  reviews  key  management  personnel  packages  annually  by  reference  to  the  consolidated 
group’s performance, executive performance and comparable information from industry sectors.
•
The performance of key management personnel is measured against criteria agreed annually with each executive 
and is based predominantly on the forecast growth of the group’s profits and shareholders’ value. All bonuses 
and  incentives  must  be  linked  to  predetermined  performance  criteria.  The  Board  may,  however,  exercise  its 
discretion in relation to approving incentives, bonuses and options.  Any changes must be justified by reference 
to measurable performance criteria. The policy is designed to attract the highest calibre of executives and reward 
them for performance that results in long-term growth in shareholder wealth. 
Key management personnel are also entitled to participate in the employee share and option arrangements. 
The key management personnel receive a superannuation guarantee contribution required by the government, 
which  is  currently  9.5%  (financial  year  2015:  9.5%)  and  do  not  receive  any  other  retirement  benefits.  Some 
individuals, however, have chosen to sacrifice part of their salary to increase payments towards superannuation. 
All remuneration paid to key management personnel is valued at the cost to the Company and expensed. Shares 
given to key management personnel are valued as the difference between the market price of those shares and 
the amount paid by key management personnel. Options are valued using the Black-Scholes methodology. 
The  Board  policy  is  to  remunerate  Non-Executive  Directors  at  market  rates  for  time,  commitment  and 
responsibilities. The Board determines payments to the Non-Executive Directors and reviews their remuneration 
annually,  based  on  market  practice,  duties  and  accountability.  Independent  external  advice  is  sought  when 
required.  The  maximum  aggregate  amount  of  fees  that  can  be  paid  to  Non-Executive  Directors  is  subject  to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Fees for Non-Executive Directors are not linked to the 
performance  of  the  consolidated  group.  However,  to  align  directors’  interests  with  shareholder  interests,  the 
Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company and are able to participate in the employee option plan.

Remuneration Report (continued) 
Performance-based Remuneration 
As  part  of  each  member  of  the  key  management  personnel’s  remuneration  package  there  is  a  performance-
based component, consisting of key performance indicators (KPIs). The intention of this program is to facilitate 
goal congruence between key management personnel with that of the business and shareholders. The KPIs are 
set annually, with a certain level of consultation with key management personnel to ensure buy-in. The measures 
are specifically tailored to the areas each key management personnel are involved in and have a level of control 
over. The KPIs target areas the Board believes hold greater potential for group expansion and profit, covering 
financial and non-financial as well as short- and long-term goals. The level set for each KPI is based on budgeted 
figures for the group and respective industry standards. 
Performance in relation to the KPIs is assessed annually, with bonuses being awarded depending on the number 
and deemed difficulty of the KPIs achieved. Following the assessment, the KPIs are reviewed by the Board in light 
of  the  desired  and  actual  outcomes,  and  their  efficiency  is  assessed  in  relation  to  the  group’s  goals  and 
shareholder wealth, before the KPIs are set for the following year.

Key Management Personnel Remuneration Policy 
The Board's policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration of key management for the group is 
as follows:  
The remuneration structure for key management personnel is based on a number of factors, including length of 
service,  particular  experience  of  the  individual  concerned,  and  overall  performance  of  the  Company.  The 
contracts for service between the Company and key management personnel are on a continuing basis, the terms 
of which are not expected to change in the immediate future. Upon retirement key management personnel are 
paid employee benefit entitlements accrued to date of retirement.

Directors’ Report 
 
Non-audit Services 
The Board of Directors is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year is compatible with the 
general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. The Directors are satisfied 
that  the  services  disclosed  below  did  not  compromise  the  external  auditor’s  independence  for  the  following 
reasons:

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
1.  CORPORATE INFORMATION 
The financial statements of MGC Pharmaceuticals Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016 were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of Directors on 26 August 2016.  These consolidated financial statements 
and  notes  represent  those  of  MGC  Pharmaceuticals  Limited  (the  “Company”)  and  Controlled  Entities  (the 
“consolidated group” or “group”). 
 
2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a)  Statement of Compliance 
The financial statements are general purpose financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with 
Australian Accounting Standards, Australian Accounting Interpretations, other authoritative pronouncements of 
the Australian Accounting Standards Board (“AASB”) and the Corporations Act 2001 as appropriate for ‘for-profit’ 
orientated entities.  
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result in financial 
statements containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions. Compliance 
with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  ensures  that  the  financial  statements  and  notes  also  comply  with 
International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the International  Accounting  Standard  Board 
(“IASB”).  Material  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  these  financial  statements  are  presented 
below and they have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
b)  Basis of Preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical costs, modified, 
where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial 
liabilities. 
The  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting  estimates.    It  also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated group’s accounting 
policies.  The  areas  involving  a  higher  degree  of  judgement  or  complexity,  or  areas  where  assumptions  and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3. 
Financial report prepared on a going concern basis 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting,  which  assumes  the 
continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary 
course of business. 
During  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  the  consolidated  group  incurred  a  loss  from  continuing  operations  of 
$6,230,063  (2015:  $3,797,791)  and  net  operating  cash  outflows  of  $3,220,501  (2015:  $617,707)  and  year-end 
cash  and  cash  equivalents  balance  of  $7,895,539  (2015:  $436,985).  Net  losses  include  one-off  non-cash 
adjustments  of  $3.54m  relating  to  the  re-measurement  of  performance  shares  issued  on  completion  of  the 
acquisition  of  MGC  UK  (note  26b)  of  $1.78m  (2015:  nil)  and  an  impairment  provision  on  the  exploration  and 
evaluation assets of $1.76m (2015: $2.78m). 
The Company’s cashflow forecasts for the 12 months ending 30 September 2017 indicate that the Company will 
be in a position to meet its committed operational and administrative expenditure and thus continue to operate 
as a going concern. 
In the Directors’ opinion there are therefore reasonable grounds to believe that the consolidated group will be 
able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. 
If  the  Company  and  group  are  unable  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  then  assets  and  liabilities  will  not  be 
discharged in the normal course of business and at values specified in the financial report.
c)  Principles of Consolidation 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  financial  statements  of  MGC  Pharmaceuticals  Ltd  and  its 
subsidiaries as at 30 June 2016 (“the Group”).

of the investee); 
• 
•
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
M G C   P H A R M A C E U T I C A L S   L I M I T E D  
Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.  Specifically, the Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;
• 
•  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 
•
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three elements of control.  Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group 
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.  Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of 
comprehensive  income  from  the  date  the  Group  gains  control  until  the date  the  Group  ceases  to  control  the 
subsidiary. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) are attributed to the equity holders of 
the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance.  When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.  All intra-group assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated 
in full on consolidation. 
A  change  in  the  ownership  interest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  loss  of  control,  is  accounted  for  as  an  equity 
transaction.    If  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary  it,  de-recognises  the  assets  (including  goodwill)  and 
liabilities of the subsidiary; de-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests; de-recognises the 
cumulative  translation  differences  recorded  in  equity;  recognises  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received; 
recognises  the  fair  value  of  any  investment  retained;  recognises  any  surplus  or  deficit  in  profit  or  loss;  and 
reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, 
as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
d)  Business Combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.  The cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree.  For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure 
the  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree  at  fair  value  or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree’s 
identifiable  net  assets.    Acquisition-related  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  included  in  administrative 
expenses. 
When  the  Group  acquires  a  business,  it  assesses  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  for  appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date.  This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by 
the acquiree. 
If  the  business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  any  previously  held  equity  interest  is  re-measured  at  its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  It is then considered in the 
determination of goodwill. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date.    Contingent  consideration  classified  as  an  asset  or  liability  that  is  a  financial  instrument  and  within  the 
scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments:  Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes 
in fair value recognised either in profit or loss or as a change to OCI.  If the contingent consideration is not within 
the scope of AASB 139, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate AASB.  Contingent consideration that is 
classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

M G C   P H A R M A C E U T I C A L S   L I M I T E D  
Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the 
amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets 
acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.    If  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired  is  in  excess  of  the  aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and 
all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date.  If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  For the purpose 
of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business  combination  is,  from  the  acquisition  date,  allocated  to 
each  of  the  Group’s  cash-generating  units  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  combination,  irrespective  of 
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.  Where goodwill has been allocated 
to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal.  Goodwill  disposed  in  these  circumstances  is  measured  based  on  the  relative  values  of  the  disposed 
operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
e)  Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.  Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over 
those policies. 
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture.  Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control. 
The considerations made in determining significant influence, or joint control, are similar to those necessary to 
determine control over subsidiaries. 
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  Under the equity method, 
the  investment  in  an  associate  or  a  joint  venture  is  initially  recognised  at  cost.    The  carrying  amount  of  the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture 
since the acquisition date.  Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount 
of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. 
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate or joint 
venture.  Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI.  In addition, when there 
has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its 
share  of  any  changes,  when  applicable,  in  the  statement  of  changes  in  equity.    Unrealised  gains  and  losses 
resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of 
the interest in the associate or joint venture. 
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of the 
statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or  loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture. 
The  financial  statements  of  the  associate  or  joint  venture  are  prepared  for  the  same  reporting  period  as  the 
Group.  When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. 
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment 
loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture.  At each reporting date, the Group determines whether 
there  is  objective  evidence  that  the  investment  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture  is  impaired.    If  there  is  such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of 
the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate 
and a joint venture’ in the statement of profit or loss. 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures 
and recognises any retained  investment at its  fair  value.    Any difference between the  carrying amount of the 
associate  or  joint  venture  upon  loss  of  significant  influence  or  joint  control  and  the  fair  value  of  the  retained 
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

f)  Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination or asset acquisition, other than goodwill, are initially 
measured  at  their  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  Intangible  assets  acquired  separately  are  initially 
recognised at cost.  Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less 
any  impairment.  The  gains  and  losses  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  arising  from  the  derecognition  of  intangible 
assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible 
asset.  The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually.  Changes in the expected 
pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or 
period. 
Licenses/permit costs 
Costs associated with the acquisition of a license or permit to cultivate hemp are considered to be indefinite life 
identifiable intangible assets and are subject to regular impairment testing.
g)  Current and Non-Current Classification 
The  group  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  based  on  current/non-current 
classification. An asset is current when it is:
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
• 
•  Held primarily for the purpose of trading; 
• 
•  A Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or
twelve months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is current when it is:
Expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
• 
•  Held primarily for the purpose of trading; 
• 
•
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period.
The group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. 
h)  Income Tax 
The  income  tax  expense  or  revenue  for  the  period  is  the  tax  payable  on  the  current  period’s  taxable  income 
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  countries  where  the  company’s  subsidiaries  and  associates  operate  and 
generate taxable income. 
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the statement of financial position date, arising 
between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements, and are recognised for all taxable temporary differences,
•
•
Except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and 
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax 
assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
•
Except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements
•
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the  temporary  differences  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
Tax Consolidation 
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under 
the tax consolidated legislation. Each entity in the group recognises its own current and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. Such taxes are measured using the ‘stand-alone taxpayer’ approach to allocation.  The group notified 
the Australian Taxation Office that it had formed an income tax consolidated group to apply from 21 October 
2005.  The tax consolidated group has entered a tax funding agreement whereby each company in the group 
contributes to the income tax payable by the group in proportion to their contributions to the group’s taxable 
income.  
i) 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to 
the asset’s carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to the 
statement of profit or loss. 
Where  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  Group  estimates  the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 
individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units 
for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated  to  be  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  (or  cash-generating  unit)  is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the 
relevant  asset  is  carried  at  a  revalued  amount,  in  which  case  the  impairment  loss  is  treated  as  a  revaluation 
decrease (refer 2x)). When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash 
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal 
of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase (refer 2x)).
j)  Employee Benefits 
A provision is made for the Group’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees 
to reporting date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the 
amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs.

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
k)  Foreign Currency Translation 
Functional and Presentation Currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary  economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  (“the  functional  currency”).  The  consolidated 
financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian  dollars,  which  is  the  Company’s  functional  and  presentation 
currency.  
Transactions and Balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the  dates  of  the  transactions.    Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such 
transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  period-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive 
income, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment 
hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.  
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the statement of comprehensive 
income, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit 
or loss on a net basis within other income or other expenses. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
at the date when the fair value was determined. Transaction differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair 
value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. 
Group companies 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at the rate 
of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at  exchange 
rates  prevailing  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.    The  exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  for 
consolidation purposes are recognised in other comprehensive income.  On disposal of a foreign operation, the 
component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or 
loss. 
Any  goodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  a  foreign  operation  and  any  fair  value  adjustments  to  the  carrying 
amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  arising  on  the  acquisition  are  treated  as  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  foreign 
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. 
l)  Segment Reporting 
An operating segment is a component of the consolidated group that engages in business activities from which it 
may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of 
the consolidated group’s other components. 
Operating  segments  are  reported  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  internal  reporting  provided  to  the  chief 
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.  
Specifically, the Group’s reportable segments under AASB 8 are currently based on its geographic location, being 
the Australian and Slovenian operations. 
m) Cash and Cash Equivalents 
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
deposits  held  at  call  with  financial  institutions,  other  short-term,  highly  liquid  investments  with  original 
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in 
current liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
n)  Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  The group recognises revenue 
when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to 
the entity and specific criteria have been met for each type of revenue as described below.

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered and titles have passed, at which time 
all the following conditions are satisfied:
the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; 
the  Group  retains  neither  continuing  managerial  involvement  to  the  degree  usually  associated  with 
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and  
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
• 
•
• 
• 
•
Interest income 
Interest  income  is  recognised  on  a  proportional  basis  taking  into  account  the  interest  rates  applicable  to  the 
financial assets. 
o)  Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  GST,  except  where  the  amount  of  GST 
incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of 
the  cost  of  acquisition  of  the  asset,  or  as  part  of  an  item  of  the  expense.  Receivables  and  payables  in  the 
statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.  
Cash  flows  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows  on  a  gross  basis,  except  for  the  GST 
component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.
p)  Rounding of Amounts 
The  Company  is  a  kind  referred  to  in  class  order  98/100  issued  by  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investment 
Commission,  relating  to  the  “rounding  off”  of  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  Amounts  in  the  financial 
statements have been rounded off in accordance with that class order to the nearest dollar.     
q)  Contributed Equity 
Issued  and  paid  up  capital  is  recognised  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  by  the  group.  Any 
transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the 
proceeds received. 
r)  Share Based Payments 
Share based compensation relating to share options are recognised at fair value. 
The fair value of the options is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss and 
other  comprehensive  income,  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  equity.    The  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is 
determined  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the  options  granted,  which  includes  any  market  performance 
conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. 
Upon  exercise  of  share  options,  the  proceeds  received  net  of  any  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  are 
allocated to share capital. 
s)  Trade and Other Payables 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the group prior to the end of the financial 
year,  which  remain  unpaid  at  year  end.  The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  are  usually  paid  within  60  days  of 
recognition. They are recognised at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. 
t)  Trade and Other Receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method, less a provision for impairment.  Trade receivables are generally due for 
settlement between thirty (30) and ninety (90) days from the date of recognition. They are presented as current 
assets unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months after reporting date.

M G C   P H A R M A C E U T I C A L S   L I M I T E D  
Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
Significant  financial  difficulties  of  the  debtor,  probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  financial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators 
that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows,  discounted  at  the  original  effective  interest  rate.  Cash  flows  relating  to 
short-term  receivables  are  not  discounted  if  the  effect  of  discounting  is  immaterial.  The  amount  of  the 
impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss within other expenses. When a trade receivable for which an 
impairment  allowance  had  been  recognised  becomes  uncollectible  in  a  subsequent  period,  it  is  written  off 
against  the  allowance  account.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts  previously  written  off  are  credited  against 
other expenses in the profit or loss. 
u)  Exploration, Evaluation and Development Expenditure 
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure incurred is either written off as incurred or accumulated in 
respect  of  each  identifiable  area  of  interest.  These  costs  are  only  carried  forward  to  the  extent  that  they  are 
expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not 
yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. 
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit/loss in the year in which 
the decision to abandon the area is made. 
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry 
forward costs in relation to that area of interest. 
v)  Plant and Equipment 
Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of plant and equipment 
over their expected useful lives as follows: 
Plant and equipment 
The  residual  values,  useful  lives  and  depreciation  methods  are  reviewed,  and  adjusted  if  appropriate,  at  each 
reporting date. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic 
benefit to the group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit 
or loss. Any revaluation surplus reserve relating to the item disposed of is transferred directly to retained profits. 
w) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of inventories are determined on a first-
in-first-out  basis.  Net  realisable  value  represents  the  estimated  selling  price  for  inventories  less  all  estimated 
costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
x)  Investments and Other Financial Assets 
Investments and other financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs are included as part 
of the initial measurement, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. They are subsequently 
measured  at  either  amortised  cost  or  fair  value  depending  on  their  classification.  Classification  is  determined 
based on the purpose of the acquisition and subsequent reclassification to other categories is restricted. The fair 
values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. For unlisted investments, the group establishes fair 
value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other 
instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models.  Financial 
assets  are  derecognised  when  the  rights  to  receive  cash  flows  from  the  financial  assets  have  expired  or  have 
been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either: i) held for trading, where they are acquired for the 
purpose of selling in the short-term with an intention of making a profit; or ii) designated as such upon initial 
recognition, where they are managed on a fair value basis or to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting 
mismatch.  Except  for  effective  hedging  instruments,  derivatives  are  also  categorised  as  fair  value  through  the 
statement of profit or loss. Fair value movements are recognised in the profit or loss.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets, principally equity securities that are either 
designated  as  available-for-sale  or  not  classified  as  any  other  category.  After  initial  recognition,  fair  value 
movements  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  through  the  available-for-sale  reserve  in  equity. 
Cumulative gain or loss previously reported in the available-for-sale reserve is recognised in the profit or loss 
when the asset is derecognised or impaired. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial 
asset  or  group  of  financial  assets  is  impaired.  Objective  evidence  includes  significant  financial  difficulty  of  the 
issuer or obligor; a breach of contract such as default or delinquency in payments; the lender granting to a 
borrower  concessions  due  to  economic  or  legal  reasons  that  the  lender  would  not  otherwise  do;  it  becomes 
probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial  reorganisation;  the  disappearance  of  an 
active  market  for  the  financial  asset;  or  observable  data  indicating  that  there  is  a  measurable  decrease  in 
estimated future cash flows. 
The amount of the impairment allowance for financial assets carried at cost is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate of 
return for similar financial assets. 
De-recognition  
Financial  assets  are  derecognised  where  the  contractual  rights  to  receipt  of  cash  flows  expires  or  the  asset  is 
transferred to another party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks 
and benefits associated  with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised where the related obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability extinguished  
or transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets 
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss. 
Available-for-sale financial assets are considered impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline 
in  value  below  initial  cost.  Subsequent  increments  in  value  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income 
through the available-for-sale reserve. 
y)   Borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.  Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and 
the  redemption  amount  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  over  the  period  of  the  loans  and  borrowings  using  the 
effective interest method. 
All borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period. 
z)  Fair value measurement 
The group measures financial instruments and non-financial assets at fair value at each reporting date.  
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. 
The fair  value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would  use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.  A fair 
value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market  participant's  ability  to  generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available  to  measure  fair  value,  maximising  the  use  of  relevant  observable  inputs  and  minimising  the  use  of 
unobservable inputs.

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level  2  —  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable 
Level  3  —  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value 
measurement is unobservable
• 
•
•
For  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  recognised  in  the  financial  statements  on  a  recurring  basis,  the  group 
determines  whether  transfers  have  occurred  between  Levels  in  the  hierarchy  by  re-assessing  categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period. 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained 
above. 
aa) Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss after income tax attributable to equity 
holders  of  the  Company,  excluding  any  costs  of  servicing  equity  other  than  ordinary  shares,  by  the  weighted 
average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  financial  year,  adjusted  for  bonus  elements  in 
ordinary shares issued during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into 
account  the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs  associated  with  dilutive  potential 
ordinary share and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in 
relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
bb) Parent entity financial information 
The  financial  information  for  the  parent  entity,  MGC  Pharmaceuticals  Limited,  disclosed  in  note  33  has  been 
prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, except as set out below: 
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities 
Investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint  venture  entities  are  accounted  for  at  cost  in  the  financial 
statements of  MGC Pharmaceuticals Limited. Dividends received from associates are  recognised in the parent 
entity’s statement of profit or loss when its right to receive the dividend is established. 
 
3.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
The  Directors  evaluate  estimates  and  judgements  incorporated  into  the  financial  report  based  on  historical 
knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events 
and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the group. 
a)  Estimated Impairment 
The  group  tests  annually  whether  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  have  suffered  any  impairment,  in 
accordance  with  the  accounting  policy  stated  in  note  1u).    The  recoverable  amounts  of  cash  generating  units 
have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.  These calculations require the use of assumptions like 
commodity price and production quantity.  Some of these assumptions may be amended in the future and this 
may lead to the subsequent impairment of the assets concerned.  
b)  Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditure 
The  group  has  capitalised  significant  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  on  the  basis  that  this  is  either 
expected to be recouped through future successful development (or alternatively sale) of the areas of interest 
concerned, or on the basis that it is not yet possible to  assess  whether it  will be recouped. Management are 
required  to  make  certain  judgements  in  relation  to  the  assessment  of  whether  the  areas  of  interest  are 
commercially viable; where costs are capitalised and are subsequently considered unsuccessful, the capitalised 
amounts are written off to the statement of profit or loss.

c)  Income Taxes 
The group expects to have carried forward tax losses which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets as it 
is not considered sufficiently probable that these losses will be recouped by means of future profits taxable in the 
relevant jurisdictions. 
d)  Share Based Payments 
The assessed fair value at grant date of share based payments granted during the period was determined using a 
binomial  option  pricing  model  that  takes  into  account  the  exercise  price,  the  price  of  the  underlying  share  at 
grant date, the life of the option, the volatility of the underlying share, the risk free rate and expected dividend 
payout and any applicable vesting conditions.  
Management  was  required  to  make  assumptions  and  estimates  in  order  to  determine  the  inputs  into  the 
binomial option pricing model.
e)  Contingent liabilities 
A contingent consideration liability arose from the acquisition of MGC Pharma (UK) Limited, where Performance 
Shares can be converted into fully paid ordinary shares at a rate of one ordinary share for every Performance 
Share that converts. 
The determination of the fair value is based on a probability weighted payout approach, where key assumptions 
take  into  consideration  the  probability  of  meeting  each  milestone  and  any  future  development  may  require 
further revisions to the estimate. 
 
4.  APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
a)  Changes in accounting policy, accounting standards and interpretations 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows: 
New and amended standards and interpretations

The  objective  of  this  Standard  is  to  establish 
principles for the financial reporting of financial 
assets and financial  liabilities that will present 
relevant  and  useful  information  to  users  of 
financial  statements  for  their  assessment  of 
the  amounts,  timing  and  uncertainty  of  an 
entity’s future cash flows.

AASB  15  outlines  a  single  comprehensive

revenue arising from contracts with customers; 
and replaces AASB 111 Construction Contracts, 
AASB 118 Revenue, Interpretation 13 Customer

Agreements  for  the  Construction  of  Real 
Estate,  Interpretation  18  Transfers  of  Assets 
Interpretation  131 
from  Customers,  and 
Revenue-Barter 
Involving 
Advertising Services. The core principle is that 
an  entity  recognises  revenue  to  depict  the 
transfer  of  promised  goods  or  services  to 
customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be 
entitled 
in  exchange  for  those  goods  or 
services. 
This  Standard  lists  the  application  paragraphs 
for  each  other  Standard  (and  Interpretation), 
grouped where they are the same. Accordingly, 
paragraphs  5  and  22  respectively  specify  the 
application  paragraphs 
for  Standards  and 
Interpretations in general. Differing application 
paragraphs are set out for individual Standards 
and Interpretations or grouped where possible.  
The  application  paragraphs  do  not  affect 
requirements  in  other  Standards  that  specify 
that  certain  paragraphs  apply  only  to  certain 
types of entities. 
AASB  116  Property  Plant  and  Equipment  and 
AASB  138  Intangible  Assets  both  establish  the 
principle  for  the  basis  of  depreciation  and 
amortisation as being the expected pattern of 
consumption  of  the  future  economic  benefits 
of an asset.  
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-
based methods to calculate the depreciation of 
an  asset  is  not  appropriate  because  revenue 
generated  by an activity that includes the use 
of an asset generally reflects factors other than 
the  consumption  of  the  economic  benefits 
embodied in the asset. 
The  amendment  also  clarified  that  revenue  is 
generally  presumed  to  be  an  inappropriate 
basis  for  measuring  the  consumption  of  the 
economic  benefits  embodied  in  an  intangible 
asset.  This  presumption,  however,  can  be 
rebutted in certain limited circumstances.

The Directors reviewed the carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets at year end, and in conclusion 
recognised an impairment provision to reduce its value to its recoverable amount of $500,000.  
As  per  note  14a  the  Group  has  sold  two  of  their  permits  to  their  joint  venture  partner,  Afrigem  SL  for  a 
consideration of $500,000, and has reclassified the exploration asset as held for sale. 
30 June 2015 
During the year ended 30 June 2015 the Directors reduced the carrying value of exploration expenditure to its 
recoverable amount being the direct costs capitalised on each area of interest; indirect expenditure that cannot 
specifically be allocated to an area of interest has been expensed through the profit or loss.  
The Wassadou North and South, and Balakonko tenements were relinquished during the year and their carrying 
values reduced to nil; the group however successfully acquired a new tenement, Youboubou on 20 May 2015.

The contingent consideration liability arose from the acquisition of MGC Pharma (UK) Limited (note 26b). 
The  performance  shares  meet  the  definition  of  a  financial  liability  where  a  variable  amount  of  performance 
shares convert, contingent upon meeting the milestone (note 26b), into fully paid ordinary shares at a rate of one 
ordinary  share  for  every  performance  share  that  converts  or  consolidates  into  one  performance  share  and 
converts to one ordinary share if no conversion occurs on or before the expiry date (3 years from completion of 
acquisition). 
The determination of the fair value is based on a probability weighted payout approach.  The key assumptions 
take  into  consideration  the  probability  of  meeting  the  performance  targets.    As  part  of  accounting  for  the 
acquisition of MGC UK, the contingent consideration was initially measured at acquisition with a probability of 
50%,  at  which  date  the  share  price  was  $0.026.  Following  review  by  the  Board  as  at  30  June  2016,  it  was 
determined  that  the  probability  of  meeting  the  targets  was  highly  probable  and  the  weighted  outcome  had 
increased to 75%, and as at that date the share price was $0.044.  The increase in value of $1,780,000 was taken 
to  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income.    Future  developments  may 
require further revisions to the estimate.

optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
Consistent with others in the industry, the group manages its capital by assessing the group’s financial risk and 
adjusts its capital structure in response to changes in these risks and in the market. These responses include the 
management of debt levels, distributions to shareholders and share issues. 
There have been no changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital of the group since the

b)  Acquisition of MGC Pharma (UK) Ltd 
Following  the  Company  exercising  its  right  to  acquire  100%  of  the  issued  capital  of  the  medicinal  cosmetic 
cannabis company, MGC Pharma (UK) Ltd (“MGC UK”), the Company then entered into a Share Sale and Purchase 
Agreement with MGC UK and subsequently completed its acquisition on 15 February 2016 through the issue of 
200,000,000 shares and 100,000,000 performance shares. 
MGC UK holds interests in MGC Slovenia d.o.o (“MGC Slovenia”) and MGC Derma d.o.o (“MGC Derma”) of 100% 
and 51% respectively. 
MGC  UK  is  a  privately  held  entity,  that  does  not  consist  of  inputs,  nor  processes  that  generate  outputs,  and 
therefore  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  a  business.  Where  a  transaction  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  a 
business, and therefore not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the transaction is that of an asset 
acquisition and is therefore a share based payment transaction under AASB 2 Share Based Payments. 
This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that principally involved the acquisition of the growing 
licences  held  under  MGC  Slovenia  for  growing  of  cannabis  for  medicinal  and  cosmetic  purposes;  MGC  Derma 
being the cosmetics sale entity. 
Under asset acquisition accounting the acquirer identifies and recognises the individual assets acquired (including 
those assets that meet the definition of, and recognition criteria for, intangible assets in IAS 38) and liabilities 
assumed;  and  allocates  the  cost  of  the  group  of  assets  and  liabilities  to  the  individual  identifiable  assets  and 
liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase. 
The principal terms of the acquisition are as follows:
Fair value of consideration 
equity instruments 
Cash acquired on acquisition 
Excess of net liabilities over 
consideration 
Initial consideration 
determined at acquisition date

Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
The securities issued as consideration for the acquisition are: 
(i)  200,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares in MGC; and 
(ii)  100,000,000 performance shares.
The Company issued 200,000,000 ordinary shares for 100% interest in the MGC UK Group. The fair value of the 
shares is calculated with reference to the quoted price of the shares of the Company at the date of acquisition, 
which was $0.026 per share. The fair value on consideration given was therefore $5,200,000. 
The 100,000,000 performance shares issued by the Company to the Vendors are convertible to ordinary shares 
(on  a  one  for  one  basis)  upon  the  Company  securing  an  off-take  agreement  to  sell  CBD  oil  that  contains  a 
minimum purity of 50% CBD and/or MGC products, and achieving revenue of €1 million from the supply of CBD 
oil and /or other MGC products under that off-take agreement. 
The determination of the fair value is based on a probability weighted payout approach. The key assumptions 
take  into  consideration  the  probability  of  meeting  the  performance  target  (as  detailed  above).  As  part  of 
accounting for the acquisition of MGC UK, the estimated fair value of the performance shares of $1,300,0000 are 
recognised on acquisition based on a probability weighting of 50% that the target would be met, at which date 
the underlying share price was $0.026.

28.  SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 
The fair value for all share options, as detailed below, are determined using a binomial option pricing method 
that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the probability of exercise, the share price at 
grant date and expected volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest 
rate for the term of the option.   
The inputs used for the valuations are tabled below for each class of option issued.   
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns 
that may occur.  The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future 
trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.  The probability of the performance conditions 
occurring, where applicable are included in determining the fair value of the options.

For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its geographical locations and it 
was determined that there are two reportable segments: 
•  Australia – corporate and administrative function 
•
Slovenia – production and supply of medicinal cannabis products
The Slovenia operations relate to MGC Slovenia and MGC Derma which, based on their level of activities for the 
year ended 30 June 2016, have been aggregated as one reportable operating segment as each company exhibit 
similar economic characteristics in respect of their inputs, processes, outputs and their regulatory environments, 
being that of the production and sale of medicinal cannabis for pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes.

31.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The group’s financial instruments consist mainly of cash at bank, payables and receivables. 
The  group  has  not  formulated  any  specific  management  objectives  and  policies  in  respect  to  debt  financing, 
derivatives or hedging activity.  As a result, the group has not formulated any specific management objectives 
and policies in respect to these types of financial instruments.  Should the group change its position in the future, 
a considered summary of these policies will be disclosed at that time.  
The Group’s current exposure to the risk of changes in the market is managed by the Board of Directors. 
Market risks 
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks through its financial instruments for example, interest rate 
risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, as well as foreign currency risk. 
Interest rate risk 
At  reporting  date,  the  Group  does  not  have  long  term  borrowings  and  its  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  is 
assessed as low. The risk monitors its interest rate risk through sensitivity analysis, as outlined below. 
The consolidated group’s exposure to interest rate risk which is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will 
fluctuate  as  a  result  of  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  the  effective  weighted  average  interest  rates  on 
classes of financial assets of the group are summarised in the following tables:

At  30  June  2016,  if  interest  rates  had  changed  by  -/+100  basis  points  from  the  year-end  rates  with  all  other 
variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been $68,153 lower/higher (2015: $4,271). 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that the  group  will  not  be  able  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  as  they  fall  due.    The 
group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient cash to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses 
or risking damage to the group’s reputation. The group monitors forecast cash flows on regular basis to manage 
its liquidity risk.  
Credit risk 
Management has assessed the credit risk exposure as minimal at reporting date. Credit risk arises from exposure 
to customers and deposits with banks. Management monitors its exposure to ensure recovery and repayment of 
outstanding amounts. Cash deposits are only made with reputable banking institutions. 
Foreign currency risk 
The  group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various  currency 
exposures, primarily with respect to the Senegal currency (CFA Franc (XOF)), GBP (£), Euro (€) and United States 
Dollars (USD). 
Foreign  exchange  risk  arises  from  future  commercial  transactions  and  recognised  assets  and  liabilities 
denominated  in  a  currency  that  is  not  the  entity’s  functional  currency.  The  risk  is  measured  using  cash  flow 
forecasting. 
The consolidated entity has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to hedge such transactions and 
anticipated  future  receipts  or  payments  that  are  denominated  in  a  foreign  currency.  The  board  manages  the 
purchase of foreign currency to meet operational requirements. 
The consolidate entity’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows:
Trade payables in denomination currency 
Trade payables - EUR 
 
Cash and cash equivalents held in denomination currency 
Cash and cash equivalents - EUR 
Cash and cash equivalents - XOF

32.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, as described at note 1z).

The fair value of financial instruments recognised under Level 1 are measured based on the active market value, 
determined in this case by the value a third party is willing to pay for the assets (refer note 14a).
b)  Valuation techniques used to derive Level 3 fair values 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined using valuation 
techniques.  These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and 
rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. 
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 
3.  
The contingent consideration was valued by applying the probability weighted payout approach as described in 
note 19, and is reviewed on a six monthly basis.

The carrying value of cash, trade receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values due 
to their short-term nature.

(1) has at least three members, a majority of whom are independent directors; and

The Company's Practice: 
Given the Company’s current size and stage of development, it is not considered necessary to have a separate

assist with the identification process.

and diversity that the board currently has or is looking to achieve in its membership. 
 
The Company's Practice: 
The Board considers that the composition of the existing Board is appropriate given the scope and size of the 
Company’s operations and the skills matrix of the existing Board members, however, the Board does not consider 
it necessary to maintain a Board “skills matrix” at this stage of the Company’s development. 
The skills, experience and expertise of each of the Company’s Directors are set out in the Directors’ Report 
 
RECOMMENDATION 2.3: A listed entity should disclose:
a. 
b.
c.
the names of the directors considered by the board to be independent directors; 
if a director has an interest, position, association or relationship of the type described in the ASX Principles 
but the board is of the opinion that it does not compromise the independence of the director, the nature 
of the interest, position, association or relationship in question and an explanation of why the board is of 
that opinion; and

The Company's Practice: 
The Board consists of one independent Director, an Executive Chairman (not independent), a Managing Director 
(not  independent)  and  an  Executive  Director  (not  independent).    Given  the  scope  and  size  of  the  Company’s 
current operations and the skills matrix of the existing Board members, the Board considers that the composition 
of the existing Board is appropriate. 
RECOMMENDATION  2.5:  The  chair  of  the  board  of  a  listed  entity  should  be  an  independent  director  and,  in 
particular, should not be the same person as the CEO of the entity. 
The Company's Practice: 
The Chairman, Mr Brett Mitchell, is not an independent Director, given that he is a shareholder of the Company, 
however the Board considers that this is appropriate given the stage of development of the Company.  The role 
of Managing Director is filled by Mr Nativ Segev.   
 
RECOMMENDATION  2.6:  A  listed  entity  should  have  a  program  for  inducting  new  directors  and  provide 
appropriate  professional  development  opportunities  for  directors  to  develop  and  maintain  the  skills  and 
knowledge needed to perform their role as directors effectively.

knowledge.

accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the entity and 
that the opinion has been formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control which

The Company's Practice: 
The  Company  has  a  formal  Continuous  Disclosure  Policy  as  required  by  Recommendation  5.1.  This  policy  was

communication  with  shareholders  and  encouraging  their  participation  at  general  meetings  and  disclose  their

The Company's Practice: 
The Company has established and regularly maintains and updates a website at www.mgcpharma.com.au, which 
provides information to  security holders and members of the public regarding the  Company’s project, profile, 
Board, management, corporate governance, ASX releases and reports and analyst reports.

The Board meets on a regular basis and discusses matters normally captured under the terms of reference of a 
risk  management  committee,  including  recognition  and  management  of  company  risk,  implementation  and 
review of risk management practices, and management of risk that may impact the Company, its security holders 
and  other  stakeholders  such  as  employees,  suppliers,  creditors  and  the  broader  community  in  which  the 
Company operates. 
The objectives of the Company’s risk management program are contained in the Risk Management Policy which 
is available on the Company’s website.

a.
review the entity’s risk management framework at least annually to satisfy itself that it continues to be 
sound; and
b.  disclose, in relation to each reporting period, whether such a review has taken place.
The Company's Practice: 
The Board requires management to design and implement the risk management and internal control system to 
manage  the  Company’s  material  business  risks,  and  report  to  it  on  whether  those  risks  are  being  managed 
effectively.  Management reports to the Board, and the Board reviews, on at least an annual basis, regarding the 
Company’s  risk  management  framework  and  as  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  management  of  its 
material business risks. 
RECOMMENDATION 7.3: A listed entity should disclose:
a. 
b.
if it has an internal audit function, how the function is structured and what role it performs; or 
if it does not have an internal audit function, that fact and the processes it employs for evaluating and 
continually improving the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control processes.
The Company's Practice: 
The Company does not have an internal audit function, however it has in place a system of risk management that 
identifies and categorises and manages material business risks faced by the Company.  
The  Board  has  delegated  responsibility  for  establishing  and  maintaining  effective  management  strategies  for 
material  business  risk  to  the  Executive  Chairman,  to  whom  the  Company’s  Financial  Controller  reports.    The 
Board  requires  that  the  Executive  Chairman  reports  regularly  as  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Group’s  risk 
management systems. 
The Board recognises that no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities.  The 
Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  business  and  financial  risk  management  systems  and  internal  control  systems 
implemented by management to obtain reasonable assurance that the entity’s assets are safeguarded and that 
the reliability and integrity of its financial information is maintained. 
RECOMMENDATION  7.4:  A  listing  entity  should  disclose  whether  it  has  any  material  exposure  to  economic, 
environmental and social sustainability risks and, if it does, how it manages or intends to manage those risks.

as otherwise required, by the Company in its Quarterly, Half-Yearly and Annual Reports to ASX and regular ASX

RECOMMENDATION 8.1: The board of a listed entity should:
a.  have a remuneration committee which:
(1) has at least three members, a majority of whom are independent directors; and 
(2) is chaired by an independent director, 
and disclose: 
(3) the charter of the committee; 
(4) the members of the committee; and 
(5) as at the end of each reporting period, the number of times the committee met throughout the period

b.
if it does not have a remuneration committee, disclose that fact and the processes it employs for 
overseeing for setting the level and composition of remuneration for directors and senior executives and 
ensuring that such remuneration is appropriate and not excessive.
The Company's Practice: 
The  Board  considers  that  due  to  the  current  size  of  the  Company  and  its  operations,  it  does  not  merit  the 
establishment  of  a  separate  remuneration  committee.    Until  the  situation  changes  the  Board  of  MGC 
Pharmaceuticals will carry out any necessary remuneration committee functions.  The Board undertakes this role 
with the assistance of any external advice which may be required from time to time. 
 
RECOMMENDATION  8.2:  A  listed  entity  should  separately  disclose  its  policies  and  practices  regarding  the 
remuneration  of  non-executive  directors  and  the  remuneration  of  executive  directors  and  other  senior 
executives. 
 
The Company's Practice: 
The  Company  has  separate  policies  relating  to  the  remuneration  of  Non-Executive  Directors  as  opposed  to 
Executive  Directors  and  Senior  Executives.    These  policies  provide  a  basis  for  distinguishing  the  type  of 
remuneration which is suitable for the two classes.   
The  level  of  remuneration  packages  and  policies  applicable  to  directors  are  detailed  in  the  Remuneration 
Report which forms part of the Directors’ Report in this Financial Report. 
 
RECOMMENDATION 8.3:  A listed entity which has an equity-based remuneration scheme should:
a.  have a policy on whether participants are permitted to enter into transactions (whether through the use
of derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of participating in the scheme; and
b.  disclose that policy or a summary of it.
