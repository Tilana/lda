 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF  
THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Monitoring of projects 
</b>1. The Secretariat has fully implemented Recommendation 11 of the report of the Office of 
Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) (E/CN.4/2005/55) emphasizing the need for a systematic and 
ongoing monitoring and evaluation system of projects funded.  A total of 228 projects have been 
visited since 2000, which completes the first cycle of visits of projects financed between 2000 
and 2006.  These visits were undertaken by members of the secretariat of the Fund, staff 
members of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
both in Geneva and in the field, as well as by staff members of other United Nations field 
presences. 
</p>
<p>2. At its twenty-sixth session, which will be held from 5 to 9 February 2006, the Board 
of Trustees will elaborate criteria for the second cycle of visits which should start in 2007, 
following its recommendation whereby all recurrent projects will be visited every four to 
five years. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Aiming at greater geographical balance in grant allocation 
</b></p>
<p>3. Recommendation 4 of the OIOS report called for &#8220;greater geographical balance in 
grant allocation&#8221; and a proactive approach by the Secretariat in identifying potential grantees.  
The Board, at its twenty-fifth session, set aside US$ 250,000 for new projects identified by 
United Nations field presences, members of the secretariat of the Fund and members of the 
Board in priority regions, namely Africa, Asia and emerging democratic States, in particular the 
Commonwealth of Independent States.  Eligible applications will be reviewed by the Board at its 
twenty-sixth session when funding will be allocated for the year 2007. 
</p>
<p>4. The Secretariat has launched a call for proposals for priority regions for 2007 through 
OHCHR&#8217;s field presences, human rights components of United Nations peace missions, 
OHCHR&#8217;s non-governmental organizations liaison officer, regional organizations such as the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and international networks of 
organizations working directly or indirectly with victims of torture, namely the World 
Organization against Torture (OMCT), the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture 
Victims (IRCT), the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), and the Association for 
the Prevention of Torture (APT). 
</p>
<p>5. A call for proposals for the year 2008 under the regular funding procedure has 
also been launched inviting eligible organizations to apply to the Fund between 1 January 
and 1 April 2007.  These requests will be considered by the Board at its twenty-seventh session, 
in October 2007, and funding will be allocated for the year 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Strengthened management system 
</b></p>
<p>6. Recommendation 9 of the OIOS report stated that &#8220;the Fund should establish a central 
and computerized historical, financial and narrative project tracking system that will allow staff 
to follow and document the history and progress of its relationship with grantees and donors&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The Secretariat is currently developing a web-based tool to strengthen the management of the 
Fund through improved administrative and management processes and enhanced assistance and 
monitoring of the work of grantees.  The tool includes an online application, which would allow 
organizations to submit their funding requests, as well as an online reporting module for grantees 
to inform about the use of grants. 
</p>
<p>7. The application module has been designed and sent for testing to a group of selected 
grantees both from technically developed and less technically developed countries.  The 
feedback obtained from this testing exercise will be used to fine-tune the functionalities of the 
module.  The results will then be presented to the Board of Trustees at its twenty-sixth session. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  FINANCIAL SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Contributions received 
</b></p>
<p>8. The following contributions were recorded since the publication of the report of the

</b></p>
<p>9. At its twenty-fifth session, the Board allocated grants for an 18-month period from 
July 2006 to December 2007, hence completing the change in the funding cycle which will allow 
grantees to receive funding in January 2008 for the year 2008.  On the basis of the requests 
received for 2006, it is expected that approximately US$ 12 million will be requested for 2008. </p>
