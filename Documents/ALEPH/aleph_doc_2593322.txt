Harvest Natural Resources Announces
2016 Second Quarter Results
HOUSTON, August 9, 2016 — Harvest Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: HNR) (Harvest or the Company) today
announced 2016 second quarter earnings and provided an operational update.
Harvest reported a second quarter net loss of approximately $12.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with a net
loss of $25.4 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the same period last year. The second quarter results include
exploration charges of $0.4 million, or $0.01 pre-tax per diluted share, and non-recurring items related to expense on the
change in fair value of warrant derivative liability of $6.9 million, or $0.13 pre-tax per diluted share, income on the change
in fair value of embedded derivative assets of $1.7 million, or $0.03 pre-tax per diluted share, and transaction costs related
to the sale of Harvest-Vinccler Dutch Holding B.V. (Harvest Holding) of $1.6 million, or $0.03 pre-tax per diluted share.
Adjusted for exploration charges and the non-recurring items Harvest would have posted a second quarter net loss of
approximately $5.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, before any adjustment for income taxes.
Highlights for the second quarter of 2016 include:
Venezuela

based on the 3D seismic data acquired in late 2013 and processed during 2014.
The Company is considering options to develop, sell or farm-down the Dussafu PSC in order to obtain the maximum
value from this asset, while maintaining the required liquidity to continue our current operations.
Corporate
On June 29, 2016, Harvest and its wholly-owned subsidiary, HNR Energia B.V. (HNR Energia), entered into a Share

At the closing of the transaction, CT Energy or an affiliate will pay consideration consisting of:
$80 million in cash, subject to adjustment;
An 11% non-convertible senior promissory note payable to HNR Energia 6 months from the closing in the principal
amount of $12 million, which will be guaranteed by the controlling equityholder of CT Energy;

acquire up to 34,070,820 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to conditions set forth in the warrant.
To fund the Company’s transaction expenses and operations until the closing, CT Energy committed to loan the Company
$2 million per month for up to five months beginning on July 19, 2016 until the earlier of the closing or the termination of
the Share Purchase Agreement dated June 29, 2016.
CT Energy funded $2 million to Harvest on June 20, 2016 and again on July 19, 2016.

EXPLORATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
Dussafu Project — Gabon
Harvest has a 66.667 percent ownership interest in the Dussafu PSC through two separate acquisitions, and we are the
operator. The third exploration phase of the Dussafu PSC expired on May 27, 2016. The expiration of the exploration
phase has no effect on the discovered fields under the Exclusive Exploitation Authorization (EEA) as discussed below. All
expenditure commitments on this exploration phase have been completed. On March 26, 2014, the joint venture partners
approved a resolution that the discovered fields are commercial to exploit. On June 4, 2014, a Declaration of
Commerciality (DOC) was signed with Direction Generale Des Hydrocarbures (DGH) pertaining to four discoveries on the
Dussafu Project offshore Gabon. Furthermore, on July 17, 2014, the DGH awarded an EEA for the development and
exploitation of certain oil discoveries on the Dussafu Project and on October 10, 2014, the field development plan was
approved. The Company has four years from the date of the EEA approval to begin production.  In order to begin
production by July 2018, the current project plan being considered is to develop the area surrounding our Ruche well first,
followed by the development of the other fields and drilling selected high quality exploration prospects identified on 3D
seismic.
Operational activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, included continued evaluation of development plans,
based on the 3D seismic data acquired in late 2013 and processed during 2014.
Corporate
On June 29, 2016, Harvest and its wholly-owned subsidiary, HNR Energia, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement
with CT Energy, to sell all of the Company’s interest in Venezuela.
Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, CT Energy will acquire HNR Energia’s 51% interest in Harvest
Holding through which all of Harvest’s Venezuelan interests are owned, and CT Energy or an affiliate will deliver to
Harvest $80 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and a $12 million 6-month 11 percent note payable by CT
Energy or such affiliate.
At the closing, Harvest will also receive (i) cancellation of $30 million of outstanding debt held by CT Energy, (ii) return to
Treasury of CT Energy’s 8,667,597 shares of Harvest common stock, and (iii) cancellation of warrants held by CT Energy
to purchase 34,070,820 shares of Harvest common stock, exercisable under certain circumstances, at an exercise price of
$1.25 per share. Based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on June 28, 2016, the market value of the shares of
Harvest common stock held by CT Energy was $4.247 million.
After giving effect to the transaction, Harvest would cease to have a presence in Venezuela, and the existing relationship
between Harvest and CT Energy, which currently owns 16.8% of Harvest’s outstanding common stock, would terminate.
In addition, at the closing, the two CT Energy non-independent directors appointed in connection with CT Energy’s initial
investment in Harvest would resign from the Board of Directors. Going forward, Harvest’s primary assets would be its oil
and gas interests in Gabon and cash.
A special committee comprised of three independent and disinterested directors of Harvest, which did not include the
three directors nominated by CT Energy (the Special Committee), with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors,
carefully analyzed CT Energy’s offer, and after in-depth negotiations and thorough consideration, concluded that the
agreement was in the best interests of Harvest’s stockholders and unanimously approved the Share Purchase
Agreement. The Harvest Board unanimously approved the Share Purchase Agreement based on the Special
Committee’s recommendation.
In addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of outstanding shares of Harvest common stock, the
closing of the transaction is subject to, among other things, approval by a majority of outstanding shares held by non-CT
Energy affiliated stockholders and approvals by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Availability of
financing is not a condition to the transaction. Closing of the transaction would constitute a change of control under
agreements the Company has in place with Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo S.A. (CVP), a Petroleos de Venezuela
S.A. (PDVSA) affiliate, and Petroandina Resources Corporation N.V., as well as the Company’s incentive plans and
employment agreements with its executive officers and key employees.
At closing of the transaction, Harvest will repay all remaining outstanding debt held by CT Energy in excess of the
$30 million cancelled at closing. The current outstanding principal of the debt held by CT Energy stands at $32 million as
of June 30, 2016. The Company expects to issue additional debt to CT Energy of $2 million a month between now and
closing. Assuming a September 30, 2016 closing, the remaining principal and accrued interest the Company would pay
CT Energy at closing would be approximately $10 million. Net proceeds after payment of the remaining CT Energy debt,
taxes and transaction-related costs from the transaction are estimated to be $63 million. These transaction-related costs
include a reservation for potential change-of-control payments that could become payable under pre-existing agreements.
Subject to determinations to be made by the Board, the remaining proceeds may be used to pay dividends, to continue to
operate our business, or some combination of the two. The decision of the Board regarding how to use the remaining
proceeds will be based on its determination of what is in the best interests of Harvest and its stockholders at the time a
decision is made. Harvest will also continue to seek opportunities to sell its Gabon assets. To the extent the Company has
not sold its Gabon assets, Harvest intends to operate and develop those assets in the ordinary course of business.
NYSE Listing Requirements
On December 2, 2015, the Company received notification from the NYSE that the Company was not in compliance with
the NYSE’s continued listing standards, which require a minimum average closing price of $1.00 per share over 30
consecutive trading days. Under the NYSE’s rules, Harvest has a period of six months from the date of the NYSE notice to
bring its share price and 30 trading-day average share price back above $1.00. During this period, the Company’s
common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE under the symbol “HNR”, subject to the Company’s compliance
with other NYSE continued listing requirements, but will be assigned the notation .BC after the listing symbol to signify
that the Company is not currently in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standards. As required by the NYSE, in
order to maintain its listing, Harvest notified the NYSE that it intends to cure the price deficiency.
On April 25, 2016, the Company received a notice from the NYSE stating that the Company is not in compliance with a
second NYSE continued listing requirement, which provides that a company is not in compliance if its average global
market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $50 million and, at the same time, its
stockholders’ equity is less than $50 million. As required by NYSE rules, the Company notified the NYSE that, within
45 days of receipt of the notice, the Company will submit a business plan that demonstrates its ability to regain
compliance within 18 months. The NYSE accepted Harvest’s plan on July 14, 2016, and the Company is now subject to
quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan. If the Company fails to comply with the business plan, the NYSE may
commence suspension and delisting procedures.

Forward Looking Statements
This press release may contain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They include estimates and timing of
expected oil and gas production, oil and gas reserve projections of future oil pricing, future expenses, planned capital
expenditures, anticipated cash flow and our business strategy. All statements other than statements of historical facts may
constitute forward-looking statements. Although Harvest believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Actual results
may differ materially from Harvest’s expectations as a result of factors discussed in Harvest’s 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K and other public filings.
Harvest may use certain terms such as resource base, contingent resources, prospective resources, probable reserves,
possible reserves, non-proved reserves or other descriptions of volumes of reserves. These estimates are by their nature
more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly, are subject to substantially greater risk of being
actually realized by the Company.
