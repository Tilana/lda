<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment undertook a visit to Kyrgyzstan from 5 to 13 December 2011. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government for the 
invitation. He was encouraged by the concrete steps taken to curb torture, but remains 
concerned that there is a significant shortfall in legislation and law enforcement practices. 
The lack of effective legislative safeguards against torture and ill-treatment and the 
insignificant sanction provided for the crime of torture inevitably create an environment 
conducive to impunity. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of the information provided during meetings held with decision-
makers, victims and civil society representatives, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the 
use of torture and ill-treatment to extract confessions remains widespread. There is a 
serious lack of sufficiently speedy, thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment. The general conditions in most places of detention visited amount 
to inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>

<p> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Kyrgyzstan expedite 
legislative reforms to ensure the absolute prohibition of torture and establish effective 
safeguards against torture and ill-treatment in law and practice; initiate prompt, impartial 
and thorough investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment; and prosecute 
when warranted, without delay. He urges the Government to establish an effective national 
preventive mechanism in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and equip it with 
the necessary financial and human resources. He also recommends that the Government 
allocate sufficient budgetary resources to improve detention centre conditions. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to take decisive steps to ensure 
immediate and effective implementation of his recommendations, and calls on the 
international community to assist Kyrgyzstan in its fight against torture and ill-treatment by 
providing appropriate financial and technical support.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, conducted a visit to Kyrgyzstan from 5 to 13 December 
2011, at the invitation of the Government. The purpose of the visit was to assess the 
situation of torture and ill-treatment in the country, including conditions of detention, and to 
identify measures needed to prevent torture and ill-treatment in the future. 
</p>
<p>2. During his 9-day mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the President, the Vice-
speaker of the <i>Jogorku Kenesh</i> (Parliament), the Head of the Committee on Human Rights, 
Equal Opportunities and Public Associations of Parliament (Parliamentary Committee), the 
Deputy Ombudsman, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for the Interior, the 
Prosecutor General, the Minister for Justice, the Head of State Service for the Execution of 
Punishments, the Deputy Head of State Committee on National Security, the acting 
Chairwoman of the Supreme Court, the Ministers for Health, Education, and Social 
Protection, district and city representatives of above-mentioned ministries in Osh and 
Djalal-Abad, members of civil society organizations and representatives of United Nations 
agencies and other international organizations. He also met with victims of torture and their 
relatives, and visited places of deprivation of liberty in Bishkek, Chui, Osh and Djalal-Abad 
provinces. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for issuing 
authorization letters providing him with unrestricted access to all detention facilities in 
accordance with the terms of reference for fact-finding missions by special rapporteurs.1  
</p>
<p>4. Owing to time constraints, the Special Rapporteur selected a representative sample 
of places and facilities and visited a total of 15 detention centres of all types, including 
seven temporary detention facilities, four pretrial detention facilities, two police stations, a 
penal colony and one psychiatric hospital in different parts of the country.2 The testimonies 
heard about torture and ill-treatment shared the same pattern and were largely corroborated 
by forensic expertise. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to express appreciation to the Government for 
facilitating his unrestricted access to most of the places where persons are deprived of their 
liberty. Overall access was by and large granted to pretrial detention facilities under the 
jurisdiction of the State Service for the Execution of Punishments.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur had to wait, however, for duty officers to gain permission 
from their superiors before he was granted access to IVSs run by the Ministry of the 
Interior. On two occasions, the Special Rapporteur had to interrupt his visits owing to 
unacceptable restrictions to his working methods. At the temporary detention facility in 
Uzgen district (Osh province), the deputy head, Baky Diykanev, entered into lengthy 
negotiations with him, questioning the time and purpose of his visit, on the pretext that the 
visit was being conducted after working hours on Saturday. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
access to the temporary detention facility was eventually compromised with &#8220;no more than 
five minute&#8221; interviews with inmates, which he had to interrupt because of the officer&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>continued interference and agitation of inmates &#8220;to tell the truth&#8221;. At the temporary 
detention facility in Moscowskiy district (Chui province), its deputy head, Zarubek 
Ibraimov, also placed undue time restrictions on conversations with inmates, in addition to 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V. 
 2 In principle, a temporary detention facility (&#8220;IVS&#8221;) are used to hold inmates in the first 48 hours after 
</p>
<p>their arrest and before the courts have authorized their remand for trial. A pretrial detention facility 
(&#8220;SIZO&#8221;) is used to hold inmates from the initial court decision until trial. Penitentiary colonies are 
for inmates serving sentences. In principle, police stations do not hold detainees. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>being rude to the members of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s team. At the temporary detention 
facility of Osh City Interior, an officer went to the cells ahead of the Special Rapporteur 
telling inmates &#8220;you know what you have to say&#8221;. These incidents constitute serious 
</p>
<p>breaches of the terms of reference agreed upon by the Government of Kyrgyzstan. 
Moreover, any restrictions to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s right to unrestricted access to 
</p>
<p>detention facilities and any interference with private interviews with detainees leads him to 
suspect that these authorities wished to conceal evidence.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in particular its Regional Office 
for Central Asia, in Bishkek, the United Nations country team, the Resident Coordinator 
and others involved in organizing the visit, for the excellent assistance prior to and 
throughout the mission.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the 
close of his mission. On 20 January 2012, he sent an advanced preliminary version of the 
present report to the Government in English and a Russian language version on 24 January 
</p><p>2012. On 20 February 2012, the Government provided comments. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Kyrgyzstan is a party to the main United Nations human rights treaties prohibiting 
torture and ill-treatment, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Kyrgyzstan acceded to the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 2008. The State is also a signatory 
to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional level  
</b></p>
<p>10. Kyrgyzstan, as a participating State in the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has made a number of political commitments in the field of 
human rights. It is also a party to regional agreements, mainly in the field of security 
cooperation, such as the Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and 
Criminal Cases of the Commonwealth of Independent States . Kyrgyzstan is a member of 
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional and legislative provisions criminalizing torture  
</b></p>
<p>11. Article 22 of the Constitution promulgated on 27 June 2011 stipulates that &#8220;No one 
may be subject to torture or to other inhuman, cruel and degrading forms of treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; In addition, article 20, paragraph 4, of the Constitution provides that the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and other inhuman, cruel and degrading forms of treatment and 
punishment should not be subject to any limitations.  
</p>
<p>12. Article 305-1 of the Criminal Code, as amended in 2003, prescribes punishment for 
ill-treatment, including ill-treatment with the use of torture, in the form of imprisonment for 
a period of three to five years.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Although article 22 of the new Constitution reflects article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the prohibition of torture, under the Criminal 
Code torture belongs to the crimes of minor gravity involving lesser public danger; a charge 
of torture may be dropped if victims decide to withdraw their complaint or in the event of 
reconciliation. 3  The insignificant sanction provided for under article 305-1 inevitably 
creates an environment conducive to impunity as perpetrators usually get conditional 
sentencing as first-time offenders or are released on amnesty. In Kyrgyzstan, the crime of 
torture is not differentiated from other types of abuse of power, making it hard to 
distinguish torture from lesser forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The crime of torture can usually be prosecuted under other provisions of the 
Criminal Code, including &#8220;abuse of power&#8221; (art. 304), &#8220;exceeding power&#8221; (art. 305), 
</p>
<p>&#8220;negligence&#8221; (art. 316) or &#8220;forced deposition&#8221; (art. 325).  
</p>
<p>14. The current definition of torture in article 305-1 is incomplete and not fully in 
conformity with article 1 of the Convention against Torture. It limits criminal responsibility 
to &#8220;public officials&#8221; and does not criminalize torture committed by others acting in an 
</p>
<p>official capacity or by individuals acting at the instigation or with the consent or 
acquiescence of public officials. Furthermore, it does not refer to severe pain, and 
discrimination is not mentioned as a reason for committing torture. In addition, the specific 
offence of torture is not punishable by appropriate penalties commensurate with the gravity 
of the offence, as required by article 4, paragraph 2, of the Convention. The Special 
Rapporteur was encouraged to learn that a Ministry of Justice working group has drafted a 
law on amendments to the Criminal Code, to be submitted to Parliament, and that the bill 
will eventually correct the anomaly with regard to the penalty for torture.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Safeguards during arrest and detention  
</b></p>
<p>15. Article 24, parts 3 and 4, of the Constitution and article 39, part 2, of the Criminal 
Procedure Code provide that no one may be detained in custody for more than 48 hours 
without a judicial decision. The provision also details that detainees should be brought 
promptly or in any case before the expiration of the 48-hour period following the moment 
of apprehension before a court in order for it to decide on the lawfulness of detention.  
</p>
<p>16. While article 24, part 5, of the Constitution prescribes the right to legal counsel for 
any person in detention from the moment of the actual apprehension, the Code of Criminal 
Procedure delays this guarantee to the moment of the first interrogation or the moment of 
actual delivery to the institution in charge of conducting preliminary investigation (art. 40, 
part 4).  
</p>
<p>17. Articles 44 and 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide that, in the event the 
defence lawyer of choosing is not able to appear within 24 hours from the moment of arrest 
or custodial placement, the investigator is entitled to arrange for the designation of a State-
appointed defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>18. According to article 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, suspects should be 
interrogated in the presence of a defence lawyer. Prior to the interrogation, the arrested 
person is to be informed of his or her rights and of the offence suspected, in accordance 
with article 24, part 5, of the new Constitution.  
</p>
<p>19. According to the amendment to article 17 of the Law on Procedure and Conditions 
of the Detention of Persons Suspected or Accused of a Crime in Custody, an additional 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 3 According to the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, decisions about the discontinuation of criminal cases of 
</p>
<p>lesser gravity are adopted mainly on the basis of articles 28.1.12 and 28.1.14 (refusal to support 
accusation), article 29.1.2 (peaceful settlement) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and article 66.2 
(agreement reached with the victim) of the Criminal Code.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>written certificate, issued by the investigator, a prosecutor or the court and stating that the 
advocate is the attorney of record for the detainee&#8217;s case is required before the attorney is 
allowed to see his client. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about this recent 
amendment, which adds an unnecessary bureaucratic hurdle in the early hours of detention, 
when detainees have not yet appointed counsel of their own choosing; moreover, it creates 
an environment conducive to coercion. When used at that stage, it violates the principle of 
equality of arms established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(art. 14).  
</p>
<p>20. Although according to article 26, paragraph 4, of the new Constitution and article 81 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, evidence obtained in violation of the law should not be 
relied upon in court, article 81, part 4, of the Criminal Code does not explicitly mention 
evidence obtained through torture or other forms of ill-treatment, but simply lists the types 
of evidence that are inadmissible. Article 325 of the Criminal Code makes it a punishable 
offence for an investigator to obtain testimony during questioning through unlawful acts, 
and the Code of Criminal Procedure renders any confession given during the investigation 
procedure in the attorney&#8217;s absence inadmissible (article 81). The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>observes, however, that, in practice, there is no clear procedure in place prescribing the 
measures to be taken by courts should evidence appear to have been obtained through 
torture or ill-treatment. Furthermore, in practice, there appears to be no instruction to the 
courts with regard to implementing that rule or ordering an immediate, impartial and 
effective investigation if the rule is violated.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur recalls that international customary law and treaty law 
require States to ensure that any statement that is established to have been made as a result 
of torture is not to be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person 
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.4  This exclusionary rule is 
fundamental for upholding the absolute and non-derogable nature of the prohibition of 
torture by providing a disincentive to use torture. 5  It is imperative to ensure the 
inadmissibility of any extrajudicial statement that is not freely and promptly ratified before 
a court of law, and a specific prohibition of the use of extrajudicial statements even as 
&#8220;inferences&#8221; or &#8220;presumptions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Articles 16 and 19 of the Law on Procedure and Conditions of the Detention of 
Persons Suspected or Accused of a Crime in Custody, and the Rules on Internal 
Regulations of Temporary Detention Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (article 3.1) 
provide for the right of suspects and accused persons to receive visits and to correspond 
upon written permission of the investigator. Neither the Code of Criminal Procedure nor the 
Law on Procedure and Conditions of the Detention of Persons Suspected or Accused of a 
Crime in Custody include a provision on the right of suspects to a free telephone call with 
family members or relatives in accordance with Principle 19 of the Body of Principles for 
the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>23. According to article 40, part 5, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, every time a 
suspect is placed in a temporary detention facility and also when this person, his/her 
counsel or his/her family makes a complaint regarding physical abuse inflicted by agents of 
inquiry or investigation, the suspect is to undergo a compulsory and documented medical 
certification ordered by the administration of the temporary detention facility. Similar legal 
provisions apply to an accused person (art. 42, part 7). By decision of a head of the 
detention facility or investigator, or by request of a suspect or accused person or his/her 
counsel, medical certification may be performed by staff of health-care institutions to 
</p>

<p>document bodily injuries (article 23 of the Law on Procedure and Conditions of the 
Detention of Persons Suspected or Accused of a Crime in Custody). The Special 
Rapporteur observes that, in practice, the norms mentioned in the two paragraphs above are 
not duly implemented in Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Complaints and investigation of acts of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>24. Article 155 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires inquiry officers and 
prosecutors to accept, register and review reports or statements on committed or intended 
crimes. The complaint filing procedure requires the complaint to be forwarded to the 
relevant addressee immediately or within 24 hours for persons detained or taken into 
custody (art. 128). Furthermore, crime reports can be registered either in police stations or 
with national security bodies, or financial police. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in 
practice, the registration of crimes committed by police officers is often delayed, resulting 
in the loss of evidence. In addition, the centre responsible for the collection, analysis and 
storage of all crime-related information under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior 
reportedly lacks transparency and has no external oversight.  
</p>
<p>25. Under article 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, agencies of preliminary inquiry, 
such as the police, penitentiary institutions and pretrial detention centres, military 
institutions, agencies of national security, and financial police, upon the receipt of a 
complaint, are to conduct a preliminary inquiry prior to the initiation of criminal 
proceedings. In most cases, if any inquiries are held, the police investigate torture allegedly 
perpetrated by its own officials, and the same holds true for the Committee for National 
Security and the financial police. The Special Rapporteur observes that the preliminary 
inquiry usually concludes that the allegations of torture and ill-treatment have not been 
substantiated and do not merit a full-scale criminal investigation.  
</p>
<p>26. In addition, during the preliminary inquiry, victims are not given an opportunity to 
present evidence nor are they allowed to review the report of the preliminary inquiry, 
making it virtually impossible for them to appeal its findings successfully.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur observes that, although the legislation provides for various 
complaint channels, the fact remains that these mechanisms are marred by allegations of 
lack of independence and ineffectiveness and the complaints are essentially addressed to 
the very body alleged to have perpetrated the ill-treatment. Such circumstances jeopardize 
their public credibility and do not allow unbiased examination of complaints of torture by 
police officers. In addition, there is not enough public awareness about the existing 
complaint mechanisms or confidence in their protective role. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the heads of preliminary and pretrial 
detention facilities denied having received any complaints of torture or ill-treatment in the 
past five years. The denial or absence of official complaints leads to the conclusion that the 
existing complaints mechanisms lack credibility, making them de facto non-functional.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes that prosecutorial oversight, although exercised 
regularly, does not focus on receiving or detecting cases of torture, but mostly on 
conditions of detention. The Special Rapporteur believes that most detainees refrain from 
filing complaints with prosecutors or inquiry officers during their monitoring visits out of 
fear of reprisal. Furthermore, no protection is afforded by the State to victims of torture, 
given that the Law on the Protection of Rights of Witnesses, Victims and Other Parties of 
Criminal Proceedings does not envisage any enforcement mechanisms. The Ombudsman&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office, as part of its broad mandate, is also tasked with receiving complaints, including 
cases involving acts of torture or ill-treatment; however, it lacks capacity and the resources 
necessary to perform its tasks. According to the Deputy Ombudsman, in 2010, of 1,270 
complaints, only eight were related to torture.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur received reports indicating that the deadline set in article 
156, part 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the investigator or prosecutor to decide 
within three days (or 10 days in exceptional circumstances) whether to launch a criminal 
investigation is rarely observed. In addition, the required medical examination of the victim 
is usually delayed until the injuries have disappeared. With regard to torture, even the time 
established in law for deciding upon the initiation of a criminal investigation is excessively 
long; it prevents prompt and effective determination and preservation of evidence and the 
identification of perpetrators. Preliminary inquiries conducted by the Department of 
Internal Security of the Ministry of the Interior vis-a-vis its own colleagues against whom 
complaints have been made are also marred by a conflict of interest. There is also conflict 
of interest between the investigating and overseeing functions of prosecutorial authorities, 
given that criminal cases launched into allegations of torture by police officers during 
preliminary investigations cast a shadow over the effectiveness of oversight of the legality 
of investigation also overseen by the prosecutor&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the bill signed into law by the President on 9 
August 2011 on amendments and changes to the Criminal and Procedural Code of 
Kyrgyzstan, whereby investigations of offences envisaged in, inter alia, article 305-1 of the 
Criminal Code are to be conducted solely by the officers of the prosecutor&#8217;s office. The 
Special Rapporteur observes that, despite the fact that prosecutors have regained 
investigating functions over the crimes of torture and other ill-treatment, they lack real 
investigatory powers, depend on the police to conduct searches and seizures, and do not 
have their own operative groups or their own criminologists.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn from the Prosecutor General that 
efforts were being made to make the suspension of law enforcement officials from their 
posts mandatory, in view of the fact that, until very recently, before official charges were 
brought against public officials, the latter continued to hold their posts and were suspended 
only during the period of pretrial investigation.  
</p>
<p>32. The Code of Criminal Procedure makes passing references to rehabilitation in 
articles 225, 419, 422 and 225, part 2. It does not, however, prescribe in full terms the 
enforceable right of the victim to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for 
as full a rehabilitation as possible. The Special Rapporteur learned that there were no State-
supported specialized rehabilitation services for victims, nor were such programmes 
envisaged by the Government at the time of the visit.  
</p>
<p>33. Furthermore, it appears that, under article 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
the effective implementation of the right of torture victims to compensation is significantly 
hampered by strict procedural requirements, given that the right to compensation is 
recognized only upon a judicial verdict or a resolution of the investigating body or 
prosecutor.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation  
</b></p>
<p>34. Kyrgyzstan has undergone significant developments since 2010, including the 
adoption of the new Constitution, on 27 of June 2011; an invitation made by the President 
to an independent international commission of inquiry, the Kyrgyzstan Inquiry 
Commission, mandated to investigate facts and circumstances relating to incidents of inter-
ethnic violence in the south of Kyrgyzstan in June 2010; the holding of parliamentary and 
presidential elections, in 2010 and 2011 respectively, and the consequent formation of a 
new Government; the release, including by reduction of sentences, of thousands of 
prisoners under the Amnesty Act of 27 July 2011; the ratification by Parliament in March 
2010 of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political </p>

(&#8220;UMUT-2&#8221;) for the period 2011-2015; and three subsequent instructions issued by the 
Prosecutor General, in April, September and October 2011, on the prohibition of torture 
and the strengthening of prosecutorial control and oversight of prosecutorial negligence in 
cases of torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur learned that, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 41, various 
public advisory councils were established within the Ministry of the Interior and Prosecutor 
General&#8217;s office in Bishkek, Osh and Djalal-Abad, entrusted with monitoring places of 
detention. In addition, public monitoring councils, which comprise representatives from 
civil society, were created under the Ministry of the Interior, the State Service for the 
Execution of Punishments and the State Committee of National Security to monitor 
detention facilities and other closed institutions. Furthermore, a draft law on the police 
force and the prospect of reforming the Ministry of the Interior are both under discussion. 
The draft bill on the national centre for the prevention of torture has been finalized and is to 
be submitted to Parliament for discussion early in 2012. It is also encouraging that, since 
May 2011, three memorandums of understanding have been signed by prosecutors and civil 
society organizations &#8211; for Djalal-Abad province, for Osh City and for Osh province &#8211; 
providing for public councils to identify solutions and building confidence in the 
prosecutorial authorities. The first initiative of the public councils was the installation of 
closed-circuit cameras in some temporary detention facilities in Djalal-Abad province.  
</p>
<p>36. In addition, in 2010 and 2011, several monitoring initiatives were undertaken by 
various public advisory councils and the Parliamentary Committee to examine the 
conditions in temporary and pretrial detention facilities. The purpose of the monitoring 
visits was to, inter alia, propose budgetary allocations for the maintenance of the facilities. 
Of particular interest to the Special Rapporteur were the findings of the project on torture 
prevention in temporary detention facilities under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, initiated 
by the OSCE Centre in Bishkek, the Ombudsman and a group of civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Practice of torture and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur received numerous accounts and eyewitness testimonies 
suggesting that torture and ill-treatment had been historically pervasive in the law 
enforcement sector. This practice has been intensified by the turbulence of the past two 
years with the ousting of President Bakiev in April 2010, followed by the violence that took 
place in the South in June 2010.6 During the violence in June 2010 and its aftermath, reports 
consistently highlighted the frequency and gravity of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-
treatment by law enforcement bodies.  
</p>
<p>38. Throughout the mission, testimonies of victims and their lawyers pointed to general 
patterns of torture and ill-treatment committed by police officers after arrest and during the 
first hours of informal interrogation. During interviews with victims, the Special 
Rapporteur heard multiple allegations of torture that shared the same pattern: asphyxiation 
with plastic bags and gas masks with no flow of oxygen; punches and beatings with 
truncheons; the application of electric shock and the introduction of foreign objects into the 
anus, or the threat of rape. Police stations, temporary detention facilities, the premises of 
criminal police departments of the Ministry of the Interior and the pretrial detention facility 
of the State Committee of National Security were the locations most often cited as where 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 6 Long-standing ethnic tensions in the south of the country escalated in 2010. The main outbreak of 
</p>
<p>violence began in Osh in June and later spread to Djalal-Abad, resulting in several hundred deaths 
and more than 1,000 people injured (Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the ill-treatment occurred. The Special Rapporteur was told that the use of torture by the 
criminal investigation police was exacerbated by the heavy reliance on confessions in the 
judicial system. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur has concluded that, in the immediate aftermath of the 
violence of June 2010, there was a significant increase of continued arbitrary arrests and 
detentions, incidents of forced confession under the use of torture and ill-treatment during 
arrest and while in detention, denial of access to a lawyer of one&#8217;s choosing, denial of 
independent medical aid, threats and extortion of money in exchange for dropping or 
mitigating charges. These incidents, usually committed by the operative-investigating 
officers of the Ministry of the Interior during the first hours of apprehension and 
interrogation, continued to be widespread throughout 2011.  
</p>
<p>40. The commission of acts of torture was further facilitated by the lack of effective 
safeguards during the first hours of arrest, non-compliance with regulations requiring the 
prompt registration of persons arrested, failure to notify family members immediately 
following an arrest, delayed independent medical examinations and the complicity of State-
appointed lawyers with investigators who offer a purely token presence and who are seen as 
being formally present to rubberstamp the decisions of the investigator.    
</p>
<p>41. On the basis of the information received and interviews conducted with relatives of 
victims, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the deaths in custody reported and lack of 
accountability for them were not isolated instances. Independent investigations launched 
into deaths in custody are the exception rather than the rule.7 In addition, relatives of the 
victims often come under pressure from the police to withdraw their complaints or to settle 
and have the case closed.  
</p>
<p>42. The authorities of the Ministry of the Interior were unable to provide precise 
statistics on the number of deaths in custody; they did, however, list the main causes of 
deaths, including suicides and alcohol and drug overdoses. In terms of procedure, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that a forensic examination was performed and 
investigation was initiated into the circumstances of the death. According to the statistics 
provided by the State Service for the Execution of Punishments, during the period 2007-
2011, there was a decrease in the number of deaths in penitentiary institutions and pretrial 
detention facilities under the oversight of the Service. Of 151 deaths in 2007, five were 
caused by bodily injuries; in 2010, there were only two deaths of pretrial detainees caused 
by bodily injuries out of 90; and in the first 11 months of 2011, of 81 deaths, five were 
caused by bodily injuries: one in the pretrial period, and four post-conviction.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of effective safeguards and prevention 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur has concluded that there is a serious lack of effective 
safeguards during the first hours of detention. Owing to the failure to register suspects at 
the time of apprehension, persons deprived of their liberty are extremely vulnerable to 
torture and ill-treatment, given that it is during this time when basic safeguards are 
generally not provided for in practice and the arrested person remains without any 
protection.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Unrecorded detention and denial of access to lawyer<i>s</i>  
</b></p>
<p>44. In all places visited, the dates of arrest, transfer to other facilities and release from 
custody were properly registered and records maintained. Most detainees indicated that 
they had seen judges and prosecutors and that, in most cases, &#8220;duty lawyers&#8221; were present 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 7 See CCPR/C/94/D/1275/2004. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>at the various stages of custody and judicial process. In practice, however, any torture or 
coercion had by then already taken place &#8211; at the time of apprehension and transfer to a 
police station, an action that is not recorded. The law authorizes police to make an arrest on 
suspicion of criminal responsibility and without judicial warrant, which by itself constitutes 
an invitation to mistreatment. On the other hand, the law also states that, within three hours 
of making an arrest, the police officer must take the person to an investigating officer or 
release him or her. The irregular &#8211; but almost routine &#8211; procedure of unregistered arrest 
makes it impossible to establish whether the three-hour maximum term for the first stage of 
deprivation of liberty is observed. Similarly, the 12-hour period envisaged for notification 
of family members about the arrest by the investigator, as stipulated in article 99 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, appears to be an ineffective safeguard.  
</p>
<p>45. Almost all detainees interviewed indicated that they had been subjected to 
mistreatment or beating since the time of apprehension and delivery to the temporary 
detention facility for the purpose of extracting a confession. During this unaccounted period 
of time, suspects may be held in unofficial detention settings (unregistered custody), such 
as in police vehicles or office rooms, where police officers have &#8220;conversations&#8221; with 
</p>
<p>suspects or witnesses. This involves inviting a person to the police station without 
recording the time and purpose of the visit, and often holding a person incommunicado for 
an unlimited period of time. These individuals do not in effect enjoy the rights that are 
provided for by criminal procedure law to suspects or accused.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Evidence obtained under torture  
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur received reports according to which, in practice, confessions 
obtained under torture are not expressly excluded as evidence in court. Moreover, the 
majority of verdicts in criminal cases are mostly based on voluntary confessional 
statements made during the investigation or at the time of surrender. In addition, the courts 
encourage this practice by giving undue weight to confessions when evaluating evidence. If 
a defendant claims during trial that the confession was obtained through torture, the courts 
either ignore such statements altogether or conduct a superficial inquiry by simply 
questioning the police officers in court. After the officers deny the use of torture, the judge 
concludes that the defendant&#8217;s allegations are not substantiated and should be treated as an 
</p>
<p>effort to avoid justice.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Lack of ex officio investigations  
</b></p>
<p>47. Under current legislation, acts of torture and ill-treatment are not investigated ex 
officio, but only at the request of the victim once a motion has been received from the 
defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur received information and heard testimonies according to 
which, in trials relating to the violence of June 2010, judges and prosecutors repeatedly 
failed to act on information of torture or ill-treatment supplied by defendants or their 
lawyers. The Special Rapporteur heard multiple allegations and received reports according 
to which judges often ignored allegations of torture made by defendants, or silenced the 
defendants to halt descriptions of how they had been ill-treated during investigation. In 
several cases, courts dismissed allegations of torture, claiming that the allegations were 
groundless because the defendant or his/her lawyer had not submitted complaints to the 
prosecutors ahead of the trial.  
</p>
<p>49. The decision of the Supreme Court of 20 December 2011 upholding the life sentence 
for prominent human rights defender Azimjan Askarov and other defendants convicted in 
relation to the violence of June 2010, despite reports of his torture in detention and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>defendants&#8217; claims that confessions had been extracted under duress,8 is an example of the 
highest judicial body&#8217;s failure to act on allegations of torture and ill-treatment. The recent 
decision of the Supreme Court of 9 December 2011, which upheld the lower instance 
courts&#8217; ruling on the acquittal of four policemen prosecuted for torturing the victim, even 
though there was sound medical evidence in the record of savage acts of torture, is yet 
another discouraging example of a failed administration of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Burden of proof and independent medical examinations 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was not able to obtain information on any instance when 
judges and prosecutors are known to have ordered medical examinations at their own 
initiative in response to allegations or signs of abuse. International law and precedent 
clearly puts the burden on the State and its agents to initiate investigations ex officio 
whenever there is any suspicion of torture.9 
</p>
<p>51. Needless to say, it is hard to prove torture when medical examinations by 
independent and impartial forensic experts are not promptly conducted. Even in those 
cases, the defendants should not have to bear the burden of proof of coercion to exclude 
self-incriminating statements, especially if they recant at the first opportunity they have to 
talk to a judge. Since independent medical examinations must be authorized by the 
supervising authority (such as the investigators, the prosecutors or the penitentiary 
authorities), that authority has ample opportunity to delay authorization so that any injuries 
deriving from torture have healed by the time an examination is conducted. The evidence 
suggests that detainees are often held for longer periods until the signs of torture have 
disappeared, at which stage they are transferred to a pretrial detention facility. As a result, a 
forensic examination might identify bruises but fail to establish the time of mistreatment. 
At trial, courts tend not to take into account conclusions other than the ones provided by 
official State-appointed forensic experts. In addition, State forensic medical examinations 
take priority over the opinions provided by independent experts proposed by defence 
counsel. The Special Rapporteur was informed that forensic doctors in Kyrgyzstan do not 
have adequate training on documenting torture and other forms of ill-treatment and, 
because of the existing institutional set-up, lack independence from the authorities in whose 
custody the alleged ill-treatment took place. Their offices and laboratories are heavily 
under-equipped owing to the general budgetary restraints in the country.  
</p>
<p>52. Judges are widely seen as formally present at the criminal process, but mainly to 
rubberstamp decisions of investigating officers or prosecutors rather than take a genuine 
interest in following up on torture allegations. The overwhelming majority of interviewees 
stated that neither at the first hearing to sanction pretrial detention nor during the trial itself 
had any judge asked about the treatment during the initial period of custody. Moreover, if 
victims made allegations of torture or ill-treatment, they were routinely silenced. The 
Special Rapporteur was unable to obtain information on cases where evidence had been 
excluded because it was found to have been obtained under torture.10 A worrying feature of 
the system repeatedly described to the Special Rapporteur is that, since crimes need to be 
solved, previous convicts are often accused of having committed them and their cases are

 10 The Government provided the Special Rapporteur with a decision of a local court (in Kyrgyz 
</p>
<p>language) indicating that the defendant was acquitted as the confession was declared to have been 
obtained illegally. A single case, however, does not change the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view that, in

</p>
<p>simply fabricated, often by obtaining confession under duress, to which false evidence is 
then added. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Impunity and lack of effective investigation of torture allegations 
</b></p>
<p>53. According to the Prosecutor General, more than 5,000 criminal investigations were 
opened into crimes relating to the events of June 2010 by an interdepartmental investigative 
working group under the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, comprising police and security 
</p>
<p>bodies. Many cases were, however, terminated owing to lack of evidence. This put a strain 
on reportedly ill-prepared police and investigative bodies, institutionally prone to use 
torture and ill-treatment against detainees to compensate for an embedded lack of 
investigative capacity. For that difficult task, it counted only on police operatives and 
investigating officers as well as national security agents, all of whom had long been 
associated with allegations of extraction of confessions under torture and ill-treatment. 
Such bodies are notoriously unable to complete criminal investigations and deliver results 
in complex cases in ways that uphold the rule of law and thereby re-establish the trust of 
citizens in State institutions. Perhaps inevitably, the investigative efforts of the criminal 
justice process brought about an unprecedented scale of legally suspect convictions and 
triggered further violations, including denial of due process guarantees. This was carried 
out against a backdrop of existing concerns over independence and impartiality of the 
judicial oversight. There is also alarming evidence that many criminal proceedings were 
marred by widely reported bias against members of certain ethnic minorities.11 
</p>
<p>54. According to information provided by the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, as at 
December 2011, there have been no convictions for torture and very few prosecutions (if 
any) since article 305-1 was introduced into the Criminal Code in 2003. In 2010, the Office 
received a total of 251 complaints regarding abuse of power, including with use of violence 
(art. 305), and 14 complaints regarding torture (art. 305-1). Only six criminal cases were 
launched concerning torture complaints, of which five cases were sent to court; the other 
eight cases were dismissed. In 2010, three people were subjected to disciplinary measures. 
During the first nine months of 2011, the Office received 200 complaints regarding abuse 
of power and 31 complaints of torture, of which 13 criminal investigations were launched 
and 18 cases dismissed. During the same period, 36 people were punished with disciplinary 
measures. In 2011, for the first time, five police officers were convicted of abuse of power 
and received suspended sentences. According to the Ministry of the Interior, during the first 
10 months of 2011, eight criminal cases were initiated against police officers by the 
Ministry; only two of those cases were submitted to court, and no decision had yet been 
reached at the time of the visit. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that serious human rights violations 
committed in the context of ongoing investigations into the events of June 2010 and after 
have continued unabated in recent months. There is a serious lack of sufficiently speedy, 
thorough and impartial investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment, as well as 
a lack of prosecution of alleged law enforcement officials. The efforts made by the interim 
Government to investigate and punish the abuses that resulted from the events of June 2010 
have proved to be largely ineffective.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur received credible reports according to which official replies 
of prosecutors do not usually contain information on how the decision not to initiate a 
criminal investigation was reached. It is reported that preliminary inquiries have been 
frequently inadequate as prosecutors fail to take all possible steps to verify allegations of 
torture. In several cases, prosecutors relied on inconclusive forensic examinations to decide 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>not to investigate; in others, prosecutors did not interrogate the victim about allegations, nor 
were steps taken to question witnesses or medical personnel. 
</p>
<p>57. While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the concrete steps taken by the 
Prosecutor General vis-&#224;-vis the recent instructions (see paragraph 34 above), it remains to 
be seen how these directives will be implemented at the city and provincial levels. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Temporary and pretrial detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>58. Currently, all 47 temporary detention facilities are under the oversight of the 
Ministry of the Interior. The State Committee for National Security has its own pretrial 
detention facilities in Bishkek and Osh. The average length of stay at a pretrial detention 
facility varies from 9 to 12 months. All 11 correctional colonies, including three institutions 
for tuberculosis patients, a juvenile penitentiary, a colony for women, six pretrial detention 
facilities and 15 settlement colonies are under the jurisdiction of the State Service for the 
Execution of Punishments. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the prison population has significantly 
dropped in recent years, from 16,934 in 2004 to 9,698 in 2011 12  (not including the 
temporary and pretrial detention facilities of the National Security Committee). It is worth 
noting, however, that the penitentiary policies applied have an essentially punitive nature 
rather than aim at reintegrating prisoners into society. The execution of sentences still 
consists of placing convicted persons in standard, reinforced or strict regime penal colony 
settlements.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur observed that conditions in a temporary detention facility, a 
pretrial detention facility and a penal colony varied from being adequate (pretrial detention 
facilities No. 1 in Bishkek and No. 25 in Osh) to unsatisfactory (most temporary detention 
facilities visited) to appalling (Kara Suu district pretrial detention facility in Osh province). 
Most facilities visited were characterized by unsanitary conditions and poor or non-existent 
ventilation or daylight; most lacked heating. In temporary detention facilities built as early 
as 1923, inmates are confined for 23 hours a day to their poorly illuminated cells with little 
or no ventilation and minimum food and water. Cells contain four to six mattresses on the 
floor or on bunk beds and provide little space for movement. In most temporary detention 
facilities, showers with no hot water were located at an outside court and access to them 
was restricted to once a week. In some temporary detention facilities, detainees are allowed 
to use the toilet only twice a day at scheduled times; it is also their only opportunity to 
walk. Access to water for washing is extremely restricted. Meals are of very poor quality, 
and in most facilities, consist of only one serving a day, plus hot water for tea. Families are 
allowed to bring supplementary food supplies.  
</p>
<p>61. Tuberculosis patients in facilities visited were separated. In almost all temporary and 
pretrial detention facilities visited, there was no separation between convicted and pretrial 
inmates. Most detainees indicated that their arrest had been confirmed by a court within the 
first 48 hours, as provided by law (albeit counted from the initial interrogation, not the 
actual detention). Most inmates interviewed confirmed that, however, their detention in a 
temporary detention facility continued after that court hearing instead of being remanded to 
a pretrial detention facility, as the law would require. Continued detention in temporary 
detention facilities can last from one month to several months, and even a year. This was 
explained by the fact that transfers from a temporary to a pretrial detention facility are only 
</p>

</b></p>

</p>
<p>conducted once every 10 to 15 days. In addition, most correctional facilities are located in 
the Chui region, while other regions do not have custodial institutions. In practice, owing to 
the shortage of pretrial detention facilities and the need for prolonged investigations, 
temporary facilities are used as pretrial ones.  
</p>
<p>62. In temporary detention facilities, access to and the length of family visits are 
determined by investigating officers on a case-by-case basis, which is an incentive for 
bribery and arbitrariness. The Special Rapporteur observed that most pretrial detainees in 
temporary detention facilities were either not aware of their right to receive visits from their 
families or thought that they were not entitled to it during pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>63. There is no permanent medical presence in temporary detention facilities, and health 
emergencies are handled by simply calling an ambulance. While existing medical personnel 
in pretrial detention facilities employed by the Ministry of the Interior and the penitentiary 
administration perform check-ups upon arrival, they clearly lack independence, because 
they are accountable to the prison administration. If a medical worker observes bodily 
injuries tending to show evidence of torture, in the absence of a complaint, his or her report 
will rarely provide a description of injuries. In addition, medical personnel lack specific 
training in assessing and documenting cases of torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>64. With the caveat in mind that, in some temporary detention facilities visited, the 
administration placed undue pressure on inmates and pressured them &#8220;to tell the truth&#8221;, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur did not receive complaints of mistreatment by facility employees. 
Invariably, inmates who reported having been tortured stated that they had been ill-treated 
before they arrived at the detention facility. They did, nevertheless, complain about general 
conditions at their place of detention, access to and length of family visits, lack of adequate 
food and access to drinking water, length of detention in the facility and the absence of any 
information about their fate. Several detainees indicated that they had had no contact with 
their relatives since detention. The almost total denial of contact with the outside world, 
often for prolonged periods, clearly contradicts the principle of the presumption of 
innocence and puts disproportionate psychological pressure on suspects. Outside temporary 
facilities, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies about reprisals by the administration of 
the facility against inmates filing a complaint. 
</p>
<p>65. Conditions in pretrial detention facilities and the colony visited were relatively 
bearable, although the infrastructure was in a deplorable state. All four facilities visited had 
modestly equipped medical units, but there was an acute shortage of medical personnel, 
especially dentists and gynaecologists, and no psychiatric assistance. Family visits were 
only authorized on a case-by-case basis by the investigator. Meals (of poor nutritional 
value) were served three times a day. 
</p>
<p>66. In all facilities visited, the administration acknowledged the appalling conditions, 
old buildings and low budgetary allocations. Some heads of temporary and pretrial 
detention facilities are overly reliant on international help and funding to maintain 
minimum detention conditions and to install closed-circuit cameras in interrogation rooms 
and in common areas of the facilities (in Djalal-Abad province). Some detention facilities 
currently run harm-reduction programmes for drug users, including substitution medication 
and needle exchange. 
</p>
<p>67. The police stations visited &#8211; in poor condition but well maintained &#8211; did not have 
holding cells. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Women in detention  
</b></p>
<p>68. Women are separated from men and juveniles are, with some exceptions, held 
separate from adults. For women in detention, conditions are generally better than in men&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>cells. In only one pretrial facility were there female guards as required by international </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p>minimum standards. In pretrial facility No. 1, a terminally ill woman continued to be 
detained. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to release the woman on 
humanitarian grounds. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Inmates serving life imprisonment  
</b></p>
<p>69. Following the abolition of the death penalty in 2007, more than 200 death penalty 
sentences have been commuted to life imprisonment. Currently the 259 prisoners sentenced 
to life imprisonment are housed in various pretrial detention centres. In facility No. 1 and 
Colony No. 47, inmates live in basements in dreadful conditions, confined in virtual 
isolation and solitary confinement in cells built in 1943 and designed for death row 
prisoners. Their isolation is applied automatically because of their life sentence and is not 
related in any way to their behaviour in custody. In effect, the system has given up on any 
possibility of rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the construction in the village of Jany-Jer 
of a special building for inmates serving life terms had been delayed for years owing to lack 
of funding.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Psychiatric institutions  
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur received a favourable impression of the Kyzyl-Yhar 
psychiatric hospital in Djalal-Abad province, which was clean and well maintained, 
although the infrastructure itself is very old and the facility has a shortage of doctors. At the 
time of the visit, 36 patients were undergoing forced treatment. Some 25 pretrial detainees 
under criminal investigation were undergoing a judicial-psychiatric expert evaluation. 
</p>
<p>72. Although no cases of mistreatment were identified at the time of the visit, the 
Special Rapporteur received reports of ill-treatment of patients, including complaints about 
the extensive use of tranquilizers when patients do not comply with orders. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations

<p><b>transition is an excellent opportunity to lay down the foundation of the absolute 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibition of torture and to incorporate constitutional provisions into all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative acts.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In this context, the open recognition of the existence of torture and ill-treatment 
by the current and former President, the deputy Speaker, the Head of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Parliamentary Committee and the Prosecutor General reflects a clear political will to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat torture and ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur heard of no such 
</b></p>
<p><b>instructions communicated by the responsible officials of the Ministry of the Interior 
</b></p>
<p><b>to condemn torture and ill-treatment or to declare unambiguously that torture and ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment by police officers would not be tolerated.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of ensuring that torture is 
defined as a serious crime, in compliance with the definition of torture in article 1 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Convention against Torture, and that all acts of instigation of, consent to or 
</b></p>
<p><b>acquiescence in torture by public officials or other persons acting in an official </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>capacity are criminalized and supported by adequate penalties commensurate with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the gravity of the offence.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur concludes that arbitrary arrests and forced confessions 
continue. The same applies to ill-treatment and coercion during arrest and while 
</b></p>
<p>suspects are in unregistered police custody, denial of access to a lawyer of one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>choosing, lack of independent medical aid, and threats and extortion in exchange for 
</b></p>
<p><b>dropping charges. These abuses are usually committed by operative and investigating 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers during the first hours after apprehension.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The absence of prompt, impartial and full investigations into allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment makes such acts a crime that goes unpunished. Impunity in 
</b></p>
<p><b>turn reinforces reliance on confessions in the administration of criminal justice and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the unfettered discretion of investigating officers to authorize or refuse independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>forensic expertise. Cases of torture are practically not addressed and perpetrators are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not punished. It is imperative that public confidence in the judiciary and in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fairness and predictability of its rulings be restored. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Conditions in pretrial detention facilities are far from compliance with 
international standards and amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur realizes that the penitentiary system is severely underfunded and 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffers from decades of accumulated problems; he nonetheless believes that, with no 
</b></p>
<p><b>current overcrowding in places of detention, improving decrepit infrastructures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be easier. Reliance on international assistance and ad hoc projects is, however, 
</b></p>
<p><b>not a sustainable solution. A coordinated approach and State budgetary allocations 
</b></p>
<p><b>are needed to improve the inhuman conditions in temporary detention facilities. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition, while recognizing that many of the problems observed are caused by a lack 
</b></p>
<p><b>of resources, he notes that some important steps could be taken that are not resource-
</b></p>
<p><b>dependent, such as establishing stronger legal and procedural safeguards and a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>widespread application of non-custodial measures for persons accused of petty crimes.  
</b></p>
<p>79. Despite the Government&#8217;s move to open the detention facilities to external 
<b>oversight, access is still on an ad hoc basis and has limited impact. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur was unable to obtain information on any complaints initiated following 
</b></p>
<p>visits by monitoring bodies. Likewise, the Ombudsman&#8217;s office is unable to ensure 
</p>
<p><b>regular and effective oversight of detention places. It is therefore imperative that a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national preventive mechanism be established in accordance with the Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and that it be equipped with the and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human resources necessary to embark on its mission. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government, with appropriate assistance from the international community, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the United Nations and other actors, take decisive steps to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Amend, as a matter of priority, article 305-1 of the Criminal Code to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that torture is defined as a serious crime in accordance with article 1 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Torture, sanctioned with penalties commensurate with the gravity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the crime; And ensure in the Law on Amnesty that no person convicted for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>crime of torture will be entitled to benefit from an act of amnesty; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that legislation concerning evidence presented in judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings is brought into line with the provisions of article 15 of the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Torture in order to exclude explicitly any evidence or extrajudicial statement 
</b></p>
<p><b>obtained under duress, unless the person interrogated affirms the veracity of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>statement before a judge, and that persons convicted on the basis of such evidence are 
</b></p>
<p><b>acquitted and released; and ensure that any allegation of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>made in court is promptly dealt with by the judicial authorities without the need for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific motion by the defence lawyer;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Amend the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Law on Procedure and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conditions of the Detention of Persons Suspected or Accused of Crime to include a 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision on the right of the suspect to one free telephone call with family members or 
</b></p>
<p><b>relatives; and reduce the 12-hour period envisaged for notification of arrest by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigator to the family stipulated in article 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Amend the Code of Criminal Procedure and other legislative acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including the law on operational investigations and search activities) with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the time period starting from the moment of actual arrest until the formal 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiation of the criminal case is in accordance with international standards, with clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>designation of procedural status, rights and safeguards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Safeguards and prevention 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure strict adherence to registration from the very moment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>apprehension, abolish unacknowledged custodies and ensure strict surveillance 
</b></p>
<p><b>devices in police stations; make police station chiefs and investigating and operative 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers criminally accountable for any unacknowledged detention and make it a 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious crime; define clearly the ability and obligation of judges to inspect places of 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention and enforce the prohibition on unacknowledged detention and torture by 
</b></p>
<p>initiating criminal prosecutions; ensure that access to lawyers of the suspect&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p><b>choosing is granted from the very moment of apprehension; and repeal the recent 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictions on access by lawyers to their defendants requiring multiple 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Overhaul the system of State-appointed lawyers completely and replace 
</b></p>
<p><b>it with an open and transparent process of fairly remunerated independent lawyers, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>process that is not controlled in practice by the investigating officers; and foresee the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of national legal aid programmes that guarantee access to a lawyer for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all detainees, including prior to interrogation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Set in legislation a minimum timeline within which medical examination 
</b></p>
<p><b>is to be provided without delay, in conformity with the Manual on Effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>Treatment or Punishment (Istanbul Protocol);</b> <b>ensure timely access to independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical examination at all stages of the criminal process, in particular when the 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspect is placed in a temporary police detention facility, when taken out for any 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigative activity, and upon return ensure that a forensic examination is conducted 
</b></p>
<p>on the basis of the victim&#8217;s application or his/her lawyer&#8217;s motion for forensic service 
</p>
<p><b>as a matter of law subject to judicial review in the event of delay or refusal, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports of independent forensics are attributed the same evidentiary weight as reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>prepared by State-appointed forensic experts; and ensure that independent forensic 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports are admissible in court upon submission by a defence counsel without any 
</b></p>
<p><b>prior approval by an investigator or a State prosecutor to include them in the case 
</b></p>
<p><b>file;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Expedite a prompt, impartial and thorough investigation into all 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertake public prosecutions without delay where the evidence warrants them; 
</b></p>
<p><b>unless the allegation is manifestly unfounded, those involved should be suspended 
</b></p>
<p><b>from their duties during the investigation and proceedings;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Increase the number of qualified health personnel in temporary and 
</b></p>
<p><b>pretrial detention facilities and ensure that medical staff in places of detention are 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent by transferring them from the State Service for the Execution of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Punishments and the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Health; and provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>forensic medical services with training in the medical investigation of torture and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other forms of ill-treatment;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Recall that evidentiary rules </b>&#8211;<b> and their incorrect interpretation -- 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not reward police and investigator misconduct; the exclusion of evidence at 
</b></p>
<p><b>trial is one effective means to combat misconduct and abuses in the course of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal investigation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that defence lawyers are given procedural opportunities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>collect evidence independently of investigators through, inter alia, the deposition of 
</b></p>
<p><b>witnesses and experts directly before a judge;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Shift the burden of proof to prosecution to prove beyond reasonable 
</b></p>
<p><b>doubt that a confession or other evidence has not been obtained under any kind of 
</b></p>
<p><b>duress, and consider filming and audiotaping interrogations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Encourage judges and prosecutors to routinely ask persons arriving 
</b></p>
<p><b>from police custody how they have been treated and to order an independent medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>examination if they suspect that the detainee has been subjected to ill-treatment; an ex 
</b></p>
<p><b>officio investigation should be initiated whenever there are reasonable grounds to 
</b></p>
<p><b>believe that a confession has been obtained through the use of torture and ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment; these cases tried under article 305-1 of the Criminal Code are prosecutable 
</b></p>
<p><b>ex officio and should not be subject to terminat</b>ion upon the victim&#8217;s request;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Improve the effectiveness of existing alternatives to pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and consider the introduction of new alternatives by encouraging the use of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>custodial measures such as bail, reporting to a police station, radio-monitored 
</b></p>
<p><b>bracelets and house arrest;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Establish clearly set out enforcement mechanisms to provide victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>with effective remedy and redress, including compensation and as full rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>as possible by allocating funds in the national budget; and fulfil the right of the victim 
</b></p>
<p><b>to obtain redress through civil litigation regardless of whether the guilt of a public 
</b></p>
<p><b>agent has been determined by a court on a criminal case; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Establish an effective national preventive mechanism in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, ensure budgetary allocations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equip the mechanism with sufficient human and other resources to enable it to 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspect all places of detention regularly, to receive complaints, initiate prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and follow them through to their conclusions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Consider adopting a law to allow regular inspections of all places of 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention by an independent monitoring mechanism (in addition to the national 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventive mechanism); ensure that oversight mechanisms, inter alia, public advisory 
</b></p>
<p><b>councils, are able to conduct unimpeded and effective oversight of places of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that their findings and recommendations are made public; and introduce 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent, effective and accessible complaint mechanisms to all places of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the installation of telephone hotlines or confidential complaints boxes, and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that every detainee has unimpeded and unsupervised access to the prosecutor 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon request and that complainants do not suffer any reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Ensure that pretrial detainees are transferred from temporary detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities to pretrial detention centres at the expiration of the 48-hour period. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Conditions of detention  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Appoint a high-level commission of multidisciplinary, credible specialists 
</b></p>
<p><b>to conduct an urgent inspection of all detention centres with the aim of closing down 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediately all facilities that are declared unfit for human habitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Allocate sufficient budgetary resources to improve conditions in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention facilities with a view to provide adequate health care, improve food quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure the separation of minors from adults and of pretrial prisoners from 
</b></p>
<p><b>convicts; and design the system of execution of punishments in a way that truly aims 
</b></p>
<p><b>at rehabilitating and reintegrating offenders by abolishing restrictive regimes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>creating work opportunities and recreational activities for inmates; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Eliminate the complete isolation of inmates sentenced to life 
</b></p>
<p><b>imprisonment and move them to open or semi-open facilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Institutional reforms  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Complete the ongoing reform of the police apparatus, and have the 
</b></p>
<p><b>highest authorities, in particular those responsible for law enforcement activities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>declare unambiguously that they will not tolerate torture or ill-treatment by their 
</b></p>
<p><b>subordinates and that perpetrators will be held to account; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Take measures to transfer authority over temporary detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the Ministry of the Interior to the State Service for the Execution of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Punishments;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) </b>Raise the awareness of personnel of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office and 
</p>
<p><b>investigating officers of the Ministry of the Interior of their role in preventing torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ill-treatment, by means of mandatory training on international standards on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibition of torture, the provisions governing investigations of torture and ill-
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment, and interrogation techniques and develop training programmes for health 
</b></p>
<p><b>and legal professionals on detecting, reporting and preventing torture, to be delivered 
</b></p>
<p><b>during professional qualification courses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Strengthen the training of the judiciary in relation to torture and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and ensure effective follow-up. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Health-care facilities/psychiatric institutions  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that appropriate bodies use 
institutionalization as a last resort and provide alternatives, including non-custodial 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychiatric assistance available at local hospitals, and ensure the patient</b>&#8217;<b>s right to free 
</b></p>
<p><b>and informed consent to treatment in compliance with international standards. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur requests the international community to support the 
efforts of Kyrgyzstan in implementing the above-mentioned recommendations, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular in its efforts to reform its legal system, establish a preventive framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>against torture and ill-treatment and provide appropriate training for police and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison personnel.
