<p> The aim of the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project, which is being promoted by the 
State-owned electric utility Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), is to construct a 
hydroelectric dam and plant on the R&#237;o Grande de T&#233;rraba in the south-east of the 
country for the purposes of large-scale electricity generation. A number of indigenous 
territories recognized by the State are located in the area affected by the project.  
 The situation of the communities affected by the project was the subject of 
correspondence between the Government of Costa Rica and the Special Rapporteur, 
starting with a letter dated 23 November 2010 in which the Special Rapporteur 
forwarded a number of allegations he had received regarding the situation. On 27 
January 2011, the Government of Costa Rica sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur 
saying it was &#8220;well disposed&#8221; to receiving a visit from him to the country, so that he 
could better assess the situation and prepare some recommendations.

</p>
<p><b>I.   Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this note, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James 
Anaya, submits a series of observations and recommendations on the situation of the 
indigenous people affected by the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project in Costa Rica. The aim of 
the project, which is being promoted by the State-owned electric utility Instituto 
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), is to construct a hydroelectric dam and plant on the 
R&#237;o Grande de T&#233;rraba in the south-east of the country for the purposes of large-scale 
electricity generation. ICE is promoting this project as part of its plans to increase 
electricity production. The project was declared to be of public interest in 2008.1 
2. A number of indigenous territories recognized by the State are located in the area 
affected by the project. Under the current proposals, the reservoir and part of the dam will 
cover 818.<footnote name="2">3. Another issue is that most of the indigenous territories affected by the project are 
occupied by non-indigenous persons. It is estimated that at least 80 per cent of the T&#233;rraba 
territory is occupied by non-indigenous persons. In building the reservoir, the El Diqu&#237;s 
project could mean the loss of 10 per cent of the T&#233;rraba territory. It is therefore </footnote>4 hectares of the T&#233;rraba indigenous territory, which accounts for around 10 per 
cent of the territory of the indigenous Teribe people. The reservoir will also flood 97 
hectares of the China Kich&#225; indigenous territory of the Cabecar people. Furthermore, the 
Rey Curr&#233; and Boruca indigenous territories, which belong to the Brunca people and are 
located downstream of the dam, could be affected by changes or alterations in the river&#8217;s 
course. Housing thousands of workers for several years during the construction of the dam 
would also have a social impact on the indigenous communities living in the area. ICE 
includes in the area which would be indirectly affected by the project the Cabagra and 
Salitre indigenous territories of the Bribri people, the Ujarr&#225;s territory of the Cabecar 
people, and the Coto Brus territory of the Ngobe people, which are located upstream of the 
dam, given that the reservoir would be created and maintained in part with water flowing 
from these territories. 
</p>
<p>3.  ICE stresses that although land that lies within the T&#233;rraba and China Kich&#225; 
territories will be flooded, there will be no need to resettle any indigenous people as these 
areas are not inhabited. Although the scope of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate only 
covers the impact of the El Diqu&#237;s project on indigenous peoples, it is important to note that 
according to the information provided by the Costa Rican Government, the project would 
displace, either completely or partially, 10 non-indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>4.  On 23 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government about 
the impact of the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project on the indigenous peoples living in the 
area. In the letter, the Special Rapporteur asked to meet with representatives of the Costa 
Rican Government to discuss the status of the project during his next trip to Geneva. The 
request was granted by the Government and the meeting took place on 29 November 2010. 
After this meeting, the Government sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur saying it was 
&#8220;well disposed&#8221; to receiving a visit from him in Costa Rica. The dates for this visit were 
arranged in subsequent correspondence. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit took place from 24 to 27 April 2011. During the visit, 
he met with various Government representatives in San Jos&#233;, including representatives of 
ICE, the State-owned utility responsible for the El Diqu&#237;s project; the Vice-President of the 
Republic, Mr. Alfio Piva; members of the National Commission on Indigenous Affairs 
(CONAI); the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Carlos Roverssi; and deputies from 
the Legislative Assembly. Also in San Jos&#233;, he met with representatives of indigenous

and public interest (February 2008). </p>

</b></p>
<p>peoples and organizations, the United Nations country team, embassies and international 
bodies with offices in Costa Rica.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur went to the T&#233;rraba indigenous territory, where he met with 
representatives from this and other indigenous territories and was also able to visit the 
prospective site of the El Diqu&#237;s dam. The Special Rapporteur also visited the ICE offices 
in Buenos Aires and held meetings with the key officials and technicians responsible for 
implementing the project. 
7. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his gratitude to everybody who helped 
prepare the visit, especially the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their 
indispensable assistance in organizing the meetings with Government representatives, and 
the representatives of the Teribe and other indigenous peoples for all their help in 
organizing the meetings with the indigenous peoples and organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Observations and recommendations 
</b>8.  On the basis of his visit to Costa Rica and the information received on the status of 
the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following observations, setting out the criteria used and his recommendations. The Special 
Rapporteur bases his observations and recommendations on the relevant international 
instruments, in particular the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 with the support of Costa Rica, and the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 
169), ratified by Costa Rica in 1993. 
9. The Special Rapporteur believes that some of his recommendations are of immediate 
relevance and that they should be acted upon in the near future if the Government intends to 
press ahead with the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project. It should be noted that several of these 
observations and recommendations were transmitted orally to ICE and various Government 
representatives during the Special Rapporteur's visit to the country. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  The need for adequate consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.11-14667 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities affected to participate in the initial decision-making process. The 
design of the project is now at an advanced stage, however, and the Government has taken 
various decisions which commit it to researching and developing the project, without 
adequate consultation beforehand. It is clear to the Special Rapporteur that, although the 
hydroelectric project has not yet received final approval, the ability of the indigenous 
peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and establish their own priorities for 
development has been infringed. 
</p>
<p>13. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur considers that it would be possible to remedy 
the lack of indigenous participation in the development of the project if a proper 
consultation process were launched now that met international standards and addressed the 
particular challenges posed in this case. The Special Rapporteur proposes criteria to further 
a consultation process of this kind below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  The aim of consultation: free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>14. According to the applicable international instruments, consultation with indigenous 
peoples who may be affected by the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project should be undertaken 
with the goal of obtaining their free, prior and informed consent.<footnote name="2">2. The Special Rapporteur understands that the current feasibility and impact studies 
complement existing ones, and notes that ICE intends to disseminate information from the 
studies at future consultations on the project, as is its duty. However, the failure to release 
the completed feasibility studies has resulted in strong criticism and mistrust of the position 
of ICE and the Government as regards the project. The Special Rapporteur believes it 
would be advisable for ICE to seek a way of making these completed studies available, as a 
sign of its readiness to engage in a transparent consultation process in which the indigenous 
parties have access to comprehensive information. 
</footnote> Such consent, which 
should be obtained before the project is approved, involves the indigenous peoples&#8217; 
acceptance of the impact that the project will have on them, and must be on fair and 
equitable terms. The consequences of the project in the Teribe people&#8217;s case, under the 
current proposals, are that 10 per cent of their territory would be affected or flooded, and 
thousands of construction workers would be located there. For the other indigenous peoples 
affected, the impact would be less but still significant. As part of the consultation process, 
the parties should be open to seeking alternatives in the design of the project, so that its 
eventual impact will be different from that currently envisaged. 
</p>
<p>15. Free and informed consent to the impact of the project should be sought prior to any 
Government decision to allow construction work to begin, and should be explicitly framed 
in an agreement or agreements which contain commitments by the Government or ICE. The 
agreements must take into account all the rights affected by the project in relation to each of 
the indigenous peoples affected, including their rights to land and natural resources, any 
rights that could underpin claims for compensation, any mitigation measures and sharing 
the project&#8217;s profits. 
16.  With the aim of reaching consent and agreement, the consultation process consists of 
an intercultural dialogue held in good faith to achieve consensus and mutual 
accommodation of the parties&#8217; legitimate interests. At the start of the process, neither the 
Government nor ICE should take it for granted that the project will go ahead, given that the 
final decision on whether or not the project should be undertaken is subject to the outcome 
of the consultations, irrespective of other considerations of social and national interest. 
Likewise, all parties to the consultations, including the indigenous parties, must act in good 
faith and recognize all parties&#8217; legitimate interests in the hydroelectric project, and try to 
reach consensual decisions.

Independent Countries (No. 169), article 6. For an analysis of the duty of States to consult indigenous 
peoples on decisions likely to affect them, see the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people to the Human Rights Council at its 
twelfth session (A/HRC/12/34).  </p>

<p>GE.11-14667 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Measures to establish a climate of trust 
</b></p>
<p>17.  In order to launch and move forward with a consultation process and to reach 
consensual long-term decisions, a climate of trust needs to be established between the 
parties, as well as within the process itself. Given the project&#8217;s history and various factors 
related to the disadvantaged situation of the indigenous peoples concerned, a number of 
concrete measures need to be taken in order to build this trust. 
</p>
<p>18. Firstly, ICE should acknowledge and address the concerns expressed by various 
representatives of the indigenous peoples and organizations concerned regarding the terms 
on which the hydroelectric project has been promoted and the preparatory studies carried 
out. There have been complaints from representatives of the Teribe people about 
construction work carried out by ICE, as well as the presence of heavy machinery for 
geological and other research within the T&#233;rraba territory. It is alleged that ICE did not 
conduct adequate consultations before moving onto T&#233;rraba territory, where it has been 
present since 2006. However, ICE and the Government maintain that it was not necessary 
to carry out the consultations stipulated in international instruments because ICE was only 
there to carry out research prior to starting the project. ICE also maintains that it did consult 
with the inhabitants of the T&#233;rraba territory, that it disseminated information on the 
hydroelectric project and that it sought permission to set up research facilities in the 
territory. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur has observed that the indigenous peoples and organizations 
concerned generally believe that whatever consultations ICE carried out in the past were 
inadequate. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur shares the view that, in accordance with 
international standards, ICE should have conducted consultations on the research facilities 
and activities before starting work in the T&#233;rraba territory, independently of any 
consultations carried out before the project is implemented. He also believes that ICE could 
have shown more consideration towards the indigenous peoples with regard to the project, 
as acknowledged by the ICE leadership in conversations with him. 
</p>
<p>20. The withdrawal of ICE from its facilities and operations in the T&#233;rraba territory, 
which was announced during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, is a positive step towards 
overcoming the obvious mistrust caused by their presence. The Special Rapporteur believes 
it would also be advisable for ICE to agree not to recommence operations in indigenous 
territories without carrying out adequate consultations beforehand and to acknowledge the 
shortcomings in its behaviour towards the indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>21. Also to help build a climate of trust, the Special Rapporteur considers it would be 
advisable for ICE to release the feasibility studies carried out before the current stage of 
research began. Several organizations have requested these studies, yet to date ICE has 
refused to release them, arguing that they are incomplete or that the information in them 
could be misinterpreted.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.11-14667 
</p>
<p>understandable that the Teribe people see the project as a threat and fear that instead of 
recovering more of their territory, they may lose even more of it.  
</p>
<p>24. As explained in paragraphs 42&#8211;44 below, the possession of large tracts of 
indigenous territories by non-indigenous persons is an underlying problem in Costa Rica 
and should be addressed by the Government as a matter of priority. In the case of the 
indigenous peoples affected by the El Diqu&#237;s project, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
efforts should be made to establish a mechanism for land recovery, which could help create 
the conditions for consensus on the project. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation and representation in the consultation process  
</b></p>
<p>25. The applicable international instruments stipulate that consultations with indigenous 
peoples should be adapted to their own representation procedures and forms of organization 
in relation to decision-making.3 Therefore it is not for the Costa Rican Government or any 
of its agencies to define how the indigenous peoples to be consulted about the El Diqu&#237;s 
project choose their representatives. The indigenous peoples themselves must decide who 
will represent them. The consultations should therefore be carried out by means of 
representation mechanisms determined by the Teribe people themselves and by the other 
peoples affected by the project, in accordance with their own customs and traditions. 
26. The Special Rapporteur has observed that there is currently no clear definition of the 
mechanisms or institutions which could legitimately represent the Teribe people during 
consultations with the Government on a project affecting their collective rights. Clearly the 
same is true of the other indigenous peoples affected by the El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project. 
Each of the indigenous territories within the area affected by the project has an Association 
for Integrated Development (ADI), an institution established and regulated by the 
Indigenous Act (Executive Decree No. 8487 of 1978), which has representative and 
managerial functions. However, according to several sources, the ADIs in Costa Rica&#8217;s 
various indigenous communities are viewed as State agencies and not as institutions which 
truly represent indigenous people. It has been alleged that the ADIs were imposed on the 
communities and that they have weakened the traditional systems of representation. In both 
the Teribe territory and the other territories concerned, there are various organizations 
which represent the interests of the territories in some way and offer alternatives to the 
ADIs. 
</p>
<p>27. For an adequate consultation process on the hydroelectric project to be carried out, 
the indigenous peoples concerned need to take steps to define representation and 
participation procedures in relation to the process. For this to happen, they need to 
demonstrate the same sense of solidarity and cooperation that the Special Rapporteur 
witnessed among the various indigenous organizations when he visited T&#233;rraba.  
</p>
<p>28. While the Government should not attempt to influence the way in which the 
indigenous peoples are represented, it should be willing to provide them with logistical 
support in determining the representation procedures, if they so wish. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to be patient and to allow the indigenous peoples 
affected by the project to take the time they need for this purpose. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

Interpretation of the judgement on preliminary objections, merits, reparations, and costs, Judgement 
of 12 August 2008, Series C, No. 185, paras. 11&#8211;13 (applying the Inter-American Convention on 
Human Rights).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-14667 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>29. As part of this process, and in order to create a favourable climate for a dialogue in 
good faith between the parties, the Government will need to show a willingness to address 
the deep concerns of the indigenous peoples regarding the representativeness of the ADIs 
(see paragraphs 46&#8211;48 below). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Defining &#8220;consultations on consultations&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>30.  The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that ICE has recognized the need to 
consult with the indigenous peoples affected by the project on the details of the consultation 
procedure itself. As the Special Rapporteur mentioned previously, the need to carry out 
&#8220;consultations on consultations&#8221; not only arises from the State&#8217;s obligation to consult with 
indigenous peoples about legislative or administrative decisions which may affect them 
directly, but is also a key element in achieving &#8220;a climate of confidence and mutual respect 
for the consultations&#8221;, which should ensure that &#8220;the consultation procedure itself is the 
product of consensus&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>31. ICE and other competent State institutions have put forward an analysis of what the 
specific elements of a consultation procedure could be. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that the work carried out on this subject has been important in raising awareness, prompting 
talks between ICE and other State actors on the criteria to be considered when establishing 
the procedure, and encouraging ideas on possible forms of consultation in the future. 
</p>
<p>32. However, the Special Rapporteur warns that although it may be useful to draw up 
proposals for consultation procedures beforehand, proposals made by one party or the other 
which are detrimental to a true consensus-building process should not be put forward. The 
consultations on consultations should involve an open and comprehensive dialogue 
between the parties on the various aspects of the consultation procedure to be established, 
such as defining the different steps in the consultations, the corresponding time limits and 
the specific forms of participation. Positions should not be taken on these aspects prior to 
the dialogue. 
</p>
<p>33. Furthermore, the State should not rush into a dialogue with the indigenous parties on 
the consultation procedure. Once again, the State actors need to be patient so that the 
indigenous parties can define their own representation procedures and are able to prepare 
themselves properly for the dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b>5. Mitigating the power imbalance 
</b></p>
<p>34. There is no doubt that there is a power imbalance between the parties to the current 
dialogue on the El Diqu&#237;s project (the indigenous peoples concerned and the State/ICE). 
Generally, the indigenous peoples have been victims of discrimination and marginalization, 
which has prevented them from entering into dialogue with representatives of the State and 
with other actors who want to exploit the natural resources in their territories. In this case 
there is a clear imbalance between the parties in terms of their access to information on the 
project and their technical capacity to evaluate the information and to prepare and respond 
to proposals in negotiations on complex subjects. 
35.  Measures need to be taken to mitigate this power imbalance. Otherwise, any 
consensus or agreement reached in the consultations will lack legitimacy and will be 
unsustainable. ICE must first ensure that the indigenous peoples have access to full and 
clear information on the project and its possible impact at every stage of the process. 
36. It is also important to ensure that the required knowledge and technical capacity is 
available to the indigenous peoples. The indigenous peoples should therefore have their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.11-14667 
</p>
<p>own expert advisers in relevant areas such as engineering, law, finance, the environment, 
development and business. The State should finance these advisers on terms that allows 
them to work exclusively for the indigenous parties and outside the control of ICE or any 
other party.5 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Proposal: a team of independent experts to facilitate the process 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur believes that it would in any case be extremely difficult to 
overcome the power imbalance between the parties and to guarantee lasting results without 
some sort of facilitation by one or more external stakeholders. A facilitating team that fits 
the specified terms of reference and has the necessary technical ability could ensure a well-
balanced process and inspire confidence in it. The Special Rapporteur also believes that the 
inclusion of external stakeholders could help clarify issues of representation, define the 
procedure and produce ideas that might lead to consensus. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur thus proposes the appointment, if all parties agree, of a team 
of independent and reliable experts to facilitate the consultation process, and suggests that 
the team should be set up under the auspices of the United Nations system. The team should 
be multidisciplinary, with expertise in the areas of intercultural dialogue, indigenous 
peoples and their rights, the technical aspects of the hydroelectric project, environmental 
and social impact studies, mitigation measures, and the drafting of agreements on a fair 
distribution of profits.  
</p>
<p>39. The team would be involved in every stage of the process, including the first stage, 
in which consultation procedures would be agreed upon. Furthermore, the team would be 
available to help the indigenous peoples to organize and prepare themselves for the 
consultation process. Thus, the team would be much more than a passive observer. 
</p>
<p>40. Should the parties agree to this proposal, the Special Rapporteur would be willing to 
promote it within the United Nations system and to help establish a team of experts and 
define the terms of reference. The terms of reference would have to be acceptable to the 
parties. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Substantive issues beyond the hydroelectric project 
</b>41. The El Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project raises important issues for the indigenous 
peoples of Costa Rica that go beyond the project itself. These issues include the recovery of 
lands and the need for legislative reforms that address indigenous demands for autonomy 
and representation. Decisive steps towards settling these issues should complement efforts 
to design and implement a consultation process that is suitable for the specific case of the 
El Diqu&#237;s project. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Recovery of lands 
</b></p>
<p>42. The State has granted legal protection to the country&#8217;s indigenous territories since 
19566 and delimited them by means of various decrees.7 However, these territories are 
mostly inhabited by non-indigenous people. Some of these people hold title deeds in good

<p> 
</p>

 See article 39 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which states 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to have access to financial and technical assistance from 
States and through international cooperation, for the enjoyment of the rights contained in this 
Declaration&#8221;, which include the right to consultation (arts. 19 and 32, among others).

<p>faith, with the corresponding rights to compensation under the Indigenous Act of 1977;8 but 
according to information received by the Special Rapporteur, most of them do not have 
legal deeds and acquired land in indigenous territories by settling there or through irregular 
transfers, sometimes with the tacit consent of the Government. Under the Indigenous Act, 
the land in indigenous territories is inalienable and imprescriptible.9 However, the inflow of 
non-indigenous persons to indigenous territories has affected the territories&#8217; demographics 
and landholding patterns, with large farms being established by non-indigenous persons, as 
in the T&#233;rraba territory. 
</p>
<p>43. It is alleged that, in the vast majority of cases, no procedures have been followed to 
compensate those who occupy indigenous territories in good faith, nor have there been any 
efforts to recover land held by non-indigenous persons through settlements or irregular 
transfers. Although the Agrarian Development Institute, the Government agency 
responsible under domestic legislation for compensating non-indigenous persons who hold 
title deeds in good faith, has bought some land under procedures to recover indigenous 
lands, the Special Rapporteur was informed that these procedures are slow and suffer from 
irregularities. 
</p>
<p>44. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur during his visit, 
one of the main priorities of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples is to recover their lands. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that decisive steps need to be taken urgently to find solutions 
that would allow indigenous peoples to recover the land in their territories. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the negotiations over the El Diqu&#237;s project offer an excellent 
opportunity to address the basic issue of land recovery, which could help create the 
conditions for consensus on the project. This process of recovering lands on the T&#233;rraba 
territory could possibly be used as a model for other indigenous peoples in the country who 
find themselves in similar situations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legislative reforms on indigenous issues and representation 
</b></p>
<p>45. For more than a decade, indigenous leaders have been promoting a bill to guarantee 
the rights of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples. The current version of this bill, the 
Autonomous Development of Indigenous Peoples Bill, was first submitted to the 
Legislative Assembly in 1995 and has been revised and amended by the Assembly on 
several occasions. The bill was also discussed in consultations with indigenous peoples, 
with the support of the United Nations system in Costa Rica. The Special Rapporteur 
understands that the debate on the bill is at a standstill. More recently, in August 2010, 30 
indigenous persons were expelled from the legislative chamber, where they had been 
protesting to urge legislators to discuss the bill. 
</p>
<p>46. One of the central themes of the bill is the representation of indigenous people, 
especially in the associations for integrated development (ADIs). Representation 
procedures in indigenous territories are regulated by the Indigenous Act of 1977 and its 
Regulations of 1978. The Indigenous Act protects indigenous territories, and also 
recognizes and protects the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional institutions of self-
government. Article 4 stipulates that &#8220;the reservations shall be ruled by indigenous peoples

 Ibid., art. 3: &#8220;Indigenous reservations are inalienable and imprescriptible, non-transferable and 
</p>
<p>exclusive to the indigenous communities that inhabit them. Non-indigenous persons may not rent, 
lease, purchase or acquire by any other means plots of land or estates on these reservations. 
Indigenous persons may only offer their land for sale to other indigenous persons. Any transfer, sale 
or bequest of land on indigenous reservations transacted between indigenous and non-indigenous 
persons shall be null and void, with all the legal consequences thereof.&#8221;  </p>

</p>
<p>according to traditional community-based structures or the laws of the Republic governing 
them, under the coordination and guidance of CONAI [the National Commission on 
Indigenous Affairs]&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur understands, however, that the Regulations 
implementing the Indigenous Act (Executive Decree No. 8487 of 1978) have effectively 
deprived indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional institutions of the authority to represent them in 
matters of sustainable development, establishing the ADIs for this purpose.10 
</p>
<p>47. Almost all the indigenous representatives who met with the Special Rapporteur 
during his visit claimed that the ADIs did not adequately represent the indigenous peoples, 
adding that indigenous peoples see the presence of the ADIs in their territories as a denial 
of their right to self-government and their right to make decisions regarding their land and 
communities. The ADIs are apparently regarded as State institutions that regularly make 
decisions without notifying or consulting the indigenous communities they supposedly 
represent. While some indigenous territories have adapted their representation procedures 
to those of the ADIs, in other territories, such as that of the Teribe people, the presence of 
the ADIs has led to a deterioration in the indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional representation 
procedures. It should be noted that there are similar concerns about the lack of adequate 
representation on the National Commission on Indigenous Affairs. 
</p>
<p>48. There is a need to address concerns about the representativeness of the ADIs; doing 
so could boost progress towards the adoption of the Autonomous Development of 
Indigenous Peoples Bill. In its concluding observations on Costa Rica in 2007, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern about the 
Government&#8217;s failure to adopt the bill and recommended that it &#8220;remove without delay the 
legislative obstacles preventing the adoption of the Autonomous Development of 
Indigenous Peoples Bill&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Conclusion 
</b>49.<b> The Special Rapporteur offers these observations and recommendations to the 
Government of Costa Rica and the indigenous peoples affected by the El Diqu&#237;s</b> 
<b>hydroelectric project as specific guidelines on the measures that he believes should be 
taken if the Government intends to press ahead with the project. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the challenges involved in developing projects of this 
magnitude in indigenous territories &#8211; challenges that exist in almost every country 
where there are indigenous peoples. At the same time, however, he believes that Costa 
Rica has the opportunity to set a good example for other countries around the world 
and to resolve this situation in a manner that fully respects the human rights of the 
indigenous peoples, on the basis of agreements reached with them.
