<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 20/12 on &#8220;accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women: remedies for women who have been subjected to violence&#8221;, the Human 
Rights Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), &#8220;to prepare, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, and to present to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, at its twenty-third session, recommendations on how to create 
and/or strengthen linkages and synergies between the mechanisms of the Human Rights 
Council, and also with other relevant intergovernmental processes on the issue of violence 
against women and girls&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>2. In preparing the recommendations, OHCHR made an online call for submissions 
and consulted with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, relevant United Nations entities1 and other stakeholders.   
</p>
<p>3. The report first maps out how various intergovernmental bodies have addressed 
violence against women since 2009. It is divided into two sections.  The first section 
addresses synergies and linkages between the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council on 
the issue of violence against women and girls.  The second section addresses synergies and 
linkages between the Council and other intergovernmental processes, namely the General 
Assembly, the Security Council, and two of the functional commissions of the Economic 
and Social Council: the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on 
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.  It then presents some conclusions and 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with resolution 20/12, the review informing the recommendations 
focuses on the issue of violence against women.  Gender-integration into the work of the 
Human Rights Council and other intergovernmental processes is not fully addressed in this 
report.2 
</p>
<p><b> II. Synergies and linkages between mechanisms of the Human 
Rights Council   
</b></p>
<p>5. The present section is based on a review of the scope and nature of the work on 
violence against women undertaken by the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms in 
the period 2009-2012.  The review focuses on how the work of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and other relevant thematic mandates 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Entities consulted included the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women (UN Women), the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual 
violence in conflict, the Team of Experts under Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), the Office of 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on children in armed conflict, the Office of the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children and the United Nations 
Organization on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  
</p>
<p> 2 Gender integration in the work of the Human Rights Council is considered under follow-up reports on 
HRC resolution 6/30 and ensuing reports by OHCHR. UN Women submits an annual report to the 
General Assembly on gender-equality issues in the Secretary-General&#8217;s reports, and in resolutions of 
the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly (most recent report A/67/185). In 
response to the findings and recommendations in these reports, the General Assembly has requested 
that: (1) a gender perspective be reflected in the reports of the Secretary General, and (2) 
intergovernmental bodies reflect a gender perspective in their work (see most recent resolution 
67/148, paras. 14, 16, 19 and 20). </p>


<p>of the Council, such as the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women 
and children, and the Working Group on discrimination against women in law and practice 
contributes to the overall thematic and country-focused work of the Council and other 
intergovernmental processes.    
</p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council resolutions 
</b></p>
<p>6. From March 2009 to September 2012, the Human Rights Council held 12 regular 
sessions and adopted 312 resolutions on a wide range of issues.  In addition to its annual 
resolutions on accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and 
girls,3 the issue of violence against women was also mentioned in resolutions on: 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity;4 the fight against sexual violence against 
children;5 elimination of discrimination against women;6 trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children;7 migration and the human rights of the child8 and human rights and 
transitional justice.9  The resolutions called upon States to protect all human rights of 
trafficked women and children, in particular unaccompanied migrant children, and to 
ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration.  The Council also 
reiterated its concern at the large number of women and children trafficked within and 
between regions and States and called upon States to take action on violations committed 
against trafficked persons.  In resolution 21/15 regarding human rights and transitional 
justice, the Council strongly condemned violence against women and girls committed in 
conflict and post-conflict situations and called for effective measures of accountability and 
redress where those acts amounted to violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>7. The issue was also addressed in the resolution extending the following thematic 
mandates: the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences;10 the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children;11 and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery.12  In renewing 
these mandates, the Council called on the mandate holders to adopt a comprehensive and 
universal approach to the issues at stake, including attention to the causes of violence 
against women related to the civil, cultural, economic, political and social spheres.  The 
Special Rapporteur on slavery was requested &#8220;to take account of the gender and age 
</p>
<p>dimensions of contemporary forms of slavery.&#8221;13  
</p>
<p>8. The Council has established seven new thematic mandates since 2009, including the 
working group on discrimination against women in law and practice.14  While the issue of 
violence against women and girls was not explicitly mentioned in any of the seven 
resolutions establishing the mandates, six mandates were requested to integrate a gender 
</p>

 6 A/HRC/RES/15/23. 
 7 A/HRC/RES/20/1; A/HRC/RES/17/1; A/HRC/RES/14/2; and A/HRC/RES/11/3.

<p>perspective into their work15 and one of the mandates was asked to &#8220;apply a gender 
perspective by, inter alia, considering the particular situation of women and girls in 
identifying gender specific discrimination and vulnerabilities&#8221;.16   
</p>
<p>9. Country-specific resolutions where the issue of sexual and gender-based violence 
was addressed included resolutions on: the Republic of Guinea, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, Cambodia, Somalia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Myanmar and a presidential 
statement on Haiti.17  The resolutions expressed concern regarding the prevalence of sexual 
and gender-based violence and called for preventive measures, investigation, punishment 
and redress for victims. 
</p>
<p>10. The Council held special sessions on the human rights situations in: the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Syria;18 the Occupied Palestinian Territories; Lebanon; Darfur; C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire; 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Myanmar; and Sri Lanka.  One session was devoted 
to support for the recovery process in Haiti and two thematic special sessions to the world 
food crisis and the economic and financial crisis.  The resolutions resulting from these 
sessions did not explicitly discuss the issue of violence against women and girls.19  
</p>
<p><b> B. Commissions of inquiry/fact-finding missions  
</b></p>
<p>11. Since 2009, the Human Rights Council has mandated the establishment of 10 
commissions of inquiry/fact-finding missions.   Most of the commissions&#8217; terms of 
reference called on them to investigate alleged violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law.  The resolutions establishing the commissions of inquiry on C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire and Libya made specific reference to gender-based violence, including sexual 
violence. The recommendations of the commissions of inquiry/fact-finding missions have 
tended to be based on the mandating resolutions,20 therefore issues related to sexual and 
gender-based violence appear more prominently in the reports and recommendations of 
commissions of inquiry that are expressly mandated to investigate these crimes.   
</p>
<p><b> C. The Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>12. Since it took its current form, the Advisory Committee has been requested to 
identify key gaps in standard-setting or emerging areas on eight thematic issues pertaining

<p>to the mandate of the Council.21  The draft declaration on the right to peace22 calls on States 
to revise national laws and policies that are discriminatory against women, and to adopt 
legislation that addresses domestic violence, the trafficking of women and girls and gender-
based violence.  The draft declaration on human rights education and training23 notes that 
education contributes to preventing violations, including violence against women.24  The 
final study on traditional values dedicates a chapter to the impact of traditional values on 
vulnerable groups with a particular focus on women and minorities.25  Similarly, the study 
on the promotion of human rights of the urban poor specifically analyses the situation of 
women and girls.26  In its study on rural women and the right to food, the Committee 
analysed patterns of discrimination harming rural women, proposing strategies and policies 
for their legal protection and emphasizing good practices.27  
</p>
<p><b> D. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Forum 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in its studies and 
reports to the Council has highlighted multiple discrimination faced by indigenous women 
and girls in several areas of life including the right to culture, education and the right to 
participate in decision-making.28  For the first four sessions of the Forum on Minority 
Issues (2008-2011) the sole recommendation which made an explicit mention of the issue 
of violence against women emanated from the fourth session, on guaranteeing the rights of 
minority women, although each session included women&#8217;s human rights language.29.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Universal Periodic Review  
</b></p>
<p>14. One of the 13 basic principles of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) as set up in 
paragraph 3(k) of Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 is the full integration of a gender 
perspective in the process.  This would entail a gender-sensitive consultation process when 
preparing the national report, as well as the consideration of all gender-related issues, 
including gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>15. UPR has made a considerable number of recommendations to States on women&#8217;s 
human rights and specifically on the issue of violence against women and girls.  During the 
</p>
<p>  
 21 The eight thematic issues are: human rights education and training; right to food; missing persons; 
</p>
<p>leprosy-related discrimination; right to peace; human rights and issues related to terrorist hostage-
taking; traditional values; and enhancement of international cooperation. 
</p>

peoples to peace, 2012 (A/HRC/20/31).

<p> 29 United Nations Forum on Minority Issues Compilation of Recommendations of the First Four 
Sessions 2008 to 2011, paras. 24 and 25, p. 50. </p>


<p>first review cycle, recommendations related to the issue of violence against women 
addressed a variety of issues, from ratification of international human rights instruments, 
such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
to removing reservations and fully incorporating international provisions into domestic law.  
A number of recommendations urged States to follow up on recommendations emanating 
from the human rights treaty bodies, including the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, and by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women.  
</p>
<p>16. Overall the recommendations have focused primarily on: domestic violence; female 
genital mutilation (FGM); sexual violence, including marital and other forms of rape; and 
access to justice, including effective reparations for women who have been subjected to 
violence.  Other emerging thematic issues include violence against women and girls with 
disabilities and political participation.   
</p>
<p>17. The UPR recommendations are to an extent in line with the thematic work 
undertaken by the Human Rights Council on the issue, particularly the recommendations on 
rape and sexual violence, which mirror those discussed in relevant thematic reports 
produced by OHCHR and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women,30 as well as 
those addressed in the Council&#8217;s annual discussions on women&#8217;s human rights.31 
</p>
<p>18. However, there are some gaps between the thematic issues related to violence 
against women addressed by UPR and the Human Rights Council.  For example, in the 
UPR recommendations there was little focus on prevention and responses as part of a 
holistic approach to eliminating violence against women.  Furthermore, while a broad 
spectrum of UPR recommendations expressed concern about the causes of violence against 
women, they did not explicitly link those to patriarchal structures that reinforce 
discrimination against women and allow violence to be perpetrated against women, as 
highlighted by the Special Rapporteur and in the course of the Council&#8217;s annual discussions 
on women&#8217;s rights.   
</p>
<p><b> F. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>19. There are currently 36 thematic special procedures mandates, including the 
mandates on violence against women, trafficking and discrimination against women.  The 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women has studied the forms, 
prevalence, causes and consequences of violence against women and has provided key 
recommendations to Governments and to the international community. The mandate has 
urged States to comply with their due diligence obligation to address violence against 
women by tackling inequality and discrimination, which are root causes of such violence. 
</p>
<p>  
 30 For example, &#8220;Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences&#8221; (A/HRC/14/22), paras. 12-85 and the &#8220;Thematic study on the issue of violence against 
women and girls and disability: Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights&#8221; (A/HRC/20/5). 
</p>
<p> 31 From 2009 to 2012, OHCHR submitted two thematic reports to the Council on the issue of violence 
against women, on good practices in efforts aimed at preventing violence against women 
(A/HRC/17/23) and violence against women and girls and disabilities (A/HRC/20/5). Pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolution 6/30 (2007), OHCHR has organized six Council panel discussions 
on the issue of violence against women, including conflict-related violence and discrimination against 
women both in law and practice. </p>


<p>20. In addition to these mandates, since 2009, just under half of the 35 mandates have 
undertaken studies on the women&#8217;s human rights aspects of their mandates.32  These studies 
have often noted specific forms of violence against women.  For example, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture in his 2010 report to the Council identified sexual violence as a 
distinct category of torture and dedicated a chapter in his report to domestic violence.33  
Since 2009, the issue has been raised by the Rapporteur in almost all of his country visits.34  
The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has also addressed the issue of 
violence against indigenous women and girls.35  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers has raised the issue in her global thematic reports to 
the Council,36 as has the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.37  
The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights has addressed the different forms of 
violence experienced by women when they claim their cultural rights on an equal basis with 
men.38  Other special procedures mandate holders, such as the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence are currently reviewing the 
women&#8217;s rights-specific aspects of their mandates. 
</p>
<p>21. The thematic mandates which have devoted attention to reviewing linkages between 
their work and violence against women have not systematically reflected this work in their 
country visits reports and recommendations.  For example, from 2006 to 2012, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
peoples undertook 22 country visits including follow-up missions: the issue of violence 
against women was specifically addressed in six of these mission reports.39  The Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights has consistently addressed women&#8217;s human rights 
in her thematic work and highlighted specific concerns related to violence against women

<p>in her visit to Morocco, undertaken in her capacity as Independent Expert in the field of 
cultural rights.40  The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers has 
issued two country visit reports addressing violence against women.41  
</p>
<p>22. In March 2009, Human Rights Council mandated seven experts including the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women to examine the human rights situation in the 
east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.42  The experts have since submitted three 
reports to Council in which they assessed the response of the Government to 
recommendations made by, inter alia, the High Commissioner, human rights mechanisms 
and Government&#8217;s commitments made in the course of the universal periodic review on 
sexual violence and impunity.43  The Special Rapporteur was a member of the special 
procedures mandate holders tasked by the Council in 2009 &#8220;to urgently seek and gather 
information on violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people&#8221;.44  The Special 
Rapporteur was also among the group of experts, comprising seven mandate holders, 
established in March 2007 by the Council in its resolution 4/8 to follow up on the 
implementation of recommendations on Darfur.45  The inclusion of the Special Rapporteur 
in these mandates ensured that attention was paid to violence against women and girls in 
the subsequent reports. 
</p>
<p>23. There are currently 12 geographic or country-specific mandates.  There has been 
generally less emphasis on the issue in the country mandates; nonetheless, outside the 
context of technical assistance and capacity-building, country reports and press releases 
have occasionally highlighted the situation of women, including violence against women 
and girls.  For example, in March 2012, during the Human Rights Council interactive 
dialogue, conflict-related sexual violence against women was raised in the discussion on 
Myanmar.  The mandate holder for Haiti has mentioned the issue of violence against 
women in his interactive dialogue with the Council and also in his reports.  In his reports 
the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia has also highlighted 
sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and female genital mutilation, and forced 
child marriage.46  The Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Independent 
Expert on human rights in Somalia convened a joint side-event during the twentieth session 
of the Council to promote a discussion on follow-up to their recommendations.

<p>24. This section reviews existing synergies and linkages between the Human Rights 
Council and other intergovernmental processes in the area of violence against women.  It 
focuses on the General Assembly, the Commission on the Status of Women and the 
Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Security Council.  The

<p>observations in this section are almost in their entirety based on a review of the work of 
these bodies during the period 2009-2012.   
</p>
<p><b> A. General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>25. The General Assembly has considered violence against women under several agenda 
items, including advancement of women, human rights and crime prevention and criminal 
justice.  Every second year, it receives reports from the Secretary-General on legislative, 
policy and other measures undertaken by Member States, and by bodies and entities of the 
United Nations to combat all forms of violence against women.  Since 2009, under the item 
on the advancement of women, the General Assembly has received two reports on 
trafficking in women and girls; three on intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of 
violence against women and two on violence against women migrant workers.  All these 
reports refer to relevant Human Rights Council resolutions.  Under the agenda item on 
human rights, the Assembly also receives reports from Council special procedures 
including the Special Rapporteur on violence against women.47  Since 2009, it has received 
103 reports from Human Rights Council special procedures.  The Special Rapporteur and 
other special procedures mandate holders hold an interactive dialogue with the Third 
Committee of the General Assembly on an annual basis.  
</p>
<p>26. Following the Secretary-General&#8217;s 2006 in-depth study on all forms of violence 
against women, the General Assembly has adopted annual &#8211; and since 2011 biannual &#8211; 
resolutions on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women, as well as on, inter alia, issues related to violence against women migrant workers 
(biennial) and trafficking in women and girls (biennial).48  During the period under review, 
the General Assembly adopted a total of 905 resolutions, 22 of which concerned women&#8217;s 
human rights and six specifically referred to the issue of violence against women and 
girls.49  Other resolutions have a specific focus on gender equality issues.50  
</p>
<p>27. Resolutions originating from the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council 
use similar language and approaches for addressing violence against women and girls.  
Both bodies reference the other&#8217;s respective resolutions on the issue.  The General 
Assembly frequently commends the Council and its mechanisms&#8217; efforts on the issue 
including contributions made by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children.  Since 2009, 
resolutions from the two bodies have called upon States to &#8220;exercise due diligence to 
</p>
<p>prevent and investigate acts of violence against women and girls and punish the 
perpetrators&#8221;,51 including by putting in place penal and criminal sanctions to punish 
perpetrators and by providing redress and justice mechanisms that victims can access 
effectively.  The resolutions encourage States to formulate and implement training 
</p>
<p>  
 47 The Special Rapporteur submitted her first report to the General Assembly at its 66th session in 
</p>
<p>accordance with General Assembly resolution 65/187. 
 48 See for example, Intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
</p>
<p>(A/RES/64/137, A/RES/65/187 and A/RES/67/144), Violence against women migrant workers 
(A/RES/64/139 and A/RES/66/128), Trafficking in women and girls (A/RES/63/156), and 
Strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women 
(A/RES/65/228). 
</p>
<p> 49 Three resolutions were on the subject of intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women, two were on violence against women migrant workers and one was on strengthening 
crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women.   
</p>
<p> 50 See document A/67/185, para. 11. 
 51 Resolutions A/RES/64/137 and A/RES/65/187. </p>


<p>programmes for law enforcement authorities, prosecutors and service providers.  States are 
also urged to adopt policies and legal and other measures that reduce the vulnerability of 
women, including those subjected to intersectional discrimination such as migrants, 
indigenous, minorities, and women with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>28. In 1996, the General Assembly adopted resolution A/RES/51/77, which called for 
the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative for children and armed conflict.  
The Special Representative reports annually to the Human Rights Council, cooperate with 
the Council&#8217;s Special Procedures and contributes to discussions under the universal 
periodic review process for those countries that fall within her mandate.  The Special 
Representative regularly highlights violence to which girls are exposed in the context of 
conflict and has called on States to comply with the recommendations of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, including on the girl child as well as recommendations by special 
procedures and UPR.52  
</p>
<p>29. In 2008, the General Assembly established the mandate of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children.53  The Special 
Representative reports annually to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.  
In addition to her regular reports, the Special Representative can issue thematic reports on 
key areas of concern.54  In her work, the Special Representative has addressed the 
specificities of violence against girls such as harmful practices, including female genital 
mutilation or early and forced marriage, degrading initiation rites, breast ironing, son 
preference, forced feeding and witchcraft rituals.55  
</p>
<p>30. In 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against 
children pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/20 entitled &#8220;Rights of the child: 
the fight against sexual violence against children&#8221; submitted a joint report 56 to the Council.  
The report provided an overview of accessible and child-sensitive counselling, complaint 
and reporting mechanisms to address incidents of violence, including sexual violence and 
exploitation, against children, including girls.  
</p>
<p>31. The General Assembly by resolution 65/182 established an Open-Ended Working 
Group on Ageing in 2010, primarily to review existing international legal framework of the 
human rights of older persons and identify possible gaps and how best to address them.  
Since its inception, the Working Group has held three substantive sessions.  All three of the 
reports of the sessions have addressed the issue of violence against older women.57  
</p>
<p><b> B. Commission on the Status of Women 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Commission on the Status of Women meets annually to prepare 
recommendations on promoting women&#8217;s rights in political, economic, civil, social and 
</p>
<p>  
 52 See for example, Report of the Secretary General on children and armed conflict in Colombia 
</p>
<p>(S/2012/171).

<p>educational fields.58  It plays a central role in monitoring the implementation of the 
Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women.  
</p>
<p>33. As part of its mandate and methods of work, the Commission has considered the 
issue of violence against women and related issues several times as a priority theme (1998, 
2003, 2007 and 2013).  The Commission has also considered particular aspects of violence 
against women, for example in the context of discrimination and violence against the girl 
child, as the priority theme in 2007 and as the review theme in 2011.  Generally, the 
Commission considers violence against women in relation to its recent priority themes59 
and reflects the issue in its agreed conclusions on those priority themes.  
</p>
<p>34. Since 2009, the Commission has also covered questions of violence against women 
in resolutions, including those on women, the girl child and HIV and AIDS (2009, 2010, 
2011, 2012), ending FGM (2010), maternal mortality and morbidity (2010, 2012), women 
in natural disasters (2012), release of women and children taken hostage, including those 
subsequently imprisoned, in armed conflicts (2010, 2012), and indigenous women (2012).   
</p>
<p>35. The priority theme of the fifty-seventh session of the Commission is &#8220;Elimination 
and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls&#8221;.  The Secretary-General&#8217;s 
reports prepared for the session focuses on prevention, and on multisectoral services and 
responses.60  Among other sources, they reference the conclusions and recommendations of 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and other relevant special procedures.  
</p>
<p>36. As mandated by the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur presents an oral 
report to the Commission and will serve as a panellist on one of the two panels of the 
Commission on the priority theme at its fifty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p>37. The Commission has a confidential complaint procedure which is designed to 
identify emerging trends and patterns of injustice and discriminatory practices against 
women, and which the Commission considers as part of its annual programme of work.61  
Following consideration by the Commission, the report of the Working Group on 
communications on the status of women is included in its annual report to the Economic 
and Social Council.  Violence against women, its causes, consequences and manifestations 
are regularly identified as a pattern by the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is mandated by the 
Economic and Social Council and tasked with setting out global strategy to prevent crime 
and promote fair and effective criminal justice systems.62  It formulates international 
policies and recommends activities in the field of crime control.  The Commission offers 
</p>
<p>  
 58 The Commission also prepares resolutions for consideration by the United Nations Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Council and the General Assembly on issues such as, inter alia, ending female genital 
mutilation. Also, during its fifty-sixth session, the Commission adopted resolutions on &#8220;release of 
women and children taken hostage, including those subsequently imprisoned, in armed conflicts,&#8221; 
</p>
<p>ECOSOC E/2012/27 E/CN.6/2012/16 and Corr.1. 
 59 The priority themes were &#8220;Equal sharing of responsibilities between women and men including 
</p>
<p>caregiving in the context of HIV/AIDS&#8221; (2009); and &#8220;Access and participation of women and girls in 
</p>
<p>education, training and science and technology, including for the promotion of women&#8217;s equal access 
</p>
<p>to full employment and decent work&#8221; (2011).

<p>Member States a forum to exchange expertise, experiences and information, to develop 
national and international strategies and to identify priorities for combating crime.   
</p>
<p>39. The Commission, under its priority area of promoting the use and application of 
United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, has 
increasingly focused on the issue of violence against women.  It has adopted thematic 
resolutions on the issue including on: strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice 
responses to violence against women, measures for achieving progress on the issue of 
trafficking in persons63 and strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice responses 
to violence against women and girls.64  Of particular interest are the Updated Model 
Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the 
Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted by the General Assembly in 
December 2010 upon recommendation of the Commission.65 
</p>
<p>40. The Commission organizes annual thematic discussion. It has addressed violence 
against migrants, migrant workers and members of their families.  In 2008, it held a 
thematic discussion on aspects of violence against women that pertain directly to the 
Commission.66 The Special Rapporteur on trafficking has been invited to address the 
Commission during its annual thematic discussions.  
</p>
<p>41. The Commission assists the General Assembly in providing substantive and 
organizational direction for the quinquennial United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention 
and Criminal Justice.  It also considers the outcome of the congresses and takes decisions 
on appropriate follow-up measures, including those related to the implementation of the 
commitments taken by Member States in the final declaration adopted at the end of each 
congress.  In the Salvador Declaration67 adopted by the 12th Crime Congress in 2010, 
member States expressed deep concern about the pervasiveness of violence against women 
in all its different forms and manifestations and urged States to enhance efforts to prevent, 
prosecute and punish violence against women.  Although violence against women is not a 
standing item of the Crime Congresses, it continues to be addressed in its workshops.  For 
example, the next Crime Congress scheduled for 2015 will focus on the role of existing 
United Nations standards and norms on crime prevention and criminal justice in addressing 
the unique needs of women and children.  
</p>
<p>42. In order to promote greater synergies and linkages between the Commission and 
Human Rights Council in the area of violence against women, the following 
recommendations may be considered: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensure the relevant thematic reports produced by the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, other relevant mandate holders, the Advisory Committee and 
OHCHR, as well as the summary of the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s rights are 
brought to the attention of Commission sessions and discussions on priority themes. 
</p>
<p>(b) Encourage the participation of the Special Rapporteur and other mandates, as 
appropriate and feasible, in the panel discussions and round tables on priority themes. 
</p>
<p>(c) Encourage the Commission to invite relevant mandate holders to report to the 
Commission and hold an interactive dialogue with it. 
</p>

 64 E/2008/30-E/CN.15/2008/22. 
 65 General Assembly resolution 65/228, annex.   
 66 E/2008/30-E/CN.15/2008/22. 
 67 General Assembly resolution 65/230, annex. </p>


<p>(d) Explore ways to ensure greater synergies between the Commission complaint 
procedures and Human Rights Council mechanisms.  This could include inviting the Chair 
of the Commission to address the Council and to exchange views when the Council 
considers the question of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>(e) Encourage Human Rights Council geographic and thematic special 
procedures to follow up on, and incorporate into their work, the findings and 
recommendations in resolutions and agreed conclusions relevant to the Commission, as 
well as the patterns of injustice and discrimination against women identified by the 
Working Group on Communications.  
</p>
<p>(f) Ensure adequate consideration to findings and recommendations contained in 
Commission resolutions and agreed conclusions in the context of relevant Human Rights 
Council thematic and country-specific work and debates. 
</p>
<p>43. It is recommended that strengthened synergies and linkages are forged between the 
Human Rights Council and the Commission, so as to ensure that the human rights 
perspective, as it relates to violence against women, is integrated in United Nations 
discussions concerning the prevention of crime and the promotion of fair and effective 
criminal justice systems.  The following recommendations may be considered in this 
regard: </p>
<p>(a) As appropriate and feasible, encourage invitations to the Special Rapporteur 
and other relevant mandates to address Commission and the Crime Congress. 
</p>
<p>(b) Promote close collaboration and consultation between Commission and the 
Special Rapporteur and other relevant procedures, including in the context of relevant 
Commission thematic discussions and open-ended working groups.  
</p>
<p>(c) Promote and encourage the exchange and distribution of relevant Human 
Rights Council reports to the Commission under the standing item on the &#8220;use and 
application of United Nations standards and norms on crime prevention and criminal 
justice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>(d) Give adequate consideration to relevant Commission reports, studies and 
recommendations in the context of the thematic work of the Human Rights Council on 
violence against women.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>44. Following the adoption in 2000 of resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, 
efforts to integrate a gender dimension into the work of the Security Council and of the 
United Nations peacekeeping architecture have increased, including follow-up resolutions 
with specific focus on conflict-related sexual violence.68  Notwithstanding the considerable 
progress made in integrating women&#8217;s rights in the context of peacemaking, peacekeeping 
and peacebuilding, observers have highlighted the need for continued efforts to ensure 
sustained and consistent attention by the Security Council to women, peace and security 
issues.69  
</p>
<p>  
 68 Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008); 1888 (2009); 1960 (2010). Also, see resolution 1889 
</p>
<p>(2009) reiterating the key role of women in preventing conflict and in peacebuilding and urged 
participation of women in all phases of the peace process.  
</p>
<p> 69 See report of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security &#8220;Mapping Women, Peace and 
Security in the UN Security Council: Report of the NGOWG Monthly Action Points for 2011-2012&#8221;. 
The report provides an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the women, peace and security work from 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>45. The Secretary-General submits an annual report on women, peace and security and 
an annual report on conflict-related sexual violence70 to the Security Council.  These reports 
and ensuing recommendations and Presidential Statements have increasingly included calls 
on States and parties to conflict as well as the international community to take measures to 
prevent and stop gender-based violence and hold perpetrators accountable.  Country reports 
submitted by peace missions and country recommendations have also increasingly referred 
to the situation of women and to gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual 
violence.  
</p>
<p>46. The set of indicators proposed by the Secretary-General to monitor the 
implementation of resolution 1325,71 include an indicator on the &#8220;extent to which violations 
of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights are reported, referred and investigated by human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies&#8221; in countries on the agenda of the Security Council.  Data for this indicator is drawn, 
inter alia, from the work of the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>47. Resolution 1888, inter alia, established the mandate of the Special Representative on 
conflict-related sexual violence to lead and coordinate efforts to end sexual violence in 
armed conflict.  The resolution encourages cooperation between the Special Representative 
on conflict-related sexual violence, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Special Representative on conflict-related sexual violence among others, to provide 
additional briefings and documentation on sexual violence in armed conflict to the 
Council.72  Informal consultations have taken place regularly between the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative on conflict-related 
sexual violence.  Also, through the secretariats of the two offices, regular exchanges of 
information are taking place on country situations, including in connection with visits, as 
well as the preparation of inputs into the Secretary-General&#8217;s reports.73  The Special 
Representative participated as a panellist at the 2011 annual full day discussion on women&#8217;s 
rights at the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>48. Paragraph 8 of resolution 1888 calls upon the Secretary-General to take measures to 
identify and deploy a Team of Experts  &#8220;to situations of particular concern with respect to 
sexual violence in armed conflict&#8221; in order &#8220;to assist national authorities . . . to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the rule of law.&#8221;  The Team was established in early 201174 with the appointment of a Team 
</p>
<p>  
August 2011 to July 2012. The report finds that general trends in the Council show significant 
development, including in the language and expertise on women, peace and security in resolutions, 
more expertise available to deploy in terms of gender advisors and a more sophisticated 
understanding of the key issues at the root of this agenda. However, the report finds that there is still a 
significant disconnect between the content of reports received by the Council, meetings the Council 
holds, and resolutions it adopts: of 82 country situation reports analysed, 52, or 63%, address women, 
peace and security; concerning Security Council&#8217;s meetings, of the 97 relevant debates or briefings, 
</p>
<p>52 meetings, or 54%, contained reference to women, peace and security issues; of the 15 presidential 
statements on country situations, only 3, or 20%, addressed women, peace and security issues; and 30 
out of 48, or 63%, of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council referenced the women, 
peace and security agenda.

 72 Security Council Resolution 1888 (2009), 30 September 2009, para. 24. 
 73 The Special Representative has identified the following priority countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, 
South Sudan and Sudan (Darfur). 
</p>
<p> 74 Within the broader objective of strengthening the rule of law, the Team of Experts: (a) works closely 
with national legal and judicial officials and other justice system personnel to address impunity; (b) 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Leader, who is based in the Office of the Special Representative on conflict-related sexual 
violence, and team members from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, OHCHR 
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (co-lead entities) who are 
located in their respective parent department/entity.  The Team&#8217;s assistance to governments 
complements existing efforts by the United Nations on the ground and results from 
thorough assessments conducted in consultation with the United Nations field presences, 
the Government and other relevant stakeholders, to determine areas of assistance to the 
Government where Team expertise might be beneficial.  The Team consistently considers 
reports and recommendations by special procedures, commissions of inquiry/fact-finding 
missions, and UPR in preparation for its engagements. 
</p>
<p>49. While the focus of the Security Council is primarily political violence directly 
related to conflict, the Human Rights Council plays a crucial role in addressing other forms 
of violence to which women are increasingly exposed in situations of conflict, crisis and 
transition, including violence in the home and the community.   
</p>
<p>50. The Human Rights Council and its mechanisms may wish to continue to build on 
and reinforce the Security Council&#8217;s work on women, peace and security and conflict-
related sexual violence, including by: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensuring that information gathered by the Human Rights Council 
mechanisms of relevance to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda, including regarding 
Security Council resolution 1325 and early warning indicators, be transmitted to the 
Security Council for consideration and follow-up action.  This includes relevant 
information by commissions of inquiry, as well as relevant geographic and thematic special 
procedures.  This can be done, inter alia, through Arria formula meetings and submission of 
updated and specific information in connection with the preparation of reports of the 
Secretary-General.  
</p>
<p>(b) Explore arrangements to ensure that Human Rights Council&#8217;s country-
specific work is informed by the Security Council&#8217;s reports on women, peace and security 
and conflict-related sexual violence, as well as briefings and press-releases by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  The latter should 
also feed, as appropriate, into the universal periodic review process.  
</p>
<p>(c) As appropriate, draw on the expertise and knowledge of the Special 
Representative in the context of special sessions and encourage commissions of inquiry to 
coordinate as appropriate with the Special Representative in the conduct of their work.   
</p>
<p>(d) In line with Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), promote continued 
cooperation between the Special Representative and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, including consultations and information sharing, as appropriate.    
</p>
<p>(e) Encouraging States, as appropriate, to rely on the services of, and cooperate 
with, the Team of Experts.  
</p>
<p>  
identifies gaps in national response and encourages a holistic national approach to addressing sexual 
violence in armed conflict, including by enhancing domestic criminal accountability, responsiveness 
to victims and judicial capacity; (c) makes recommendations to coordinate domestic and international 
efforts and resources to reinforce the Government&#8217;s ability to address sexual violence; (d) works with 
</p>
<p>a variety of United Nations mechanisms towards the full implementation of resolution 1820 (2008). 
In coordination with the Office of the SRSG SVC and UN Action, the Team identified the following 
priority countries for the current year: Central African Republic, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Somalia, Sudan (Darfur) and South Sudan. </p>


<p>(f) Encourage relevant special procedures to engage with the Team and to take 
into account its role and engagements in formulating recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> The Human Rights Council has increasingly devoted attention to the issue of 
violence against women and girls.  Because of the work of the Special Rapporteur on 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against women, as well as other thematic special procedures, the annual full 
</b></p>
<p>day discussions on women&#8217;s rights and ensuing resolutions, the work of the Advisory

<p><b>consider the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that violence against women is adequately addressed in country-
</b></p>
<p><b>specific special sessions and ensuing resolutions, as well as other country-specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolutions, including those renewing or establishing special procedures mandates.   
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Explicitly address violence against women in resolutions establishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions and encourage these bodies to 
</b></p>
<p><b>devote specific attention to violence against women and gender-based violence in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports and recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Encourage consultations and collaboration between geographic special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Encourage all special procedure mandate holders, both thematic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>geographic, </b>to devote specific attention to women&#8217;s rights and violence against women 
</p>
<p><b>during their country-missions, including by ensuring regular meetings with women 
</b></p>
<p>groups and women&#8217;s rights d<b>efenders.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Encourage greater focus on violence against women in inter-active 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogues with geographic mandate holders. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) If and when country-specific mandates are given to thematic procedures, 
</b></p>
<p><b>give adequate consideration to the inclusion of the Special Rapporteur and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant mandates, as appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Promote consistent and comprehensive attention to violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in the context of the universal periodic review, in line with the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council</b>&#8217;s thematic work on the issue.  I<b>n particular, beyond the manifestations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, it is recommended that its root causes and the responses provided by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>State, be brought to the fore of the dialogue. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> It is also crucial to continue to advance the analytical and thematic work of the 
Human Rights Council on violence against women.  In this respect, the Council may 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the following recommendations:  </b></p>


<p><b>(a) Encourage thematic special procedures, other than the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur, to continue to analyse the specific gender-dimensions of their mandates, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the issue of violence against women.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Encourage the Advisory Committee and the Expert Mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to pay attention to the relevant dimension of violence against women in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>work and recommendations, in cooperation with the Special Rapporteur and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant mandates. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Continue to promote synergies and cooperation between the work of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur and other thematic procedures, as well as the Advisory 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee and the Expert Mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Encourage adequate attention in the overall work of the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council to multiple forms of discrimination exposing women to heightened risks of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including the intersection between sex and age, disability, ethnic origin 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or affiliation, religious beliefs, language, national or social origin, political or 
</b></p>
<p><b>other opinion, property, birth, migratory status, family and marital status, sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation, gender-identity or other status.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> Arrangements should be envisaged to ensure that the Human Rights Council</b>&#8217;s 
<b>thematic analysis and research on violence against women and girls continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistently inform relevant thematic work of the General Assembly and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and vice-versa.  To this end, the following recommendations may be 
</b></p>
<p><b>considered:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Encourage the General Assembly to involve, as appropriate, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur and other mandates, such as the Working Group on discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women in law and practice and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, in the relevant thematic work and debates, including, inter alia, on 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking, ageing, violence against women migrant workers, improvement of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of women in rural areas, and women and political participation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure adequate consideration is given to findings and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>contained in relevant reports submitted to the General Assembly in the context of 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant the Human Rights Council thematic and country-specific work and debates. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that relevant Human Rights Council reports are brought to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention of the General Assembly in connection with discussions under the agenda 
</b></p>
<p><b>items on human rights and the advancement of women.  This should include the 
</b></p>
<p><b>outcome of the </b>Council&#8217;s <b>annual full </b>day discussion on women&#8217;s rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Encourage consultation and collaboration as appropriate between the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Representative for children and armed conflict and Special Representative of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Secretary-General on violence against children with the Special Rapporteur and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other relevant mechanisms of the Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Encourage the provision of an opportunity for other relevant special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, particularly the Working Group on discrimination against women in law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and practice, to systematically report to, and engage in a dialogue with the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Draw on the specific knowledge and expertise of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Representative for children and armed conflict and the Special Representative of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Secretary-General on violence against children in the context of special sessions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council and other relevant country-specific and thematic work. </b></p>


<p><b>(g) Encourage cooperation between the Special Representative for children 
</b></p>
<p><b>and armed conflict and commissions of inquiry/fact-finding missions, as feasible and 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant.  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> The Human Rights Council may wish to consider undertaking discussions with 
OHCHR, other relevant United Nations entities, the Special Rapporteur, other 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant mandates, and civil society organizations on the development of a strategy to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate the implementation of the above recommendations.
