</p>

<p>Programme of Action and the outcome document of the 2009 Durban Review Conference, 
and their follow-up processes at the national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 66/144 of 19 December 2011, by 
which the Assembly encouraged the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent to develop a programme of action, including a theme, for adoption by the Human 
Rights Council, with a view to proclaiming in 2013 the Decade for People of African 
Descent and, within this context, recalling Assembly resolution 67/155 of 20 December 
2012,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the opportunity for achieving important synergy in the combat of all 
scourges of racism through the proclamation of the International Decade for People of 
African Descent and in accelerating the universal implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of a consistent global effort to inform the public about the 
contribution of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to the struggle against 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing also</i> the important role of the independent eminent experts in following up 
on the implementation of the provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action; 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and 
economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices, 
which in turn generate more poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that the current economic and financial crisis and its 
consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the rise of 
extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated identity-related issues, 
and that, in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, persons belonging to national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers are still 
the main scapegoat of extremist political parties that have a xenophobic and racist agenda 
and that sometimes incite racial hatred and violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the misuse of print, audiovisual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and any other means that constitute incitement to acts of national, racial or 
religious violence, discrimination and hatred, which have targeted and severely affected 
racial and religious communities and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities, emanating from a variety of sources, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the Internet and social media can also be a useful tool for 
preventing the spread of racist ideologies by extremist political parties, groups and 
movements, as well as their potential to contribute to development as an international and 
equal forum, and aware that there are disparities in the use of and access thereto,
