<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that everyone has the right to life, 
liberty and security of person, as well as the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion and the right not to be discriminated against,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion shall 
include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one&#8217;s choice, and freedom, either 
individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one&#8217;s religion 
</p>
<p>or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching, and that no one shall be subject to 
coercion which would impair one&#8217;s freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one&#8217;s 
choice, as well as that freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be subject only to 
</p>
<p>such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, 
health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes 
the right of everyone to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous relevant resolutions and decisions, including Human 
Rights Council resolution 20/2 of 5 July 2012 and Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 2004/35 of 19 April 2004 and 1998/77 of 22 April 1998, in which the 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/24/2), Part One. 
</p>

<p>Commission recognized the right of everyone to have conscientious objection to military 
service as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, 
as laid down in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 18 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and general comment No. 22 (1993) of 
the Human Rights Committee, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>general comment No. 32 (2007) of the Human Rights Committee, in which it 
stated that repeated punishment of conscientious objectors for not having obeyed a renewed 
order to serve in the military based on the same constant resolve may amount to punishment 
in breach of the legal principle <i>ne bis in idem</i>,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that conscientious objection to military service derives from principles 
and reasons of conscience, including profound convictions, arising from religious, ethical, 
humanitarian or similar motives, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> that persons performing military service may develop conscientious 
objections, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recognizes</i> that the right to conscientious objection to military service can be 
derived from the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Takes note</i> of the analytical report on conscientious objection to military 
service presented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session,1 pursuant to resolution 20/2; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages</i> all States, relevant United Nations agencies, programmes and 
funds, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions to cooperate fully with the Office of the High Commissioner by providing 
relevant information for the preparation of the next quadrennial analytical report on 
conscientious objection to military service, in particular on new developments, best 
practices and remaining challenges; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Takes note</i> of the publication by the Office of the High Commissioner of a 
guide entitled <i>Conscientious Objection to Military Service</i> (2012); 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Acknowledges</i> that an increasing number of States recognize conscientious 
objection to military service not only for conscripts but also for those serving voluntarily, 
and encourages States to allow applications for conscientious objection prior to, during and 
after military service, including reserve duties; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recognizes</i> that an increasing number of States that retain compulsory military 
service are taking steps to ensure the establishment of alternatives to military service; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that some States accept claims of conscientious objection 
to military service as valid without inquiry; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon</i> States that do not have such a system to establish independent and 
impartial decision-making bodies with the task of determining whether a conscientious 
objection to military service is genuinely held in a specific case, taking account of the 
requirement not to discriminate between conscientious objectors on the basis of the nature 
of their particular beliefs; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> States with a system of compulsory military service, where such 
provision has not already been made, to provide for conscientious objectors various forms 
of alternative service which are compatible with the reasons for conscientious objection, of 
a non-combatant or civilian character, in the public interest and not of a punitive nature; 
</p>

<p>10. <i>Emphasizes</i> that States should take the necessary measures to refrain from 
subjecting individuals to imprisonment solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to 
military service and to repeated punishment for refusing to perform military service, and 
recalls that repeated punishment of conscientious objectors for refusing a renewed order to 
serve in the military may amount to punishment in breach of the legal principle <i>ne bis in idem</i>; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider releasing individuals imprisoned or detained 
solely on the basis of their conscientious objection to military service; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Reiterates</i> that States, in their law and in practice, must not discriminate 
against conscientious objectors in relation to their terms or conditions of service, or any 
economic, social, cultural, civil or political rights; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Encourages</i> States, subject to the circumstances of the individual case 
meeting the other requirements of the definition of a refugee as set out in the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the Protocol thereto of 1967, to consider 
granting asylum to those conscientious objectors to military service who have a well-
founded fear of persecution in their country of origin owing to their refusal to perform 
military service when there is no provision, or no adequate provision, for conscientious 
objection to military service; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Also encourages</i> States, as part of post-conflict peacebuilding, to consider 
granting and effectively implementing, amnesties and restitution of rights, in law and in 
practice, for those who have refused to undertake military service on grounds of 
conscientious objection to military service;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Affirms</i> the importance of the availability of information about the right to 
conscientious objection to military service, and the means of acquiring conscientious 
objector status, to all persons affected by military service; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Welcomes</i> initiatives to make such information widely available, and 
encourages States, as applicable, to provide information to conscripts and persons serving 
voluntarily in the military services about the right to conscientious objection to military 
service; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> States to respect freedom of expression of those who support 
conscientious objectors or who support the right of conscientious objection to military 
service; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Encourages</i> States to use the information contained in the above-mentioned 
report and guide of the Office of the High Commission and in the present resolution to 
consider introducing appropriate legislation, policies and practices regarding conscientious 
objection to military service, and to address any discriminatory provisions therein, and to 
inform the enforcement of an adequate legal framework to ensure that the right can be 
respected in practice; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Invites</i> States to consider including in their national reports, to be submitted 
to the universal periodic review mechanism and to United Nations human rights treaty 
bodies, information on domestic provisions related to the right to conscientious objection; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this matter under the same agenda item 
in accordance with its annual programme of work. 
</p>
<p><i>35th meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>27 September 2013 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
