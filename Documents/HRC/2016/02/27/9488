<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a 
means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to 
self-determination visited Honduras from 21 to 25 August 2006.  The Group commends the 
Honduran authorities for their cooperation and openness, which have contributed to establishing 
a constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group is encouraged by the measures undertaken to accede without delay 
to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries, as well as to strengthen the Honduran Criminal Code.  The Working Group 
welcomes the adoption in June 2005 of the rules and regulations on oversight of private military 
and security companies, as provided for in the 1998 Police Act; joint inspections of private 
security companies conducted by the Ministries of Public Security and Labour and Social 
Security; and the establishment of a Commissioner in the Ministry of Public Security with the 
specific task of registering and monitoring private security companies. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group remains concerned at information received regarding Honduran 
nationals recruited by firms registered in Honduras that are subsidiaries of foreign-based 
companies, and who have received training in Honduras, and at the situation faced by a 
significant number of these individuals who have travelled to Iraq.  Such a situation arose in the 
case of Your Solutions Honduras, a subsidiary of Your Solutions Inc. of Illinois, United States of 
America, which was subcontracted by Triple Canopy in Washington D.C., under a contract for 
the Department of Defense of the United States.  The Working Group has received information 
from a number of sources indicating irregularities in contracts, harsh working conditions with 
excessive working hours, wages partially paid or unpaid, ill-treatment and isolation, and lack of 
basic necessities such as medical treatment and sanitation.  The Working Group is also 
concerned at the fact that 105 Chileans travelled to Honduras to receive or conduct military 
training.  This report identifies omissions in monitoring the situation, which included military 
training of foreign nationals in Honduras without the approval of the National Congress, as well 
as irregularities and lack of protection in the contracts of Honduran nationals employed by 
private security companies to work in Iraq.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends that the regulatory framework for private security 
companies should be strengthened and publicized, that components on human rights and relevant 
United Nations norms should be incorporated in the training provided by private security 
companies to their employees, and that the authorities should maintain a transparent registry of 
private security companies, including on issues of ownership, control and possible conflicts of 
interest.  The Working Group further urges the competent authorities to adopt measures enabling 
them to respond with speed and vigour to complaints submitted by individuals who have 
returned from Iraq, and to consider the possible complicity and responsibility of private security 
companies and individuals involved. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Working Group visited Honduras 
from 21 to 25 August 2006.  The Working Group delegation was composed of its Chairperson, 
Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, and one of its members, Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado.  The 
Working Group is grateful to the Government of Honduras for its prompt and positive response 
to the request to visit.  The Working Group enjoyed excellent assistance from and cooperation 
with the Honduran authorities throughout the planning and conduct of this visit, and it 
commends the Government for its efforts and its readiness to consult in a constructive and 
progressive manner.  It also expresses appreciation for the fact that, in advance of the visit, 
Honduras completed the questionnaire sent to all Member States in 2005, providing a useful 
basis of information in preparation for the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. The visit to Honduras forms part of a regional assessment by the Working Group of a 
phenomenon observed in recent years in which nationals of countries in Latin America have 
been recruited by private military and security companies (referred to below as PMSCs<b>1</b>).  The 
Working Group had three areas of particular interest in Honduras:  (a) a widely reported situation 
involving Chilean nationals who provided and received security and military training in 
September 2005, and who were sent to work in Iraq; (b) Honduran nationals contracted by 
security companies in Honduras which were subsidiaries of foreign companies, and posted to 
work in Iraq; and (c) legislation and regulations governing private security companies operating 
in Honduras, including follow-up to the observations made following an earlier visit by the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on the alleged execution of 
children by employees of PMSCs.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>3. During the visit, the Working Group delegation held meetings in Tegucigalpa with the 
Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Defence, Labour, Justice and Security, deputies from the National 
Congress, the Attorney-General, the President of the Constitutional Court, the National Human 
Rights Commissioner and the National Bar Association, as well as departmental and municipal 
leaders in Tegucigalpa and Lepaterique.  The Working Group delegation also met other 
representatives of Honduran society, including representatives of a wide range of 
non-governmental organizations and private security companies and individuals, and held an 
open forum at the National Pedagogical University.  In Lepaterique, the Working Group 
delegation was allowed to visit a site where a private security company organized training for 
Honduran and foreign individuals in 2005.

</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The mandate of the Working Group was established in 2005 and builds on the work of 
the former Special Rapporteur on use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of 
the right of peoples to self-determination.  With the creation of the Working Group, the 
mandate was widened to include monitoring of PMSCs and the impact of their activities on all 
human rights.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group considers that, under international and domestic law, State 
authorities bear primary responsibility for maintaining public security and law and order in the 
State.  Given the trend towards the privatization of security and the use of force, the Working 
Group is concerned that whilst operating in armed conflicts and other situations, some PMSCs 
are committing human rights violations which go unpunished.  This phenomenon is often 
associated with the creation by transnational companies of subsidiaries with legal personality 
in one country, providing services in another and recruiting personnel from third countries.  
As indicated in the Working Group&#8217;s 2006 report to the General Assembly 
(A/61/341, paras. 65-76), the international legal framework still fails to guarantee 
transparency in these companies and monitoring of them.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II. POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY AND 
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>6. Honduras is a party to the seven major international human rights instruments, and 
ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2002.  It is also a party to the two 
Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has ratified 
only the first Optional Protocol and the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, but not the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women.  The Government of Honduras submitted a core document for 
use by the treaty bodies in September 1998 (HRI/CORE/1/Add.96).  In July 2006, a total of nine 
periodic reports from Honduras were overdue:  two to the Committee against Torture (first and 
second); one to the Human Rights Committee (second); three to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women (fourth to sixth); one to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (first); and the two initial reports due under the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>7. Honduras is not a party to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries, which has been ratified by 28 States.  Despite the 
limitations of this 1989 Convention, accession constitutes an important step towards addressing 
the problem of mercenaries.  The Working Group is encouraged by the verbal statements and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.1

</p>
<p>repeated indications from the executive, legislative and judicial branches in Honduras and 
welcomes indications from the treaty department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the issue 
of ratification of the Convention could be placed before Congress in the coming months.  The 
Working Group welcomes this step and offers its support and assistance for speedy ratification. 
</p>
<p>8. One of the Convention&#8217;s limitations is that PMSCs and their employees fall into a grey 
area which the Convention does not specifically cover.  This demonstrates the need for 
appropriate national regulation, control and monitoring of the activities of these security 
companies to guarantee State responsibility for the effective protection of human rights.  In terms 
of human rights obligations, while the responsibilities of non-State actors remain a matter for 
debate, the Working Group considers that private enterprises, as organs of society, share the 
obligations set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Once international treaties enter into force, they become part of domestic law and their 
provisions can be invoked by individuals or legal entities in any court or before any authority in 
the country.  Any conflict between a treaty and the Constitution is resolved in accordance with 
the Constitution, which stipulates that, in cases of conflict between a treaty and domestic law, the 
treaty shall prevail (Constitution of Honduras, arts. 16, 17 and 18). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p>10. Given the limited international regulation of PMSCs, the Working Group notes the 
critical importance of complementing international efforts by establishing licensing and 
registration systems for PMSCs and their employees at the national level.  Such regulation 
should include defining minimum requirements for transparency and accountability of firms, 
screening and vetting personnel, and establishing a monitoring system including parliamentary 
oversight. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to the situation of Chileans trained in Honduras, relevant articles in the 
Constitution include article 15 (in which Honduras endorses &#8220;the principles and practices &#8230; 
which promote human solidarity, respect for the self-determination of peoples, non-intervention 
and the strengthening of universal peace and democracy&#8221;), as well as articles 30 to 35, in 
particular article 32, which states that &#8220;foreigners may not carry out political activities of a 
national or international character in the country, on pain of punishment in accordance with the 
law&#8221;.  The Constitution does allow the National Congress to authorize foreign military missions 
to provide assistance and technical cooperation in Honduras, and to allow or forbid foreign 
troops to pass through Honduran territory (art. 205).  Although there is no provision specifically 
dealing with military training of foreign civilians, Congress argues that activities by foreign 
troops on Honduran soil should be authorized by the legislature and not the Government. 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group was informed of the amendment process designed to strengthen the 
provisions of the Criminal Code in order to counter the use of mercenaries.  The National 
Human Rights Commissioner noted that article 317 of the Criminal Code stipulated up to 
six years&#8217; imprisonment for training of nationals of third countries, with a clear distinction made 
where the ultimate purpose was training for the security services.  Senior representatives of the 
judiciary were seeking to expand the definitions to fulfil the requirements of the Convention 
against Mercenaries, and also indicated that a special law could be one legislative avenue to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>pursue in this regard.  The Procurator-General favoured amending the Criminal Code, where 
&#8220;unlawful association&#8221; meant simply belonging to a gang.  Another provision which the 
judiciary considered in need of improvement was article 416 of the Criminal Code, which dealt 
with the recruitment of troops of foreign nationality.  
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group was informed that an Interdepartmental Commission had been set up 
in June 2006 to meet two to three times per month, convened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
to ensure greater coordination of the efforts of the authorities for the promotion and protection of 
human rights.  The Commission includes the Procurator-General, the Special Procurator for 
Human Rights, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice, the 
Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme Court and the Procurator. 
</p>
<p>14. Another measure was the establishment of a &#8220;mercenaries unit&#8221; in the Ministry of Public 
Security (Acting Director-General of Special Investigation Services in the DGIC).  The Special 
Unit for Private Security Companies was set up in early 2006, with the task of undertaking joint 
inspections with the Ministry of Labour.  The Unit is to make announced or surprise inspection 
visits. 
</p>
<p>15. In October 2002, the Honduran National Congress approved a law regulating the 
possession of firearms and other weapons.  The law bans individuals, including members of 
private security firms, from possessing weapons such as AK-47s.  The Ministry of Security, 
which also licenses weapons of particular calibres, maintains a ballistics register indicating who 
is responsible and who owns weapons.  A Criminal Unit in the Ministry of Public Security will 
be administering the ballistics register, while not controlling it.  The previous Government 
privatized the ballistics register in 2004 under a concession arrangement.  The figure of US$ 24 
per weapon initially charged has now been reduced to US$ 17 per weapon.  Now all equipment 
is monitored, and the State keeps US$ 5 for each weapon registered. 
</p>
<p>16. Each PMSC must report on its weapons, including their calibre, and register them.  
Unregistered weapons are confiscated.  By law, PMSCs cannot use automatic weapons (nor can 
the police).  Previously, a PMSC could loan weapons to another company, but now such 
transfers are prohibited.  The Ministry of Defence is responsible for authorizing imports of small 
arms and light weapons and granting licences to importers. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group notes that, although PMSCs do not act as agents of the State, the 
State is responsible for issuing licences and for monitoring and oversight both of parent 
companies and of subsidiaries.   
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES IN HONDURAS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Recruitment and military training of Hondurans and foreigners 
by private security companies for service in Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>18. Between July and October 2005, Your Solutions Honduras SRL, a local agent of 
Your Solutions Incorporated, registered in Illinois, United States of America, which in turn had 
been subcontracted by Triple Canopy, based in Chicago, United States of America, recruited and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>trained 189 Hondurans in Honduras.  Triple Canopy had been awarded a contract by the 
United States Department of State.<b>5</b>  The 189-strong contingent left the country by air from 
San Pedro Sula, Honduras, in several groups (12 persons on 13 July 2005, 12 more on 
23 August, 111 on 11 October and 54 on 13 October), with a stopover in Iceland, as confirmed 
by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.  The majority of the 189 Hondurans were 
engaged as security guards at fixed facilities in Iraq.  Your Solutions Honduras was also 
reportedly a subsidiary of, or had close ties with, the North American private security company 
InterCom, which operates in Honduras.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>19. As happens in other parts of the world where transnational corporations provide private 
military and security services in armed conflict zones and subcontract to local companies in 
third world countries, the private security company Your Solutions Honduras and the company 
Your Solutions Incorporated engaged Honduran personnel for Triple Canopy, which operates in 
Iraq, to provide security services in the ongoing conflict there.  The Working Group received 
information concerning irregularities in compliance with the contracts of these employees, who 
report harsh working conditions, partial payment or non-payment of wages, arbitrary action by 
superiors including isolation, lack of basic necessities such as food and lodging, as well as a lack 
of medical treatment and poor sanitation. 
</p>
<p>20. According to the contracts signed in Tegucigalpa, these persons were going to Iraq as 
security guards.  However, the statements taken indicate that they were given military training 
and instruction in anti-guerrilla tactics such as possible ambushes and how to avoid them, and 
deactivation of explosives and mortars.  Some are reported to have received this training in 
Honduras, others on arrival in Iraq.  Information received shows they used high-calibre weapons 
such as M-16 rifles or light machine guns.  The instructors in Honduras were reportedly often 
Chileans and used aliases, but they are also said to have received training from Honduran Army 
soldiers.<b>7</b>  These additional tasks, and conditions of work which included far more hours, were 
not mentioned or agreed in their contracts.  Their identity documents were issued by the 
United States Embassy in Baghdad. 
</p>
<p>21. Triple Canopy is said to have been awarded the contract for the defence of Baghdad&#8217;s 
heavily fortified &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; starting in November 2005.  Up to that date, the company 
Global Strategies Group had been in charge of security in the so-called &#8220;Green Zone&#8221;.

</b>  Information confirmed by the Ministry of Security, which reported that Your Solutions was a

<p>subsidiary of InterCom but operated independently, although the shareholders were the same in 
both companies.

</b>  Before they left Honduras, compulsory vaccinations were reportedly administered by Ministry

<p>of Health staff. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>For the protection of fixed facilities in the &#8220;Green Zone&#8221;, Triple Canopy, through two 
subsidiaries, recruited 189 Hondurans and a substantial number of other Latin Americans, 
including 105 Chileans trained in Honduras. 
</p>
<p>22. Honduras is one of those third world countries where there are a number of conditions of 
benefit to the globalized economy:  cheap labour, widespread unemployment, a population 
which traditionally migrates abroad in search of work and an economy heavily dependent on the 
remittances sent back to the country by that migrant workforce, amounting to around 
US$ 250 million a year. 
</p>
<p>23. The process of engaging the Hondurans was conducted with the consent, and under the 
supervision, of the Ministry responsible for the portfolios of labour and social security, which, in 
accordance with its powers under articles 43 to 45 of the Labour Code, as amended by decree 
No. 32-2003, monitored, and in some cases apparently suggested amendments to, the clauses 
governing the nature and provision of the work<b>8</b> and verified the legal standing of Your Solutions 
Incorporated of Illinois, as the employer, and Your Solutions Honduras SRL, as its agent.  The 
Ministry of Labour and Social Security appears to have decided to regard the private security 
guards as migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>24. In early May 2005, the Honduran media revealed that the then Minister responsible for 
the portfolios of labour and social security, Germ&#225;n Edgardo Leitzelar Vidaurreta, had received 
visits from United States companies providing security services - mainly to the United States 
Government - which had expressed an interest in working with specialists in that field to effect 
transfers of immigrant workers.  The Minister had reportedly made it clear that it would be 
necessary to draw up regulations and an agreement providing Hondurans with the strongest 
possible guarantees and assurances, in order to discourage clandestine departures, which were 
common occurrences.  He had also pointed out the risk that, without the involvement of the 
Ministry of Labour, such persons might be recruited from neighbouring Central American 
countries.  Consequently he had reportedly stressed that the Ministry would draft regulations to 
make sure that Hondurans taking up such offers did not fall prey to fraud or deception.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The Hondurans in Iraq had been recruited to provide the following services (though not 
all had signed a contract before leaving the country):  interpreter, personal security detail, 
fixed-facility security, convoy security and others related to all-round security.  With the 
exception of interpreting services - for which no Hondurans were chosen, as far as the Working 
Group is aware - the remaining services all involved security situations that might at any moment 
turn into direct combat situations.  Under one of the clauses in the contract, the employer 
reserved the right to transfer or move the employee from any given post, assignment or task as 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  According to clause 9 of the contract, entitled &#8220;Presumption of risk&#8221;, &#8220;the employee knowingly 
</p>
<p>and voluntarily acknowledges the risks to which he will be exposed by the nature of the work, 
and the known and unknown risks he may face during training and in the performance of his 
duties, including during transport and travel between destinations.  The signatory certifies that 
the employing authority has advised him of the risks and hazards inherent in the work.&#8221; 
<b>9
</b>  <i>La Tribuna</i>, 13 May 2005. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>required.  All the Hondurans known by the Working Group to have served in Iraq went as 
security guards in Baghdad&#8217;s &#8220;Green Zone&#8221;.  The initial offers reportedly received by the 
Ministry mentioned a wage of US$ 300 a day (around US$ 9,000 a month).  By the time the 
contracts were signed the wages had fallen sharply, and according to a Your Solutions Honduras 
advertisement, wages ranged between US$ 990 and US$ 1,500 a month. 
</p>
<p>26. The hazardous nature of these assignments is reflected in several clauses in the contract, 
which the Hondurans were obliged to accept before signing.  For example, the employee 
&#8220;<i>understands and accepts that, in providing the services referred to in the present contract, he 
will be exposed to great risk and immediate danger and to the many risks associated with a 
hostile environment, including but not limited to the threats inherent in a war situation, and 
therefore recognizes and is aware that the performance of his duties may expose him to physical 
and material injury or result in death, disablement or incapacitation</i>&#8221;.  In this connection, the 
contract states that the employer will provide recruits with a life insurance policy and medical 
and hospital insurance, effective from the date of entry into service. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group has not had access to the policy mentioned in the previous 
paragraph, but wishes to point out that one of the main complaints of the Hondurans who served 
in Iraq was precisely to do with medical assistance.  Thus, for example, in one of the statements 
made to the Office of the Attorney for Human Rights, the complainant alleges that, although he 
had fractured his right ankle and was unfit for work, his superiors did not secure medical 
assistance for him so that he could be declared unfit for work:  he had to continue working with 
no medical assistance whatsoever.  When he invoked the medical and hospital insurance 
provisions in the contract, his superiors replied that the contract he had signed in Honduras was 
&#8220;in their view not valid&#8221;.<b>10</b>  The same kind of situation was confirmed by at least one other of 
those who served in Iraq, who had one foot badly swollen as a result of a fall, but nevertheless 
had to perform his duties in a lookout tower on crutches, complete with machine gun and 
bullet-proof vest.  To save time, since he could move around only very slowly, he was ferried by 
car to the canteen and to the place where he was on guard duty. 
</p>
<p>28. A year after the Minister of Labour&#8217;s statements to the press, and following recruitment, 
training and service in the &#8220;Green Zone&#8221;, some 16 persons engaged by Your Solutions Honduras 
and Your Solutions Inc. lodged claims with the Honduran authorities (a) on labour grounds, for 
breach of individual fixed-term contracts and unilateral termination of contract, and (b) on 
criminal grounds, with the Attorney for Human Rights in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  The 
Attorney reportedly brought charges against government officials who had permitted Your 
Solutions to engage Hondurans for security service in Iraq and force them to fight alongside 
United States soldiers.  He reportedly submitted 3 of the 16 statements by Hondurans so 
recruited to the Tegucigalpa Criminal Court as evidence in criminal proceedings against public 
servants or employees for permitting illegal recruitment.<b>11</b>

<p>29. In parallel with the recruitment and training of the 189 Hondurans, 105 Chileans, 
apparently recruited in Chile, were either undergoing (in 97 cases) or providing (in 8 cases) 
training in Honduras for the Iraq contingent.  The Chileans had entered Honduras as tourists in 
September 2005.  When, on completion of the training course,<b>12</b> the press discovered and 
revealed that Chilean ex-soldiers were receiving training in Honduras, the Migration Department 
announced that they had entered the country as tourists, were there illegally and must leave.  
Fifty other Chileans then in El Salvador awaiting training in Honduras were reportedly 
denied entry.  After having been granted a 72-hour extension by the Migration Department, 
the 105 Chileans were escorted to the Nicaraguan border, where the Nicaraguan authorities 
denied them entry on suspicion that they were mercenaries.  A further 72-hour extension enabled 
them to prolong their stay in Honduras, and an appeal to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to be 
allowed to stay in the country, in a hotel in Choluteca in the custody of the migration authorities, 
enabled them to stay until early October 2005, when they left on the same aircraft that was to 
take the third group of Hondurans to Iraq. 
</p>
<p>30. The Hondurans and Chileans recruited for Iraq were trained at the development centre of 
the Honduras Forestry Development Corporation (COHDEFOR), a former army base in the 
municipality of Lepaterique,<b>13</b> some 40 kilometres from the capital, where the facilities had 
reportedly been rented to the Scout Association of Honduras.  Several statements indicated that 
some of the Honduran and Chilean recruits were trained not only at Lepaterique but also at the 
Army Military Training Centre (CAME) in Olancho.  This information was not confirmed at the 
Working Group&#8217;s interview with the Minister of Defence, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and the Armed Forces Chief of Military Intelligence.  However, according to statements made to 
the press by the former Minister of Defence, Federico Brev&#233; Travieso, Your Solutions did at 
one point request permission to use the CAME facilities in Olancho, but permission was denied. 
</p>
<p>31. Various sources agree that the training conducted at Lepaterique was of a military nature 
involving the use of weapons of the M-16 type, which are considered illegal in Honduras.<b>14</b>  The 
director of Your Solutions Honduras himself admitted, in an interview with the daily <i>La Tribuna</i>, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  All the Chileans had successfully completed the training course in Honduras except three, 
</p>
<p>who were sent back to Chile. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  Known to have been used in the 1980s as a training camp for the Nicaraguan Contras and 
Argentina&#8217;s 601st Intelligence Battalion, a specialist counter-terrorist unit under Operaci&#243;n 
Condor.  In 2005 the director of COHDEFOR is said to have signed an agreement with the head 
of the Scout Association, at that time the Deputy Minister of Labour.  The presidency of the 
Scout Association later passed to the then Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces, 
now retired from the Army. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  Statements from local residents, articles in the press and statements from some of the guards 
who underwent training mention deafening bursts of gunfire reminiscent of the 1980s, when 
Contra forces were being trained.  Also, shell cartridges found at the training sites are the calibre 
of illegal firearms. </p>

</p>
<p>that he had borrowed or rented some of the M-16s.  The Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
stressed to the Working Group that the Armed Forces were not involved in or in any way 
responsible for the training - which he maintained had been security, not military, training. 
</p>
<p>32. The contracts were signed by the director of Your Solutions Inc. of Illinois, and the 
individual contracted in Honduras.  The signature of the director of Your Solutions Honduras did 
not appear on the contracts.  Nevertheless, a clause in the contract states that &#8220;Your Solutions 
Honduras shall be jointly responsible with Your Solutions Inc. for payment of the emoluments 
contracted&#8221;.  Another clause establishes that &#8220;the contract shall be governed by the laws of the 
State of Illinois, United States of America, and of Honduras, as though signed in that location, 
nullifying any conflict of laws to which it may give rise.  In the event of compliance disputes, the 
competent courts shall in all cases be determined at the employee&#8217;s request, or wherever the 
service is being provided ...&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. The contract contains clauses on (a) the location and performance of duties (in and 
around Iraq); (b) length and duration (12 months); (c) working conditions (up to 12 hours 
remunerable, one day a week off); (d) remuneration, compensation and expenses (in most cases 
the pay is US$ 990 a month); (e) provision of board, lodging and equipment; (f) the dangerous 
nature of the situation and presumption of risk; and (g) guidelines as to conduct, which should 
comply with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the employee&#8217;s country of 
residence.  But there is no clause dealing with employees&#8217; individual liability for any serious 
violations of human rights or of international humanitarian law which they might commit in a 
situation of armed conflict where they are constantly exposed to &#8220;great risk and immediate 
danger&#8221; in a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221; including but not limited to &#8220;the threats inherent in a war 
situation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. The Working Group notes with concern that Your Solutions Honduras, which recruited, 
trained and dispatched 189 Hondurans and 105 Chileans for service in Iraq, was not listed among 
the 123 legally established private security companies registered with the Ministry of Security.  
This information was confirmed by the Ministry of Security&#8217;s Commissioner on the oversight of 
private security companies, who is responsible for enforcing the regulations.  According to the 
information provided, private security companies are required to register with the Ministry of 
Security and the Property Institute; registration with the Chamber of Commerce is optional.  
Your Solutions Honduras was not registered with the Ministry of Security.<b>15</b>  Another disturbing 
fact is that the director of Your Solutions Honduras is a former army major and that the person in 
charge of training the Honduran and Chilean contingent that went to Iraq is also a former army 
colonel who reportedly continues to hold a senior security post in the present Government.  
Besides not being legally registered with the Ministry of Security, Your Solutions Honduras 
carried out activities for which there is no provision in the Police Act or in article 22 of the 
regulations, such as, for example, the export of military and security services to another country.

<p><b>B. Activities, coverage, operation and oversight of private 
security companies in Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>35. The State of Honduras is constitutionally responsible for the country&#8217;s internal security 
and the protection of its citizens.  The National Police is responsible for maintaining law and 
order, preventing, controlling and combating crime and ensuring the safety of persons and their 
property.<b>16</b>  However, the country is currently plagued by a breakdown in law and order that, 
according to the National Human Rights Commissioner, has assumed the characteristics of a 
national emergency.  Improper conduct by many police officers, and the fact that the police have 
clearly taken the administration of justice into their own hands, bypassing the rule of law, are 
two of the many factors contributing to this situation.<b>17</b>  The Commissioner warned as early 
as 2003 that fear and insecurity were infesting the people&#8217;s everyday lives little by little.  The 
country&#8217;s internal security is increasingly being handed over to private individuals and private 
security companies. 
</p>
<p>36. The Ministry of Security is responsible for the regulation and oversight of private 
security companies.  Under the Police Act (art. 102), civil society is allowed to involve itself in 
the area of law and order.  The Ministry of Security may encourage the formation of security or 
neighbourhood watch committees, which already exist in many communities in Honduras, in 
accordance with article 57 of the Regulations on Registration, Monitoring, Supervision and 
Oversight of Private Security, Investigation and Training Companies and Internal Security Units, 
though these were previously encouraged by the Ministry of Security and the Government.  
These security committees, according to a report by the Arias Foundation,<b>18</b> give cause for 
concern.  Members have been involved in murders and other crimes, as well as unlawful 
detentions and violations of the right to freedom of movement.  It is said that not even the police 
are adequately equipped to control the committees.  According to the report, &#8220;the formation by 
communities of security or neighbourhood watch committees has in recent years become a 
matter of concern for human rights bodies in Honduras, because this form of involvement has 
resulted in a shift of police powers into private hands&#8221;.  Ministry of Security figures show that 
there were 180 citizens&#8217; security committees in 2000 and more than 200 in 2006.  In recent years 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is said to have brought to court a number of murder cases against 
members of citizens&#8217; security committees. 
</p>
<p>37. Before the creation of the National Police in 1996, it was the Ministry of Defence that 
issued operating permits to private security companies.  Security companies&#8217; operations are now 
governed by article 10, paragraph 5, of the Police Act.  Although under article 91 of the Act it is

</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  In April 2006, the National Human Rights Commissioner, alarmed at the breakdown in law 
</p>
<p>and order and the behaviour of the police, wrote an open letter to the President, published in the 
media, urging him to launch a clean-up of the police force.  <i>La Tribuna</i>, 27 April 2006.

page 14 
 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Security that authorizes private security companies to operate, on the basis of a 
decision by one of the Ministry&#8217;s departments, the Act does not specify which department.  The 
companies are supposed to be regulated by the Ministry of Security&#8217;s Security Company 
Supervision and Oversight Unit, which, according to information received, only commenced 
operations in 2006, though it was set up in 2003, and is not well staffed.  The regulations on 
registration, supervision and oversight, which under the 1998 Police Act should have been drawn 
up around eight months after the Act entered into force, were in fact drafted only in 2005. 
</p>
<p>38. Although article 92 of the Police Act lists and defines the private security services such 
companies may provide, the Ministry of Security seems to disregard these definitions when 
issuing licences to private security companies.  This means the companies can provide whatever 
form of security clients may request without regulation by the Honduran authorities.  This 
situation would not only make it difficult to categorize the security companies according to 
service provided, as required by law, but would also create problems of control for the Ministry 
of Security&#8217;s supervision unit.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The regulations and manuals that are supposed to govern private security companies are 
reportedly the responsibility of the National Council for Internal Security (CONASIN), a 
collegiate body which, among other tasks, is expected to &#8220;examine and rule on police regulations 
and manuals&#8221;, in accordance with article 4 of the Police Act.  However, the Working Group only 
learnt of this institution on reading through the Police Act. 
</p>
<p>40. There are 123 legally constituted private security companies in Honduras.<b>20</b>  Some 30 of 
these belong to the Asociaci&#243;n de Empresas de Seguridad e Investigaci&#243;n Privada de Honduras 
(Honduran Association of Private Security and Investigation Companies), which estimates the 
total number of private security companies operating legally and illegally in Honduras at more 
than 350.  According to article 101 of the Police Act, &#8220;no agency authorized to provide private 
security services may employ security operatives equivalent in number to more than 15 per cent 
of the total National Police force or use firearms of unauthorized calibre or type.  Firearms shall 
in all cases be different from those used by the National Police&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. In this regard, it should be noted that, under article 292 of the Constitution, the 
Armed Forces have sole rights to the manufacture, import, distribution and sale of firearms.  
Arms registration and purchase are carried out through the Armed Forces armoury.

</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Information provided by the Registration, Supervision and Oversight Unit in the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Security.  This report indicates that the total number of registrations is 250, a figure that includes, 
apart from the 123 legally constituted private security companies, the following categories:  
36 business security companies; 32 neighbourhood watch organizations; 34 permit applications 
pending; 22 permit applications rejected and 3 companies closed down following cessation of 
operations or liquidation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>42. Alongside the 250 private security companies registered with the Ministry of Security, of 
which only 123 are legally constituted, there are reportedly more than 280 operating illegally in 
Honduras - though their precise number and the nature of their operations are not known.  
Referred to as &#8220;briefcase companies&#8221;, they have no fixed address and no overheads other than 
the wages of the agents working for them and the weapons they purchase once they have 
obtained a contract.  Use is made of these companies because of the low prices they charge.  
Nothing at all is known about them:  who owns them, who works for them, how they select their 
employees, what training they have, what weapons they use or who supplies them.  Frequently, 
such briefcase companies, or even just a single vigilante operating on his own, offer security 
services to the residents of a neighbourhood or area.  It often happens that the residents reject the 
offer and the vigilantes themselves or their accomplices break into their houses and rob or wreck 
them.  Employees of such companies reportedly work 24 hours at a stretch followed by 24 hours 
off, and have no social security whatsoever. 
</p>
<p>43. Various sources agree that, counting the legally registered companies and the illegal 
operations, the number of people employed by private security companies in Honduras as private 
guards and vigilantes must range between 20,000 at a minimum and 70,000 at most.<b>21</b>  The 
National Police numbers 12,000, of whom 7,300 belong to the uniformed Preventive Police.  
These figures are very disturbing.  There seems to be no authority with any control over these 
companies&#8217; actions, which pose a serious threat to the general public and to law and order.  
These illegal companies reportedly have thousands of banned weapons acquired on the black 
market, such as AK-47 and M-16 assault rifles and Uzi submachine guns.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Other provisions of the Police Act and the Regulations on Registration, Monitoring, 
Supervision and Oversight of Private Security Companies allow private individuals or 
organizations to make their own security arrangements without any need for a licence, providing 
the number of security personnel employed does not exceed 100 and that such arrangements are 
not for profit. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> As mentioned above, Honduras is a party to the main international human rights 
instruments.  It has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which 
has jurisdiction over persons who commit serious international crimes.  It has acceded to 
the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and Additional Protocols I and II thereto. 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> In the context of international humanitarian law governing the rules of war 
(<i>jus in bello</i>), article 47 of Additional Protocol I defines a mercenary and establishes that a 
mercenary is not a combatant and shall not be considered a prisoner of war in case of 
capture, but does not define mercenary activities as an international crime or establish any 
obligation to punish such activities.

</p>
<p>47.<b> In the context of international law on human rights, the stability of Governments, 
non-intervention and the territorial integrity of States, the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries ensures the 
protection of human rights and the application of <i>jus ad bellum</i>.23  In defining mercenaries, 
the Convention adopts the criteria established in article 47 of Additional Protocol I, but it 
also categorizes as offences both the activities of mercenaries themselves and those of 
persons involved in recruiting, using, financing or training mercenaries.  The provisions of 
the Convention establish an obligation to punish a mercenary who &#8220;effectively participates 
directly in hostilities or in an act of violence&#8221;.  Honduras is not a party to this Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The Hondurans and Chileans recruited and trained in Honduras meet some of the 
Convention criteria.  In the first place, mention should be made of the fact that they have 
received military training, have been provided with combat weapons such as machine guns 
or assault rifles, and have been issued with uniforms very similar to those worn by 
United States soldiers in Iraq and with bullet-proof vests and helmets.  The fact that they 
had to do front-line guard duty in the &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; in Baghdad could very well be 
interpreted as indicating that they were specially recruited abroad in order to fight in an 
armed conflict.  In an armed conflict such as the one in Iraq it is impossible to distinguish 
between regular combat troops and auxiliary support forces, particularly in situations 
where private guards provide protection to convoys, buildings, people or equipment. 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> They also meet certain other criteria in the Convention definition, such as the fact 
that both the private security companies involved in the recruitment, training and 
financing of those engaged and the individual Hondurans and Chileans were motivated 
essentially by the desire for private gain.  They also meet the criteria of being neither 
nationals of a party to the conflict nor residents of territory controlled by a party to the 
conflict, and not having been sent by a State which is not a party to the conflict on official 
duty as a member of its armed forces. 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> It remains to be determined whether the Hondurans and Chileans were acting as 
members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict, i.e., whether, having been recruited 
under a contract with the United States Department of State, they were members of the 
United States Army. 
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> It also remains to be determined whether the Hondurans and Chileans participated 
in the hostilities.  In an armed conflict such as the one in Iraq, the line separating the 
passive services for which they were recruited, such as personal security detail, 
fixed-facility security or convoy security, from actions involving participation in the 
hostilities in case of attack, is a very fine one that may easily be crossed. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> The Convention states in its preamble that &#8220;matters not regulated by such a 
convention continue to be governed by the rules and principles of international law&#8221;.

Declaration constitute basic principles of international law&#8221;,25 and &#8220;consequently 
[appealed] to all States to be guided by these principles in their international conduct and 
to develop their mutual relations on the basis of the strict observance of these principles&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> As a Member of the United Nations and of the international community, Honduras 
has undertaken to observe international law.  This was recently affirmed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs26 in its reply to the Working Group on Mercenaries by reference to 
article 15 of the Constitution, which states that &#8220;Honduras endorses the principles and 
practices of international law, which promote solidarity, respect for the self-determination 
of peoples, non-intervention and the strengthening of universal peace and democracy&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> By making it possible for a Honduran private security company, a subsidiary of a 
North American private security company that was itself subcontracted by another 
company to which the United States Department of State had awarded a security contract 
in the &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; in Baghdad to recruit and train Honduran and Chilean nationals on 
its territory and send them to Iraq, Honduras has failed to uphold principles of 
international law.  Furthermore, as a State party to the Rome Statute, Honduras should 
have refrained from exposing its own nationals to military service in a situation of armed 
conflict, or sending the nationals of another country through its territory for that purpose. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The fact of delegating what are normally functions of the State to private entities 
does not relieve Honduras of its obligation to guarantee security, law and order, the rule of 
law and respect for human rights, or of its responsibility to uphold the principles of 
international law. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> It is worth asking how far a State can cede control of public security to foreign 
private security companies before losing part of its sovereignty and before the situation 
becomes one of interference in the internal affairs of that State. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> In the case of Iraq, the Honduran authorities should have made an assessment of the 
services to be provided by the persons recruited by the private security company.  In a 
situation of armed conflict such as the one in Iraq, services such as personal security detail, 
fixed-facility security or convoy security and other general security-related duties would 
inevitably require the Hondurans to carry heavy weapons in order to deal with war 
situations and involve a constant risk of entering into direct engagement with Iraqi

<p>63.<b> With regard to the 105 Chileans who, after having been recruited by Your 
Solutions, entered Honduras on tourist visas, 97 of whom received training in Honduras 
while 8 acted as instructors, and all of whom left the country by plane, presumably illegally 
via San Pedro Sula and bound for Iraq, the Working Group would like to request the 
Honduran authorities to look into these events and consider whether this allegation does 
not in part imply a violation of article 317 of the Criminal Code, on offences which 
endanger the peace, external security or dignity of the nation, which punishes &#8220;<i>anyone who 
recruits troops in Honduras to serve a foreign nation, for any purpose whatsoever</i>&#8221;.  It also 
wonders whether there have not been any violations of the relevant provisions of the 
Honduran Criminal Code relating to arms control, abuse of power, use of weapons, 
involvement of foreign ex-soldiers in activities of a military nature, and unlawful 
association. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> By exporting personnel services to Iraq through the local agent of a private security 
company, Your Solutions Honduras, Honduras has become de facto a country from which 
contingents leave for operations in other countries, regardless of the fact that the employer 
was Your Solutions Incorporated, of Illinois, United States of America.  The Working 
Group wishes to refer to its report to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session 
(A/61/341, para. 98), in which it recommended that States from which these private 
companies export military or security services should adopt the legislative instruments 
needed to set up regulatory mechanisms to control and monitor their activities, including a 
system of registering and licensing which would authorize these companies to operate and 
allow penalties to be imposed on them when the norms are not respected. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> In this context, the Working Group welcomes indications that the Attorney for 
Human Rights in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is preparing to bring charges against 
government officials who allowed Your Solutions to engage Hondurans to go to Iraq to 
provide security services and obliged them to fight alongside United States soldiers.29 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> What with the Security and Neighbourhood Watch Committees, private security 
companies operating legally or otherwise, and Honduran nationals&#8217; right to form their own 
security corps up to 100 strong, Honduras now has some veritable &#8220;mini-armies&#8221; to which 
the State has ceded some of its monopoly on the use of force, and which are beyond the 
control of the authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> What is more, it is claimed by a number of sources that former members of the 
Armed Forces and the police are the owners of many of these private security companies or 
hold important positions in them, and in some cases held such posts while still on active 
service.  Such close ties make for a dangerous conflict of interest.  Those private security 
companies that are owned by ex-police or ex-military personnel are also said to be the most 
reluctant to comply with the registration and oversight regulations.  Another cause for

</p>
<p><b>concern is the fact that there were allegations regarding the office of the Commissioner 
appointed to monitor the private security companies, indicating a murky past that required 
a clean-up operation to be carried out. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> It is alarming to find that a relatively small number of the weapons supplied to the 
legally constituted private security companies should have come from the Armoury, 
implying that other sources of supply exist.30  It is also disturbing to note that none of the 
four private security companies described by the Ministry of Security as the most 
important ones (InterCom, InterSec Security, Walking Hound and Golan Group) is listed 
in the Ministry&#8217;s register of legally constituted private security companies.  Two of them 
(InterSec and Golan) are not listed in the public business register either. 
</b>69.<b> Another concern is related to the establishment in Honduras of transnational 
private security companies that allegedly attract not only former members of the 
Honduran military and police, but also active members of both forces, by offering higher 
pay, and are also reported to operate outside the proper control and oversight of the 
appropriate bodies, which poses a threat to national sovereignty.  By law, foreign private 
security companies may operate in Honduras provided they are associated with Honduran 
companies, but it appears that this requirement is not being met.31 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> All these indicators point to an alarming situation in which the State of Honduras 
has ceded part of its sovereignty in respect of internal security, and apparently continues to 
do so.  In the Working Group&#8217;s opinion, the State has shown negligence in so delegating its 
own powers. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Working Group is particularly worried by the measures reportedly taken by 
the three branches of government on 29 August 2006 in relation to public security policy, 
which enable some 30,000 private security guards to provide backup to the police and the 
Armed Forces in fighting crime in Honduras, and which authorized private security guards 
to take action and even open fire on lawbreakers attempting a robbery.  Once again the 
question must be raised of how far a State can go in handing control of the use of force over 
to private security companies. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Working Group is also concerned at the campaign of harassment, death threats 
and slander against the Asociaci&#243;n para una Sociedad M&#225;s Justa (Association for a Fairer 
Society - ASJ) and its project coordinator, journalist Dina Meetabel Meza Elvir, launched 
by Delta Security Services, a private security company, following the Society&#8217;s defence of 
the labour rights of 12 security guards working for Delta who were arbitrarily dismissed, 
and the support the Society provided to other employees being exploited by State 
enterprises to which Delta provides private security services.

<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group wishes to submit the following seven recommendations to the 
Honduran Government for its consideration: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) It should accede to the International Convention against the Recruitment, 
Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries and amend the relevant article of the 
Criminal Code to take account of the measures contained in the Convention on 
punishment for the recruitment, use, financing and training of personnel for mercenary 
purposes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) It should carry out an in-depth study of the manner in which the agencies 
and institutions responsible for enforcing the law, the Ministry of Security (National Police 
and Department of Investigation), the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the judiciary and the 
prison system, operate and perform their duties, and make the necessary changes to 
guarantee law and order, protect people and property and strengthen the rule of law.  In 
formulating and evaluating this policy, the authorities should draw maximum benefit from 
the advice of the National Commission for Internal Security (CONASIN), a collegiate body 
comprising State institutions and representatives of civil society; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) It should strictly apply the provisions of the Police Act and the Regulations 
on Registration, Monitoring, Supervision and Oversight of Private Security, Investigation 
and Training Companies and Internal Security Units, which provide that all private 
security companies should be legally constituted and registered with the Ministry of 
Security; a full survey of all private security companies operating in the country should be 
carried out and their arsenals continuously and effectively monitored in accordance with 
the law; their agents should wear uniforms and bear the insignia of the service company, 
the corresponding identification bearing the agent&#8217;s full name and photograph, approved 
by the police; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) It should ensure the certification of the services provided by the private 
security companies and the training of their agents, and oversight by the Ministry of 
Security of entrance tests and recruit training and preparation in accordance with the 
approved standards.  It is recommended that personnel training should include the rules 
drawn up by the United Nations on the use of firearms and the protection of human rights, 
such as the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the 
Use of Force by Law Enforcement Officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) It should check the reliability of private security company directors, 
shareholders and executives, as well as all their personnel, to ensure that they have not 
previously been implicated in human rights violations, and investigate whether there are 
any conflicts of interest between the posts held by certain members or former members of 
the military or police and their involvement in private security companies; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/42/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b> (f) It should set up an authority over the Ministry of Security, either a 
parliamentary committee or a commissioner, which would have the power to monitor the 
activities of private security companies and which could receive complaints; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) It should prohibit the export of private military or security services to other 
countries and, where such export does occur, regulate such services by law through the 
granting of licences and control mechanisms, as recommended by the Working Group in 
its report to the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-first session (A/61/341, 
para. 98).
