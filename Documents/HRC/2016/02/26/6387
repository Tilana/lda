</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, and resolution 62/127 of

<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the most recent of which is resolution 2005/65 of 25 April 2005, as well as those of 
</p>
<p>the Commission for Social Development of the Economic and Social Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and 
</p>
<p>interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that disability is an evolving concept and that disability results 
</p>
<p>from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and 
</p>
<p>environmental barriers that hinder their full and effective participation in society on 
</p>
<p>an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also </i>the importance of accessibility to the physical, social, 
</p>
<p>economic and cultural environment, to health, education, information and 
</p>
<p>communication, in enabling persons with disabilities to enjoy all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms fully,

<p> <i>Recognizing further</i> the importance of international cooperation for improving 
</p>
<p>the living conditions of persons with disabilities in every country, particularly in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, </p>

<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that women and girls with disabilities are often subject to 
</p>
<p>multiple discrimination, and emphasizing the need to incorporate a gender perspective 
</p>
<p>in all efforts to promote the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>by persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal 
</p>

</p>
<p>disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity, and in this regard, calls 
</p>
<p>upon Governments to take active measures: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  To prevent and prohibit all forms of discrimination against persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To ensure, for persons with disabilities, full and effective participation 
</p>
<p>and inclusion, respect for their individual autonomy, including the freedom to make 
</p>
<p>one&#8217;s own choices; independence; and equality of opportunity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption by the General Assembly on 13 December 
</p>

</p>
<p>Protocol, and expresses the hope that they will enter into force at an early date; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the fact that, since the opening for signature of the 
</p>
<p>Convention and Optional Protocol on 30 March 2007, 126 States have signed and 17

</p>
<p>Optional Protocol, and calls upon those States and regional integration organizations 
</p>
<p>that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying the Convention and the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further welcomes</i> the attention that several special rapporteurs have 
</p>
<p>paid to the rights of persons with disabilities in carrying out their mandates, and

</p>
<p>full and equal enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, and other 
</p>

</p>
<p>the inclusion of persons with disabilities in the work of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> all stakeholders to give consideration to the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities at all stages of the universal periodic review, including during the

</p>
<p> 14. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner to 
</p>
