CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Dear Shareholder
It was a good year to be an Australian gold miner and a great year to be a Northern Star 
Shareholder.
The  combination  of  the  higher  US-dollar  gold  price  and  lower  Australian  dollar  provided 
our industry with the ideal environment to deliver strong returns for Shareholders.
With this wind in our back, the onus was on us as a company to maximise the opportunity 
by continuing to drive down costs and to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth 
by investing in exploration and development.
I believe our team seized the day in every respect, delivering a 65% increase in net profit to 
a record A$151.4 million for the year to 30 June 2016.
All-in sustaining costs continued to fall, averaging A$1,041/oz, helping to fuel a 21% rise in underlying free cash 
flow to a record A$224.3 million.
The  strong  performance  culminated  in  your  Company  finishing  the  year  with  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of 
A$326 million, up from A$178 million a year earlier. And we have no bank debt.
As a result, we increased the full-year dividend from 5¢ to 7¢, fully-franked.
At the time of writing, your Company had just announced the sale of its Plutonic gold mine. While it may sound 
odd to say that an asset sale can be a milestone in a growth strategy, the reality is that the transaction heralds 
the next chapter in a plan based on organic growth and maximising financial returns.
As  well  as  ensuring  we  can  maintain  downward  pressure  on  our  costs,  the  sale  enables  us  to  focus  our 
resources on four key operational centres: Kalgoorlie, Jundee, Paulsens and Tanami.
Each  of  these  centres  has  significant  production  and  exploration  scale.  This  reflects  a  key  theme  being 
pursued by both global investors and overseas gold mining majors and is consistent with Northern Star’s strong 
belief  that  centres  of  such  magnitude  will  be  increasingly  valuable  as  global  gold  exploration  struggles  to 
replace the world-class orebodies as they are mined out.
This  strategy  also  stems  in  part  from  the  significant  exploration  success  Northern  Star  has  enjoyed  at  each  of 
these  centres  over  the  past  two  years.  As  our  results  show,  we  have  numerous  outstanding  opportunities  to 
continue increasing our gold inventory, enabling us to generate organic growth at just a fraction of the prices 
being paid to acquire Resources and Reserves in the current environment.
The  benefits  of  this  approach  were  highlighted  by  our  recent  33%  increase in Reserves  to  2.0  million  ounces. 
Importantly,  these  Reserves  were  added  at  a  cost  of  just  A$50/oz,  equal  to  about  10%  of  current  market 
acquisition prices.
This exploration success puts us firmly on track to achieve our goal of increasing production to an annual rate 
of 600,000oz by 2018.
However,  as  impressive  as  this  growth  is,  it  still  represents  only  a  means  to  an  end.  That  end  is  financial  and 
Shareholder returns. Northern Star is proud of its record of delivering some of the highest financial returns of any 
ASX-listed  company,  including  those  in  the  industrial  sector,  and  our  approach  to  growth  will  always  be 
dictated by such measures, not by tonnes and ounces.
Your  Board  believes  that  it  is  particularly important  to  remember  this  adage  at  times  such  as  those  currently 
being  witnessed  in  the  gold  sector.  Shareholder  wealth  has  a  habit  of  being  damaged  when  markets  are 
thriving and therefore financial discipline is even more imperative in such a climate.
The past year has seen your Company capitalise on its opportunities and create a platform for further growth 
while not exposing Shareholders unnecessarily to the inevitable volatility which comes with being a resources 
company.
The  credit  for  this  success  goes  to  our  outstanding  management  team,  employees,  service  providers  and 
suppliers.  Their  vision,  commitment  and  willingness  to  run  their  own  race  has,  with  the  support  of  the  Board, 
enabled Northern Star to deliver superior results on all fronts. I thank them for their enormous efforts.
I  would  also  like  to  thank  our  Shareholders  for  the  strong  support  you  have  given  the  Company  as  we 
implement our strategies for growth.
Yours sincerely
CHRIS ROWE 
Chairman

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Northern Star Resources Limited (Northern Star) is an  ASX  100 
gold  (Au)  production  and  exploration  company  with  a 
Mineral  Resource  base  of  9.25 million  ounces  and  Ore 
Reserves  of  2.0 million  ounces (1), 
in  highly 
prospective  regions  of  Western  Australia  and  the  Northern 
Territory.
located
As  the  third  largest  Australian  gold  producer,  Northern  Star 
continues to deliver on its growth strategy objective of being 
a significant gold company delivering outstanding value to its 
Shareholders.   During  FY2016,  the  Company  sold  561,153 
ounces  of  gold  from  its  five  West  Australian  operating 
business units being the Jundee, Kundana (2), Kanowna Belle, 
Paulsens and Plutonic Mines.
The Company continues to advance activities at the Central 
Tanami Project in the Northern Territory.
In  parallel,  the  Company  has  had  significant  exploration 
success during the previous year through the diligent work of 
our  Exploration  Team  and  targeted  expenditure  of  A$50 
million  which  has  extended  mine  lives  and  has  enabled  the 
Company  to  progress  the  creation  of  an  exciting  organic 
pipeline  of  future  projects  for  the  business.    In  FY2017,  the 
Company  will  invest  A$60  million  in  exploration  to  generate 
the  mines  of  the  future,  grow  production  and  follow  up  the 
significant success achieved in FY2016.
OUR PEOPLE, HEALTH AND SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITY
Participants at the 2016 Leadership Forum
Our People and Our Culture
Over  the  last  financial  year,  the  Company  continued  to  consolidate  its  operations,  and  embarked  on  an  organic 
growth strategy. As the Company strengthens and evolves, its reliance on its people grows.
Northern  Star  conducts  an  offsite  Leadership  Forum  each  year  involving  the  Board,  Executive,  key  Site  Leadership 
and Technical personnel. This forum provides an opportunity to build relationships across the Group, and to generate 
ideas and input into the future direction of the business.
The  Company  believes  that  its  future  leaders  will  be  developed  from  within  its  diverse  workforce  and  that  they  will 
benefit  from  an  inclusive  and  entrepreneurial  environment.  The  Company  seeks  to  provide  challenging  career 
development opportunities and, as a result of the development and growth of the business, the Company is pleased 
that it has been able to provide substantial internal career advancement opportunities to its employees during the 
previous year.
Northern  Star  remains  a significant  and  proud  employer with  a workforce  of  ~1,600  people,  comprising  ~900  direct 
employees and ~700 contractors across the business.
Management  is  committed  to  operating  the  business  at  all  levels  based  on  its  core  values  of:  Safety,  Teamwork, 
Accountability,  Respect  and  Results  (STARR),  and  encourages  its  employees  and  contractors  to  challenge 
behaviours that are inconsistent with these values.  Adherence to the STARR Core Values is non-negotiable, as they 
remain the foundation for driving the culture within the Northern Star Family, and are the platform for employees and 
contractors alike to contribute to achieving Northern Star’s vision.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Northern  Star  values  diversity  in  its  workforce,  and  is  an 
equal  opportunity  employer,  based  on  the  best  person 
for the position at the time of recruitment. During FY2016, 
the  Company  implemented  a  new  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity  Policy  which  aligns  with  its  management 
philosophy  and  Code  of  Conduct,  and  affirms  the 
Company’s commitment to equality across its business.
female  participation
Northern  Star’s  overall 
rate 
increased to 14.11% (2015: 13.23%), with females in senior 
positions  accounting  for  2.6%  (2015:  2.01%)  of  the  total 
workforce.  Management  are  committed  to 
further 
improving female participation rates across the Group in 
line with our recruitment practices. The Company’s 2015-
16  Workplace  Gender  Equality  Report  is  located  on  our 
website at http://www.nsrltd.com/about/corporate-governance/.

Northern Star recognises its responsibility to ensure Aboriginal peoples and most importantly the Traditional Owners on 
the  lands  which  we  operate  on  are  meaningfully  engaged  through  employment  and  enterprise  development 
opportunities across the Company’s operational footprint. Similarly, it understands Aboriginal people and their place-
based affinity with their traditional country offers the organisation a unique and valued resource of local employees. 
Northern Star is proud to support Aboriginal Ranger Programs at three of its operations which engages local people 
to perform environmental services on a flexible basis (see the Social Responsibility Section for further details).
The Company continues to support the professionals of the future by committing 
to employ new graduates each year from a variety of disciplines relevant to the 
mining  industry.  In  addition,  the  Company  also  provides  opportunities  for 
university students to engage in meaning summer vacation work to prepare them 
for  a  future  in  the  industry.    Last  year’s  intake  saw  Northern  Star  employ  19  new 
graduates  and  17  vacation  students.    The  Company  was  also  pleased  to  offer 
four  new  apprenticeships  during  the  last  year,  which  included  two  mature  age 
trade apprenticeships to existing employees.
People  remain  our  greatest  strength  and  the  Company  continues  to  create 
opportunities  where  employees  can  build  outstanding  careers  in  a  vibrant  and 
ever-changing  industry.  The  Company  encourages  innovative  thought  and 
entrepreneurial  spirit  in  its  employees,  however  Northern  Star  will  not  tolerate 
unnecessary  risk  taking  by  employees  or  service  providers  which  jeopardises  the 
safety of its workforce, the environment or its reputation in the Community.

The Board acknowledges the ongoing dedication and hard work of its employees, service providers and suppliers, as 
it continues to grow the business.
Health and Safety
Northern  Star  values  the  health  and  safety  of  its  employees,  contractors  and 
stakeholders within our community. We have an embedded Company focus for hazard 
identification  and  risk  reduction,  and  promoting  positive  safety  behaviours  within  the 
Company.  Importantly, we monitor leading safety indicators to target injury prevention 
and awareness through our Five STARR safety program on a day-to-day basis to further 
improve safety culture in the workplace.
Standardisation of key safety functions and processes has continued to remain the core 
focus of the Company. Building a strong and robust safety management framework has 
allowed  further  enhancement  of  areas  such  as  leadership,  risk  management,  training 
and governance.
In  November  2015,  a  team  member  at  the  Paulsens  gold  mine  sadly  passed  away.  The  Board,  management  and 
staff offer our deepest sympathy and condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.  A full investigation is being 
conducted by the relevant authorities following this sad event.
As at 30 June 2016, Northern Star’s Lost Time Injury frequency rate (LTIFR) was 5.1 (2015: 2.1) and its Total Recordable 
Injury  frequency  rate  (TRIFR)  was  20.4  (2015:  13.0).  The  Company  will  continue  to  demand  improvement  in  safety 
performance and foster a culture that strives for zero harm outcomes.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Environment
Northern Star is committed to high standards in environmental management and performance.
Through the implementation of a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS) and the dedication of its 
workforce,  Northern  Star  commits  to  mitigating  and  minimising  environmental  impacts  associated  with  its  business 
activities.  Northern  Star  acknowledges  that  there  is  more  to  simply  being  given  a  legal  right  to  mine,  and  that 
respecting the environmental values held by people outside of the organisation is an integral part of doing business.
The Northern Star’s revised EMS contains company-wide standards for:
  Mine Closure




Environmental Incident Reporting
Energy and Climate Change
Biodiversity Management
Environmental Risk Management
Northern Star had no material adverse environmental incidents in FY2016.

Beyond  the  framework  of  the  EMS,  Northern  Star  has  committed  to  a  range  of  innovative  strategies  for  continually 
advancing our environmental performance. The following examples indicate the Company’s commitment:



Rangers  Programs:  the  Company  has  expanded  the  contracting  of  Traditional  Owners  for  environmental 
services  across  three  operations.  This  sees  environmental  services  being  conducted  by  local  Ranger  Groups 
who have a cultural affinity and obligation with the lands on which we operate. 
Heat  Exchange  Technology: the  Company  has  entered into  a Power  Purchasing  Agreement with  Enerji Ltd  to 
progress  heat  exchange  technology  for  power  generation  at  the  Jundee  mine.  Enerji’s  cutting  edge  heat  to 
power generation technology captures waste heat and converts it into useable power. When the 1.5MW heat-
to-power plant is installed at the Jundee mine, it will reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. 
Seed  Germination  Improvement  Project:  the  Company  is  also  partnering  horticultural  company  Bentonite 
Products WA in investigations to improve native seed germination rates through the use of bentonite clay in the 
seeding process. If successful, this study has the potential to improve seed strike rates and ultimately make the 
overall mine rehabilitation process both more economical and effective.
Social Responsibility
In  FY2016,  Northern  Star  continued  to  create  both 
respectful  and 
relationships  with  all 
Stakeholders touched by our business activities.

Northern  Star  operate  on  the  belief  that  as  an 
organisation,  its  activities  must  be  guided  by  a

of its activities by the communities in which it operates

and  the  creation  of  a  strong  Social  License  to

utilises local suppliers where possible and participates 
in  community  initiatives  and  activities.  Each  year, 
Northern  Star  and  its  employees  join  with  the  local 
community  to  celebrate  the  Saint  Barbara’s  Festival

long  been  revered  as  the  patron  saint  of  miners.  The 
Festival  is  steeped  in  tradition  and  it  recognises  the 
ongoing  socio-economic  contributions  the  mining 
sector makes to the region, and honours the past and 
present men and women of the mining industry.
Northern  Star  also  believes  that  it  is  important  to 
participate  in  community  initiatives  that  are  not 
directly related to our business. The Company and its 
employees are pleased to participate in and support

a  social  return  on  investment  analysis,  run  by  Social 
Ventures  Australia,  and  commissioned  by 
the

finding of this study was that for every dollar spent on 
Aboriginal  Rangers  Programs,  $2.30  of  subsequent 
value is created.
At  the  Jundee  operation,  support  continued  for  the

the Wiluna Remote Community School. At the end of 
each term, students who maintained an 80% or higher 
attendance rate are invited out to the Jundee Village 
for  a  special  dinner  and  award  ceremony.  While 
simple in strategy, feedback from the School confirms 
that this initiative does play a positive role in improving 
attendance rates.

Performance  for  the  2016  financial  year  has  been  generated  from  the  Jundee,  Kundana,  Kanowna Belle,  Paulsens 
and Plutonic gold mines. In the 2016 financial year, a total of 561,153 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of 
A$1,578 (2015: A$1,453). All-in sustaining cost for the period was A$1,041 per ounce (2015: A$1,065).
During  the  period,  3.9  million  tonnes  were  milled  at  an  average  head  grade  of  5.0gpt  Au  for  558,143  ounces  Au 
recovered.  Unprocessed  ore  stocks  available  for  mill  feed  at  the  end  of  the  period  contained  80,342  ounces  Au. 
Gold in circuit at the end of the period totalled 15,136 ounces. These items are reflected in the accounts as gold in 
circuit at cost.
Jundee operation saw a number of achievements during 
the  year  with  delivery  of  strong  gold  production, 
extension  of  mine  life  through  Reserve  growth  and 
improvement in operating cost base though productivity 
and  procurement  initiatives.  The  development  of  a 
strategic  diamond  drilling  drill  drive  was  completed 
during the year to  set a platform  for drilling rigs to  target 
the  mine  extensions  on  multiple  mineralised  zones. 
Investment  continued  in  capital  development  to  open 
up new mining fronts and setup future mine infrastructure.
The  Kundana  mines  continued  to  grow  production 
through  the  exploration  and  development  of  Hornet, 
Rubicon,  Pegasus  and  Raleigh  zones.  This  high  grade 
mineralised  system  has  demonstrated  signs  of  linking  at 
depth and has provided solid opportunity to extend mine 
life.  Significant  investment  in  exploration  drilling  has  now 
turned  towards  mining  development  and  production 
setup to grow mine output.
On  the  100%  Northern  Star  tenements,  the  Millennium 
discovery  was  rapidly  advanced  during  the  period  with 
Resource  drilling  and  dewatering  of  South  pit  occurring 
for  mining  to  commence.  This  new  development  is  also 
positioned  well 
to  access  historic  operations  of 
Centenary,  Pope  John,  Barkers  and  Strzelecki  mines 
creating a future production centre for the Company.
The  Kanowna  Belle  operation  had  strong  success  in 
lowering  the  operational  cost  base  whilst  maintaining 
productivity  during  the  year  with  the  mining  activity 
throughout historic mining areas as well as accessing the 
newly  discovered  Velvet  zone.  The  mine  plan  was 
extended  through  in-mine exploration leveraging  off  the 
extensive infrastructure in the underground. The Kanowna
facility
increased
the 
processing 
contribution of Kanowna and Kundana ore grew, with a 
record  monthly  throughput  achieved  in  May  2016  at 
levels not seen since 2004.
throughput  as
The  Paulsens  operation  continued  to  transition  activity 
from  the  Voyager  1  zone  to  Voyager  2  zone  with  a 
resultant  lift  in  head  grade  from  the  mine  as  the  high 
grade  upper  zone  was  accessed.  Capital  upgrades  to 
the ventilation system were completed which has set the 
mine for future years of production as well as power and 
surface  infrastructure  improvement.  The  mine  continued 
to  build  a  stockpile  in  addition  to  what  was  processed 
during the year that enables a future production source.
Plutonic  transitioned  its  underground  mining  centre  into 
the  Caribbean  zone  as  a  primary  ore  source.  The 
extensive underground workings enabled continued yield 
from multiple production fronts, low grade stockpiles also 
supplemented  the  year’s  production  in  the  second  half 
of  the  period  to  fully  utilise  the  processing  facilities. 
Resource  drilling  of  the  Hermes  project  continued  with 
success  and  the 
finalisation  of  mining  plans  were 
performed during the year.
The  Central  Tanami  Project  settlement  occurred  at  the 
start  of  the  year  with  Northern  Star  acquiring  a  25% 
interest,  and  the  ability  to  expand  to  60%  through 
redevelopment  of  the  Project’s  processing  facility.  The 
focus  during  the  year  was  Resource  definition  drilling  of 
the  Groundrush  deposit  and  evaluation  of  refurbishment 
of the processing facilities. The Tanami region is integral to 
the Company’s organic growth strategy to create a new 
concentrated centre of production in future years.

[a] Key highlights presented in the table above are inclusive of Plutonic operations results for the year ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015.
(1) EBITDA is earnings before interest depreciation, amortisation and impairment and is calculated as follows: Profit before Income tax plus depreciation, amortisation, impairment and 
finance costs.
(2) Net Profit is calculated as net profit after taxation.
(3) Free Cash Flow is calculated as operating cash flow minus investing cash flow.
(4) Underlying Free Cash Flow is calculated as follows: 30 June 2016 - free cash flow ($193.6 million) plus bullion awaiting settlement ($1.9 million), plus acquisition and development of 
Central  Tanami  Project  ($22.8  million),  plus  stamp  duty  paid  on  prior  acquisitions  ($4.9  million),  less  working  capital  adjustment  ($1.0  million).  30  June  2015  - free  cash  flow  ($119.6 
million)  plus  Jundee  gold  mine  acquisition  ($90.7  million)  and  Hermes  acquisitions  ($1.95  million),  plus  one  off  acquisition  and  restructure  expenses  ($12.8  million  and  $4.2  million 
respectively), less working capital adjustment ($43.6 million).
EBITDA, Underlying Free Cash Flow and All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) are unaudited non IFRS measures
The  Group’s  operating  and  financial  performance  for  the  twelve  months  ended  30  June  2016  reflects  the  focus  on 
productivity and cost reduction whilst maintaining growth options through exploration. Increased free cash flow generation 
in  the 2016 financial year follows operational efficiencies, a focus on  cost reduction  across all sites and an increase in  the 
gold price realised per ounce.
Profit
The profit overview commentary includes  results  from  both  continuing  and  discontinuing  operations.  For  the  financial  year 
ended  30  June  2016  the  Group  reported  a  profit  after  tax  of  $151.4  million  (2015:  $91.9  million).  Revenue  increased  5%  to 
$887.4 million, the principle driver being the higher gold price per ounce realised (2016: $1,578; 2015: $1,453). Gold sold for 
the current year was at the higher end of full year guidance at 561,153 ounces (guidance FY2016 535,000-570,000 ounces) 
and AISC of $1,041 per ounce sold was below full year guidance ($1,050-$1,100 per ounce sold).
EBITDA  was  $401.3  million  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  which  was  an  increase  of  27%  over  the  corresponding  prior 
period.  The  Group  reduced  overall  finance  charges  by  51%  (2016:  $4.5  million;  2015:  $9.1  million)  consistent  with  the 
refinancing  and  nil  debt  position  of  the  Group.  An  impairment  charge  of  $5.1m  million  was  recorded  on  exploration  and 
evaluation assets (2015: $8.5 million).
Balance Sheet
Current assets as at the 30 June 2016 increased by 29% against the prior year balance date. The increase was largely a result 
of cash and cash equivalents increasing by $147.9 million and the classification of the Plutonic operations as held for sale.
Non-current  assets  decreased  by  $7.2 million  principally due  to  the  re-classification  of  the Plutonic  operations  as a  current 
asset  held  for  sale, which  offsets  the increased  spend  on  non-sustaining  capital (2016:  $35.2 million;  2015:  $9.3 million)  and 
exploration and evaluation during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2016: $61.5 million; 2015: 35.6 million).
Trade and other payables and provisions decreased as at 30 June 2016 principally due to the classification of the Plutonic 
operations as held for sale. Current tax liabilities increased to $35 million consistent with the increased earnings profile of the 
Group.
The increase in Issued capital was predominately due to the shares issued as part of the Central Tanami acquisition.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Cash Flow
Cash flow from operating activities for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016 were $383.3 million which was $24.3 million higher 
than  the  previous  financial  year  due  to  the  higher  realised  gold  price  per  ounce  (2016:  $1,578;  2015:  $1,453)  offset  by 
reductions in production and income taxes paid.
Cash flows for investing activities increased by 20% after allowance for the acquisitions in the current and prior period (2016: 
Tanami $11.0 million; 2015: Jundee $90.7 million). This was largely as a result of the Group’s extensive capital development 
and exploration program.
Cash flows from financing activities included payments for leased equipment of $9.7 million (2015: 8.0 million) and dividends 
totalling $36.0 million (2015: 26.5 million) paid to Shareholders.

EXPLORATION
Paulsens Mine
The  Paulsens  Mine  continued  to  drill  the  Voyager  2  and 
Titan  extensions  down-plunge  to  maintain  resources  in 
future production areas. Lateral extension and exploration 
also  targeted  the  Galileo  and  Southern  Gabbro  vein 
mineralisation systems.
Plutonic Mine
Plutonic  Mine  drilling  focused  predominantly  on  grade 
control and Resource drilling. Exploration work undertaken 
during  the  year  developed  extensions  to  the  existing 
Mineral  Resource  base  in  the  Caribbean,  Timor,  Indian, 
Caspian and Baltic areas of the Mine.
Kalgoorlie Operations
The  Kundana  and  Kanowna  Belle  Operations  continued 
large  near-mine  exploration  programs  that  delivered 
strong  growth  to  the  existing  Mineral  Resource  domains 
and  generated  several  new  discoveries  with  an  increase 
of  0.5  million  ounces  in  Resources  after  depletion.  At 
Kanowna  Belle  Operations,  rapid  exploration  of  the  new 
Velvet discovery continued with production development 
reaching the deposit at the end of the year.
Near-mine exploration within the EKJV area (Northern Star 
51%) in the Kundana region was successful in maintaining 
the total Resource inventory for Pegasus, Rubicon, Hornet 
and Raleigh Deposits.
Exploration  within 
the  Northern  Star’s  100%  owned 
Kundana  tenements  was  exceptionally  successful  with  a 
further  increase  to  the  Millennium  Deposit  and  maiden 
Resource  announced  for  the  Barkers  Deposit  (137,000 
ounces)  with  further  drilling  planned  for  all  areas  in  the 
coming year.
Jundee Operations
Jundee  Operations  continued 
infill  and  Resource 
extension  drilling  within  the  mine  with  increases  in  the 
Gateway  area  more  than  offsetting  depletion  thus 
growing  existing  Mineral  Resource  and  Ore  Reserve 
boundaries. Exploration drilling commenced from the new 
drill drive platform during the year resulting in two exciting 
new  discoveries,  being  the  Revelation  and  Armada 
trends,  which  are  not  included  in  the  Mineral  Resource 
statement at this time.
Pilbara Regional
Paulsens Regional
Hermes Project
Further  infill  and  extensional  drilling  at  the  Hermes  Project 
resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  Mineral  Resources  to 
314,000  ounces  and  the  definition  of  a  maiden  open  pit 
Ore  Reserve  of  101,000  ounces  as  at  30  June  2016.  The 
Project  has  moved  into  production  planning  with  site 
development to be commenced shortly.

the 
generation  of  significant  new  drilling  targets.  Following 
heritage  clearance  activities,  initial  drilling  on  these  new 
targets  has  commenced.  Further  drilling  completed  on 
open  pit  targets  in  the  Gourdis-Vause  area  has  identified 
extensions to existing Resource areas with further follow up 
drilling planned.
Kalgoorlie Region
Kanowna Belle
Further drilling increased the open pit Resources for the Six 
Mile Project.
Kundana EKJV (51% NST)
Surface  drilling  at  the  Pegasus,  Drake  and  Falcon 
prospects  continued  to  define  new  zones  of  gold 
mineralisation parallel to the main structures. Underground 
exploration  drilling/development  at  Raleigh  South  was 
highly  successful  in  identifying  potential  extensions  to  the 
Raleigh  deposit  opening  up  a significant new exploration 
target.
Carbine
Ongoing  drilling  at  Paradigm  has  intersected  significant 
high  grade  mineralised  zones  with  further  extensional 
drilling planned in this area.
Central Tanami (25% NST)
An  extensive 
infill  and  extensional  drilling  program 
completed at the Groundrush Deposit achieved excellent 
results  extending  the  main  ore  system  and  discovering 
new  mineralisation  within  the  hanging  wall  sequence. 
Development studies for the area are in progress.
Exploration  drilling  targeting  extensions  to  the  Paulsens 
Mine  sequence  has  been  completed.  Surface  sampling 
programs continued on regional targets across the Wyloo 
Dome area.
Fortescue JV and Northern Star’s Regional Exploration
Gold exploration programs continued on the Fortescue JV 
and 100% Northern Star tenements in the Ashburton Basin 
with  regional  geochemical  sampling  programs  and  initial 
exploration  programs  at  the  Soldiers  Secret  and  Charlie’s 
Creek prospects completed.
Plutonic Region
Exploration  drilling  at  the  Trout,  Cod,  MMR  and  Zone  114 
and  Plutonic  West  prospect  areas  were  completed. 
Target  generation  programs  in  the  Timor  and  Zone  114 
areas were completed to assist with drill targeting.

B. Remuneration Governance
Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group’s remuneration structures are aligned with the long-term interests of the 
Company  and its  Shareholders.  Accordingly,  the  Board  has  an  established  Remuneration  Committee  to  assist it in  making 
decisions in relation to KMP remuneration.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises all Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the Board:

the Company’s remuneration policy and framework (including determining short term incentives (STIs) key performance 
indicators and long term incentives (LTIs) performance hurdles, and vesting of STIs/LTIs); 
senior executives’ remuneration and incentives (including KMP and other senior management);
 
  Non-Executive Director individual remuneration, and the aggregate pool for approval by Shareholders (as required);
2016 Annual Financial Report
Page 17
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 

superannuation arrangements; and 
remuneration by gender.
Executive  remuneration  is  reviewed  annually  having  regard  to  individual  and  business  performance,  relevant  industry 
comparative information, current market conditions, and internal and independent external information.
In  order  to  ensure  that  this  Committee  is  fully  informed  when  making  remuneration  recommendations,  the  Committee 
receives reports from management, independent sources, empirical market data and may draw on services from a range 
of other external sources if required.
Use of Remuneration Consultants
The  Remuneration  Committee  consulted  with  external  sources  during  the  period  to  obtain  information  in  relation  to 
reviewing the Executive and Non-Executive remuneration and mix of remuneration.
During  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  no  remuneration  recommendations,  as  defined  by  the  Corporations  Act,  were 
provided by remuneration consultants.
C. Remuneration Policy and Link to Performance
Remuneration Philosophy
The  performance  of  the  Company  depends upon  the quality  of its  Directors  and  Executives. To  succeed  and endure,  the 
Company must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled Directors and Executives.
To this end, the Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
  provides for competitive rewards to attract and retain high calibre Executives; 
  aligns  the  incentives  of  Executives  with  the  long-term  interests  of  Company  Shareholders  by  linking  rewards  to
Shareholder value; and
  establishes appropriate key performance indicators and hurdles in relation to variable Executive remuneration.
In  accordance  with  good  corporate  governance  practices,  the  structure  of  Non-Executive  Director  and  Executive 
management remuneration is separate and distinct.
Non-Executive Director Remuneration
The  Board’s  objective is  to  set aggregate  remuneration  at  a level which  provides  the  Company with  the  ability  to  attract 
and retain Directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to Shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are paid within an aggregate remuneration limit which is approved by the Shareholders from 
time to time (currently $1,250,000 per annum - approved 12 November 2014). Retirement payments, if any, are agreed to be 
determined  in  accordance  with  the  rules  set  out  in  the  Corporations  Act  as  at  the  time  of  a  Director’s  retirement  or 
termination.
The  Board  reviews  on  an  annual  basis  the  manner  in  which  it  apportions  the  aggregate  remuneration  amongst  Non-
Executive Directors at its discretion, and the amount of  aggregate remuneration sought to  be approved  by  Shareholders. 
When undertaking the annual review process, the Board considers the amount of Non-Executive Director fees being paid by 
comparable  companies  within  the  S&P  ASX200  with  similar  market  capitalisation  (and  now  the  S&P  ASX100),  plus 
responsibilities and experience of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has not increased its current individual Non-Executive Directors’ Fees since 1 July 2015, with the exception of the 
introduction of a Chair Fee for the Remuneration Committee. Refer to Section G. All fees payable to Non-Executive Directors 
remain within the approved aggregate remuneration limit of $1,250,000 per annum.
Executive Director and Senior Executive Remuneration
The  Board’s  objective  is  to  reward  Executives  with  a  level  and  mix  of  remuneration  commensurate with  their  position  and 
responsibilities within the Company and so as to:
  motivate and reward Executives for Company and individual performance; 
  ensure continued availability of experienced and effective management; and 
  ensure total remuneration is competitive by market standards.
In  reviewing  the  level  and  make-up  of  Executive  total  remuneration,  the  Remuneration  Committee  ensures  remuneration 
reflects  the  market  salary  for  a  position  and  individual  of  comparable  responsibility  and  experience.  Remuneration  is 
compared  with  the  external  market  by  reviewing  industry  salary  surveys,  sourcing  empirical  market  data  and  other 
evaluation methods during the recruitment process. Target positioning of total remuneration against market is between the 
50th  and  75th  percentile.  If  required,  the  Remuneration  Committee  may  engage  an  external  consultant  to  provide 
independent advice in the form of a written report detailing market levels of remuneration for comparable Executive roles.
Total remuneration for the 2016 financial year consisted of a mix of:
fixed remuneration; and
 
  “at risk” variable remuneration, comprising STIs and LTIs.

During  the  period,  2,810,953  Performance  Shares  were  issued  as  FY2016  LTIs  to  five  KMP  Executives  and  eight  senior 
management personnel in accordance with the Performance Share Plan approved by Shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in November 2013. This Plan provides the Board with the discretion to grant Performance Shares on an annual basis 
to  certain  Executives  and  senior  management  that  will  vest  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  performance  hurdles,  as 
determined by the Board. Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2013 Annual General Meeting to issue LTIs in the form 
of Performance Shares to  the Managing Director without seeking further Shareholder approval to a maximum of 3,000,000 
shares.  In  relation  to  the  FY2016  period,  597,836  Performance  Shares  were  issued  to  the  Managing  Director  under  that 
approval.
The  LTI  arrangements  have  been  designed  to  motivate  and  incentivise  Executives  to  drive  the  Company’s  long  term 
performance to deliver greater returns to Shareholders. The hurdles defined for the 2016 issue will be measured at the end of 
year  three  (30  June  2018)  against  (1)  a  Relative  Total  Shareholder  Return  against  a  group  of  peers,  (2)  Total  Shareholder 
Return  targeting  compound  annual  growth  of  15%,  and  (3)  Resource/Reserve  replacement  for  the  Group.  In  order  to 
achieve  vesting  of  LTIs,  the  set  hurdles  must  be  achieved  as  at  30  June  2018,  along  with  continued  employment  and 
satisfactory performance reviews in all years.
The Performance Share Plan also provides an appropriate framework to incentivise other key Company employees who are 
not  at  the  Executive  level  as  may  be  determined  from  time  to  time.  In  addition,  the  Company  may  also  issue  unlisted 
employee share options to incentivise other key Company employees. For the sake of simplicity, the comments here focus 
on  incentivising  of  Executives,  but  the  framework  will  apply  in  the  same  manner  for  select  non-Executives,  with  differing 
percentage allocation levels.
Accordingly, under the Performance Share Plan, KMP Executives were granted Performance Shares (outlined  below), with 
vesting of any Performance Shares subject to the satisfaction of performance hurdles.
Each Performance Share represents an  actual legal interest in  a share in  the Company on day one of the vesting  period, 
with the Performance Share being forfeited for no consideration should the vesting condition not be met. Under the terms of 
the  Performance  Share  Plan,  the  Performance  Shares  are  issued  to  the  Executive  at  their  current  market  value,  with  the 
Executive  required  to  pay  this  market  value  amount  in  order  to  take  up  the  Performance  Share  offer.  The  Company  will 
provide  the  Executive  with  a  loan  to  fund  the  acquisition  price.  The  loan  is  interest-free  and  is  secured  against  the 
Performance  Shares  in  the  form  of  a  holding  lock  preventing  all  dealing  in  the  Performance  Shares.  The  loan  is  limited 
recourse, such that if the Performance Shares are forfeited, this is treated as full repayment against the loan balance. While 
a loan balance remains outstanding, any dividends paid on the Performance Shares will be automatically applied towards 
the repayment of the loan.
In  making  the  loan  in  respect  of  newly  issued  Performance  Shares,  there  is  no  cash  cost  to  the  Company,  as  the 
Performance  Shares  are  newly  issued,  with  the  loan  essentially  being  an  obligation  to  repay  the  amount  due  when  the 
Performance Shares are sold or forfeited. This also means that no funds are raised upon the issue of the Performance Shares.
In substance, the Performance Share Plan operates in the same way as an option plan, therefore provided the size of the LTI 
award is reasonable and there are appropriate vesting conditions, it should be viewed in the same light as an option plan. 
The following Performance Shares were issued to KMP Executives in relation to the 2016 financial year:

(i) Terms and Conditions of the Share-based Payment Arrangements

The terms and conditions of each grant of options affecting KMP remuneration in the current or a future report period are as

Value Per Option at
Options granted under the plan carry no dividend or voting rights.
The assessed  fair value at grant date of  options  granted  to  the individuals is allocated equally  over the period from  grant 
date  to  vesting  date,  and  the  amount  is  included  in  the  remuneration  tables  above.  Fair  values  at  grant  date  are 
independently determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term 
of  the  option,  the  impact  of  dilution,  the  share  price  at  grant  date,  expected  price  volatility  of  the  underlying  share,  the 
expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option.

The  above  conversion  did  not  result  in  the  Company  receiving  any  funds  as  the  options  were  converted  through  the 
Company’s  Employee  Option  Plan's  cashless  conversion  mechanism  which  results  in  a  reduced  amount  of  shares  being 
issued. No amounts are unpaid on any shares issued through the exercise of options.

The loans are limited recourse and are secured against the performance shares held by the relevant participants.
The Board may, at its discretion, agree to forgive a loan made to a participant. The fair value at grant date is independently 
determined  using  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  model  (market  based  vesting  conditions)  and  a  Black  Scholes  Model  (non-
market  vesting  conditions)  that  takes  into  account  the  exercise  price,  the  term  of  the  performance  share,  the  impact  of 
dilution (where material), the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected 
dividend yield, the risk free rate for the term of the performance share and the correlations and volatilities of the peer group 
companies.
The model inputs for performances shares granted during the year ended 30 June 2016 are noted below:
Model Inputs 
(a) Exercise price 
(b) Grant date 
(c) Expiry date 
(d) Share price at grant date 
(e) Expected volatility of the company’s shares 
(f) Expected dividend yield 
(g) Risk-free interest rate

The  expected  price  volatility  is  based  on  the  historic  volatility  (based  on  the  remaining  life  of  the  performance  share) 
adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The value of the instruments granted have been expensed on a proportionate basis for each financial year from grant date 
to vesting date. The proportion of the value of the instrument, which were expensed and accounted for in the share option 
reserve was for the year ended 30 June 2016 was $1,521,253 (2015: $896,587).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
a)  Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
(i)  Determination of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves
The  Group  reports  its  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  in  accordance with  the  Joint  Ore  Reserves  Committee  (JORC) 
Australasian  Code  for  Reporting  of  Exploration  Results,  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  -  the  JORC  Code.  The 
information on Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is prepared by Competent Persons as defined by the JORC Code.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Assumptions that are valid at 
the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes  in  the  forecast  prices  of  commodities,  exchange  rates,  production  costs  or  recovery  rates  may  change  the 
economic  status  of  Reserves  and  may,  ultimately,  result  in  the  Rreserves  being  restated.  Such  changes  may  impact  asset 
carrying values, depreciation and amortisation rates, deferred development costs and provisions for restoration.
Other critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions are discussed in the following notes:

Share-based payments 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure

2.  SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 (a)  Description of segments and principal activities
The Group's Executive Committee consisting of the Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Chief  Geological  Officer,  examine  the  Group's  performance  and  have  identified  six  operating  segments  relating  to  the 
continuing operations of the business:
1. Paulsens, WA Australia - Mining and processing of gold
2. Kundana, WA Australia - Gold mining
3. Kanowna Belle, WA Australia - Mining and processing of gold
4. Jundee, WA Australia - Mining and processing of gold
5. Tanami, NT Australia (acquired 31 July 2015)
6. Exploration - Exploration and evaluation of gold mineralisation
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues or 
incur expenses.
Exploration compromises all projects in the exploration, evaluation and feasibility phase of the Group. These include the Mt 
Olympus,  Fortescue  JV  and  Electric  Dingo  projects  as  well  as  ongoing  exploration  programmes  at  the  Group’s  respective 
sites.
During  the  year  the  Group  commenced  a  sales  process  related  to  its  Plutonic  operations  in  WA,  which  is  consequently 
classified  as  a  discontinued  operation  as  at  30  June  2016.  Further  information  on  Plutonic  and  the  disposal  process  is 
included in note 15.
An analysis of segment revenues is presented in note 3.

Interest income, finance charges, interest expense and acquisition costs are not allocated to the operating segments as this 
type of activity is driven by the central treasury function which manages the cash position of the Group.
Segment  EBITDA  reconciles  to  profit  before  income  tax  from  continuing  operations  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  as

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the entity and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised when there has been a transfer of risks and rewards from the Group to an external party, no further 
processing is required by the Group, quality and quantity of the goods has been determined with reasonable accuracy, the 
selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The point at which risk and rewards passes for the majority 
of  the  Group’s  commodity  sales  is  upon  delivery  of  the  gold  bullion  to  the  refiner  or  its  agent.  Adjustments  are  made  for 
variations in commodity price, assay and weight between the time of dispatch and the time of final settlement.
The Group derives the following types of revenue:

Sale of silver

4.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD
The  financial  position  and  performance  of  the  Group  was  particularly  affected  by  the  following  events  and  transactions 
during the reporting period:
  Completion  of  settlement  with  Tanami  Gold  under  which  Northern  Star  can  progressively  acquire  a  60%  joint  venture 
interest  in  the  Central  Tanami  Project.  Settlement  occurred  on  31  July  2015  following  a  payment  of  A$20  million  by 
Northern Star to Tanami Gold NL. This comprised a cash payment of a A$11 million and the issue of 4.29 million Northern 
Star shares which have a value of A$9 million based on their five-day volume weighted average price prior to the ASX 
announcement of the deal on 26 February 2015. As a result of the payment Northern Star now has a 25% interest in the 
Central Tanami Project

In  February  2016,  the  Company  announced  its  intention  to  run  a  formal  process  to  consider  the  sale  of  the  Plutonic 
operations.  As  announced  to  the  ASX  on  15  August  2016,  the  Company  has  executed  a  legally-binding  Sale  and 
Purchase  Agreement  to  sell  the  Plutonic  operations  subject  to  satisfaction  of  certain  conditions  as  disclosed  in  the 
announcement. Plutonic operations are classified as held for sale at 30 June 2016, refer to note 15 of the financial report 
for details.

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via Option and Share Plans as discussed in note 20.
The fair value of shares and options granted under these Plans are recognised as a share-based payments expense with a 
corresponding  increase  in  equity.  The  total  amount  to  be  expensed  is  determined  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the 
shares or options granted, which includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions 
but excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares and  options that are expected  to 
vest.  The  total  expense  is  recognised  over  the  vesting  period,  which  is  the  period  over  which  all  of  the  specified  vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares and options 
that  are expected  to  vest based  on  the  non-market  vesting conditions. It  recognises  the impact  of  the  revision  to  original 
estimates, if any, in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
 (c)  Acquisition costs
Pre-emptive waiver expense 
Gain on bargain purchase 
Acquisition costs 
 
 
During  the  year  ended  30  June  2015,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  Jundee  gold  mine  from  Newmont 
Mining Corporation. Acquisition related costs of $12.8 million and ordinary shares issued to the value of $10.0 million to a third 
party  to  waive  their  pre-emptive  right  were  excluded  from  the  consideration  transfer  and  have  been  recognised  as  an 
expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The bargain purchase arose as a result of the 
vendor  making  a  strategic  decision  to  reduce  their  presence  in  the  Australian  market  as  part  of  a  review  of  their  global 
operations.

Income tax expense 
Income tax expense/(benefit) is attributable to: 
Profit from continuing operations 
Loss from discontinued operations (note 15) 
 
 
 (b)  Accounting policy 
The income tax expense for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income  tax  rate  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to  temporary  differences  and  to 
unused tax losses.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting period in  the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to 
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Deferred  income  tax  is  not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Current  and  deferred  tax  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss,  except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates  to  items  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity.  In  this  case,  the  tax  is  also  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  or 
directly in equity, respectively. 
 (c)  Numerical reconciliation of income tax expense to prima facie tax payable
Profit from continuing operations before income tax expense 
Loss from discontinuing operations before income tax expense

 (d)  Amounts recognised directly in equity
Aggregate current and deferred tax arising in the reporting period and not recognised 
in net profit or loss or other comprehensive income but directly debited or credited to 
equity:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(i)  Classification as trade and other receivables 
If collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current  assets.  Trade  receivables  are  generally  due  for  settlement  within  30  days  and  therefore  are  all  classified  as 
current.
(ii)  Fair value of trade and other receivables 
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to be the same as their fair value. 
 (b)  Available-for-sale financial assets 
Accounting policy
Investments  are  designated  as  available-for-sale  financial  assets  if  they  do  not  have  fixed  maturities  and  fixed  or 
determinable payments and management intends to hold them for the  medium to long-term. Financial assets that are not 
classified into any of the other categories (at FVTPL, loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments) are included in 
the available-for-sale category. Refer to note 25 for further information on accounting policies for financial assets and note 
8(f) in relation to fair value measurements.
Available-for-sale financial assets include the following classes of financial assets:
Non-current assets 
Listed equity securities 
 
 (i)  Classification of financial assets as available-for-sale 
The  financial  assets  are  presented  as  non-current  assets  unless  they  mature  or  management  intends  to  dispose  of  them 
within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.

(ii)  Risk exposure 
The  Group's  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  is  discussed  in  note  11.  The  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of cash and cash equivalents mentioned above. 
 (d)  Trade and other payables 
Accounting policy
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which are 
unpaid.  The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  are  usually  paid  within  60  days  of  recognition.  Trade  and  other  payables  are 
presented  as  current  liabilities  unless  payment  is  not  due  within  12  months  from  the  reporting  date.  They  are  recognised 
initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are assumed to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term 
nature.

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised  under plant and equipment at the lease's inception at the 
fair value of  the leased  property  or, if lower,  the present  value  of  the  minimum  lease payments.  The  corresponding  rental 
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the reporting date.

(iii)  Fair value 
For  the  majority  of  the  borrowings,  the  fair  values  are  not  materially  different  to  their  carrying  amounts,  since  the  interest 
payable on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature. Refer above 
for differences as at year end.
(iv)  Financing arrangements 
At the end of the reporting period, the Group had an undrawn $100 million (2015: $100 million) revolving credit facility and a 
$5 million guarantee facility which was drawn down by $3.5 million (2015: nil). 
 (f)  Recognised fair value measurements 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group's level 1 financial instruments comprise available-for-sale equity securities of $8.8 million (2015: 
$7.5 million). The Group's available-for-sale equity securities are traded in an active market and their fair values are based 
upon quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.

Accounting policy
Property,  plant  and  equipment is  carried  at historical  cost less  accumulated  depreciation and impairment losses. Refer  to 
note 25 for further information on accounting policies associated with impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured  reliably.  The  carrying  amount  of  any  component  accounted  for  as  a  separate  asset  is  derecognised  when 
replaced.  All  other  repairs  and  maintenance  are  charged  to  profit  or  loss  during  the  reporting  period  in  which  they  are 
incurred.

(i)  Leased assets 
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease's inception at the fair value of the lease property, 
or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The  property,  plant  and  equipment  acquired  under  finance  leases  is  depreciated  over  the  asset’s  useful  life  or  over  the 
shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at 
the end of the lease term.
Plant and equipment includes the following amounts where the Group is a lessee under a finance lease:

Exploration and evaluation assets include the costs of acquiring licences, costs associated with exploration and evaluation 
activity,  and  the  fair  value (at acquisition  date)  of  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  acquired  in  a business  combination. 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  capitalised  on  an  area  of  interest  basis.  Costs  incurred  before  the  Group  has 
obtained  the  legal  rights  to  explore  an  area  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive 
income.
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  only  recognised  if  the  rights  of  the  area  of  interest  are  current  and  either,  the 
expenditures  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  successful  development  and  exploitation  of  the  area  of  interest  or 
activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date; reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of 
the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable Reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, 
the area of interest are continuing.
Once  a  development  decision  has  been  made  all  past  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  in  respect  of  an  area  of 
interest that has been capitalised is transferred to mine properties where it is amortised over the life of the area of interest to 
which it relates on a unit-of-production basis. No amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
The  application  of  the  above  accounting  policy  requires  management  to  make  certain  estimates  and  assumptions  as  to 
future  events  and  circumstances,  in  particular,  the  assessment  of  whether  economic  quantities  of  Reserves will  be  found. 
Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available, which may require adjustments 
to  the  carrying  value  of  assets.  Capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  assessed  for  impairment  when  an 
indicator of impairment exists, and capitalised assets are written off where required.

On  31  July  2015  the  Company  completed  settlement  of  the  agreement  with  Tanami  Gold  NL  (TAM)  under  which  the 
Company  can  progressively  acquire  a  60%  joint  venture  interest  in  the  Central  Tanami  Project.  Settlement  followed  the 
payment  of  A$20  million  by  the  Company  to  TAM.  This  comprised  a  cash  payment  of  A$11  million  and  the  issue  of 
4.29 million shares in the Company which had a value of A$9 million based on the five-day volume weighted average price 
prior to the ASX announcement on 26 February 2015.
As a result of this payment, the Company now has a 25% interest in the Central Tanami Project and surrounding tenements. 
Refer to note 14 for further details. 
 (ii)  Impairment 
At  each  reporting  date  the  Group  undertakes  an  assessment  of  the  carrying  amount  of  its  exploration  and  evaluation 
assets.  During  the  year  the  Group  identified  indicators  of  impairment  on  certain  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  under 
AASB 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. As a result of this review, an impairment loss of $4.4 million (2015: 
$8.1 million) has been recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in relation to areas of 
interest where no future exploration and evaluation activities are expected.
(c)  Mine properties 
Accounting policy
Mine  properties  includes  aggregate  expenditure  in  relation  to  mine  construction,  mine  development,  exploration  and 
evaluation expenditure where a development decision has been made and acquired mineral interests.
Expenditure  incurred  in  constructing  a  mine  by,  or  on  behalf  of,  the  Group  is  accumulated  separately  for  each  area  of 
interest in which economically recoverable  Reserves and Resources have been identified. This expenditure includes direct 
costs of construction, drilling costs and removal of overburden to gain access to the ore, borrowing costs capitalised during 
construction and an appropriate allocation of attributable overheads.
Mine development represents expenditure in respect of exploration and evaluation, overburden removal and construction 
costs  and  development incurred  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  Group  previously  accumulated  and  carried  forward in  relation  to 
properties in which mining has now commenced. Such expenditure comprises direct costs and an appropriate allocation of 
directly related overhead expenditure.
All expenditure incurred prior to commencement of production from each development property is carried forward to the 
extent  to  which  recoupment  out  of  future  revenue  from  the  sale  of  production,  or  from  the  sale  of  the  property,  is 
reasonably assured. When further development expenditure is incurred in respect of a mine property after commencement 
of  commercial  production,  such  expenditure  is  carried  forward  as  part  of  the  cost  of  the  mine  property  only when  future 
economic  benefits  are  reasonably  assured,  otherwise  the  expenditure  is  classified  as  part  of  the  cost  of  production  and 
expensed as incurred. Such capitalised development expenditure is added to the total carrying value of mine development 
being amortised.
Mine development costs (as transferred from exploration and evaluation and/or mines under construction) are amortised on 
a  units-of-production  basis  over  the  life  of  mine  to  which  they  relate.  In  applying  the  units  of  production  method, 
amortisation is calculated using the expected total contained ounces as determined by the life of mine plan specific to that 
mine property. For development expenditure undertaken during  production, the amortisation  rate is based on the ratio of 
total development expenditure (incurred and anticipated) over the expected total contained ounces as estimated by the 
relevant  life  of  mine  plan  to  achieve  a  consistent  amortisation  rate  per  ounce.  The  rate  per  ounce  is  typically  updated 
annually as the life of mine plans are revised.
Mineral  interests  comprise  identifiable  exploration  and  evaluation  assets,  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves,  which  are 
acquired  as  part  of  a  business  combination  or  joint  venture  acquisition  and  are  recognised  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of 
acquisition.  Where  possible,  mineral  interests  are  attributable  to  specific  areas  of  interest  and  are  classified  within  mine 
properties.

An impairment indicator assessment was undertaken for all operations at balance date. This review concluded that for the 
Plutonic gold mine operation an impairment indicator did exist given the high cost of production and losses incurred during 
the year. The other operations were assessed as not having indicators of impairment.
During the year, the Company announced its intention to conduct a sale process for the Plutonic operations. The Plutonic 
operations have been classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2016.
An impairment assessment was undertaken prior to the reclassification to held for sale, with the recoverable amount being 
referenced  to  the  consideration  presented  within  an  arm’s  length  non-binding  offer  letter  (The  Offer).  The  consideration 
included  in  The  Offer  composed  of  a  number  of  components  which  required  judgement  in  fair  valuing.  The  various 
components include:





A$12.5 million cash payment at completion of the Sale and Purchase Agreement ('SPA');
further payments in either cash or equity of the acquirer within six months of the execution of the SPA, valued at at least 
A$25 million;
if the proposed acquirer’s parent is listed at completion or lists up to six months after completion of the SPA, one 10 year 
warrant for every two shares issued to Northern Star exercisable at a 100% premium to the “Go Public” issue price;
potential milestone payments capped at A$10 million where A$2.5 million is payable for each additional 250,000 ounces 
of  NI  43-101  compliant  indicated  Resources  (or  better)  in  excess  of  1,717,000oz  JORC  2012  measured,  indicated  or 
inferred Mineral Resources; and
a  2%  net smelter  royalty on  production  between  300,000oz  and  600,000oz  of  refined  gold  generated  from  the  Project, 
capped at A$10 million. The acquirer is entitled to buy the royalty earlier for A$6.5 million.
The Offer was considered the best evidence of fair value less costs to sell in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets 
given  that  it was  a  result  of  a  competitive  sales  process  participated  in  by  a  number  of willing,  able  and  knowledgeable 
participants. Subsequent to year end, the Company executed a legally-binding conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement 
for the Plutonic gold mine, refer to note 18.
Refer to note 15 for further information in relation to the Plutonic operations, including its related assets and liabilities which 
will be transferred as part of any sale.
Based  on  management's  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  presented  above,  the  recoverable  amount 
exceeded  the  carrying  value  of  the  associated  assets  of  the  Plutonic  operations  and  therefore  no  impairment  loss  was 
charged to the profit or loss for the year ended 30 June 2016.

Offsetting within tax consolidated group 
Northern  Star  Resources  Limited  and its wholly-owned  Australian  subsidiaries  have  applied  the  tax  consolidation legislation 
which means  that these entities are taxed  as a single entity. As a consequence, the deferred  tax assets and  deferred  tax 
liabilities of these entities have been offset in the consolidated financial statements.

Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  only  if  it  is  probable  that  future  taxable  amounts  will  be  available  to  utilise  those 
temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets, including  those arising from  unutilised tax losses (where applicable), 
require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will comply with the relevant tax legislation and will generate 
sufficient  taxable  earnings  in  future  years  in  order  to  recognise  and  utilise  those  deferred  tax  assets.  Estimates  of  future 
taxable  income  are  based  on  forecast  cash  flows  from  operations  and  existing  tax  laws  in  each  jurisdiction.  These 
assessments  require  the  use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  such  as  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices  and  operating 
performance over the life of the assets. To the extent that cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, 
the ability of the Group to realise the deferred tax assets reported at the reporting date could be impacted. Additionally, 
future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could limit the ability of the Group to obtain tax 
deductions in future years.
(e)  Inventories 
Accounting policy
Gold bullion, gold in circuit and ore stockpiles are physically measured or estimated and valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost represents the weighted average cost and includes direct purchase costs and an appropriate portion 
of  fixed  and  variable  production  overhead  expenditure,  including  depreciation  and  amortisation,  incurred  in  converting 
materials into finished goods.
Materials  and  supplies  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.  Any  allowance  for  obsolescence  is 
determined  by  reference  to  specific  stock  items  identified.  A  regular  and  on-going  review  is  undertaken  to  establish  the 
extent of surplus items and an allowance is made for any potential loss on their disposal.
Net  realisable  value is  the  estimated  selling price in  the ordinary  course of  business less  the  estimated  costs of  completion 
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Ore  stockpiles  which  are  not  expected  to  be  processed  in  the  12  months  after  the  reporting  date  are  classified  as  non-
current inventory. There is a reasonable expectation the processing of these stockpiles will have a future economic benefit 
to the Group and accordingly values these stockpiles at the lower of cost and net realisable value

 (i)  Amounts recognised in profit or loss 
Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value amounted to $4.3 million (2015 - Nil). These were recognised as an expense 
during the year ended 30 June 2016 and included in 'cost of sales' in profit or loss.

18,456

Provisions  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has  a  present  legal  or  constructive  obligation  as  a  result  of  past  events,  it  is 
probable  that an outflow of  resources will be required  to  settle the obligation  and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Provisions  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  managements  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure  required  to  settle  the 
present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

The  current portion  of  this liability includes all of  the accrued  annual leave,  the unconditional  entitlements  to  long  service 
leave where  employees  have  completed  the  required  period  of  service  and  also  those where  employees  are  entitled  to 
pro-rata  payments in  certain  circumstances.  The entire  amount  of  the annual leave provision  of  $18.5 million  (2015  -  $17.3 
million) is presented as current, since the Group does not have an unconditional right to  defer settlement for any of  these 
obligations. Based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued leave 
or require payment within the next 12 months. The following amounts reflect leave that is not expected to be taken or paid 
within the next 12 months.
Current leave obligations expected to be settled after 12 months 
 
 (ii)  Information about individual provisions and significant estimates 
Rehabilitation provision 
The  Group assesses its mine  rehabilitation  provision  annually. Significant judgement is  required in  determining  the provision 
for mine rehabilitation and closure as there are many factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable to rehabilitate the 
mine  sites,  including  future  disturbances  caused  by  further  development,  changes  in  technology,  changes  in  regulations, 
price increases, changes in timing of cash flows which are based on life of mine plans and changes in discount rates. When 
these  factors  change or  become known in  the  future,  such  differences will impact  the mine  rehabilitation  provision  in  the 
period in which the change becomes known.

Long service leave
The liability for long service leave and other long-term benefits is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash 
outflows to be made by the Group for those employees with greater than 5 years’ service up to the reporting date. Long-
term  benefits  not  expected  to  be  settled  within  12  months  are  discounted  using  the  rates  attaching  to  high  quality 
corporate bonds at the reporting date, which most closely match the terms of maturity of the related liability. In determining 
the liability for these long-term employee benefits, consideration has been given to expected future increases in wage and 
salary rates, the Group’s experience with staff departures and periods of service. Related on-costs are also included in the 
liability.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  Board  has  the  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  risk  management  framework.  The  Audit 
and Risk Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly 
to the Board on its activities.
Risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards 
and  procedures,  aims  to  develop  a  disciplined  and  constructive  control  environment  in  which  all  employees  understand 
their roles and obligations.
The Group’s Audit and Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management 
policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the 
Group. 
 (a)  Market risk 
 (i)  Foreign exchange risk 
At  reporting  date  the  Group  has  minimal  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk.  The  Group’s  operations  are  all  located  within 
Australia and material expenses and revenues are denominated in Australian Dollars, the Company’s functional currency. 
 (ii)  Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk 
At reporting date the Group has minimal exposure to interest rate risk. The majority of the Group’s borrowings relate to the 
purchases  of plant and equipment  under  finance lease arrangements which  have  fixed interest  rates  over  their  term and 
therefore not subject to interest rate risk as defined in AASB 7. 
 (iii)  Price risk 
Exposure 
The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the prevailing market prices for the gold and silver currently produced from 
its operating mines.
The Group manages this risk through the use of gold forward contracts. These contracts are accounted for as sale contracts 
with revenue recognised once gold has been physically delivered into the contract. The physical gold delivery contracts are 
considered  a  contract  to  sell  a  non-financial  item  and  therefore  do  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  AASB  139  Financial 
Instruments:  Recognition and Measurement.  As at reporting date the Group has contractual sale commitments of 297,193 
ounces of gold at an average price of A$1,737 per ounce (2015: 90,000 ounces at A$1,435 per ounce).
The  Group  is  also  exposed  to  equity  securities  price  risk  arising  from  investments  held  by  the  Group  and  classified  in  the 
statement of financial position as available-for-sale financial assets.
All of the Group's equity investments are publicly traded on the ASX.
Sensitivity
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of the gold price on the Group's post-tax profit for the year. 
The  analysis  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  gold  price  had  increased/decreased  by  AUD$100  per  ounce  (2015: 
increased/decreased by AUD$100 per ounce) with all other variables held constant.

Credit  risk  refers  to  the  risk  that  a  counter  party  will  default  on  its  contractual  obligation  resulting  in  financial  loss  to  the 
Group.  Credit  risk  arises  from  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  credit  exposures  to  gold  sales  counterparties  and  financial 
counterparties. 
 (i)  Risk management 
The Group has adopted the policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial 
loss  from  defaults.  Cash  is  deposited  only  with  institutions  approved  by  the  Board,  typically  with  a  current  minimum  credit 
rating of A (or equivalent) as determined by a reputable credit rating agency eg. Standard & Poor’s. Permitted instruments 
by  which  the  Group  hedges  gold  price  risk  are  entered  into  with  financial  counterparties  with  a  minimum  credit  of  A  (or 
equivalent).  The  Group  has  established  limits  on  aggregate  funds  on  term  deposit  or  invested  in  money  markets  to  be 
placed with a single financial counterparty and monitors credit and counterparty risk using credit default swaps. The Group 
sells the majority of its unhedged gold and silver to a single counterparty with settlement terms of no more than 2 days. The 
counterparty  currently  has  an  AA+  long  term  rating  and  AAA  short  term  rating.  The  Group  does  not  have  any  other 
significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty or any Group of counterparties having similar characteristics. 
 (ii)  Credit quality 
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit 
ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates:

(iii)  Impaired trade receivables 
In determining the recoverability of trade and other receivables, the Group performs a risk analysis considering the type and 
age of the outstanding receivable and the creditworthiness of  the counterparty. If appropriate, an impairment loss will be 
recognised in profit or loss. The Group does not have any impaired Trade and other receivables as at 30 June 2016 (2015: 
nil).
(c)  Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring immediate and forecasted cash requirements and ensures adequate cash 
reserves are maintained to pay debts as and when due.
Prudent  liquidity  risk  management  implies  maintaining  sufficient  cash  and  marketable  securities  and  the  availability  of 
funding  through  an  adequate  amount  of  committed  credit  facilities  to  meet  obligations  when  due.  At  the  end  of  the 
reporting period the Group held deposits at call of $101.3 million (2015: $2.3 million) that are expected to readily generate 
cash  inflows  for  managing  liquidity  risk.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  underlying  businesses,  the  Group  maintains 
flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
Management  monitors  rolling  forecasts  of  the  Group's  available  cash  reserve  (comprising  the  undrawn borrowing  facilities 
below and cash and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at local level in the 
operating  companies  of  the  Group.  The  Group's  liquidity  management  policy  involves  seeking  to  maintain  a  minimum 
available cash of at least 30 days costs of goods sold plus net interest costs. 
 (i)  Financing arrangements 
The Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:
Floating rate 
- Expiring within one year (financing facility) 
- Expiring beyond one year (financing facility) 
 
The credit facilities may be drawn at any time.

GROUP STRUCTURE
This section provides information which will help users understand how the Group structure affects the financial position and 
performance of the Group as a whole. In particular, there is information about:


changes  to  the  structure  that  occurred  during  the  year  as  a  result  of  business  combinations  and  the  disposal  of  a 
discontinued operation; and
interests in joint operations.
A list of significant subsidiaries is provided in note 16.
13. BUSINESS COMBINATION
Accounting policy
The  acquisition  method  of  accounting  is  used  to  account  for  all  business  combinations,  regardless  of  whether  equity 
instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the: fair 
values of the assets transferred; liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business; equity interests issued by the 
Group; fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and fair value of any pre-
existing equity interest in the subsidiary.
Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination  are,  with  limited 
exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in 
the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  over  the 
acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the 
fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, 
the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.

statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2015. The bargain purchase arose 
as a result of the vendor making a strategic decision to reduce their presence in the Australian market as part of a review of 
their global operations.

On  31 July 2015,  the Group  completed settlement with Tanami Gold NL (TAM) to progressively acquire a  60% joint venture 
interest in the Central Tanami Project (CTP).
As part of the acquisition, the Group has granted TAM two put options to sell the remaining 40% interest in the CTP following 
completion.  The  first  put  option  will  grant  TAM  the  right  to  sell  15%  of  CTP  for  A$20  million  in  cash  or  NST  shares  at  TAM’s 
election,  at  any  time  from  completion  up  until  three  years  after  the  completion  of  the  initial  acquisition.  If  commercial 
production is achieved more than three years after completion, TAM may exercise this option at any time up to 30 calendar 
days following achievement of Commercial Production. The second put option will grant TAM the right to sell 25% of CTP for 
A$32  million  in  cash  or  NST  shares  at  TAM’s  election  at  any  time  from  completion  up  to  six  calendar  months  after  the 
achievement of commercial production.
The  total undiscounted  amount  of  payments  that  the  Group could  be  required  to  make  to TAM  upon  the exercise of  the 
two put options is A$52 million.
15. DISCONTINUED OPERATION
Accounting policy
A  discontinued  operation is a component  of  the entity  that has  been  disposed  of  or is  classified as held  for  sale  and  that 
represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or  geographical  area  of  operations,  is  part  of  a  single  coordinated  plan  to 
dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results 
of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss. 
 (a)  Description 
As  announced  to  the  ASX  in  February  2016,  the  Group  commenced  a  formal  sale  process  for  the  Plutonic  gold  mine. 
Subsequently,  the  Group  announced  on  15  August  2016  that  a legally  binding  conditional Sale and  Purchase  Agreement 
was  executed.    The  associated  assets  and  liabilities  were  consequently  presented  as  held  for  sale  in  the  2016  financial 
statements.
As  at  30  June  2016  the  sales  process  was  at  an  advanced  stage  and  is  expected  to  complete  within  12  months  of  the 
reporting date.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(i)  Fair value of options granted 
The  assessed  fair  value  at  grant  date of  options  granted  during  the  year ended  30  June  2016 was  $0.67  per  option  (2015: 
$0.25).  The  fair  value  at  grant  date  is  independently  determined  using  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  model  (market  based 
vesting conditions) and a Black Scholes Model (non-market vesting conditions) that takes into  account the exercise price, 
the term of the options, the impact of dilution (where material), the share price at grant date and expected price volatility 
of the underlying option, the expected dividend yield, the risk free rate for the term of the options and the correlations and 
volatilities of the peer group companies.
The model inputs for options granted during the year ended 30 June 2016 included:
(a)  Options are granted for no consideration and vest based on the Company’s total  Shareholder returns (“TSR”) ranking
within a selected peer group of companies over a three year period.
(b)  exercise price: $2.1818 (2015 - $1.2804) 
 (c)  grant date: 9 July 2015 (2015 - 14 November 2014) 
 (d)  expiry date: 31 July 2018 (2015 - 31 July 2017) 
 (e) 
share price at grant date: $2.21 (2015 - $1.08) 
 (f)  expected price volatility of the company's shares: 60% (2015 - 58%) 
 (g)  expected dividend yield: 2.26% (2015 - 3.24%) 
 (h)
risk-free interest rate: 1.87% (2015 - 2.62%)
The expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility (based on the  remaining life of the options), adjusted for any 
expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
(b)  Employee Share Plan
Under  the  Employee  Share  Plan,  eligible  employees  may  be  granted  up  to  $1,000  of  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  in  the 
Company annually for no cash consideration. The number of shares issued to participants in the scheme is the offer amount 
divided by the weighted average price at which the Company’s shares are traded on the ASX during the week up to and 
including the date of grant. The fair value of shares issued during the year was $5.09 (2015: $2.26) per share.

On 9 July 2015, 2,810,953 FY2016 performance shares were issued to KMP and other senior management of the Company at 
an issue price of $2.1818. Corresponding non-recourse loans totalling $6,132,937 were entered into in accordance with the 
Plan as part of their remuneration. As at 30 June 2016, non-recourse loans relating to this issue had reduced to $6,010,058.

Company at an issue price of $1.1874 per share, with a further 212,917 shares issued on 30 March 2015 to an employee of 
the Company at an issue price of $2.4549 per share. Corresponding limited recourse loans totalling $6,254,338 were entered 
into with KMP and senior management in accordance with the Plan as part of their remuneration. As at 30 June 2016, non-
recourse loans relating to this issued had reduced to $5,960,580.
The loans offered  are limited recourse and are secured against the performance shares held  by  the relevant participants. 
The Board may, at its discretion, agree to forgive a loan offered to a participant.
The assessed fair value at grant date of the performance shares granted during the year ended 30 June 2016 was $0.67 per 
share (2015: 9 October 2014 $0.37 and 30 March 2015 $0.57).
The  fair  value  at  grant  date  is  independently  determined  using  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  model  (market  based  vesting 
conditions) and a Black Scholes Model (non-market vesting conditions) that takes into account the exercise price, the term 
of  the  performance  share,  the  impact  of  dilution  (where  material),  the  share  price  at  grant  date  and  expected  price

22. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:

the profit attributable to owners of the Company; and
  by the weighted average numbers of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, excluding treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:


the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, and
the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

(e)  Determining the parent entity financial information 
The financial information for the parent entity, Northern Star Resources Limited, has been prepared on the same basis as the 
consolidated financial statements, except as set out below.
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities
(i) 
Investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint  venture  entities  are  accounted  for  at  cost  in  the  financial  statements  of 
Northern Star Resources Limited.
(ii)  Tax consolidation legislation 
Northern Star Resources Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation 
legislation.
The head entity, Northern Star Resources Limited, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group account for their 
own  current and  deferred  tax amounts.  These  tax amounts  are measured as if  each  entity  in  the  tax  consolidated  Group 
continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer in its own right.
In  addition  to  its  own  current  and  deferred  tax  amounts,  Northern  Star  Resources  Limited  also  recognises  the  current  tax 
liabilities  (or  assets)  and  the  deferred  tax  assets  arising  from  unused  tax  losses  and  unused  tax  credits  assumed  from 
controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group.
The  entities  have  also  entered  into  a  tax  funding  agreement  under  which  the  wholly-owned  entities  fully  compensate 
Northern  Star  Resources  Limited  for  any  current  tax  payable  assumed  and  are  compensated  by  Northern  Star  Resources 
Limited  for any  current  tax  receivable  and  deferred  tax  assets  relating  to  unused  tax losses or  unused  tax  credits  that  are 
transferred to Northern Star Resources Limited under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined 
by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities’ financial statements.
The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of  the funding advice from  the 
head entity, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each  financial year. The head entity may also require 
payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.
2016 Annual Financial Report
Page 61
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current amounts 
receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are 
recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.
25. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This  note  provides  a  list  of  all  significant  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial 
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial 
statements are for the Group consisting of Northern Star Resources Limited and its subsidiaries.
(a)  Basis of preparation 
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and 
interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. Northern Star Resources 
Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.
(i)  Compliance with IFRS 
Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the financial statements and notes of the Company and the 
Group complies with international financial reporting standards (IFRS).
(ii)  Historical cost convention 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the following:
 

available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments); and 
 assets held for sale - measured at the lower of cost and fair value less cost of disposal.
(iii) New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
The  Group  has  adopted  all  of  the  new,  revised  or  amending  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  issued  by  the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period.
Any  new,  revised  or  amending  Accounting  Standards  or  Interpretations  that  are  not  yet  mandatory  have  not  been  early 
adopted.
Any  significant  impact  of  the  accounting  policies  of  the  Group  from  the  adoption  of  these  Accounting  Standards  and 
Interpretations  are  disclosed  below.  The  adoption  of  these  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  did  not  have  any 
significant impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
(iv)  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
Certain  new  accounting  standards  and  interpretations  have  been  published  that  are  not  mandatory  for  30  June  2016 
reporting  periods  and  have  not  been  early  adopted  by  the  Group.  The  Group’s  assessment  of  the  impact  of  these  new 
standards and interpretations is set out below.

adoption by Group 
Must be applied for financial years 
commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
Based on the transitional provisions in the 
completed AASB 9, early adoption in 
phases was only permitted for annual 
reporting periods beginning before 1 
February 2015. After that date, the new 
rules must be adopted in their entirety.
The Group is currently assessing whether it 
should  adopt  AASB  9  before 
its 
mandatory date.
Impact 
While  the  Group  has  yet  to  undertake  a  detailed 
assessment of the classification and measurement of 
financial  assets,  debt  instruments  currently  classified 
as  available-for-sale  (AFS)  financial  assets  would 
appear  to  satisfy  the  conditions  for  classification  as 
at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income 
(FVOCI)  and  hence  there  will  be  no  change  to  the 
accounting for these assets.
The  other  financial  assets  in  held  by  the  Group 
include:
  equity  instruments  currently  classified  as  AFS  for
which a FVOCI election is available,
  equity  investments  currently  measured  at  fair 
value  through  profit  or  loss  (FVPL)  which  would 
likely continue to be measured on the same basis 
under AASB 9, and
Accordingly,  the  Group  does  not  expect  the  new 
guidance  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
classification  and  measurement  of 
financial 
assets.
its
There  will  be  no  impact  on  the  Group's  accounting 
for  financial  liabilities,  as  the  new  requirements  only 
affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are 
designated  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and 
the  Group  does  not  have  any  such  liabilities.  The 
derecognition  rules  have  been  transferred  from 
AASB  139  Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and 
Measurement and have not been changed.
2016 Annual Financial Report
Page 62
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The new impairment model requires the recognition 
of  impairment  provisions  based  on  expected  credit 
losses (ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses as 
is  the  case  under  AASB  139.  It  applies  to  financial 
assets  classified  at  amortised  cost,  debt  instruments 
measured  at  FVOCI,  contract  assets  under  AASB  15 
Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers, 
lease 
receivables, 
loan  commitments  and  certain 
financial  guarantee  contracts.  While  the  Group  has 
not yet undertaken a detailed assessment of how its 
impairment  provisions  would  be  affected  by  the 
new model, it may result in an earlier recognition  of 
credit losses.

At this stage, the Group is not able to estimate the

assessments of the effect over the next twelve

Expected date of adoption by the 
Group: 1 January 2018.
AASB 15
Revenue from 
Contracts with 
Customers
The AASB has issued a 
new standard for the 
recognition of revenue. 
This will replace AASB 118 
which covers revenue 
arising from the sale of 
goods and the rendering 
of services and AASB 111 
which covers 
construction contracts.
The new standard is 
based on the principle 
that revenue is 
recognised when control 
of a good or service 
transfers to a customer.
The standard permits 
either a full retrospective 
or a modified 
retrospective approach 
for the adoption.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity 
in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
(b)  Principles of consolidation 
 (i)  Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over  which  the  Group  has  control.  The  Group  controls  an  entity 
when  the  Group  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  with  the  entity  and  has  the  ability  to 
affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  and  losses  on  transactions  between  Group  companies  are 
eliminated.
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  all  subsidiaries  of  Northern  Star  Resources 
Limited ('Company' or 'parent entity') as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. Northern 
Star Resources Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred  to in  this financial report as the Group or the consolidated 
entity.
(ii)  Joint arrangements 
Under AASB 11 Joint Arrangements investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. 
The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the 
joint  arrangement.  Northern  Star  Resources  Limited  has  only  joint  operations.  A  joint  operation  is  a  joint  arrangement 
whereby  the  parties  that  have  joint  control of  the  arrangement have  rights  to  the  assets,  and obligations  for  the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only 
when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint operations 
Northern  Star  Resources  Limited  Limited  recognises  its  direct  right  to  the  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  of  joint 
operations  and  its  share  of  any  jointly  held  or  incurred  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses.  These  have  been 
incorporated in the financial statements  under the appropriate headings. Details of  the joint operation  are set out in  note 
16().

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(iii)  Changes in ownership interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity 
owners  of  the  Group.  A  change  in  ownership  interest  results  in  an  adjustment  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  the 
controlling  and  non-controlling  interests  to  reflect  their  relative  interests  in  the  subsidiary.  Any  difference  between  the 
amount of  the adjustment to  non-controlling interests and any  consideration  paid  or received is recognised in a separate 
reserve within equity attributable to owners of Northern Star Resources Limited.
When  the  Group  ceases  to  consolidate  or  equity  account  for  an  investment  because  of  a  loss  of  control,  joint  control  or 
significant  influence,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is  remeasured  to  its  fair  value with  the  change  in  carrying  amount 
recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount  for the purposes of subsequently accounting 
for  the  retained  interest  as  an  associate,  jointly  controlled  entity  or  financial  asset.  In  addition,  any  amounts  previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed 
of  the  related  assets  or  liabilities.  This  may  mean  that  amounts  previously  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  are 
reclassified to profit or loss.
(c)  Foreign currency translation 
 (i)  Functional and presentation currency 
Items included  in  the  financial statements  of each  of  the  Group's  entities are measured  using  the  currency  of  the primary 
economic  environment in which  the entity  operates  ('the  functional  currency').  The  consolidated  financial  statements are 
presented in Australian dollars ($), which is Northern Star Resources Limited's functional and presentation currency.
(d)  Impairment of assets 
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  its  tangible  and  other  intangible  assets  to  determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets might be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the  asset  is  estimated  in  order  to  determine  the  extent  of  the  impairment  loss  (if  any)  which  is  the  amount  by  which  the 
assets  carrying  value  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  Where  the  asset  does  not  generate  cash  in-flows  that  are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of  the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks  specific  to  the asset  for which  the estimates  of  future  cash  flows  have  not been 
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses for assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
(e)  Investments and other financial assets 
 (i)  Classification 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:


financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
loans and receivables;
  held-to-maturity investments; and
  available-for-sale financial assets.
The  classification  depends  on  the  purpose  for  which  the  investments  were  acquired.  Management  determines  the 
classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held-to-maturity, re-evaluates this 
designation at the end of each reporting period. See note 8 for details about each type of financial asset.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  financial  assets  held  for  trading.  A  financial  asset  is  classified  in  this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless 
they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this  category  are  classified  as  current  assets  if  they  are  expected  to  be  settled 
within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables 
Loans  and  receivables are non-derivative  financial  assets with  fixed  or  determinable payments  that  are not  quoted  in  an 
active  market.  They  are  included  in  current  assets,  except  for  those  with  maturities  greater  than  12  months  after  the 
reporting  period  which  are  classified  as  non-current  assets.  Loans  and  receivables  are  included  in  trade  and  other 
receivables and receivables in the Statement of Financial Position.
2016 Annual Financial Report
Page 64
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Held-to-maturity investments 
Held-to-maturity  investments  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  and  fixed  maturities 
that the Group's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than 
an  insignificant  amount  of  held-to-maturity  financial  assets,  the  whole  category  would  be  tainted  and  reclassified  as 
available-for-sale.  Held-to-maturity  financial  assets  are  included  in  non-current  assets,  except  for  those with  maturities  less 
than 12 months from the end of the reporting period, which are classified as current assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale  financial  assets,  comprising  principally  marketable  equity  securities,  are  non-derivatives  that  are  either 
designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the 
investment  matures  or  management  intends  to  dispose  of  the  investment  within  12  months  of  the  end  of  the  reporting 
period.  Investments  are  designated  as  available-for-sale  if  they  do  not  have  fixed  maturities  and  fixed  or  determinable 
payments and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-term.
(ii)  Measurement 
At  initial  recognition,  the  Group  measures a  financial  asset  at  its  fair  value plus, in  the  case  of  a  financial  asset  not at  fair 
value  through  profit  or  loss,  transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  financial  asset. 
Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Loans  and  receivables  and  held-to-maturity  investments  are  subsequently  carried  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective 
interest method.
Available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  subsequently  carried  at  fair 
value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised as follows:


for ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ - in profit or loss within other income or other expenses;
for  available  for  sale  financial  assets  that  are  monetary  securities  denominated  in  a  foreign  currency  -  translation 
differences related to changes in the amortised cost of the security are recognised in profit or loss and other changes in 
the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income;

for other monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available for sale - in other comprehensive income.
Dividends  on  financial  assets at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss  and  available-for-sale equity  instruments are  recognised  in 
profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations when the Group’s right to receive payments is established
Interest  income  from  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  is  included  in  the  net  gains/(losses).  Interest  on 
available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement as part of 
revenue from continuing operations.
(iii)  Impairment 
The  Group  assesses  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial  asset  or  a 
group of  financial assets is impaired.  A  financial asset  or  a  group  of  financial assets is impaired  and impairment losses  are 
incurred  only  if  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment  as  a  result  of  one  or  more  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial 
recognition of the asset (a 'loss event') and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of 
the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. In the case of equity investments classified as 
available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator 
that the assets are impaired.
(f)  Provision for rehabilitation 
Rehabilitation costs include the dismantling and removal of mining plant, equipment and building structures, waste removal 
and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with  the requirements of  the mining permits. Such  costs are determined using 
estimates of future costs, current legal requirements and technology.
Rehabilitation costs are recognised in full at present value as a non-current liability. An equivalent amount is capitalised as 
part  of  the  cost  of  the  asset  when  an  obligation  arises  to  decommission  or  restore  a  site  to  a  certain  condition  after 
abandonment as a result of bringing the assets to its present location. The capitalised cost is amortised over the life of the 
project and the provision is accreted periodically as the discounting of the liability unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is 
recorded as a finance cost.
Any changes in the estimates for the costs or other assumptions against the cost of relevant assets are accounted for on a 
prospective  basis.  In  determining  the  costs  of  site  restoration  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  nature  and  extent  of  the 
restoration due to community expectations and future legislation.
(g)  Rounding of amounts 
The Company is of a kind referred to in Class Order 98/100, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, 
relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded 
off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(h)  Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  associated  GST,  unless  the  GST  incurred  is  not 
recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of 
the expense.
Receivables  and  payables  are  stated  inclusive  of  the  amount  of  GST  receivable  or  payable.  The  net  amount  of  GST 
recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in  the Statement of 
Financial Position.
Cash  flows are presented  on a  gross  basis.  The  GST  components  of  cash  flows  arising  from investing  or  financing  activities 
which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flows.
