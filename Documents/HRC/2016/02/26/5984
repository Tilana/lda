<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on its sixtieth anniversary, which 
</p>
<p>proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is 
</p>
<p>entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in 
</p>
<p>particular with regard to race, colour or national origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly on the protection of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the provisions concerning migrants contained in the outcome documents of 
</p>
<p>all major United Nations conferences and summits, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that every State must ensure the protection of human rights of all individuals 
</p>
<p>within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind, including 
</p>
<p>in particular on the basis of national origin, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 2001 and advisory 
</p>
<p>opinions OC 16/99 of 1 October 1999 and OC 18/03 of 17 September 2003, issued by the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on the right to information on consular assistance in the 
</p>
<p>framework of the guarantees of the due process of law and on the juridical condition and rights 
</p>
<p>of undocumented migrants, respectively, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the judgment of the International Court of Justice of 31 March 2004 in the 
</p>

</p>
<p>the obligations of States reaffirmed therein, as well as in the subsequent rulings of the

<p>International Court of Justice following that judgment, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>who attempt to cross international borders without the required travel documents, which places

<p>  </p>

<p>

them in a particularly vulnerable situation, and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the 
</p>
<p>human rights of those migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing participation of women in international migration movements, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the manifestations of violence, racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and other forms of intolerance and inhuman and degrading treatment against 
</p>
<p>migrants, especially women and children, in different parts of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held 
</p>
<p>pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/208 of 23 December 2003, in New York on 14 and 
</p>
<p>15 September 2006, for the purpose of discussing the multidimensional aspects of international 
</p>
<p>migration and development, which recognized the relationship between international migration, 
</p>
<p>development and human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the adoption of resolution 62/270 by the General Assembly on the Global Forum on 
</p>
<p>Migration and Development in which, inter alia, the Assembly recognizes that exchanges of 
</p>
<p>information and expertise, consultation and closer cooperation between the Global Forum on 
</p>
<p>Migration and Development and the United Nations could have a positive impact, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the role of migrants in positive interaction, particularly in social and cultural 
</p>
<p>fields between the countries of migration, and their contribution to the promotion of international 
</p>
<p>ties, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving 
</p>
<p>societies and their communities of origin and committing to ensure dignified, humane treatment 
</p>
<p>with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
</p>
<p>international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
</p>
<p>economy and take place in a context of new security concerns, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including those that 
</p>
<p>refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic approaches that take into </p>

<p>

</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, 
</p>
<p>and urges States to apply existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts or manifestations or 
</p>
<p>expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
</p>
<p>xenophobic and racist acts; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Requests States to effectively promote and protect the human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, regardless of their

</p>
<p>international instruments to which they are party; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Expresses concern at legislation and measures adopted by some States that may 
</p>
<p>restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, when 
</p>
<p>exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security measures, 
</p>
<p>States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, including 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Calls upon States to observe national legislation and applicable international legal

</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Takes note with appreciation of States that have successfully implemented

</p>
<p>areas to treat migrants and their families respectfully and in accordance with the law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Also requests States to prosecute, in conformity with applicable law, any act of

</p>
<p>unrestricted and expeditious transfer of earnings, assets and pensions of migrants to their country

</p>
<p>appropriate, measures to solve other problems that may impede such transfers;
