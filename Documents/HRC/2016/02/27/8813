Richard Falk</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report examines developments related to human rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories from the period from July through December 2009. The Special 
Rapporteur gives primary attention to the establishment, activities and main findings of the 
United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. Reactions to the Mission 
report, including criticisms and objections from the international community, are also 
reviewed. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur considers the question of Israeli settlements and their 
impact on the enjoyment of human rights. In this regard, the current initiatives of the 
Government of Israel in relation to the settlements are discussed, and reactions at the local 
and international levels are examined. Recent efforts to demonstrate against the 
construction of a wall in the West Bank by the Government of Israel are also discussed. 
</p>
<p> The report gives considerable attention to the ongoing blockade of Gaza by the 
Government of Israel. In this context, the implications of the blockade for efforts to rebuild 
following Operation Cast Lead are highlighted, as well as persistent calls from the 
international community for Israel to lift the blockade. The Special Rapporteur recalls the 
situation of Palestinian refugees, and emphasizes the need to keep their plight on the 
agenda of any effort to establish peace. Finally, the report welcomes a civil society-led 
campaign to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel for its occupation of Palestinian 
territories.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967 has again been compelled to prepare this report without the benefit of 
the cooperation of the State of Israel. In practical terms, this has meant a continuing refusal 
to grant access to the Occupied Palestinian Territories to a representative of the United 
Nations. This violates Israel&#8217;s obligations as a Member State, it impairs the capacity of the 
Human Rights Council to serve the international community, and denies the people living 
under occupation a critical outlet to convey grievances regarding violations of international 
humanitarian law or international human rights law, thus interfering with the ability of the 
United Nations and Member States to exercise their responsibilities to stop these violations. 
This report, then, is based on the best efforts of the Special Rapporteur to gain reliable 
information bearing on the range of issues arising from the continuing occupation, 
including from secondary sources and the testimony of witnesses. In the future an effort 
will be made to visit the Gaza Strip in a formal mission facilitated by the Government of 
Egypt. The Special Rapporteur has been given assurances that the Government of Egypt 
intends to grant him permission to enter Gaza by way of the Rafah Crossing. 
</p>
<p>2. This report covers developments related to human rights in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories (OPT) from July through December 2009. Most developments are connected to 
issues discussed in prior reports of the Special Rapporteur. New concerns addressed in the 
present report include the treatment, by the Human Rights Council and other organs of the 
United Nations, of the report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict, and the role of civil society initiatives that seek to protect human rights in the 
OPT,  in particular given the inability or unwillingness of the United Nations and other 
international actors to uphold human rights and the severity of the deprivations confronting 
Palestinians, who have been living for so long under the burdens of a harsh occupation. 
This harshness has long been flagged as being of an emergency character with respect to 
the 1.5 million residents of the Gaza Strip, especially since the imposition of the unlawful 
Israeli blockade, beginning in June 2007, which has been widely condemned as a flagrant 
and serious violation of the prohibition on collective punishment expressed in article 33 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention, relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
War, which unconditionally condemns collective punishment. There are also some new 
concerns that have been prompted by the announcement by the Government of Israel of a 
temporary and partial 10-month freeze on settlement expansion in the West Bank and the 
resultant resistance to this ban by settlers and their settler organizations, often taking the 
form of recourse to violence against Palestinians, their persons, their property and their 
public facilities. Israel has not displayed due diligence in discharging its primary 
responsibility as occupying Power to protect the occupied civilian population. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The United Nations Fact-finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict 
</b>3. The United Nations Fact-finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict released its report 
(FFM report)1 on 15 September 2009. It was discussed by the Human Rights Council on 29 
September 2009. The Mission undertook a comprehensive investigation of allegations of 
war crimes committed by both Israel and Hamas during Operation Cast Lead, which was 
carried out by Israel in the Gaza Strip from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 A/HRC/12/48. </p>

</p>
<p>resulted in the death of 1,434 Palestinians (960 of whom were civilians), injuries to 5,303 
Palestinians, and the death of 13 Israelis (3 of whom were civilians). The mandate of the 
Fact-finding Mission was as follows: &#8220;To investigate all violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time 
in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 
27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, after or during.&#8221;2 The 
investigation was carried out over a period of three months by a four-person mission led by 
Justice Richard Goldstone, former member of the South African Constitutional Court and 
former Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia 
and Rwanda. The other members of the mission were Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan; Christine Chinkin of the London School of Economics and Political 
Science; and Desmond Travers, formerly an officer in the Irish Defence Forces.  
</p>
<p>4.  The main findings of the FFM report reinforced conclusions reached earlier by an 
Arab League fact-finding mission3 headed by John Dugard, former Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, and by a 
range of respected international, Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations.4 The 
most significant general conclusion reached was that during Operation Cast Lead the 
attacks by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were aimed at the population of the Gaza Strip 
as a whole and, as such, constituted collective punishment that violated Israel&#8217;s obligations 
arising out of its &#8220;effective occupation&#8221;5 of Gaza.6 
</p>
<p>5. This main finding of collective punishment, together with a series of specific abuses 
in incidents where the IDF was found to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilian 
structures, led the Fact-Finding Mission to conclude that crimes against humanity might 
have been committed by Israel.7 The FFM report also concluded that the rockets fired from 
Gaza into Israeli territory were indiscriminate, and as such their use constituted war crimes 
that amounted to crimes against humanity.8 Given the asymmetric casualty totals and 
Israel&#8217;s initiation of Operation Cast Lead, far more attention was given in the FFM report to 
the allegations of IDF criminality than to that of Hamas.  
</p>
<p>6. The rather elaborate recommendations in the FFM report were preoccupied with the 
challenge of overcoming &#8220;the culture of impunity&#8221; that had immunized similar criminality 
in the past, and sought mechanisms of accountability that would result in the prosecution of 
perpetrators. At the same time, the FFM report, in recognition of the general international 
policy of allowing political actors to establish their own domestic procedures of 
accountability, recommended that Israel and Hamas be given six months to establish their 
own independent, credible investigations of allegations and put in place procedures to 
assess accountability.

<p>7. This process is supposed to have been monitored by a body of independent experts 
appointed by the Human Rights Council, and, if the Council deems the results 
unsatisfactory, then it is to refer the report to the Security Council for transfer to the 
International Criminal Court for appropriate action.9 Further, the FFM report recommended 
that countries with laws conferring universal jurisdiction on national criminal courts pursue 
investigation, detention and indictment of alleged perpetrators, as appropriate.10 
</p>
<p>8. The FFM report was discussed in the Human Rights Council and resolution S-12/1 
was adopted on 16 October 2009 by a vote of 25 in favour, 6 opposed, and 11 abstaining. 
On 15 October 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights told the 
Human Rights Council of her support for the FFM report and its recommendations, urging 
action to counter impunity by investigating and prosecuting those against whom substantial 
evidence existed to support war crimes accusations. Significantly, the High Commissioner 
asserted that holding war criminals accountable should not be considered as an obstacle to a 
peace process, which is the position taken by leading Member States of the United Nations 
in response to similar allegations regarding criminal charges directed at Sudanese officials 
responsible for Darfur.11 On 5 November 2009, the General Assembly adopted resolution 
64/10 by a vote of 144 in favour, 18 opposed, and 44 abstaining, giving Israel and Hamas 
three months to undertake independent, credible investigations, with provision for referral 
to the Security Council in the event that the parties do not carry out satisfactory self-
investigations. The Secretary-General has been tasked with the responsibility of monitoring 
the process and reporting to the General Assembly as to whether there has been 
compliance. To date there has been no appointment of a panel of international law experts 
to evaluate the assessment process as recommended by the FFM. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Criticisms of the report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission on 
the Gaza Conflict 
</b></p>
<p>9. Israel and the United States of America both levelled heavy criticism at the report, 
contending that it was biased and one-sided. On a more technical level there was a 
suggestion that United Nations rules on fact finding were not adhered to, as Professor 
Chinkin, a member of the mission, had already been on record as supporting the allegations 
prior to her appointment.12 Justice Goldstone explained that if the mission had been a 
strictly judicial undertaking, then Professor Chinkin would have been disqualified, but 
given the framework of inquiry, the qualifications for membership were competence and 
objectivity in the discharge of the inquiry.13 There were a variety of highly emotional 
attacks on the FFM report made by top Israeli political leaders, among other persons 
associated with the Government of Israel. The former Israeli Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Dore Gold, contended that the Goldstone report was the &#8220;most serious and vicious 
indictment of the State of Israel bearing the seal of the United Nations&#8221; since the anti-
Zionist resolution of 1975.14

<p>10. The more substantive argument against the approach taken in the report was that it 
neglected to take into account the actuality of a conflict in which Israel, as a democratic 
State, was entitled to defend itself by all effective means against Hamas, which is officially 
listed internationally as a terrorist organization. The implication of this argument seemed to 
be that the nature of the parties, in this instance, suspends the normal application of the 
rules of international humanitarian law. The representative of Israel to the General 
Assembly attacked the text of the report as disregarding Israel&#8217;s right to self-defence and 
that as such it amounted to a gift to terrorism. In fact, the FFM report affirmed Israel&#8217;s right 
to use force to defend itself, limiting its findings to the widely-supported conclusion that it 
was criminally unlawful to use force against the Gazan population as a whole, and also 
criminally unlawful to target civilians deliberately or to strike intentionally at protected 
buildings, including a variety of lethal attacks on United Nations facilities in Gaza that were 
lending shelter to Gazan civilians. There were also objections made by the United States 
representative to the call for the involvement of the Security Council or General Assembly 
in securing implementation of the report, claiming that the Human Rights Council was the 
appropriate forum. That argument was set forth despite &#8212; or possibly because of &#8212; the 
lack of any enforcement role or capability. Such efforts to steer subsequent action relating 
to the report away from implementation procedures seems designed to preserve Israeli 
impunity, and prompted the respected Gazan human rights leader and recipient of the 
Robert F. Kennedy Award, Raji Sourani, to remark: &#8220;We hope the Goldstone Report 
doesn&#8217;t end as piles of paper.&#8221;15 
</p>
<p><b> B. Objections from Palestinians to the report of the United Nations Fact-
finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
</b></p>
<p>11. Most attention has been paid to Israeli complaints directed at the FFM report. 
Virtually no attention has been paid to Palestinian complaints, and in truth, the 
representatives of the Palestinian Authority have devoted themselves to the implementation 
of the recommendations contained in the report without expressing objections. Yet there are 
objections that should be considered as part of a comprehensive effort to gain a clearer 
understanding of the issues, as well as of the debate.  
</p>
<p>12. First of all, the FFM report pays no attention to the surrounding circumstances of a 
temporary Israel-Hamas ceasefire that had been put in place in June 2008, with notable 
success in reducing cross-border violence, especially as regards rockets. It also ignores the 
provocative violence of Israel during the ceasefire, especially the incident of 4 November 
2008 in which Israel killed six Palestinians inside Gaza, as well as the frequent attempts by 
Hamas representatives to extend the ceasefire for as long as 10 years if Israel would lift the 
blockade and open the crossings. It is notable that these overtures by Hamas were made 
notwithstanding the failure by Israel to fulfil its commitments during the temporary 
ceasefire by easing, if not lifting, the blockade, which was in any event intrinsically 
unlawful under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
acknowledges that the number of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel declined by 80 per 
cent during the ceasefire.16

<p>GE.10-10260 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>13. From the perspective of international law, these elements raise serious questions as 
to whether Israel was entitled to act &#8220;defensively&#8221; under the circumstances, especially as it 
refused to explore the relevance of a diplomatic alternative to unbridled military force 
against an impoverished and crowded Gazan society, force that lacked clear military targets 
or even an opposing military. Also notable is the failure of the FFM report to take account 
of the refusal of Israel to allow civilians, including women and children, as well as the 
disabled, to exit Gaza and become refugees. This policy of locking civilians into a combat 
zone during sustained military attacks, denying them the right to seek refuge, is not 
explicitly prohibited in any existing human rights treaty or covenant, but seems clearly 
inconsistent with the prohibition of customary international law on cruel and inhumane 
tactics, and appears to be at odds with the fundamental duty of Israel, under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, to provide protection to an occupied population. Finally, it is notable 
that the FFM report devotes considerable sympathetic attention to the captivity of the single 
Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, but no comparable concern is expressed in the report for the 
thousands of Palestinians being held in detention (estimated to be between 8,000 and 
10,000, many without charge).  
</p><p>14. These serious gaps in the FFM report suggest that the contention of an anti-Israeli 
bias is without foundation. In fact, despite the refusal of Israel to cooperate with the 
Mission, the report indicates incredibly diligent efforts to meet with witnesses sympathetic 
to the arguments of the Israeli Government, including paying expenses associated with 
providing testimony received from the mayor of Sderot and from Israelis directly involved 
in Operation Cast Lead. Given the credibility of the members of the Mission, and in 
particular of Justice Goldstone himself, who insisted on including allegations of Palestinian 
war crimes within the FFM undertaking, it would seem irresponsible and frivolous to 
mount an argument against the findings and recommendations built around either the claim 
that anything emanating from the Human Rights Council is bound to be biased, or that the 
report, by finding the IDF responsible for the commission of war crimes, is by the very 
nature of its conclusions exhibiting an anti-Israeli, or in some dramatically-inflamed claims, 
even an anti-Semitic bias. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Intrinsic unlawfulness 
</b></p>
<p>15. The FFM report was based on a fact-finding mission. It was probably correct for this 
reason to overlook the underlying concern as to whether the rather restrictive legal framing 
of the FFM inquiry is suitable for this kind of asymmetric encounter, in which the 
Palestinian side lacked any weaponry to defend itself against a modern military machine 
and Israel defined its war aims as extending to the civilian infrastructure of the Gaza Strip. 
The ratio of casualties on both sides, even leaving aside the widespread trauma induced 
among the civilian population (estimated by some psychologists as being as high as 90 per 
cent), exhibits clearly the one-sided character of the encounter.17 In addition, the property 
damage caused by Operation Cast Lead was entirely inside Gaza.18 Is reliance on such a 
blunt instrument of destruction, particularly under circumstances of effective occupation, 
ever capable of being reconciled with the values and principles embodied in international 
humanitarian law? At the very least, the character of Operation Cast Lead suggests the 
importance of raising such a question within the setting of the Human Rights Council or, as

Cross to examine the topic.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Implementing the report of the United Nations Fact-finding Mission on 
the Gaza Conflict: universal jurisdiction 
</b>16. Among the most controversial, yet consequential, recommendations of the FFM 
report, is its endorsement of seeking accountability by way of &#8220;universal jurisdiction&#8221; 
through national judicial systems that contain such legislative authorization. The 
recommendation is formulated as follows: &#8220;In the context of increasing unwillingness on 
the part of Israel to open criminal investigations that comply with international standards, 
the Mission supports the reliance on universal jurisdiction as an avenue for States to 
investigate violations of the grave breach provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, 
prevent impunity and promote international accountability.&#8221;19 
</p>
<p>17. In addressing ordinary international crimes, such as piracy or counterfeiting, it has 
long been the case that national courts exercise their authority to attach legal consequences, 
including for crimes, to behaviour that takes place beyond territorial jurisdiction. What is 
new is the assertion of this authority in relation to war crimes, crimes against humanity, 
genocide and torture. Most countries do not have such an authorization or do not exercise 
their authority in relation to war crimes committed outside national territory. For those that 
do, it is possible to pursue allegations of war crimes in relation to those who acted on behalf 
of either Israel or Hamas during Operation Cast Lead, to arrest, indict, prosecute, and 
punish.  
</p>
<p>18. Although there are political ways to insulate potential defendants from such a legal 
process, in national courts reliance on universal jurisdiction is not subject to the sorts of 
constraints that block efforts to achieve accountability within the United Nations system. 
As indicated in the FFM recommendation, recourse to universal jurisdiction is only deemed 
appropriate in those situations where there are substantial grounds to believe that a 
government cannot or will not take advantage of its own prerogative (and duty) to 
investigate authoritatively on its own. That is, the first line of defence against impunity is 
through the governmental procedures of the State whose nationals are suspected to be 
perpetrators. Some Israeli journalists and public figures have called on the Israeli 
Government to fulfil this obligation, arguing that even if the FFM report can be set aside 
because of its supposed bias and the auspices under which it was produced, this does not 
mean that the IDF acted in full accordance with international humanitarian law during 
Operation Cast Lead.20  
</p>
<p>19. It has been reported that the Israeli Foreign Minister at the time of Operation Cast 
Lead and currently an opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, cancelled a visit to London in 
December 2009, because of the expectation that she would be arrested and charged with 
war crimes.21 A spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that 
an arrest warrant had been issued in Britain charging Ms. Livni with orchestrating the

<p>attacks in Gaza.22 Some confusion exists, as Ms. Livni&#8217;s office released a statement 
indicating that her trip was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict two weeks prior to her 
departure date.23 The issuance of this arrest warrant, although later withdrawn, has 
prompted efforts to amend British law as a matter of urgency to ensure that diplomatic 
contact with Israeli officials will not be threatened.24 
</p>
<p>20. It is important to remember that there have been other situations involving 
controversial foreign public figures in which concerns about their possible detention and 
arrest has arisen. The most famous British case involved the detention of the former 
Chilean head of State, Augusto Pinochet, in 1998 in response to a Spanish request for 
extradition to face torture and other criminal charges associated with his years as head of 
State in Chile. There have also been some recent problems faced by Israeli officials who 
were considering a visit to Britain. The Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, was granted 
immunity from the legal process by the British Government while on a visit to London to 
deliver a speech.25 In October 2009, Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Ya&#8217;alon, was apparently 
advised by the Israeli Government to cancel a speaking engagement in London because he 
might be arrested.26

</b></p>
<p>21. On 25 November 2009, Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed a 10-month freeze on 
settlement growth in the West Bank, which was approved by Israel&#8217;s security cabinet by a 
vote of 11&#8211;1.27 Mr. Netanyahu described the initiative as following from the urging of &#8220;our 
friends&#8221; that once Israel takes &#8220;the first meaningful step&#8221; towards peace &#8220;the Arab world 
and the Palestinians will follow&#8221;.28 The Prime Minister described the freeze as &#8220;a policy of 
restraint regarding the settlements which will include a suspension of new permits and new 
construction in Judea and Samaria&#8221; reassuring the settlers with &#8220;a promise to enable a 
normal life to continue for three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and

</p>
<p>States, but encountered criticism from both the Palestinian Authority and the leadership of 
the settler movement.30  
</p>
<p>22. Palestinian criticism centred on the fact that the freeze did not include public 
buildings in the West Bank settlements, several thousand residential units under 
construction, or any building in occupied East Jerusalem. The original call for a freeze, by 
President Barack Obama, did call for a temporary freeze to be extended to the whole of the 
OPT, including East Jerusalem. The disappointing response of the United States to the 
Israeli initiative was articulated by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: &#8220;Today&#8217;s 
announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward towards resolving the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can 
mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of 
an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps, and the Israeli 
goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent 
developments and meet Israeli security requirements&#8221;.31 One can only wonder about how 
big a departure from 1967 borders are envisaged to &#8220;reflect subsequent developments&#8221; and 
&#8220;meet Israeli security requirements&#8221;. Such an assertion by a senior official of the United 
States Government seems to be a virtual invitation to Israel to continue creating facts on the 
ground, presumably even if these facts occur in violation of international humanitarian law. 
It is also notable that, in his statement announcing the freeze, the Israeli Prime Minister 
twice used the settler terminology of Greater Israel, that is, &#8220;Judea and Samaria&#8221;, rather 
than the language adopted by the United Nations and the international community, that is, 
&#8220;the occupied West Bank&#8221; or simply &#8220;the West Bank&#8221;, which could be interpreted as 
staking an implicit claim for the eventual annexation of the West Bank, and not as a step 
towards the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.32  
</p>
<p>23. The settlement movement, represented by Danny Dayan, chair of the main settler 
body, defiantly expressed objections: &#8220;We are 300,000 citizens living in 150 communities. 
It is impossible to freeze us. I don&#8217;t know how it will happen, but we will break this 
freeze.&#8221;33 A variety of legal and non-violent settler initiatives have reinforced the Dayan 
statement, as well as an array of unlawful violent expressions of opposition to the freeze. 
The scope of the freeze is definitely less than meets the eye. Despite the freeze, 
construction will continue on 3,000 housing units in West Bank settlements for which 
permits have already been issued, and the freeze does not apply to public facilities such as 
schools, shops, meeting and administrative halls. It will, however, delay the construction of 
18,000 housing units for which permits have been issued, but will not be built during the 
freeze. In addition, it has been reported that hundreds of construction permits were obtained 
by various settlements just prior to the announcement of the freeze. A Likud minister, 
Benny Begin, has said that the settlement population could grow by 10,000 even during the 
period of the freeze. To further diminish the impact of the freeze, after a large settler 
demonstration in Tel Aviv, the Prime Minister offered settlements some new tax breaks and 
other economic benefits, as well as reassuring settlers that after the freeze period &#8220;my 
government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to 
construction&#8221;.34

<p>GE.10-10260 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>24. As has been pointed out many times in past reports of the Special Rapporteur and 
his predecessors, the settlements are all unlawful due to the prohibition in article 49 (6) of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention. This provision prohibits the transfer of the population of an 
occupying Power to the occupied territory, particularly in this case where Israeli withdrawal 
to the 1967 borders &#8212; as legally prescribed by Security Council resolution 242 &#8212; is 
gravely compromised by the extensive settlement development, its related network of 
Israeli-only roads, the ongoing construction of the separation barrier, and the sustained 
effort to establish favourable facts on the ground, which would ultimately be relied upon by 
Israel as the basis for negotiating some agreed outcome. Finally, there have been hints by 
Mr. Netanyahu that if the Palestinian Authority does not soon reciprocate to the extent of 
agreeing to start peace talks, Israel may suspend the partial freeze.35 Whether such a 
suspension would be significant beyond the atmospherics of pre-negotiation give and take 
is questionable, considering the large gap between what Israel seems to regard as its best 
offer and what the Palestinians are seeking as an acceptable outcome. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Israeli national regional priorities plan 
</b></p>
<p>25. There are further developments that suggest the real intentions of Israel with respect 
to the future of the settlements, and that undermine the credibility of the freeze as a prelude 
to the withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, at least from the territory outside the so-
called settlement blocs. In this respect, the 21 votes to 5 adoption by the full Israeli cabinet 
of a plan to fund settlements within the framework of &#8220;national regional priorities&#8221; to the 
extent of $30 million for about 90 settlements, homes for 110,000 existing settlers, is a 
disturbing development.36 Such investment would not make any sense if Israel is 
contemplating relinquishing substantial control over the West Bank, as these settlements 
are spread out all over the occupied territory. As the respected Palestinian negotiator, Saeb 
Erekat, has observed, these moves demonstrate that the freeze is &#8220;a sham&#8221;, and reveal 
Israel&#8217;s real goals.37 A close cabinet associate of Mr. Netanyahu, Yuval Steinitz, Minister of 
Finance, confirmed this concern by pointing out that the priorities plan shows that the 
Netanyahu Government continues to support the settlers despite the freeze.38 A strident 
critique has appeared in <i>Haaretz</i> under the byline of Zvi Bar&#8217;el: &#8220;The folly lies in how the 
new map renders void the decision to freeze construction in the settlements. &#8230; The 
objective, then, is to create housing opportunities in the settlements and increase the 
number of settlers, as well as other dubious facts on the ground.&#8221;39 What seems most 
destructive of prospects for the realization of the Palestinian right of self-determination is 
the treatment of former &#8220;fringe settlements&#8221; as if they were part of settlement blocs, making 
the national regional priorities plan a major expansion of permanent settlements. However, 
the Prime Minister reacted by declaring that nothing is permanent until final status talks 
have been concluded.40 The Palestinian Authority has reportedly considered responding by 
issuing a directive to prohibit Palestinians from working in West Bank settlements.41

<p><b> C. Attack on Hassan Hader Mosque 
</b></p>
<p>26. One of the worst incidents of settler violence following establishment of the freeze 
has been the burning of Hassan Hader Mosque in Yasuf village south of Nablus, on the 
night of 11 December 2009. The library of the mosque was burned, destroying copies of the 
Koran and other holy objects.42 Graffiti written on the walls confirmed that this was a so-
called &#8220;price-tag&#8221; punitive act against Palestinians, with the aim of offsetting the burdens 
imposed on settlers by the freeze. As a supporter of the arson, Rabbi Yosef Elitzur of a 
yeshiva in Yitzhar explained: &#8220;If the Jews don&#8217;t have quiet &#8211; the Arabs won&#8217;t have quiet 
either; if the Arabs win because of violence against Jews, Jews will win because of violence 
against Arabs.&#8221;43 By and large, however, Jewish leaders, including the Prime Minister and 
President, decried the crime against the mosque and called for an investigation and 
punishment of the arsonists.44  Many rabbis, including several from nearby settlements, 
have denounced the crime, calling it &#8220;a distortion of Jewish values&#8221; and proclaiming that 
religious sites are inviolate, being outside the domain of national struggle.45 Robert Serry, 
the United Nations Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process, made the following 
comment on the incident: &#8220;Desecrating a place of worship is deplorable. This attack is part 
of a broader and ongoing phenomenon of settler violence against Palestinian civilians, 
property, and land. Far too little is being done by Israeli authorities to enforce the rule of 
law on violent extremists, leading to a climate of impunity.&#8221;46 There have been dozens of 
other &#8220;price-tag&#8221; incidents occasioned by the freeze, involving settler violence against 
Palestinian property and agriculture, especially olive trees that the occupying Power is 
obligated to protect as a matter of the highest priority.47 Furthermore, there have been 
concerns related to insufficient protection from Israeli security forces and limited 
investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. East Jerusalem settlements 
</b></p>
<p>27. The initial observation is to take note of the original effort to persuade the 
Government of Israel to place a temporary ban on all settlement growth, including East 
Jerusalem. To include East Jerusalem would have demonstrated at least some openness to 
allowing the Palestinians to look forward to a state with Jerusalem as its capital. To persist 
with &#8220;natural growth,&#8221; especially when linked with the West Bank freeze, the accelerated 
rate of house demolitions and evictions and the denial of residency rights to Palestinians, 
seems to convey an unwillingness on the part of Israel to include any provision for a 
Palestinian capital in Jerusalem in a negotiated end to the conflict. This impression is

<p>strengthened by Prime Minister Netanyahu&#8217;s announcement that his office, as well as 
municipal authorities, would henceforth have to approve demolition orders.48 Of course, 
this could mean greater restraint in the future. Time will tell.  
</p>
<p>28. Israelis argue that the eviction of Palestinian occupants was to restore the homes of 
Jews that had been seized during the period 1948&#8211;1967 when East Jerusalem was occupied 
and administered by Jordan. Yet in 2009 more Palestinians were stripped of their residency 
rights than in any year between 1967 and 2007. In the course of the year, according to 
Israeli figures, 4,577 Palestinians were deprived of residency status.49 Palestinians interpret 
this pattern as an effort to alter the demographic balance in East Jerusalem so as to 
strengthen Israeli claims to the whole of Jerusalem. There are now approximately 200,000 
Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem, which brings the respective populations in Jerusalem to 
about 65 per cent Jewish (500,000) as compared to 35 per cent Palestinian (250,000). 
Attention was given to a statement made by European Union (EU) Foreign Ministers on the 
Middle East peace process in early December, especially the paragraph pertaining to East 
Jerusalem. A leaked early draft prepared by Sweden definitely supported the idea of East 
Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state, which upset the Government of 
Israel.50 After intense lobbying the final EU ministerial statement was much more 
equivocal, concluding in vague general terms: &#8220;If there is to be genuine peace, a way must 
be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of two 
states.&#8221;51 The statement was much more supportive of the Palestinians in relation to 
demolitions and evictions, which were condemned as violations of Palestinian rights under 
occupation and as Israeli violations of international law. The Human Rights Council 
possesses the authority to insist on Israel ending its occupation of the entire Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, both as the basis for a just, lasting, and 
comprehensive peace and in view of the persistent failure of Israel to uphold its legal duties 
as the occupying Power, as these are specified by international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Demonstrations against the wall in the West Bank </b></p>
<p>29. As earlier reports have demonstrated, the construction of the separation wall on 
occupied Palestinian territory that has been continuing since 2002 is one of the clearest 
examples of the unlawful character of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, in direct 
violation of several fundamental Palestinian human rights, including the right of self-
determination. This assessment has been confirmed by a 14&#8211;1 vote of the International 
Court of Justice in an Advisory Opinion, which called upon Israel to dismantle the wall and 
pay reparations to Palestinians who have been harmed by its construction.52 These 
conclusions were accepted by an overwhelming vote of the General Assembly, and rejected 
without qualification by Israel.53 Not surprisingly, Palestinian residents of the West Bank

</p>
<p>most directly affected by the wall have tried to interfere with and object to, and to the 
extent possible, prevent its construction, relying almost totally on non-violent tactics. These 
acts of resistance are continuing at present. Israel has been charged with use of excessive 
force, causing several deaths and injuries in dealing with anti-wall demonstrations and 
activists, among whom are Palestinians, Israelis and peace activists from foreign countries. 
Witnesses and human rights groups have reported use of live ammunition on several 
occasions, as well as tear gas and rubber bullets.54 Weekly demonstrations continue at the 
wall sites in the Palestinian villages of Bi&#8217;lin and Ni&#8217;lin.55 In December 2009, Abdallah 
Abu Ramah, high school teacher and coordinator of Bil&#8217;in Popular Committee, was arrested 
in his home at 2 a.m. in the presence of his wife and children, while the house was 
surrounded by seven military jeeps, surely a terrifying and humiliating experience that 
served no security purpose.56 Mr. Abu Ramah was charged with the unlawful possession of 
arms which, incredibly, turned out to be a collection of used Israeli tear gas canisters that 
had been shot by the Israeli security forces at the protestors. Similarly, the internationally 
respected human rights figure, leader of the Stop the Wall Coalition and known for his 
advocacy of non-violent tactics, Jamal Juma, was arrested on 16 December 2009 and 
charged with the crime of &#8220;incitement&#8221;. The manifest absurdity of such charges strongly 
suggests that Israeli intention is to demoralize the anti-wall campaign by criminalizing the 
non-violent human rights activism, a pattern that should be a matter of grave concern to the 
Human Rights Council. Additional night raids on anti-wall activists have been carried out 
by Israeli security forces in Nablus on several recent occasions.57

<p><b> V. The blockade of Gaza 
</b>30. One year after Operation Cast Lead, the humanitarian situation in Gaza not only 
remains deplorable, but has worsened. The total blockade of the Gaza Strip remains in full 
effect, having lasted now for nearly three years, contributing to deteriorating physical and 
mental health for 1.5 million persons. A series of recent deaths from swine flu have caused 
fears of an onslaught of the disease against a population whose resistance has been reduced 
due to an inadequate diet and medical care, and otherwise living under constant threat.58 
Further, the sanitation system continues to deteriorate, not only adding to the hazards of life 
in Gaza, but resulting in the dumping of 40&#8211;50 million litres per day of partially treated or 
untreated sewage into the Mediterranean Sea, as well as contaminating parts of the water 
supply in Gaza and endangering the fish in coastal waters.59 After the end of hostilities in 
Gaza last January, States gathered at a donor conference in Sharm el-Sheikh pledged $4.5 
billion in funds for the reconstruction of Gaza. However, Israel has extended its blockade to 
include virtually all building materials, thereby preventing efforts to rectify the extensive 
damage wrought by Operation Cast Lead.

increase to 35 per cent during the coming winter months, leaving residents without 
electricity for 18&#8211;32 hours per week. Such shortages, arising in part from restrictions on the 
availability of spare parts for repair, are an aspect of the unlawful collective punishment 
associated with the blockade. The shortage of cooking fuel and electricity has also made it 
almost impossible for bakeries, factories, and greenhouses to operate normally, worsening 
conditions of poverty and unemployment.61

consisting of a specially dense form of steel that is resistant to explosions and cannot be cut 
or melted. The apparent purpose of the fence is to supplement the network of censors 
deployed along the border to detect noise and activity, and thereby reduce, if not eliminate, 
smuggling of goods and weapons into Gaza by way of an estimated 1,000 tunnels.62 While 
there may be some genuine Israeli concern regarding weapons smuggling, the tunnels serve 
as a humanitarian lifeline due to the severity and long duration of the Israeli blockade of 
goods needed for normal living. As is understandable for a society facing harsh externally 
imposed economic coercion, an alternative economy has emerged in the Gaza Strip, 
producing a vibrant black market. In light of this, the destruction and disruption of the 
tunnels would make life even more unbearable for the population of Gaza.  
</p>
<p>33. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has started to build mud 
houses for those Palestinians made homeless by the attacks a year ago; the first mud house 
was recently completed, and the announced plan is to build 120 mud houses at a cost of 
$10,000 each.63 The houses take three months to build and are a direct response to the 
absence of blockaded building materials such as cement, glass, and steel. This gesture of 
relief is welcome, but it is pathetically small in relation to the thousands made homeless by 
Operation Cast Lead.  
</p>
<p>34. Many world leaders, including Tony Blair, the envoy of the Quartet, and President 
Barack Obama, as well as the General Assembly, have called upon Israel to lift the 
blockade, open the crossings, and end this regime of collective punishment afflicting the 
entire population of the Gaza Strip, but so far to no avail. Israeli defiance of these calls to 
end the blockade has been consistently ignored, creating a crisis of confidence in the 
sincerity and true intentions of the international community. Even the persistent rumours of 
an impending prisoner swap, in which Gilad Shalit would be released along with many 
hundred Palestinian prisoners, do not promise an end to the blockade.64 Nor has the absence 
of Israeli casualties due to rocket attacks post Operation Cast Lead, or the low incidence of 
such attacks, produced any change. In the face of these tremendous challenges, it is Gazan 
civil society that has demonstrated the most consistent resolve against the blockade. Several 
convoys of activists bringing medical supplies and food have attempted to cross into Gaza 
from Egypt, and have encountered difficulties when seeking transit permission from Cairo. 
Such initiatives are symbolic expressions of commitment to wage a legitimacy war on 
behalf of the Palestinians so long as their basic rights are being suppressed and their 
collective well-being subject to extraordinary stress. These initiatives also serve to expose

<p>the limited capacity of and effort by the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities to

more than 42 years. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The plight of Palestinian refugees 
</b></p>
<p>35. An important and unwelcome change in the overall posture of the Palestine/Israel 
conflict is the decreasing attention, in relevant diplomatic and human rights discourse, 
devoted to the plight of Palestinian refugees, in particular regarding the extent to which 
their rights as refugees should be fulfilled. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is 
concerned only with the OPT, discussion will necessarily be limited. Yet the wider 
implications for the total Palestinian refugee population of over 4 million should not be 
ignored. The underlying question is whether the refugees living in Gaza and the West Bank 
enjoy the right of return under international law if they were forced out or fled in 1948. The 
fundamental text is General Assembly resolution 194 (III) adopted on 11 December 1948, 
and especially paragraph 11: &#8220;Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes 
and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest 
practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing 
not to return ...&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>36. By its nature a General Assembly resolution has no independent binding authority, 
and does not create legal obligations. Yet in this case it seemed to express a consensus 
widely shared at the time by governments as to the rights of the parties, and thus deserving 
of implementation. This language of paragraph 11 has been generally interpreted as 
conferring an unconditional right of repatriation, in accordance with customary 
international law, although implementation has been inconsistent due to the control 
exercised by sovereign States over who may enter their territory. More carefully 
considered, the second part of the paragraph looks towards implementation, instructing the 
Conciliation Commission (at the time representing the United Nations in trying to resolve 
the conflict) &#8220;to facilitate the repatriation, resettlement and economic and social 
rehabilitation of the refugees ...&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>37  Israel has over the years used its diplomatic muscle to minimize Palestinian 
expectations with regard to exercising a right of return. However, up to and including the 
1967 War the refugee issue remained salient. The canonical Security Council resolution 
242 unanimously called in 1967 for &#8220;a just settlement of the refugee problem&#8221; as an 
essential element in its conception of peace, but the shift from the language of paragraph 11 
of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) represents a partial retreat as it leaves open the 
question of what would constitute &#8220;a just settlement&#8221; and who would determine what is 
&#8220;just&#8221;. It refers not to the rights of refugees but to &#8220;the refugee problem&#8221;. Fast forward to 
2009, and there is little discussion of the current plight of the refugees living for 
generations in miserable conditions in Gaza and the West Bank. The Special Rapporteur 
shares the assessment recently made by Karen AbuZayd, the Commissioner-General of 
UNRWA, that for these refugee issues to remain unresolved 60 years after the 
dispossession and displacement of several hundred thousand Palestinians is unacceptable. 
In her words the acknowledgement of &#8220;the 60-year-old injustice&#8221; would be &#8220;a first step 
towards addressing the consequences of that injustice&#8221;.65 Ms. AbuZayd movingly expresses 
her concern in the form of an appeal: &#8220;As forced displacements continue across the West 
Bank, as Palestinians are evicted from their homes in East Jerusalem, I ask a simple

<p>question. Is it not time for those engaged in the peace process to muster the will and the 
courage to address the Palestine refugee question.&#8221;66  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Boycotts, divestments and sanctions 
</b></p>
<p>38. Operation Cast Lead shocked the conscience of humanity, giving rise to feelings of 
solidarity around the world with the ordeal and struggle of the Palestinian people. These 
feelings were intensified by the awareness that neither the neighbouring States nor the 
United Nations, nor its most powerful Member States, were willing or able to protect the 
Palestinian people and uphold their rights. The spectacle of a people under siege, as has 
been the case now for over 30 months in the Gaza Strip, has deepened this sense that there 
exists some responsibility for people everywhere to take appropriate, non-violent action. 
Civil society&#8217;s global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, aimed at 
bringing non-violent economic and social pressure to bear to end the Israeli occupation, is 
the outgrowth of these sentiments, and it has been expanding at a rapid rate during the last 
few years. This sense of an anti-occupation movement of worldwide scope has come to 
resemble in many respects the anti-apartheid movement that made important contributions 
to the transformation of the political climate in South Africa in the late 1980s.  
</p>
<p>39. The boycott dimension of BDS takes many forms. For example, the boycott in 
Europe of products produced by Israeli settlements; Britain has now allowed stores to put 
stickers on food and other products reading &#8220;Israeli settlement produce&#8221;. Soccer games and 
other athletic events involving Israel have been cancelled or protests mounted. Similar 
efforts have been made with respect to academic and cultural interaction. Artists and 
performers have been asked to refuse invitations from Israel, or at least to contribute the 
proceeds of a performance to Palestinian relief. Stores and companies around the world 
have been boycotted based on their dealings for profit in the OPT. On the divestment front, 
contracts have been terminated or bids not made. In addition, a growing number of 
churches and universities are extending their efforts to invest in a spirit of social 
responsibility, and are excluding companies that are perceived to be profiting from the 
Israeli occupation. Individuals and NGOs have come out in support of BDS in increasing 
numbers. It is a central battleground in the legitimacy war being waged by and on behalf of 
Palestinians. It is also making use of persuasive and coercive non-violent means to secure 
the human rights of Palestinians living under oppressive and unlawful conditions of 
occupation that the actions of diplomacy or the authority of the organized international 
community seem unable to correct. BDS represents the mobilized efforts of global civil 
society to replace a regime of force with the rule of law in relation to the OPT.
