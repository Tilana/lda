<p><b>8/&#8230;  Human rights and extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
international covenants on human rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying 
freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone 
may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her civil and political 
rights, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council and 5/2 
on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 18 June 2007, and 
stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in accordance with these 
resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by Heads of State and 
Government on the occasion of the Millennium Summit, and their commitment to eradicate 
extreme poverty and to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world&#8217;s people who live in extreme 
poverty,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the outcomes of the World Summit for Social Development and the 
twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in its resolution adopted in December 2007, the General Assembly 
proclaimed the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017),  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the resolutions of the General Assembly on human rights and extreme 
poverty and the importance they attach to giving persons living in extreme poverty the 
wherewithal to organize and participate in all aspects of political, economic and social life,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all other previous resolutions on the issue of human rights and extreme poverty 
adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, as well as its own 
relevant resolutions, including Council resolutions 2/2 and 7/27, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> that, after the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of 
Poverty (1997-2006), and midway to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals target date, while 
there has been progress in reducing poverty in some regions, this progress has been uneven and 
that the number of people living in poverty in some countries continues to increase, with women 
and children constituting the majority of the most affected groups, especially in the least 
developed countries and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of 
their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and manifestations are 
particularly severe in developing countries,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the priority and urgency given by the Heads of State and Government to the 
eradication of poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences 
and summits in the economic and social fields,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the fight against extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the 
international community,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to better understand the causes and consequences of extreme poverty,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> <i>also</i> that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible and 
interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight 
extreme poverty, at the local and national levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> its gratitude to the former independent expert on the question of human rights 
and extreme poverty for the important work accomplished in the discharge of his mandate, and 
conscious of the necessity to continue this work, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Acknowledges </i>the report of the independent expert on extreme poverty 
(A/HRC/7/15), and in particular the proposed definition of extreme poverty as the combination 
of income poverty, human development poverty and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the independent expert on extreme poverty for a 
period of three years, in order to, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Further examine the relationship between extreme poverty and impediments to the 
enjoyment of human rights, and in particular the factors that perpetuate extreme poverty, 
including institutional impediments to its eradication;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Identify, including in cooperation with international financial organizations, the most 
efficient measures taken at the national, regional and international levels to promote the full 
enjoyment of human rights of persons living in extreme poverty;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Study the various possible modalities of the contribution that people living in 
extreme poverty can make to the definition of measures to promote the full enjoyment of their 
human rights;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Develop cooperation with other United Nations bodies dealing with human rights 
and that are also active in the area of the fight against extreme poverty; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Participate in the assessment of the implementation of the Second United Nations 
Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, the internationally agreed goals contained in the 
Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus (A/CONF.198/11, chap. I, resolution 1, 
annex), adopted by the International Conference on Financing for Development, in March 2002, 
and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Work on the impact of discrimination on extreme poverty, bearing in mind the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in September 2001 by the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Pay particular attention to the situation and empowerment of women in extreme 
poverty, applying a gender perspective in his or her work;  
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) Pay particular attention to children living in extreme poverty, as well as to the most 
vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities who live in extreme poverty; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) Submit proposals that could contribute to the realization of Millennium Development 
Goals, and in particular of goal 1, which consists in the halving by 2015 the proportion of people 
living in extreme poverty, taking into account the role of international assistance and cooperation 
in reinforcing national actions to reduce extreme poverty;  
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) Continue participating in and contributing to relevant international conferences and 
events with the aim of promoting the reduction of extreme poverty;  
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
give high priority to the question of the relationship between extreme poverty and human rights 
and invites it to pursue further work in this area, integrating and cooperating fully with the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>independent expert in the various activities, notably the Social Forum and the consultation on the 
draft guiding principles on extreme poverty, and to provide all necessary human and financial 
resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the independent expert;  
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Requests</i> the independent expert to submit an annual report on the implementation of 
the present resolution to the General Assembly and the Council, in accordance with their 
programme of work;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the independent expert in 
his or her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit their 
countries, to enable him or her to fulfil his or her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, treaty bodies and 
civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the private sector, to 
cooperate fully with the independent expert in the fulfilment of his or her mandate;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty, in accordance with its programme of work.
