Lender Presentation August 10, 2016
Exhibit 99.1
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This presentation includes certain forward-looking statements and projections of EP Energy LLC (“EP Energy” or
the “Company”). EP Energy has made every reasonable effort to ensure that the information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are based are current,
reasonable, and complete. However, a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed,
including, without limitation, the volatility of and current sustained low oil, natural gas, and NGL prices; the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; changes in
commodity prices and basis differentials for oil and natural gas; EP Energy’s ability to meet production volume targets; the uncertainty of estimating proved reserves and unproved
resources; the future level of service and capital costs; the availability and cost of financing to fund future exploration and production operations; the success of drilling programs
with regard to proved undeveloped reserves and unproved resources; EP Energy’s ability to comply with the covenants in various financing documents; EP Energy’s ability to
obtain necessary governmental approvals for proposed E&P projects and to successfully construct and operate such projects; actions by the credit rating agencies; credit and
performance risks of EP Energy’s lenders, trading counterparties, customers, vendors, suppliers, and third party operators; general economic and weather conditions in
geographic regions or markets served by EP Energy, or where operations of EP Energy are located, including the risk of a global recession and negative impact on oil and natural
gas demand; the uncertainties associated with governmental regulation, including any potential changes in federal and state tax laws and regulation; competition; and other risk
factors described below and in EP Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. EP Energy has significant debt and debt service obligations,
which requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. In addition, the debt levels exposes it to more liquidity, breach of covenants and default risks, especially during times of
financial volatility and reduced commodity prices, and could reduce its flexibility to compete on future acquisitions. EP Energy has made and may continue to make acquisitions,
however, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions EP Energy finds acceptable or at all. Any acquisition, including any completed
or future acquisition, involves potential risks that could significantly impair EP Energy’s ability to manage its business, complete or effectively integrate acquisitions and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The proposed transaction and the new term loans could be subject to bankruptcy related
risks. For example, in any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the borrower or the guarantors, it is possible that parties could assert that the new term loans are under-
collateralized and the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such term loans would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim based on the
value of the collateral, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In addition, a court could void the liens securing the new term
loans under fraudulent transfer laws and any future pledge of collateral might be avoidable in bankruptcy. While EP Energy makes these statements and projections in good faith,
neither EP Energy nor its management can guarantee that anticipated future results will be achieved. Reference must be made to those filings for additional important factors that
may affect actual results. EP Energy assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein or any other forward-looking statements
made by EP Energy, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. This presentation presents certain production and reserves-related information on an
"equivalency" basis. Equivalent volumes are computed with natural gas converted to barrels at a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl. These conversions are based on energy equivalency
conversion methods primarily applicable at the burner tip and do not represent value equivalencies at the wellhead. Although these conversion factors are industry accepted
norms, they are not reflective of price or market value differentials between product types.
Authorization Letter Ladies and Gentlemen: We refer to (i) the proposed amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Term Loan Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2012 among EP
Energy LLC (the “Company”), the various lenders party thereto from time to time and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the new credit agreement to be entered into by
the Company (the “New Credit Agreement”, and, together with Amendment, the “Transaction Documents”), in each case that the arrangers are arranging at our request and (ii)
the lender presentation forwarded herewith (the “Lender Presentation”, and together with the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2016 and all
other public filings by the Company since February 22, 2016, the "Information Package”). We have reviewed or participated in preparing the Lender Presentation and the
information contained therein. The Company has reviewed the information contained in the Information Package and represents and warrants that the information contained in
the Information Package does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading. Any management projections or forward-looking statements included in the Information Package
are based on assumptions and estimates developed by management of the Company in good faith and management believes such assumptions and estimates to be reasonable
as of the date of the Information Package. Whether or not such projections or forward looking statements are in fact achieved will depend upon future events some of which are
not within the control of the Company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projections and such variations may be material. The projections included in the Information
Package should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or its management that the projected results will be achieved. The Company represents and warrants that
the information contained in the Lender Presentation is either publicly available information or not material information (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect
to the Company or its securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws. We request that the arrangers distribute the Lender Presentation to such financial
institutions as the arrangers may deem appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. We agree that we will rely on, and that the
arrangers are authorized to rely on, the undertakings, acknowledgments and agreements of recipients of the Lender Presentation. Yours sincerely, /s/____________________

Q&A
Non-GAAP PV-10 Reconciliation Non-GAAP Term and Reconciliation The PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves is a non-GAAP measure derived from the standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. It differs from our standardized measure
as we used forward pricing versus average historical pricing and used more recent well cost data than is typically used in the standardized measure. In addition, the standardized
measure reflects discounted future income taxes related to our operations. We believe that the presentation of the PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves is useful to investors
because it provides a better indication of the value of the collateral securing the New Term Loans. We feel this is important information for the lenders in their evaluation of the
exchange offer. We used current costs and forward strip prices since both are better market indicators for calculating future revenues and costs of developing our proved
reserves. Additionally, we believe that the PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves presents (i) the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties regardless of
tax structure, (ii) the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies, and (iii) the measure we use when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil
and natural gas properties. The PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not present the fair value of our oil,
natural gas and NGLs reserves. Pricing used to calculate the PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves is based on NYMEX strip prices as of July 15, 2016. Pricing used to calculate
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is based on SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10 as amended, using the 12-month average price calculated as the
unweighted arithmetic average of the spot price on the first day of each month preceding the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. The first day 12-month
average price used to estimate our proved reserves at June 30, 2016 was $43.12 per barrel of oil (WTI) and $2.24 per MMBtu for natural gas (Henry Hub). The first day 12-month
average price used to estimate our proved reserves at December 31, 2015 was $50.28 per barrel of oil (WTI) and $2.49 per MMBtu for natural gas (Henry Hub). (1) Assumption
differences relate to the utilization of NYMEX strip prices as of July 15, 2016 as well as current well cost data. ($ in millions) PV-10 of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves $3,816 Less:
