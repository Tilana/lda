<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifth 
session from 4 to 15 May 2009. The review of Viet Nam was held at the 10th meeting on 8 
May 2009. The delegation of Viet Nam was headed by H.E. Pham Binh Minh, First Vice-
Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its meeting held on 12 May 2009, the Working Group 
adopted the present report on Viet Nam.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Viet Nam: Burkina Faso, Canada and Japan. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Viet Nam: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/3).  
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Canada, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Viet Nam through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. H.E. Pham Binh Minh, First Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that Viet Nam 
attaches importance to the UPR national report, regarding it as a United Nations member&#8217;s 
obligation and an opportunity for comprehensive and participatory review of its human 
rights achievements and future measures. A special task force composed of members from 
more than 20 national legislative, judiciary and administrative departments was established. 
To make the report was as comprehensive, objective and authoritative as possible, 
consultations were held with dozen of NGOs and academic institutions. Viet Nam has also 
learnt from international experience and received cooperation from international partners in 
many ways. The UPR report and nearly 100 pages of annexes provide detailed information 
on the human rights implementation.  
</p>
<p>6. Viet Nam pursues a consistent policy of respecting and ensuring human rights as 
enshrined in its Constitution. This policy stems from the recognition that human rights are 
the universal values of mankind, including the right to national self-determination which is 
upheld in today&#8217;s core human rights conventions.  
</p>
<p>7. The policy is also rooted in Viet Nam&#8217;s thousands of years of history and culture. 
Fifty-four ethnic groups have been living together in peace on the Vietnamese soil without 
any ethnic conflict. The Vietnamese people love peace and humane values while staying 
open to diversity and outside values, including the major religions like Buddhism and 
Christianity that have come to thrive in Viet Nam since very early. The will of Viet Nam 
also represents the aspirations of the Vietnamese people throughout the colonial rule that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/11</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.09-16382 
</p>
<p>deprived them of the most fundamental freedoms and the war of national defence following 
Viet Nam&#8217;s regained independence in 1945.  
</p>
<p>8. The people&#8217;s support stands behind the success of the independent Viet Nam in 
overcoming enormous ordeals and hardships and in leading the comprehensive renewal 
process recognized by the international community. This support indeed demonstrates the 
enjoyment by the people of their human rights.  
</p><p>9. Viet Nam attaches great importance to building a comprehensive legal system to 
guarantee and promote human rights. About 13,000 laws and by-laws have been enacted or 
revised since 1986. Draft laws and ordinances of the National Assembly are subjected to 
people&#8217;s comments via the mass media. The Constitution and legal normative documents 
stipulate the rights and measures to guarantee civil and political human rights in Viet Nam 
in conformity with international treaties. Viet Nam&#8217;s efforts in this regard have been 
commended by the United Nations and international partners. 
</p>
<p>10. The monitoring and supervising system and the law enforcement system in Viet 
Nam, which are constantly reformed in accordance with the principle of a State ruled by 
law, encompass all State agencies and various organizations and people&#8217;s participation. The 
National Assembly supervises all activities of the State. All its Q&amp;A sessions with 
Government members are broadcast live.  
</p>
<p>11. The Master Plan on Administrative Reform 2001&#8211;2010 is aimed at making the 
administrative system cleaner, stronger, more democratic, professional, modern and 
effective in the people&#8217;s interest. All Government agencies have their own inspecting 
mechanism in their respective areas of responsibility. The judicial system serves as the 
means for protection of justice and human rights, for enforcement of the law and the fight 
against crimes and law violations. 
</p>
<p>12. Various organizations, the mass media and citizens&#8217; indirect and direct participation 
through their representative bodies or legal mechanisms are important components of the 
machinery of human rights protection. The people take voluntary and active part in running 
for election, nominating and voting representatives from different social strata into the 
governing bodies at all levels. Many raise their concerns and questions to their 
representatives related to the functioning of the State agencies. Q&amp;A sessions of the 
National Assembly are closely watched by the people. Viet Nam has about 380 nationwide 
mass associations and numerous associations at the local and grassroots levels. There are 18 
nationwide sectoral trade unions and 6,020 local trade unions. Some 600 foreign NGOs 
operate in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>13. The mass media have been growing rapidly in diverse forms and with rich content, 
becoming important forums for the people and contributing actively to the process of 
renewal, the fight against corruption and other vices. The number of print press agencies 
and publications now reach 700 and 850 respectively, tripling the 1990 figure. Over 15,000 
licensed journalists are working in Viet Nam. Regular Internet users account for nearly 24 
per cent of the population, which is higher than the Asian average of 18 per cent. Presently 
95 per cent communes of extreme difficulties have radio stations, including those 
broadcasting in ethnic minority languages. According to a recent ITU report, Viet Nam was 
among the top 10 countries in 2002&#8211;2007 in terms of the growth rate of IT coverage, usage 
and skills. 
</p>
<p>14. Religious and belief activities are now a vibrant social feature. There are over 20 
million followers of different religions. Over 80 per cent of the population has a belief. The 
United Nations Day of Vesak was organized in Hanoi in 2008 with the participation of 
Buddhists and dignitaries from 74 countries and territories. Viet Nam will host the World 
Buddhist Summit in 2010. A Holy See delegation comes to Viet Nam annually to exchange </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/11</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16382 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>views on religious issues of mutual interest and acknowledges positive developments in the 
life of catholic community.  
</p>
<p>15. Members of ethnic minorities participate in an increasingly equal manner in the 
country&#8217;s socio-political life. The twelfth National Assembly (2007&#8211;2011) includes 87 
deputies of ethnic minorities, accounting for nearly 18 per cent of all deputies. Ethnic 
minority members are present in the People&#8217;s Council at provincial, district and communal 
levels and assume high positions, including the highest portfolio, in State agencies and 
varied organizations.  
</p>
<p>16. Viet Nam has attained significant achievements in promoting women&#8217;s rights as 
measured by CEDAW indicators. It has been rated by the World Bank and Asian 
Development Bank as the Asian country most rapidly narrowing the gender gap in the past 
20 years. Vulnerable groups, such as children and people with disabilities, receive special 
attention from the State, society and family. Children and people with disabilities have been 
able to enjoy better care and protection in various fields and to express views on issues of 
interest to them in line with CRC and CPD. Viet Nam was the second country in the world 
and the first in Asia to sign CRC and it signed CRPD.  
</p>
<p>17. Protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights in Viet Nam have 
made significant progress. Efforts to deal with social problems have brought about tangible, 
positive changes. People&#8217;s cultural life is advanced. After 20 years of renewal, per capita 
income has increased five-fold and the percentage of households living under the national 
poverty line decreased from about 60 per cent to 13 per cent. Viet Nam has been recognized 
by the United Nations and many development partners as one of the countries with the most 
impressive achievements in poverty reduction. As reported by the United Nations, Viet 
Nam had attained or surpassed many of the MDGs and was capable of attaining them all by 
</p><p>2015. 
</p>
<p>18. The percentage of poor ethnic minority households has been reduced by 3 to 5 per 
cent per year; 90 to 95 per cent of school-age children are enrolled and all districts have 
secondary schools. Thirty ethnic minority groups have their own languages and scripts and 
ethnic minority languages are used in primary and secondary-level textbooks and television 
and radio programmes for ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>19. The UPR report of Viet Nam has described in detail lessons drawn from 
achievements in protecting and promoting human rights. These include placement of the 
human being at the centre of development, the close relationship between protection of 
human rights and national independence and sovereignty, the importance of maintaining 
political stability, promoting economic development in parallel with expanding social 
welfare, and enhancing the people&#8217;s awareness of and capacity to exercise their rights. 
</p>
<p>20. These accomplishments also derive from Viet Nam&#8217;s foreign policy of openness and 
increasingly active participation in regional and international human rights mechanisms and 
activities, including those of the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the 
Asia-Europe Meeting. Viet Nam is now working with other countries in the region to 
establish a human rights body of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Viet Nam also has technical cooperation and human rights dialogues with Australia, 
Norway, Switzerland, the United States, the European Union and other countries and 
international organizations.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of special rapporteurs have visited Viet Nam and the Government has 
recently extended invitations to five other special procedures to visit.  
</p>
<p>22. Viet Nam is conscious of the shortcomings and difficulties and challenges to be 
addressed. The legal system of Viet Nam still lacks coherence while remaining overlapped 
and even contradictory in some areas. The development of the legal system has not matched </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/11</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.09-16382 
</p>
<p>the changes in life, leading to misinterpretation and difficulties in enforcement, affecting 
efforts to ensure constitutionality, feasibility and transparency. The effectiveness of 
information provision, education and awareness enhancement in relation to the law remains 
limited. The system of law enforcement needs to be strengthened. A segment of public 
servants remain unfamiliar with the human rights treaties to which Viet Nam is party and 
occasionally have insufficient knowledge of government policies and the law.  
</p>
<p>23. These shortcomings have objective causes, including the fact that Viet Nam remains 
a poor country that has to cope with the aftermaths of war, for example by supporting the 
many victims of bombs, mines and Agent Orange/dioxin. The population is scattered 
throughout the country, including in remote and harsh areas with varying languages, 
customs and habits. The international environment with major economic upheavals, the 
outbreak of pandemics, environmental degradation and transnational crimes, is another 
factor. Viet Nam is still victim of hostile activities like terrorism, sabotage, and attempts to 
destabilize the country and infringe upon national security and territorial integrity. There 
are subjective causes, namely the slow pace of change in some policy areas, the poor 
quality of implementation and the shortcomings of institutional and human capacity. 
</p>
<p>24. A number of priorities were identified in the UPR national report of Viet Nam: 
continue to attach importance to poverty reduction, health care, development of the social 
safety net and human resources, expansion and improvement of the education and training 
system and effective implementation of the master plan for public administration reform, 
the strategy for the development of the legal system and the judicial reform strategy; take 
specific steps to realize these priorities; accede to additional human rights treaties; and 
strengthen cooperation with regional and international human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>25. Viet Nam is committed to building a strong country with prosperous people and a 
just, democratic and advanced society, to protecting and promoting democracy and human 
rights as both the goal and the driving force of renewal. 
</p>
<p>26. Viet Nam hopes that the working session will be a manifestation of cooperation and 
constructive dialogue, in line with the objectives for which the UPR mechanism was 
created by United Nations member States to achieve. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 60 delegations. Additional 
statements by 16 delegations which could not be delivered during the dialogue due to time 
constraints are posted on the UPR extranet when available.* A number of delegations 
praised the national consultation held for the preparation of the UPR report and the 
comprehensive presentation. Reference was made to Viet Nam&#8217;s struggle for national 
independence in the context of the realization of the right to self-determination. Support 
was expressed for ongoing reforms in various areas, including the judicial reform with 
particular reference to the Doi Moi policy. A number of delegations praised Viet Nam&#8217;s 
rapid economic growth and social development with particular emphasis on its effective 
poverty reduction strategies, and it was highlighted that Viet Nam was one of the first 
countries to fulfil MDG 1 (poverty reduction). Significant achievements in economic, social 
and cultural rights were highlighted. Viet Nam was praised for its improvements in basic 
education, the right to health, including reduction of infant mortality, the right to food and 
the right to education. Positive remarks were made on progress in gender equality,

instruments.  
</p>
<p>28. Noting the commitment to promoting the right to self-determination, Algeria 
recommended (a) continuing to uphold the promotion of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, particularly for the exercise by people under foreign occupation to their right to 
self-determination. Praising the poverty reduction strategy, Algeria recommended (b) 
continuing to implement the strategy to further lower the rate of poverty, and (c) sharing 
best practices and experience in this field with interested countries, inter alia by 
contributing actively to strengthening South-South cooperation in this regard , and (d) 
continuing to implement credit-for-jobs projects and to promote labour market 
development. Algeria recommended that Viet Nam (f) give due attention to reconciling the 
universal values of human rights with its specific circumstances, and (e) continue fulfilling 
its obligations under the international treaties to which it is a party and consider acceding to 
CAT.  
</p>
<p>29. Venezuela noted the great efforts to overcome the devastation suffered in the 
struggle for national liberation. It appreciated the effective reduction of the poverty rate 
from 58.1 per cent in the 1990s to 13.8 per cent in 2008. In the framework of the right to 
development, it recommended that Viet Nam share with other countries its successes and 
good practices on the guiding principles of solidarity and socialism. 
</p>
<p>30. The Russian Federation welcomed the preparation of the national report through 
wide consultation and recommended that Viet Nam (a) continue to involve the appropriate 
political and social organizations in work to encourage and promote human rights. 
Highlighting support to the poorest including orphans and persons with disabilities, it 
recommended (b) continuing the very successful and socially oriented economic policy, 
including by providing drinking water to poor households and special hardship regions, and 
(c) participating actively in international cooperation to encourage and protect economic 
social and cultural rights. It urged Viet Nam to (d) share its positive experiences with other 
countries and, highlighting results achieved in gender equality, to (e) continue efforts to 
inform the wider society about the laws concerned and the rights of women in general, 
widely use the mass media to raise awareness of gender equality and publish the 
appropriate papers and documents in ethnic minority languages. 
</p>
<p>31. Thailand noted that one of Viet Nam&#8217;s challenges was to strike the right balance 
between the imperatives of economic development and the need to enlarge civil liberties. 
Thailand recommended (a) continuing its poverty reduction efforts as a means of laying the 
groundwork for the further enhancement of human rights of its people, and (b) providing 
and expanding human rights education and training for all relevant Government authorities 
to build capacities of officials and ensure effective implementation of human rights-related 
laws.  
</p>
<p>32. The Philippines noted that Viet Nam intends to ratify the Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the Palermo Protocol. It commended Viet Nam&#8217;s 
support for the establishment of the ASEAN human rights body and asked whether Viet 
Nam had plans to establish an independent national human rights institution. The 
Philippines recommended (a) sharing experiences in promoting agricultural productivity 
and sustainability, local development and good governance with other developing 
countries, (b) further increasing the use of ethnic languages in schools and the mass media, 
and (c) continuing the programme of building affordable housing for low-income families 
to promote broader enjoyment of the right to adequate housing by 2020.   
</p><p>33. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic underlined that since unification in 1975, 
after over 30 years of post-war reconstruction, the country had overcome tremendous </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/11</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.09-16382 
</p>
<p>obstacles and successfully implemented the renovation policy. It recommended that Viet

guarantee the full participation of the population in public and security affairs; (b) share its 
experience and best practice, especially in how to achieve the MDGs, with other countries; 
(c) continue to bring down poverty in urban and rural areas along with the maintenance of 
peace, stability and the protection of environment to boost up the country&#8217;s socio-economic 
development, industrialization and modernization to achieve the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>34. Cuba referred to the successes of Viet Nam based on a system freely chosen by the 
people, and the protection of the rights of ethnic minorities. Cuba acknowledged in 
particular the results achieved in protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, many of 
whom were direct victims of the unbridled aggression including napalm bombing and use 
of notorious chemical agents. Cuba recommended the Government to (a) continue with its 
efforts to promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities and share its 
experiences in this regard; (b) continue to take measures to provide education and health 
care, especially in mountainous areas and to the population of ethnic minorities and with 
their involvement.  
</p>
<p>35. Canada applauded the positive impact that Viet Nam&#8217;s economic gains have had on 
human rights, and welcomed improvements in the areas of equality between men and 
women, education and religious freedom, including for ethnic minority groups. Canada 
recommended measures which would contribute to freedom of expression, in particular that 
Viet Nam (a) increase the independence of media from the State, including by allowing 
privately-run media; (b) bring its press laws into compliance with article 19 of ICCPR; (c) 
adopt a whistleblower law so that those who identify corruption are protected from

Viet Nam (e) reduce the use of security laws that limit public discussion about multi-party 
democracy or criticism of the Government, including by bringing security and propaganda 
laws into compliance with ICCPR; (f) reduce the length of prison sentences for non-violent 
crimes; (g) register all individuals detained under security laws, and make this information 
publicly available; (h) provide people detained under security or propaganda laws with 
fundamental legal safeguards, including representation by legal counsel of their choice

procedures of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>36. China noted that Viet Nam encourages balanced development of the economic 
sectors, gives priority consideration to education, health, infrastructures, human resources, 
poverty reduction and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, and has dramatically improved 
living standards. China recommended that Viet Nam (a) take active measures to close the 
gap between rich and poor and between the mountainous and urban areas; (b) continue to 
help ethnic groups to increase awareness of their rights and responsibilities so that they can 
improve their living conditions and better enjoy their rights.  
</p><p>37. Myanmar noted the discussions about establishing an ASEAN human rights body 
and Viet Nam&#8217;s openness in acknowledging its existing human rights challenges. Myanmar 
recommended further intensifying its engagement with the international community,

<p>39. Singapore noted that Viet Nam has come a long way in rebuilding after decades of 
war. Concerning poverty eradication, the proportion of people below the national poverty

condition for the promotion and protection of human rights; (c) cooperating with the 
international community and neighbouring countries particularly in the fight against 
transborder organized crime, and fight against trafficking in women and children; (d) 
strengthening efforts in fighting against corruption, which negatively affects the enjoyment

transmissible diseases and pandemics, notably HIV/AIDS, by giving priority to vulnerable 
groups, particularly national minorities, the poor and sex workers, and (b) continuing 
efforts aimed at the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>47. The Netherlands recommended that the Government (a) ensures that press laws are 
in compliance with article 19 of ICCPR, (b) authorize independent and privately-run 
newspapers and magazines, and (c) lift restrictions on Internet usage such as filtering and 
surveillance. It welcomed steps towards the ratification of the United Nations Convention

housing for the poor, students, migrant workers, ethnic minorities, allocation of land for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/11</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.09-16382 
</p>
<p>production, and provision of added resources for social safety from the State budget. The 
target is to bring the poverty rate below 10 per cent in 2010.  
</p>
<p>70. The delegation noted that international standards on the rights of employees and on 
trade unions are stipulated and protected in the Constitution and laws, and that Viet Nam 
has signed and ratified a number of ILO conventions. Viet Nam&#8217;s trade union has nearly 8 
million members in enterprises of both State and private sectors and is the legitimate 
representative body in protecting the interest of employees. Viet Nam is studying the 
contents of the remaining conventions, including ILO Conventions 87 and 98. 
</p>
<p>71. Viet Nam will strictly enforce the law on gender equality and the law against 
domestic violence, which was adopted in 2006. 
</p>
<p>72. The delegation noted that Viet Nam is a unified country with 54 ethnic groups, 53 of 
which are minorities making up nearly 14 per cent of the population. The equal political 
rights of the ethnic minorities are proclaimed in the Constitution, and any ethnic-based 
division or discrimination is forbidden. The proportion of ethnic minorities in all levels of 
the administration is increasing. Nationalities enjoy equality in education and health care, 
and the cultural identities, language and scripts of all nationalities are preserved and 
promoted. Viet Nam builds houses for poor ethnic minority people, promoting education 
and builds boarding schools for ethnic minority students. Languages and scripts of the 
ethnic minorities are taught in their schools and public offices; the areas of ethnic minority 
people have seen rapid development and improved conditions, with places of worship 
preserved and upgraded. The delegation acknowledged that ethnic minority areas still lag 
behind in terms of development. 
</p>
<p>73. On religious issues, the State considers religion and belief a legitimate demand of 
the people, as proclaimed in the Constitution and legal documents. Viet Nam has 20 million 
followers of Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Islam, among others. Religious 
activities as Vesak of Buddhism, Christmas and Easter of Catholicism and Protestantism 
and Ramadan of Islam are organized with the participation of hundreds of thousands of 
followers. Viet Nam has also allocated land for the religions to build worshipping places. 
Religious texts have been printed in ethnic minority languages, such as Bana, Ede, Jarai and 
Khmer. 
</p>
<p>74. The Criminal Code had stipulated 44 offences subject to the death penalty; that was 
now reduced to only 29 offences and the death penalty was only applied to extremely 
serious crimes, such as drug trafficking and cruel murder to deter the criminals. Public 
opinion in Viet Nam is not yet ready for the complete removal of the death penalty. In 
2006, Viet Nam revised the law on complaints and denunciation, which allows 
organizations and individuals to lodge lawsuits in the judicial court to review the decisions 
made by administrative agencies related to the legitimate rights of the plaintiff. 
</p>
<p>75. The delegation stated that Viet Nam has enacted codes, laws and provisions to 
ensure social safety and deal strictly with acts infringing on national security and social 
stability, including the 1999 Criminal Code and the 2004 Law on National Security. The 
laws related to national security are in conformity with Viet Nam&#8217;s socio-economic and 
political conditions as well as the international laws that Viet Nam has acceded to. There 
are no so-called &#8220;prisoners of conscience&#8221; and no one is arrested for criticizing the 
Government; only those who violate the laws have to bear criminal responsibility.  
</p>
<p>76. The delegation stated that any violations committed by individuals, State agencies or 
law enforcement officers shall be strictly dealt with in accordance with the law in force. 
Joining CAT is in principle in conformity with the policy and law of Viet Nam, which is 
taking speedy steps to join this Convention. </p>

<p>77. On the conditions of detention and reform of inmates and those subjected to 
temporary detention and investigation and interrogation, the delegation noted that all 
citizens have the right to complaints, and that in case of miscarriage of justice, those 
involved in the proceedings must compensate and can even be prosecuted criminally. The 
delegation reaffirmed that Vietnamese law prohibits all acts of torture and there is no 
practice of torture or degrading treatment of law offenders and those under detention for 
investigative purposes. It also stated that there are no detention camps of the military or 
police in Viet Nam. Every year, the State grants special amnesty for inmates with good 
conduct. In early 2009, 15,000 inmates were commuted and released. 
</p>
<p>78. Furthermore, the courts abide by the principle of equality, and no one is deemed 
guilty and punished, including being put under probation, until so found and sentenced by 
the court. Judges and people&#8217;s grand juries are independent and only abide by the law, and 
Vietnamese law has strict rules on temporary arrest and detention. The delegation referred 
to an increased interest in judicial reform, which aims to make court hearings more 
democratic and transparent. The courts have ordered cash compensation for 80 per cent of 
those making petitions for remedy, and the rest of the cases are being settled.  
</p>
<p>79. The delegation referred to Constitutional provisions and stated that the rapid 
development of the press in Viet Nam testifies to the freedom of speech, freedom of press 
and the right to information. The press, inter alia, monitors the implementation of laws and 
is indispensable for combating corruption. Every citizen has the right to provide feedback 
on socio-economic development plans and programmes, and many cases of corruption and 
wrongdoing have been detected and denounced by the people and brought to justice. With 
people&#8217;s feedback, authorities have cancelled or adjusted many major construction projects. 
The Government has implemented training and retraining programmes for over 2,000 
journalists, thus helping improve the quality and reliability of the media. The law stipulates 
that socio-political and professional organizations are allowed to publish newspapers, and a 
new draft press law will consider allowing enterprises to publish newspapers.  
</p>
<p>80. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted that Viet Nam provides appropriate nutrition for its population 
and that 20 per cent of its budget is dedicated to education. It recommended that Viet Nam 
(a) continue and enhance efforts to reduce the level of poverty, especially for vulnerable 
groups, so as to boost employment, improve access to health and increase available social 
housing, and (b) continue reforming the judiciary and civil service and building a State 
based fully on the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>81. While commending the efforts, the Republic of Korea expressed concern that some 
parts of the rural population, ethnic minority women and children and persons with 
disabilities benefit little from the improved economic conditions. It recommended 
strengthening efforts in the areas of civil and political freedoms that include freedom of 
expression and the press and freedom of religion.  
</p>
<p>82. Nigeria noted challenges faced, including limited resources, inadequate training for 
judicial personnel and the high unemployment rate. Nigeria called on the international 
community to provide the necessary resources. Nigeria recommended that Viet Nam (a)

ICCPR, particularly to reduce cases of arbitrary detention and ensure that the right to a fair 
trial based in law is guaranteed; (b) take the necessary steps to ensure that citizens can fully 
enjoy these rights; (c) consider the possibility of inviting the Special Rapporteurs on 
freedom of expression and freedom of religion to visit the country. Argentina recommended

<p>this happens it commends the reduced number of crimes to which this penalty is applicable 
and hopes that this will be done in accordance with international standards and in full 
transparency. Argentina recommended that Viet Nam (e) ratify CED, the Rome Statute, the 
Palermo Protocol and the conventions on refugees and stateless persons. It asked about 
experiences in reforming the judicial system, rebuilding institutions in a post-conflict 
situation, and on measures to reduce hunger and meet the needs of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>84. South Africa noted that promotion and protection of the human rights of persons 
with disabilities, especially those wounded in the war, is an example of a best practice to be 
emulated. It recommended ratifying CPD.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>85. France referred to a draft bill in 2008 to revise the criminal code to reduce the 
number of crimes to which capital punishment is applicable, and asked when this is likely 
to be approved. It asked if Viet Nam would be willing to host visits by all requesting 
special rapporteurs and not only those working on economic, social and cultural rights. It 
asked about measures to prevent, combat and eradicate discrimination and violence against 
persons belonging to ethnic minorities. France recommended that the Government (a) take 
measures advocated by the Human Rights Committee to bring to an end restrictions to 
freedom of expression and opinion and to end, notably, restrictions on the creation of 
private media at the same time; (b) set up a national human rights institution in accordance 
with the Paris Principles; and (c) sign and ratify the Rome Statute.

recommended that Viet Nam (a) maintain its commitment to strike a balance between the 
opening up of their economy and minimizing the adverse impacts on the most vulnerable 
and disadvantage groups in the society. It recommended that Viet Nam (b) uphold the 
progress it has achieved in ensuring religious freedom to the different communities and 
ensuring that religious and belief activities continue to be a vibrant and enriching feature of 
Vietnamese society. 
</p>
<p>87. Italy recommended (a) stepping up efforts to ensure the full respect of freedom of 
religion and worship, including by reviewing laws and provisions at all levels, related to the 
freedom of religion, in order to align them with article 18 of ICCPR; (b) giving a positive 
reply to the request to visit the country made by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of
