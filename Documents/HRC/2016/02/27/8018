<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
undertook an official visit to Rwanda from 5 to 13 July 2012. In the present report, she 
reviews the policies and programmes implemented in Rwanda in the areas of the right to 
housing and land management, including: (a) villagization (or <i>imidugudu</i>); (b) the Bye Bye 
Nyakatsi programme; (c) the land registration and land titling policy; (d) land consolidation 
programmes; and (e) urban planning in Kigali and consequent population displacements. 
She also focuses attention on the particular situation of the Batwa. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Rwanda on its understanding 
of the concept of decent housing. The efforts that the Government has made to rebuild the 
State and the nation are also welcomed, as are the results of the efforts made to combat 
poverty and improve the living conditions of the Rwandan people.

<p> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for the Government to ensure that all 
ongoing programmes are designed and implemented in accordance with its international 
obligations. She also points out that the conditions under which those policies are 
implemented potentially raise issues of compliance with the international standards 
applicable to the right to decent housing. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to the 
importance of genuine participation by the populations concerned and of establishing 
effective and efficient remedies to deal with any disputes that may arise. She recommends 
that temporary special measures be adopted in favour of the Batwa and calls on the 
Government to improve the opportunities available for the exercise of human rights and 
civil liberties that are essential to the defence of the right to housing. Finally, she advocates 
that a participatory evaluation be conducted of current policies and a number of reforms, 
including legislative reforms.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to the non-discrimination in this context 
undertook an official visit to Rwanda from 5 to 13 July 2012 at the invitation of the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Rwanda for its invitation 
and for its support and cooperation during both the preparation of her mission and the visit 
itself. The Special Rapporteur also thanks the office of the human rights adviser of the 
United Nations team in Rwanda for the support provided. 
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the Rwandan authorities at the 
highest level, including ministers. She also met with representatives of the State&#8217;s strategic 
and technical agencies, civil society and independent research institutions, as well as 
various well-known persons. The Special Rapporteur furthermore met with representatives 
of the Rwandan Parliament and with the National Human Rights Commission. She went to 
the Southern and Eastern provinces, visited many neighbourhoods in Kigali and outside the 
capital, and had discussions with many people living in these areas. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical and geopolitical context 
</b></p>
<p>3. The 1994 genocide, the culmination of an armed conflict that had begun in 1990, 
continues to leave its mark on the Rwandan historical and geopolitical context. The 
genocide claimed the lives of approximately 800,000 people between April and July 1994. 
At that time, as in the past, control over land was a fundamental issue.1 The importance of 
the links between the 1994 genocide and various elements of the country&#8217;s sociopolitical 
history and geography is worth noting. 
</p>
<p>4. Violence linked to competition over power and control of resources, as well as to the 
issue of identity, led to successive waves of migration, mainly at the end of the 1950s and 
again in the mid-1990s. With the end of the monarchy and the outbreak of violence that 
followed, significant numbers of former leaders and their families went into exile at the end 
of the 1950s. In the aftermath of the 1994 genocide, the former exiles returned in large 
numbers, just as other Rwandans were leaving the country. Hence, a significant part of the 
Rwandan population only returned to the country after 1994, while there is also a large 
diaspora. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
there are approximately 115,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Rwanda. 
</p>
<p>5. An understanding of the distinctive features of the country&#8217;s physical and human 
geography is critical to an understanding of the current situation in respect of the right to 
decent housing. In terms of physical geography, the surface area of Rwanda (26,338 km2) 
makes it one of the smallest countries in Africa and one of the most densely populated 
countries in the world (10,537,222 inhabitants according to the August 2012 census), with 
416 inhabitants/km2. At the same time, the very rugged terrain consists of many highlands 
and hills. Over the centuries, this has made agriculture and animal husbandry problematic 
because of the scarcity of suitable land. Land has thus long been a major issue in the 
country&#8217;s socioeconomic and political life. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Arusha Peace Agreement, concluded between the Government of Rwanda of the time and Paul 
</p>
<p>Kagame&#8217;s Rwandan Patriotic Front, was intended to end the civil war between the two sides. It 
contained many provisions relating to land management and housing, showing that these issues were 
already sources of tension. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10538 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. As a result of all this, but also because of cultural and sociological factors, human 
settlements in Rwanda were not arranged in groups. Households tended to be scattered 
across the territory and villages, as coherent social and economic entities were few and far 
between. 
</p>
<p>7. The painful experience of the genocide continues to leave its mark on Rwanda 
today, although the socioeconomic indicators do show that significant progress has been 
made: the rate of extreme poverty has declined, from 40 per cent in 2000&#8211;2001 to 24 per 
cent in 2010&#8211;2011; school attendance has improved; and the proportion of children enrolled 
in secondary school has doubled since 2005. There have been significant improvements in 
the area of housing: sources of drinking water are now available to approximately 74 per 
cent of the population, and access to improved methods of sanitation (latrines) has 
increased, from 55 per cent in 2005&#8211;2006 to 73 per cent in 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government is implementing many programmes in the areas of landownership 
and housing. These include: (a) the villagization policy, under which households that used 
to be scattered are being grouped together; (b) the Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme, which 
provided for the replacement of thatched-roof houses with houses that have sheet metal 
roofs; (c) the land registration and land titling policy; and (d) the land consolidation 
programme, whose purpose is to promote commercial farming. 
</p>
<p>9. Given the importance of land in the culture and recent history of Rwanda, fairness 
and inclusiveness must be assured in the numerous reforms under way in this field. The 
reforms and the manner in which they are implemented must not give rise to conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and policy framework relating to the right to housing 
</b></p>
<p>10. The 2003 Constitution contains no explicit references to the right to housing, 
although it does establish the right to own private property (art. 29) and the more specific 
right to private ownership of land (art. 30). Rwanda is, however, party to several 
international treaties that provide for the protection of the right to decent housing, including 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.2 Rwanda is bound by the relevant provisions of 
these treaties under article 190 of the Constitution, which stipulates that: &#8220;Upon their 
publication in the Official Gazette, international treaties or agreements which have been 
conclusively adopted in accordance with the provisions of law shall be more binding than 
organic laws and ordinary laws (&#8230;).&#8221; 
</p><p>11. The most relevant legislation in the context of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s review is 
Act No. 57/2007 of 15 December 2007, repealing Act No. 06/98 of 22 June 1998 on the 
creation, organization and management of the housing fund (which simply provides for the 
transfer of the fund to the Housing Bank of Rwanda); Organic Law No. 08/2005 of 14 July 
2005 on the use and management of land in Rwanda; and Act No. 18/2007 of 19 April 2007 
on expropriations in the public interest. A series of regulatory instruments also deal with 
various aspects of the right to housing in the country; they include Presidential Order No. 
53/01 of 12 October 2006 on the structure, powers and functions of the Office of the 
Registrar of Land Titles; Presidential Order No. 30/01 of 29 June 2007 on the exact number 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Since the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, in communication No. 155/96, <i>The 
</i></p>
<p><i>Social and Economic Rights Action Center and the Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria</i>, 
found that a combined reading of articles 14 (right to the property), 16 (right to health) and 18 (right 
to protection of the family) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights showed that there 
was an implicitly recognized right to adequate housing, it is accepted that this right is protected by the 
Charter. </p>

</p>
<p>of years that land leases last; Ministerial Order No. 002/2008 of 1 April 2008 on land 
registration procedures; and Ministerial Order No. 14/11.30 of 21 December 2010 on land 
consolidation and utilization procedures. Various aspects of the right to housing are 
addressed in a number of different policies, including the National Urban Housing Policy 
(2008), the Kigali Master Plan (2007), the human settlement policy (2004), and the land 
policy (2004). 
</p><p>12. The general intention behind these instruments is to establish conditions of greater 
equality between Rwandans. This is the case of the 2005 law on land tenure, under which 
spouses and descendants in the first degree are granted equal rights with respect to 
landownership. The instruments also attest to a clear willingness on the part of the 
authorities to modernize the country based on the exigencies of the market economy, as will 
be explained in the section below on the land consolidation policy. In fact, regularization of 
the landownership system and liberalization of the land market are important elements of 
the country&#8217;s economic development strategy. On this point, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to remind the Government that when a country opens itself up to a market economy it 
must take specific actions to protect the poor and all of the most vulnerable groups. 
Furthermore, the sometimes dominant role of the authorities could open the way for abuses, 
as in the case of the 2007 Act on expropriations in the public interest. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the State of Rwanda is legally 
obliged to take all appropriate measures, as far as its available resources permit, to ensure 
the gradual realization of the right to decent housing. As noted by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, such action must be based on the principle of 
equality and non-discrimination, as well as on the need to protect human dignity. 
Furthermore, some measures towards the full realization of the right to decent housing can 
be applied with immediate effect, regardless of the resources available: (a) refrain from 
practices likely to compromise the realization of the right to decent housing; (b) give 
priority to groups living in unfavourable conditions, particularly when a general 
deterioration in living and housing conditions occurs as the result of State policy; (c) adopt 
a costed national strategy for the realization of the right to housing, to be developed on the 
basis of extensive and genuine consultations; and (d) constantly monitor the situation with 
respect to the right to housing, particularly where the most vulnerable groups are 
concerned.3 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Interventions in respect of land and housing 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Policy of villagization (<i>imidugudu</i>) 
</b>14. In a country where the population has traditionally lived in scattered dwellings, the 
policy of villagization, known as &#8220;<i>imidugudu</i>&#8221; (singular: &#8220;<i>umudugudu</i>&#8221;) in Kinyarwanda, 
encourages the establishment of consolidated, planned, prebuilt housing in rural centres. 
The Government states that the policy of <i>imidugudu</i> was initiated and is being implemented 
in order to improve housing and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 4: the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing, 13 December 1991. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10538 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>15. The policy, which was included in the August 1993 Arusha Peace Agreement,4 
meets several needs: (a) it opens the way for the provision of social services and basic 
infrastructure at low cost; (b) it provides for a more rational use of land (which is already 
scarce) for housing and agriculture and thus helps to promote growth and reduce poverty; 
(c) it contributes to reconciliation through the establishment of ethnically mixed housing 
areas; (d) it helps to improve security; and (e) it helps to mobilize people to implement 
various Government policies and programmes. The pace of implementation of <i>imidugudu</i> 
has accelerated in the past few years: the proportion of the population living in <i>imidugudu</i> 
villages rose from 18 per cent in 2005 to 39 per cent in 2011.5 This demonstrates the 
Government&#8217;s capacity to mobilize both central and local administrations and the 
population to carry out its policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>16. Theoretically, therefore, the policy of villagization is a worthy initiative, as it 
generally conforms with the idea of decent housing, as defined by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comment No. 4 (1991). Indeed, the 
Committee considers the elements of adequate housing to include legal security of tenure; 
the availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; and habitability. In the 
present case, the Rwandan Government understands the right to adequate housing to mean 
the right to a decent home, that is to say the possibility for the holders of that right to live in 
peace, security and dignity and to have access to basic services and infrastructure, as well 
as to socioeconomic opportunities. The Special Rapporteur would like to commend the 
Government on this understanding of the concept of decent housing. 
</p>
<p>17. This understanding is clearly reflected in the pilot <i>umudugudu</i> project conducted in 
Nyagatovu in Eastern province, where a village was built from scratch by the Government 
and equipped with basic infrastructure accessible free of charge (running water, electricity 
and biogas). The former inhabitants of the land where Nyagatovu is now located received 
compensation, while the new inhabitants of the site were only moved there once the 
infrastructure was in place. The Government has also developed some income-generating 
activities as a means of combating poverty. From her discussions with them, the Special 
Rapporteur learned that the living conditions of the inhabitants of Nyagatovu had improved 
with the move to their current place of residence. The inhabitants said, for example, that 
they have easier access to water and they now own their homes. This model <i>umudugudu</i>, 
which is to the Government&#8217;s credit, is, however, unlikely to be repeated at the national 
level, largely because of economic and financial constraints. 
</p>
<p>18. These benefits of the <i>imidugudu</i> policy cannot, however, be allowed to overshadow 
the problems that implementation has sometimes caused and that potentially raise issues of 
compliance with the international standards applicable to the right to housing. Villagization 
has often led to the forced displacement of populations to locations not yet provided with 
basic infrastructure and services. In several <i>imidugudu</i> villages visited by the Special 
Rapporteur, the inhabitants stated that their living conditions had not improved and that 
basic services such as water and electricity were only accessible on payment. A few 
inhabitants expressed concern about the lack of effective participation and transparency in 
the conduct of land exchanges often necessitated by the establishment of <i>imidugudu</i>. In the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Article 28 of the Protocol of Agreement (to the Arusha Peace Agreement) on the Repatriation of 
</p>
<p>Refugees and the Resettlement of Displaced Persons provides that: &#8220;The Commission for Repatriation 
shall develop settlement sites. The sites shall be provided with basic socioeconomic infrastructures 
such as schools, health centres, water, access roads, etc. The housing scheme in these areas shall be 
modelled on the &#8216;village&#8217; grouped type of settlement to encourage the establishment of development 
centres in the rural area and break with the traditional scattered housing.&#8221;

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10538 
</p>
<p>same vein, the Special Rapporteur noted the absence of sanitation in many of the <i>imidugudu</i> 
villages that she visited. Thus, in reality, in contrast to the official rhetoric, villagization 
does not always lead to improved living conditions or better access to infrastructure and 
services. 
</p>
<p>19. The implementation of this policy involves population displacements. In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur met with some <i>imidugudu</i> inhabitants who told her they 
had been forcibly displaced. The <i>imidugudu</i> villages are furthermore set up on land 
obtained by the authorities either through exchanges or the pooling of separate plots, often 
under pressure from the local administration. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that: the process for establishing the 
villages must take place in full consultation with the populations concerned; the free and 
informed consent of the latter must be sought; the parties in land exchanges and victims of 
expropriation must be compensated before such transactions take place, in accordance with 
Act No. 18/2007 of 19 April 2007 on expropriations in the public interest; conditions in the 
<i>imidugudu</i> villages must be at least equal to those in the locations where displaced persons 
lived previously; the displacement of populations should never lead to a deterioration in the 
populations&#8217; living conditions; and an administrative or judicial review system must be 
introduced for challenging transactions arising from this policy. Land disputes in 
connection with transactions made necessary by villagization must not be stifled or 
dismissed but resolved fairly, equitably and transparently on the basis of the law. These 
conditions are essential to the consolidation of peace and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to evaluate the policy of 
villagization in order to identify successes and failures and then take corrective measures so 
that the problematic cases that came to her attention become the exception and can be 
quickly identified and remedied. While she recognizes the efforts and role of the authorities 
in raising awareness of the positive aspects of the programmes and policies under way, she 
calls on the Government to relinquish the notion that the ruling elites have a better idea of 
what is good for the population than the population has itself, and to ensure that effective 
and genuine consultations are always undertaken. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme was designed and implemented by the 
Government as part of its modernization and villagization policy. Under the programme, 
thatched-roof houses (<i>nyakatsi</i>) were banned and replaced with houses with metal or, more 
rarely, tiled roofs. The policy was implemented very effectively between January and June 
2011 and resulted, in 98 per cent of cases, in the destruction of thatched-roof houses and 
their replacement by houses with metal roofs. According to the terms of reference, the 
specific objectives of the policy included helping all people living in thatched-roof houses 
to move to <i>imidugudu</i> villages where they would have metal-roof houses; providing 
vulnerable families with building materials; and mobilizing those families able to build 
themselves decent housing.6

 Letter No. 2075/07.01 of 27 December 2010, sent by the Minister of Local Government to the

<p>Minister of Defence, the Minister of Internal Security, the Chief of Defence Staff, the Commissioner 
General of Police and various local authorities, transmitting the terms of reference of the team 
responsible for implementation of the housing programme, is available at http://www.minaloc.gov.rw/

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10538 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to the authorities, the roll out of the Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme was 
accompanied by awareness-raising and advocacy campaigns, so that the consent of affected 
persons was obtained for population displacements and destruction of houses. In practice, 
however, the hasty implementation of the policy often led to the destruction of dwellings 
with many people being left homeless. The Special Rapporteur has heard numerous 
accounts of excessive force being used in the implementation of the programme, as 
reported in the press.7 She has also heard of a case of imprisonment of a priest who had 
publicly stated that the programme was inappropriate.8 The Special Rapporteur notes with 
concern that many homes that now have metal roofs do not have sanitation, not even septic 
tanks. Moreover, the extreme haste with which the programme was implemented is 
potentially problematic, because it has clearly left very little room for consultations or 
genuine participation by the populations concerned. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government that the determination 
of whether or not housing qualifies as decent cannot be made solely on the basis of the type 
of material used to make the roof. Decent housing implies not just an improvement in living 
conditions over those that were obtained previously but also the existence of conditions to 
guarantee the dignity, health and safety of the inhabitants, as well as the availability of 
basic services and infrastructure. Many of the houses that now have metal roofs do not have 
sanitation, as the Special Rapporteur was able to see for herself during her visits to the 
Eastern and Southern provinces. This raises questions as to whether the conditions in which 
the Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme has been implemented are in conformity with 
international standards relating to the right to housing. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to ensure that its housing programmes are carried out in accordance with the 
concept of the right to decent housing, as defined above. She also invites the Government to 
conduct an a posteriori evaluation of the implementation of the Bye Bye Nyakatsi 
programme and to grant fair compensation to those whose rights have been violated as a 
result. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Land registration and land titling programme 
</b></p>
<p>25. The importance of land in regard to access to housing and security of leasehold 
explains the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interest in the ongoing process of land registration and 
land titling for those with rights to the land. Although the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate 
specifically concerns housing, given the close link between the right to housing and land 
rights, it is necessary to conduct an analysis of the land reform process. This analysis will 
thus look at agricultural, commercial and other types of land.9 
</p>
<p>26. The purpose of the land registration policy is to improve security of land tenure, to 
resolve the many &#8212; sometimes old &#8212; disputes over land, and to modernize land 
management practices in line with the demands of the market economy. In the long term, 
the policy should also lead to the establishment of a single national land register and to 
improvements in agricultural planning and transformation. The land registration and land 
titling policy, provided for under the 2005 Land Act, addresses many aspects of this issue. 
It provides for significant progress in such areas as equal rights and the prohibition of all 
forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, nationality or origin in regard to ownership 
and use of land. It thus has some positive aspects, such as equal rights for spouses to

<p>landownership and equal rights for all descendants in the first degree. These positive 
aspects reflect the requirements of the Constitution and the international commitments of 
Rwanda. As part of the land reform process, a tax exemption is available to taxpayers who 
own less than two hectares of land, a positive measure that helps to improve conditions of 
equality between taxpayers. The great capacity of the State and its machinery for 
mobilization and implementation, as demonstrated in this process, is also noteworthy. 
</p>
<p>27. The process is led by the Rwanda Natural Resources Office, with the support of 
various development partners, such as the European Union, the United Kingdom 
Department for International Development (DFID) and the Netherlands. It consists in the 
regularization of landownership and occupation on a plot-by-plot and cell-by-cell basis. It 
began with a pilot phase, which ran from 2007 to 2009. The Government then adopted a 
strategic road map in March 2008. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the Government, the process of land registration and land titling began 
with the preparation and production of field sheets for each cell. This was done with the 
help of aerial photographs and significant other technical resources. A series of public 
meetings was then organized to raise awareness of the process; the meetings dealt with 
subjects such as the role of the adjudication committees, and the rights of persons, and other 
topics. The next stage is the demarcation of plots by surveyors, the adjudication committees 
and the local populations. Any disputes are then documented and costs are paid. A receipt is 
then issued. The maps are then scanned using ArcGIS software and the data are entered in a 
central information system. There is then another stage in which challenges and corrections 
can be made at the local level. The titles are printed and issued only at the end of this 
process. 
</p>
<p>29. This process does, however, have some significant drawbacks. First of all, even in 
the opinion of the Government (through its Rwanda Governance Board), very few 
Rwandans understand the 2005 Land Act. In fact, a study of the population of Kigali 
conducted in October 2010 showed that fewer than 10 per cent understood the law on land 
tenure. The same study showed that only 11.6 per cent of the population of Kigali were 
aware of the Act on expropriations in the public interest.10 Furthermore, the technical 
aspects of the land registration and land titling process mean that it is not easily accessible 
to all. For example, interviews conducted in 2010 showed that the problems rural 
communities had in adapting to the new legal framework had been underestimated, and 
there were inconsistencies between the law and the customary rules on inheritance that are 
still applied outside urban centres.11 Hence, there is no guarantee that the current policy will 
resolve land disputes in the medium- and long-term, since there is no way of being sure that 
rural populations will continue systematically to register any land transactions that take 
place. 
</p>
<p>30. These facts point to a serious lack of participation and commitment on the part of the 
people affected by the policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Land consolidation policy 
</b></p>
<p>31. In the framework of the land registration and land titling policy, the Government has 
launched a land consolidation and productivity programme to combine land plots, which

<p>are then considered to be easier and more productive to farm than fragmented plots, with 
the aims of promoting rural development and transforming agriculture so as to increase 
output and improve the lives of the rural population.12 In practice, areas that are freed up as 
a result of the grouping together of sites formerly used for other purposes are identified, 
marked and planted either with a single crop or a very small number of crops. The selection 
of crops has to be targeted to meet the needs of the market, as stated in the decree on land 
consolidation. This is done by groups of farmers organized in cooperatives or 
agribusinesses or working in the context of facilitated contract farming. In all these cases, 
the land is considered as an input and has a cash value; it is to be used to make a profit. The 
entire process is therefore driven by a determination to move away from food crop 
production or subsistence farming to commercial farming. It is ultimately a programme of 
agricultural intensification, based on a particular type of landownership arrangement. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur would like to acknowledge the results which these policies 
have helped to achieve. According to the authorities, the land consolidation policy and the 
policy of commercial agricultural intensification have brought about an improvement in the 
country&#8217;s agricultural production. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the crops chosen for intensive cultivation, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the space set aside for the populations concerned was somewhat limited. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to the fact that imposing 
the cultivation of commercial crops on the population could jeopardize the diversity of food 
crop production and hence the population&#8217;s food security in the event of a contraction in the 
economy. It is therefore essential that the people, particularly the rural population, should 
be able to continue to practise farming that meets their daily subsistence needs. 
</p>
<p>34. As indicated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its 
general comment No. 4 (1991), there is a close link between the right to decent housing and 
certain civil and political rights. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interviews 
with different stakeholders, including civil society organizations, highlighted the existence 
of a very widespread practice of self-censorship, indicative of a sense of fear of openly 
criticizing the Government&#8217;s policies and programmes. This climate, in which the freedoms 
of expression and association of human rights activists and defenders are restricted, is 
harmful to genuine participation by the populations in the implementation of land and 
housing policies and is hardly conducive to the realization of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>35. In sum, as the Special Rapporteur has learned from discussions with the affected 
populations, the policies of villagization, land registration and land titling, and land 
consolidation, as well as the Bye Bye Nyakatsi programme, have not been accompanied by 
sufficient consultation or participation. Furthermore, the haste with which some of the 
policies have been implemented is potentially dangerous, because it leaves little room for 
challenges to be made to land transactions initiated. It would seem that the authorities have 
played down the number of disputes and complaints arising over land transactions 
conducted in pursuance of these programmes. The fact is that more than 80 per cent of the 
complaints received by the Office of the Ombudsman in the months of May, June and July 
2012 concerned land disputes of various kinds. Of the 216 complaints received in May, 176 
concerned land disputes; in June, 201 of the 244 cases reported related to land; as of 11 July 
2012, 122 of 151 requests for assistance received by the services of the Ombudsman also 
related to land disputes. If the Government wishes to build on the progress that has been 
made in the areas of peace, security and the economy, it must immediately create a space 
for consultation and genuine questioning of the land and housing programmes currently

</p>
<p>under way. It must also begin as soon as possible to carry out regular assessments that take 
account of its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Urban planning and forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>36. In its effort to modernize the country, and in line with the Rwanda Vision 2020 
programme, the Government developed the Master Plan for the city of Kigali, which was 
finalized in 2007. The Plan provides for improvements to be made to existing informal 
settlements, which house most of Kigali&#8217;s inhabitants at the time of writing the present 
report. It also includes plans to improve access to safe drinking water and to sanitation, as 
most of Kigali&#8217;s inhabitants do not have clean drinking water in their homes. They do, 
however, have access to pit latrines. 
</p>
<p>37. For the Kigali Master Plan to be implemented, detailed district plans have to be 
drawn up. The first plan that has been finalized is for the Nyarugenge district and the 
business centre, which cover almost the whole of the city zone and thus have the best 
infrastructure. Most of this space is to become the business centre and a luxury residential 
area. As a result, low-income owners of small properties in this area have been displaced.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the type of sanitation infrastructure available is 
not ideal for large urban areas; it is more suited to a rural environment. In fact, because of 
the size of the population and its sanitation needs, the presence of large numbers of pit 
latrines is likely to pose a threat over the long term to health, sanitation and groundwater.  
</p>
<p>39. The population displacements carried out in implementation of the Kigali Master 
Plan raise the issue of compliance with the applicable international standards. The 2005 law 
grants the right to full ownership of land only to those who use the land in accordance with 
the blueprint for land allocation, management and use adopted by the competent authorities. 
Hence, owners of small plots located in areas intended for the construction of the business 
centre and luxury residential sites are unable to build houses or commercial buildings of the 
required level. They are therefore forced to sell under pressure from the market. This poses 
a real problem in terms of ensuring their decision to relinquish their land is based on valid 
consent. 
</p>
<p>40. Many expropriations said to be &#8220;in the public interest&#8221; have also taken place during 
the roll-out of the Kigali Master Plan. Hundreds of owners have had property expropriated 
and their homes demolished, notably in the neighbourhoods of Kiyovu and Kimicanga. The 
relevant rules provide that only the State may order expropriations in the public interest, 
that such expropriations must be subject to fair and prior compensation, and that 90 days&#8217; 
advance notice must be given to the persons concerned before the expropriation takes place. 
In the present case, the persons whose properties were expropriated in Kiyovu and 
Kimicanga had the choice between compensation in cash and relocation to a site in 
Batsinda, a neighbourhood approximately 15 kilometres from the city centre. In her 
discussions with those relocated to Batsinda, the Special Rapporteur was told that access to 
many services, employment opportunities and infrastructure had been made more difficult 
by the move and that the new accommodation given to the individuals concerned was 
generally less spacious than their previous accommodation, even if the latter was 
sometimes of inferior quality. It was also brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention that, 
in some cases, people had been displaced before disputes over compensation had been 
resolved. These waves of displacements and expropriations have not in fact resolved the 
problem of informal settlements, but simply shifted it away from the city centre, for reasons 
that are mainly related to the market and to aesthetics. By way of proof, the proportion of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-10538 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Kigali residents living in informal and unplanned dwellings increased from 48.8 per cent in 
2005 to 62.6 per cent in 2010.13 The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that the 
Government&#8217;s priority should be to improve homes where they are, rather than displacing 
less affluent populations to areas where their living conditions are not materially improved. 
</p>
<p>41. Act No. 18/2007 of 19 April 2007 on expropriations in the public interest also 
includes many provisions that are potentially not in compliance with the relevant 
international standards. The main provision concerns the definition of the public interest. In 
addition to the public works outlined in the non-exhaustive list given in article 5 of the Act, 
section 2 defines a public interest activity as one carried out in the public interest by the 
Government, a public institution, a non-governmental organization, a legally recognized 
association operating in the country or an individual. Work carried out in relation to 
implementation of master plans for urban development, national land management in 
general and basic infrastructure, and any other activities undertaken in the public interest 
that have been approved by an order of the Minister responsible for the expropriation, 
issued on his or her own initiative or on the request of other persons concerned, are also 
considered to be public interest activities. In practice, this very broad definition of the 
public interest, which does not expressly exclude activities carried out, for example, by 
private individuals for profit, is problematic and could lead to the wrongful application of 
the concept. For example, in Kiyovu, people have had plots expropriated and then sold on 
to private investors for the construction of luxury commercial buildings which, at the time 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, were still unoccupied because of the exorbitant rents 
being asked. Similarly, many plots where homes had been destroyed several months 
previously were still lying empty because of a lack of buyers.  
</p>
<p>42. Overall, the design of the city, as reflected in the Kigali Master Plan, leaves little 
scope for the creation of good quality social housing. During her visit, the Special 
Rapporteur met with many stakeholders who acknowledged the absence of any major social 
housing projects, particularly in urban areas. The aim of the housing plans being 
implemented by the national social security agency is not to provide quality housing for the 
middle classes or vulnerable populations either. The Government must do more to establish 
programmes that afford genuine access to housing, including for the less affluent sectors of 
society. The Special Rapporteur also considers that the existing laws and policies are not 
systematically implemented, as illustrated, inter alia, by expropriations conducted on the 
basis of market demand and by the failure to pay compensation within a reasonable time to 
many of the persons whose property is expropriated. The urban development plans for 
Kigali are not inclusive either, which is contrary to the Rwanda Vision 2020. 
</p>
<p>43. The Government must take urgent action to establish informal housing improvement 
programmes in order, gradually but systematically, to ensure the right to housing for all. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that the type of sanitation 
infrastructure available in Kigali is not ideal for large urban areas; it is more suited to a 
rural environment. In fact, given the size of the population and its sanitation needs, the 
presence of large numbers of pit latrines is likely to pose a threat over the long term to 
health, sanitation and groundwater.

</p>
<p><b> VI. Particular situation of the Batwa 
</b></p>
<p>45. As a matter of principle, the Government is opposed to using the concepts of 
indigenousness (<i>autochtonie</i>), the native population (<i>indig&#233;nat</i>) and the minority. Although 
they are used in international human rights law, these concepts are perceived by the 
authorities as being divisive, as is that of &#8220;ethnic group&#8221;.14 While no group&#8217;s identity 
appears to be denied a priori, there is certainly a possibility of certain groups being subject 
to direct or indirect discrimination because of their identity. Several mechanisms for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, including the special mechanisms of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, have deemed that the Batwa of Rwanda are 
&#8220;indigenous&#8221; populations.15 The Government has decided instead to describe these 
populations as &#8220;historically marginalized&#8221;, estimating their number to be between 25,000 
and 30,000.16 
</p>
<p>46. The Batwa, who also live in several countries of the Great Lakes region, perceive 
and define themselves as a group with a specific way of life, constituting a minority or an 
indigenous population. The right of individuals to identify themselves, individually or with 
others, as belonging to an indigenous group or to a minority is well established in 
international human rights law and serves as a key criterion in the definition of the 
existence of minorities or indigenous peoples.17 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur consulted both representatives of non-governmental 
organizations that support the Batwa and Batwa populations themselves. She visited the 
<i>umudugudu</i> of Karubibi and was able to see the particularly difficult conditions in which 
the Batwa people live there. The initiative taken by the First Lady of Rwanda of building 
housing for the population of this <i>umudugudu</i> is laudable, but it is an inadequate response 
to the requirements of international human rights law relating to the right to decent housing. 
The houses that the Special Rapporteur visited in the <i>umudugudu</i> had neither adequate 
sanitation nor drinking water. Getting access to school is difficult for the children of this 
<i>umudugudu</i>, as the nearest school is several kilometres away. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also gleaned from her discussions that the way that the 
general population of Rwanda views the Batwa is based on very negative stereotypes and 
prejudices. As a consequence, the Batwa are often employed in poorly paid work that is 
considered to be degrading. In general, the structural inequalities which these populations 
sometimes face put them in a more vulnerable position than other segments of the 
population in terms of access to and enjoyment of all human rights. These populations have 
more difficulty gaining access to land, landownership and decent housing. 
</p>
<p>49. Above and beyond the efforts made to assist all &#8220;historically marginalized&#8221; groups, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to the need to focus 
attention on the Batwa with a view to taking urgent measures to address the unequal 
treatment that they experience in all areas of economic, social and political life in the

 Special Rapporteur&#8217;s Consultations with members of the Parliament, Kigali, 9 July 2012. However, it 
</p>
<p>is noteworthy that the Constitution itself makes a clear reference to &#8220;ethnic origin&#8221; in its articles 11 
and 58. It is therefore a reality that also exists in Rwanda and cannot be denied, as noted by Gay 
McDougall, the independent expert on minority issues, in her report on Rwanda 
(A/HRC/19/56/Add.1).

<p>country. To grant them recognition of their special status, as recommended by the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights International Work Group for Indigenous 
Affairs, would seem to be an appropriate step towards the establishment of temporary 
special measures to correct the discriminatory practices of the past, of which these 
populations continue to be victims. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>50. <b>The theoretical approach that the Government has taken to the concept of 
decent housing is commendable. The efforts that the Government has put into 
rebuilding the State and the nation are also to be commended, as are the results it has 
achieved in combating poverty and improving people&#8217;s living conditions. Progress has 
also been made in many areas, including with regard to access to education, water and 
sanitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Policy of <i>imidugudu</i> 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The <i>imidugudu</i> policy should be implemented in full consultation with the 
populations concerned, whose free and informed consent must be sought; the parties 
to land exchanges or victims of expropriation should be compensated before such 
transactions take place, in accordance with Act No. 18/2007 of 19 April 2007 on 
expropriations in the public interest; persons displaced to <i>imidugudu</i> villages should 
be afforded conditions in their new place of residence at least equal to those that 
obtained in the location where they lived previously; population displacements should 
never lead to a deterioration in living conditions; an administrative or judicial review 
system should be introduced to allow for challenges to be made to transactions 
conducted in connection with this policy; and a participatory system should be 
established to evaluate the policy. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land registration and land titling programme 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: ensure that the 
populations concerned truly understand the process of land registration and land 
titling; establish measures to guarantee greater and freer access to the law courts for 
the referral of disputes relating to this process; reduce the speed with which the 
process is implemented so as to allow for genuine involvement on the part of the 
populations affected, including those of the diaspora; and ensure that the most 
vulnerable groups are not excluded from the process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land consolidation policy 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the improvement that the 
Government has made to agricultural production in recent years. She recommends 
that the Government encourage families to maintain a minimum level of subsistence 
agriculture so that they do not become completely vulnerable to market fluctuations. 
She also recommends that the Government ensure that proper consultations are held 
prior to implementation of land consolidation programmes and that effective remedies 
are available to persons who wish to challenge transactions conducted in connection 
with this policy. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urban planning and expropriations 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>In line with general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur invites the Government to adopt a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.13-10538 
</p>
<p><b>more inclusive approach to development of the city when implementing the Kigali 
Master Plan. Expropriations should not be used as a first resort, but only in cases of 
absolute necessity. The Government should always explore possibilities for improving 
housing in situ. Where expropriations do take place, they should be conducted in 
accordance with the law and the persons affected should be provided with fair and 
prior compensation or the possibility of being rehoused under conditions at least equal 
to those that they previously enjoyed (including with respect to access to 
opportunities, goods, services and infrastructure). The Special Rapporteur invites the 
Government to revise Act No. 18/2007 of 19 April 2007 on expropriations in the public 
interest so as to provide a more restrictive and equitable definition of the public 
interest, with a view to guarding against further possible misinterpretations of the 
concept. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Indigenous populations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government of its obligations 
under the provisions on equality and non-discrimination set forth in various 
international instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. On this basis, she invites the 
Government to recognize the distinctive nature of the Batwa and to take temporary 
special measures, as a matter of urgency, to remedy, on a sustainable basis, the 
inequalities from which this group suffers because of political, historical and 
geographical circumstances and various other factors that do not necessarily fall 
under the responsibility of the current leadership. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Right to participate, right to an effective remedy, and other civil liberties 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The right to housing cannot be fully realized without genuine participation by 
the population. The right to participate presupposes the freedoms of expression and 
association, but also the possibility for persons who consider that their legitimate 
rights have been violated to apply to a competent authority to obtain fair 
compensation. This is of paramount importance for the consolidation of peace and 
security. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to provide a safer and freer 
forum for the expression of diverse opinions by the various stakeholders.</b>
