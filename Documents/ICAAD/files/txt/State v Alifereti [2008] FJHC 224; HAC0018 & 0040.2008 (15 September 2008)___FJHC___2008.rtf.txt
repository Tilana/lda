JUDGMENT

1.      
I have carefully considered the unanimous verdicts of Guilty against both Pita Koni Alifereti and Peli Kete Doviyaroi, by the five assessors. I have reviewed them in the context of the summing up I gave and the totality of the evidence adduced by both the prosecution and the defence in this trial.

2.      
I am satisfied that the verdicts of the assessors are supportable on the evidence and the relevant law applicable in this case. 

3.      
I therefore accept the verdicts of the assessors against Pita Koni Alifereti. I find Pita Koni Alifereti guilty as charged in Counts 3, 5 and 7 in the Information. I convict him accordingly for each of those counts.

4.      
I also accept the verdicts of the assessors against Peli Kete Doviyaroi. I therefore find Peli Kete Doviyaroi guilty as charged in Count 4 of the Information. I convict him accordingly.

5.      
As regards sentencing, I will deliver sentence on Wednesday 17 September 2008 at 10 am. Defence counsels are to file submission in mitigation no later than 4pm on Tuesday 16 September 2008.
