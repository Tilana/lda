Canadian Securities Administrators.
1.1 The Houston Deposits
The Houston Property is approximately 14 km southeast of LIM’s currently producing James Mine. 
Historic work by The Iron Ore Company of Canada Limited (“IOC”) occurred in several phases 
between  1950  and  1982.  The  area  was  extensively  trenched  and  drilled  and  was  in  a  stage  of 
advanced exploration work at the time of closure of IOC’s mines in 1982. 
 
LIM commenced its work here with a diamond drill program in 2006. In 2008 a more extensive 
reverse circulation program began. LIM has worked continuously in this project area since 2008.  
 
Historically referred to as (from NW to SE) Houston 2, Houston 1 and Houston 3, the deposit is a 
continuous band of iron (“Fe”) enrichment. The ore strikes NW/SE and dips NE 60-70 degrees. 
The focus of LIM’s work has been on the Houston 1 & 2 areas. Work is continuing on the Houston 
3 area which is still open to the SE. Total strike length of the Houston target is currently 5km with a 
width of up to 170m. 
 
The  current  measured  and  indicated  resource  estimate  for  the  Houston  property  is  30.1  million 
tonnes  at  an  average  grade  of  57.7%Fe  and  13.4%  SiO2.  In  addition,  a  measured  and  indicated 
manganiferous Fe resource is estimated to be 1.2 million tonnes at 53.6% Fe, 10.3% SiO2 and 5.1% 
Mn.

1.2 The Malcolm 1 Deposit
Malcolm  1  lies  on  gently  westward  sloping  land  and,  is  approximately  12  km  southeast  from 
Schefferville  (Figure  4-4)  in  the  Quebec  side  of  the  Labrador  trough  and  is  believed  to  be  the 
northwest extension of the Houston deposit.  Work by IOC in the 1960’s and 1970’s delineated a 
zone of enrichment that was 1000 m long by up to 90 m wide, had a northwest/southeast trend and 
dipped at 60 to 70 degrees to the northeast. At this point, drill holes at Malcolm 1 have been drilled 
as deep as 112 m and iron enrichment appears to continue at depth. A second smaller area of iron 
enrichment measuring 70 m by 160 m occurs to the southeast along strike from the former.  
 
Malcolm 1 was mapped, sampled and drilled by IOC in several phases from the 1960’s to 1982. A 
historical resources estimate was done at the time for Malcolm 1 by IOC. SMI has a partial database 
of historical IOC fieldwork including a geological map showing geology and the surface location of 
the occurrence. 
 
SMI  commenced  work  on  Malcolm  1  in  2011  and  in  two  seasons,  2011  and  2012,  31  reverse 
circulation drill holes were completed for a total of 2978-m of drilling. In addition, 21 chip samples 
for 61 m have been taken from the contact of ore with the footwall. One historic drill hole has been 
located in the field for which SMI has assay results. All of this data has been compiled together to 
calculate the current resource. 
 
The current resource estimate for the Malcolm 1 property is 9.2 million tonnes at an average grade 
of 57.8 %Fe in the measured and indicated categories.
1.3 Property Description and Location
As  of  March  31st,  2013,  the  Houston  property  comprises  1  Mineral  Rights  License  issued  by  the 
Department  of  Natural  Resources  for  the,  Province  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  which 
represents 112 mineral claims located in western Labrador covering approximately 2,800 hectares. 
The  Malcolm  1  property  includes  36  additional  claims  covering  approximately  1,172  hectares  in 
Québec. 
 
LIM holds a 100% interest in the title to the Mineral Rights in Newfoundland and Labrador subject 
to a Royalty equal to 3% of the selling price freight on board (FOB) port of iron ore produced and 
shipped from the properties, subject to such royalty being not greater than $1.50 per tonne.  
 
SMI holds a 100% right to the Malcolm 1 claims in Québec, subject to a royalty of $2 per tonne. 
 
The Houston project is located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and is the western 
central part of the Labrador Trough Iron Range about 1,140 km northeast of Montreal and about 14 
km southeast of the town of Schefferville Quebec. The Houston deposits comprise a number of 
separate deposits historically identified as Houston 1, 2 and 3.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 5
The Malcolm 1 project is located in the Province of Quebec contiguous to the northwest of the 
Houston deposit and mineral licenses. The Malcolm 1 mineral occurrence is believed to be the NW 
extension of the Houston deposit. 
 
While both Houston and Malcolm 1 can be reached by all-weather exploration roads from the town 
of Schefferville there are no roads connecting the area to southern Labrador or elsewhere in Canada. 
Access to the area is by rail from Sept-Îles to Schefferville and by air from Montreal and Quebec 
City via Sept-Îles and Wabush. 
 
IOC had previous mining activities close to the Houston/Malcolm 1 properties during the period of 
operations from 1954 to 1982 when part of the Houston deposit formed part of the IOC resource 
base.
1.4 Geology
At least 45 hematite-goethite ore deposits have been discovered in an area 20 km wide that extends 
100 km northwest of Astray Lake, referred to as the Knob Lake Iron Range, which consists of a 
tightly folded and faulted iron-formation exposed along the height of land that forms the boundary 
between Quebec and Labrador. The Knob Lake properties are located on the western margin of the 
Labrador Trough adjacent to Archean basement gneisses. The Central or Knob Lake Range section 
extends for 550 km south from the Koksoak River to the Grenville Front located 30 km north of 
Wabush Lake. The principal iron formation unit, the Sokoman Formation, part of the Knob Lake 
Group, forms a continuous stratigraphic unit that thickens and thins from sub-basin to sub-basin 
throughout the fold belt. 
 
The  sedimentary  rocks  in  the  Knob  Lake  Range  strike  northwest,  and  their  corrugated  surface 
appearance is due to parallel ridges of quartzite and iron formation which alternate with low valleys 
of shales and slates. The Hudsonian Orogeny compressed the sediments into a series of synclines 
and anticlines, which are cut by steep angle reverse faults that dip primarily to the east. Most of the 
secondary earthy textured iron deposits occur in canoe-shaped synclines, some of which are tabular 
bodies extending to a depth of at least 200 m, and one or two deposits are relatively flat lying and 
cut by several faults. Subsequent supergene processes converted some of the iron formations into 
high-grade ores, preferentially in synclinal depressions and/or down-faulted blocks.  
 
The Labrador Trough contains four main types of iron deposits:
  Soft iron mineralization formed by supergene leaching and enrichment of the weakly 
metamorphosed  cherty  iron  formation;  they  are  composed  mainly  of  friable  fine-
grained secondary iron oxides (hematite, goethite, limonite);
  Taconites,  the  fine-grained,  weakly  metamorphosed  iron  formations  with  above 
average  magnetite  content    which  are  also  commonly  called  magnetite  iron 
formation;
intensely  metamorphosed,  coarser-grained
termed 
metataconites  which  contain  specular  hematite  and  subordinate  amounts  of 
magnetite as the dominant iron minerals;
formations,

  Minor occurrences of hard high-grade hematite ore occur southeast of Schefferville
at Sawyer Lake, Astray Lake and in some of the Houston deposits.
Secondary enrichment included the addition of secondary iron and manganese which appear to have 
moved in solution and filled pore spaces with limonite-goethite. Secondary manganese minerals, i.e., 
pyrolusite  and  manganite,  form  veinlets  and  vuggy  pockets.  The  types  of  iron  mineralization 
developed in the deposits are directly related to the original mineral facies. The predominant blue 
granular  mineralization  was  formed  from  the  oxide  facies  of  the  middle  iron  formation.  The 
yellowish-brown mineralization, composed of limonite-goethite, formed from the carbonate-silicate 
facies,  and  the  red  painty  hematite  ore  originated  from  mixed  facies  in  the  argillaceous  slaty
members.
Only  the  soft  iron  mineralization  is  considered  amenable  to  beneficiation  to  produce  lump  and 
sinter fines and forms part of the resources for LIMHL’s DSO Projects.
1.5 Exploration
Most historic exploration on the Schefferville area iron ore properties was carried out by IOC until 
the closure of its operation in the 1980s. A considerable amount of data used in the evaluation of 
the resource and reserve estimates is provided in the documents, sections and maps produced by 
IOC or their consultants. More recent exploration has been carried out by LIMHL during the period 
2006 to 2012 and includes tricone reverse circulation and diamond drilling, trenching, bulk sampling 
and data collection and verification. 
 
The majority of the additional resource outlined in the 2012 program has resulted from the drilling 
of a not well defined area between Houston 1 & 2 deposits, as well as infill drilling. Additional bulk 
sampling for metallurgical testing may also be necessary to prepare the final process flow sheet for 
treatment of the iron and manganiferous ore resources.
1.6 Drilling and Sampling
Diamond drilling of the Schefferville area iron deposits has proven to be a challenge historically as 
the alternating hard and soft mineralized zones tend to preclude good core recovery. Traditionally 
IOC used a combination of reverse circulation drilling, diamond drilling and trenching to generate 
data for reserve and resource calculation. A large quantity of original IOC data has been recovered, 
reviewed and digitized by LIMHL. 
 
For the most recent calculations of the resources for the Houston deposits, data from 4,418 m- of 
drilling in 86 historical reverse circulation drill holes comprising 1,496 samples has been used. The 
systematic drilling had been carried out on sections 100 feet (30 m) apart.  
 
IOC also sampled targets by trenching and test pits in addition to drilling. The test pits and trenches 
were to determine lithologies, ore body limits and quality of ore on surface. A total of 8,001 m-in 
236 trenches and test pits with 2,106 samples from historical records were considered in this report. 
Samples were usually collected over 10 feet (3.0 m) intervals.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 7
In order to update historical data, LIM carried out several exploration programs at Houston since 
2006 with the purpose of verifying the historical resources and evaluating its extensions, with the 
addition of diamond drilling in 2012. This included 15,072 m in 199 RC and diamond drill holes, 
1,105 m in 13 trenches and 135 samples. Most of the drilling completed was using tricone reverse 
circulation. 
 
Additionally, SMI carried out drilling activities at the Malcolm 1 deposit for the first time in 2011 to 
compare with historical information. A total of 18 RC drill holes were completed with a total depth 
of  1,379  and  480  samples  were  sent  for  chemical  analysis.  During  2012  an  additional  14  reverse 
circulation drill holes (1,599 m) were completed. Total drilling at Malcolm 1 is 2,978 m in 32 drill 
holes,  all  reverse  circulation  type.  There  were  also  21  chip  samples  collected  from  the  contact 
between ore and the footwall of the deposit. 
 
The  geological  sections  originally  prepared  by  IOC  have  been  updated  with  the  information 
obtained through LIMHL’s exploration work. All of this data has been used for the purpose of the 
current Resource Study.
1.7 Sample Preparation, Security and Data Verification
The  precise  sampling  procedures  used  by  IOC  are  not  known  but  it  is  believed  that  LIM  has 
followed  procedures  that  are  similar  to  those  used  in  the  past.  Sampling,  as  well  as  sample 
preparation, was carried out under supervision of LIM personnel in 2012 by experienced geologists 
and technicians following well-established procedures. The samples were reduced to representative, 
smaller size samples by a riffle splitter for RC, and split core for diamond drilling, which were all 
sent to ACTLABS laboratory for analysis and testing.
1.8 Metallurgical Testing
The  results  of  the  metallurgical  tests  done  on  Houston  bulk  trench  samples  have  indicated  the 
amenability of the deposit to be processed using conventional iron ore processing methods.  
 
The  +1mm  size  fraction  of  HU1,  HU2  and  DRO  is  generally  of  marketable  grade,  hence  the 
objective  of  the  concentration  process  for  Houston  deposit  will  be  mainly  to  upgrade  the  -1mm 
portion using either wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) or a hydrosizer. The settling 
test results on the -1mm products of the trench samples generally have shown good settling rates 
even without flocculent addition, therefore implying the use of conventional thickener. The vacuum 
filtration of the -300micron is one of the areas that need to be investigated further, though initial 
tests have produced 15-16% cake moisture.  
 
Confirmatory  tests  were  completed  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2012  involving  drill  core  samples  to 
establish more confidence to the beneficiation process on a wider plant feed variation and also to 
further refine the fine fraction processing of the Houston deposit. A confirmatory test program will 
be  composed  of  similar  set  of  tests  as  the  bulk  trench  samples  and  will  also  include  a  deeper 
investigation  on  fines  and  ultra-fines  dewatering  (e.g.  sedimentation  and  filtration)  methods.  It  is

Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 8
expected that the output of the upcoming tests will fine tune the preliminary flow sheet established 
by DRA and LIM. 
 
Iron  resources  are  estimated  and  tabulated  separately  from  manganiferous  resources.  The 
beneficiation process developed for the project is appropriate only for the iron resources.
1.9 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
Table  1-1  summarizes  an  updated  resource  estimate  for  the  Houston  deposits,  and  Table  1-2 
summarizes the estimated resources of the Malcolm 1 property, both as of April 16, 2013 on both 
iron and manganiferous iron resources, which have been carried out in compliance with NI 43-101. 
No mineral reserves are reported in this Technical Report.

Block Modelling
In March 2013, SGS was mandated to update the March 2012 resource estimation for the Houston 
and  Malcolm  1  properties.  SGS  identified  certain  differences  and  updated  the  Houston  resource 
using the same parameters as in March 2012. 
 
SGS used its own software called Genesis for the resource estimation. The SGS set of geostatistical 
software programs are reliable and validated and constantly improved by SGS experienced software 
and  geostatistical  team.  The  ordinary  kriging  interpolation  method  was  used  to  estimate  the 
resources  by  block  modeling  with  block  sizes  of  5x5x5  m-and  block  rotation  of  45.6°  which 
corresponds  to  the  general  strike  of  the  deposit.  SGS  used  LIM’s  geological  and  ore  models 
interpreted  in  the  Gemcom  software.  The  mineralised  envelope  prepared  by  LIM  is  considered 
reliable and current.
1.10.1
Analyses
Analyses for all of the samples from the 2012 drilling and trenching programs were carried out by 
Activation  Laboratories.  The  analytical  method  used  was  borate  fusion  whole  rock  X-Ray 
Fluorescence.
1.10.2
Density
A variable specific gravity, Fe dependent, was used for the resource estimation which was calculated 
using the formula: SG (in situ) = [(0.0371 * Fe) + 1.877] * 0.85. This equation was updated using 
the  latest  core  density  measurements  done  during  the  2012  diamond  drilling  campaign.  The  data 
used  was  restricted  to  valid  Houston  and  Malcolm  1  area  mineralized  core.  According  to  and  in 
relation  to  findings  on  the  in-situ  density  on  James  deposit  from  reconciliation,  it  was  decided  to 
apply 15% porosity (0.85 in the equation) for added security.

Interpretation and Conclusions
The  authors  have  reviewed  all  of  the  technical  data  in  the  possession  of  LIMHL  relating  to  the 
Houston  and  Malcolm  1  deposits  and  have  detailed  personal  knowledge  of  LIM’s  projects  since 
2008.  
 
LIM’s  exploration  work  programs  and  technical  evaluation  programs  carried  out  in  2008  were 
conducted under the supervision of the first named author. SGS – Geostat reviewed the different 
field,  laboratory  and  QA/QC  protocols  and  procedures.  The  2009  to  2012  exploration  work 
programs and technical evaluation programs follow the same methods and protocols (updated and 
improved) and although the author did not do a site visit in 2010, the information in this report 
according to the first author’s knowledge does not appear to be misleading.  The first named author 
visited  the  site  from  August  23rd  to  24th,  2012,  as  part  of  the  reconnaissance  visit  of  the  all  the 
properties of the Schefferville area for the 2012 RC and Diamond drilling and trenching campaign. 
The second named author visited LIMs operations many times during 2011 and 2012. 
 
The  geological  interpretation  of  the  Houston  and  Malcolm  1  deposits  are  restricted  to  the  zones 
considered of reasonable economic extraction potential. Geological interpretations were completed
considering a cut‐off grade of 45% Fe; however the resources reported are based on a cut‐off grade 
of Non‐Bessemer (NB), lean non‐Bessemer (LNB), high silica (HiSiO2), high manganiferous (HMN)
of 50%Fe for iron ore and 50% Fe+Mn for manganiferous iron ore. The IOC ore type parameters
and low manganiferous (LMN) were considered for the resource estimation.  
  
The geological modeling of both deposits was performed using standard sectional modeling of 30-
metre spacing. Geological interpretation and modeling of the mineral deposits on paper sections and 
plans from IOC were digitized and updated with new information acquired during the recent field 
work  seasons.  SGS  used  LIM’s  geological  information  and  LIM’s  3D  solids  of  ore  models 
interpreted  in  their  Gemcom  software.  The  mineralised  envelope  prepared  by  LIM  is  considered 
reliable and current. 
 
SGS  used  its  own  proprietary  software  called  Genesis©  for  the  resource  estimation.  The 
geostatistical software is reliable, validated and constantly improved by SGS experienced software 
and geostatistical team. The ordinary kriging interpolation method was used to estimate the Houston 
resources  by  block  modeling  with  block  sizes  of  5x5x5  m  and  block  rotation  of  45.6°  which 
corresponds to the general strike of the deposit. The inverse distance squared (ID2) interpolation 
method was used to estimate the Malcolm 1 resources by block modeling with block sizes of 5x5x5 
m and block rotation of 47°( counter Clockwise) which corresponds to the general strike (313°) of 
the deposit. 
 
The results of LIM’s work to date on the Houston deposits have shown that there is sufficient merit 
to  continue  with  the  development  of  the  Houston  1  &  2  deposits  and  to  carry  out  further 
exploration work to confirm and expand the resource potential of the Houston 3 deposit, as well as 
to conduct preliminary evaluation of the potential for lower grade taconite deposits along the eastern

The results of SMI’s work to date on the Malcolm 1 deposit has shown that there is sufficient merit 
to  continue  with  the  development  of  the  deposit  and  to  carry  out  further  exploration  work  to 
confirm and expand the resource potential. 
 
The  results  of  the  2012  data  verification  indicated  that  the  diamond  drill  hole  Houston  check 
sampling had very good correlation and no significant errors were detected. The RC method has 
dramatically improved since the last field season and errors with the method decreased significantly 
over the 2012 field season No obvious bias was observed on Malcolm 1 check sampling 2012 data. 
The sign test identified a bias while the student T test did not show any errors. Additionally, the 
difference between means for iron and silica was considered negligible. In the first author’s opinion, 
the information in this section appears to be consistent and not misleading.

Recommendations
SGS Geostat recommends LIMHL to continue its ongoing QA/QC program.  
 
SGS Geostat suggest inserting real blanks and certified materials as well as regular field, prep coarse 
rejects pulp duplicates and the use of a second laboratory for checks.  
 
SGS recommends the continued use of diamond drilling in order to obtain core from all of work 
areas.  Recent  2012  DDH  drilling  campaign  demonstrated  a  good  recovery  of  core  (over  85% 
recovery) making assay results, lithological and physical information more accessible with an almost 
constant volume in order to better define the in situ Specific Gravity and to gather material at depth 
for metallurgical tests and possibly geotechnical tests. The tests should include general mineralogy, 
QEMSCAN,  grindability  and  Bond  Work  Index,  scrubbing  tests,  size  analysis  and  assays  from 
before  and  after  scrubbing,  density  separation,  jigging  tests,  WHIMS  tests,  settling  tests  without 
using flocculants, and Vacuum filtration (assuming vacuum disc filter).  
 
SGS understands that the Houston 3 is at an earlier stage of development than the Houston 1 & 2 
sectors but suggest carrying the metallurgical tests and diamond drilling as well. Houston 3 remains 
open to the southeast and this extension should be tested with more drilling.  
 
Infill core drilling in Malcolm 1 is recommended. The possible northern extension enrichment in 
Malcolm  1  should  be  tested  with  further  drilling  and,  in  addition,  exploration  work  between 
Houston 2 and Malcolm 1 should be carried out in order to determine the continuity of mineral 
enrichment between these two deposits. 
 
The  following  budgetary  recommendations  below  are  purely  conceptual.  The  metallurgical  tests 
costs estimates are purely conceptual and LIM should inquire on the update of a formal proposal for 
such tests. These assay costs should be used only as a reference. The access, logistics, camp, meals 
and equipment rental costs are not included in this budget recommendation.

LIMHL  has  carried  out  significant  geological  exploration  programs  on  the  Houston  and  other 
Labrador properties held by LIMHL during the 2006, and 2008 to 2012 summer seasons.  
 
The first named author first visited the sites from May 26th to May 28th 2008 as part of the site visit 
and reconnaissance visit of the all the properties of the Schefferville area. SGS –Geostat participated 
in the summer-fall 2008 RC drilling campaign for the supervision of the sampling and preparation 
before dispatch to the analytical laboratories. The first named author assisted and instructed LIMHL 
on RC drilling and sampling procedures for the Houston mineral deposits as well as other targets 
during this campaign. SGS –Geostat implemented a QA/QC procedure as part of the standard RC 
drilling and sampling program. 
 
The  first  named  author  visited  the  site  from  August  23rd  to  August  24th,  2012  as  part  of  the 
reconnaissance visit of the all the properties of the Schefferville area for the 2012 RC drilling and 
trenching campaign. SGS –Geostat reviewed the different field, laboratory and QA/QC protocols 
and  procedures.  Maxime  Dupéré  met  on  a  regular  basis  with  LIMHL  management  and  relevant 
personnel by phone and in the SGS office located in Montréal, Quebec.  
 
This report was written in accordance with the National Instrument 43-101 Policy guidelines. This 
report was requested by LIMHL for the update of the resource estimation of the Houston property 
including the Malcolm deposit.   
 
The  Houston  Project,  including  the  Malcolm  property,  does  not  have  any  demonstrated 
mineral  reserves  and  a  feasibility  study  has  not  been  conducted  on  the  Houston  Project.

Property Description and Location 
4.1 Houston
The Houston property is located in Labrador in the western central part of the Labrador Trough 
iron  range  and  about  1,140  km  northeast  of  Montreal  and  20  km  southeast  of  the  town  of 
Schefferville, Quebec Figure 4-1. 
 
There are no roads connecting this area to western Labrador or elsewhere in Quebec. Access to the 
area is by rail from Sept-Îles to Schefferville or by air from Montreal and Sept-Îles. 
 
With respect to the Houston property, LIM holds the title to 1 Mineral Rights License (as of March 
31,  2013)  issued  by  the  Department  of  Natural  Resources,  Province  of  Newfoundland  and 
Labrador,  representing  112 mineral  claims  located  in  northwest  Labrador  covering  approximately 
2,800 hectares (Table 4-1 and Figure 4-2). 
 
Under  the  terms  of  an  Option  and  Joint  Venture  Agreement  dated  September 15,  2005  between 
Fonteneau Resources Limited (“Fonteneau”) and Energold, as amended, and subsequently assigned 
to LIMHL, a royalty in the amount 3% of the selling price FOB port per tonne of iron ore produced 
and shipped from any of the properties shall be payable to Fonteneau. This royalty will be capped at 
US$1.50 per tonne on the Houston property. 
 
On  October  22,  2009,  LIMHL  announced  that  it  had  entered  into  an  agreement  with  NML  to 
exchange  certain  of  their  respective  mineral  licences  in  Labrador.  The  exchange  eliminated  the 
fragmentation  of  the  ownership  of  certain  mining  rights  in  the  Schefferville  area  and  will  enable 
both parties to separately mine and optimise their respective DSO deposits in as efficient a manner 
as  possible.  As  part  of  the  Agreement,  NML  transferred  to  LIMHL  125  hectares  in  five  mineral 
licenses in Labrador that adjoin or form part of LIM’s Houston deposit.

4.2 Malcolm 1
Malcolm 1 lies in Quebec on gently westward sloping land, is approximately 12 km southeast from 
Schefferville (Figure 4-4). Work by IOC in the 1960’s and 1970’s delineated a zone of enrichment 
that was 1000 m long by up to 90 m wide which had a northwest/southeast trend and dipped at 60 
to 70 degrees to the northeast. At this point drill holes at Malcolm 1 have been drilled as deep as 112 
m  and  iron  enrichment  appears  to  continue  to  depth.  A  second  smaller  area  of  iron  enrichment 
measuring 70 m by 160 m occurs to the southeast along strike from the former.  
 
The  enrichment  appears  to  occur  mainly  within  the  Ruth  member  and  Lower  iron  Formation 
(“LIF”) of the Sokoman Iron Formation and would be similar to the enrichment encountered at the 
Houston showing which is 5 km to the southeast and occurs in the same band of iron formation. 
 
SMI holds a 100% right to the Malcolm 1 claims in Québec, subject to a royalty of $2 per tonne. 
 
Malcolm 1 was mapped, sampled and drilled by IOC in several phases from the 1960’s to 1982. A 
1982 resource for Malcolm 1 is listed in IOC records as being 2,879,000 tonnes at 56.2% Fe and 
6.14% SiO2. A manganiferous component of the resource is 422,000 tonnes grading 51.4% Fe, 4.9% 
SiO2 and 5.80% Mn. SMI has a partial database of historical IOC fieldwork including a geological 
map  showing  geology  and  the  surface  location  of  the  occurrence.  The  historical  estimate  was 
prepared  according  to  the  standards  used  by  IOC  and,  while  still  considered  relevant,  is  not 
compliant with NI 43-101. 
 
The Malcolm 1 property includes 36 mineral claims (1,171.59 ha) issued by the Quebec government. 
Table 4-2 below summaries the list of Quebec claims for the Malcolm 1 property.

Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure,
Physiography 
5.1 Accessibility
The Houston property is located in the west central part of the Labrador Trough iron range. The 
mineral  properties  are  located  about  1,140  km  northeast  of  Montreal  and  adjacent  to  or  within 
20 km of the town of Schefferville (Quebec).  
 
There are no roads connecting the area to southern Labrador or southern Quebec. Access from the 
southern areas of the province to the Project area is either by rail from Sept Îles to Schefferville or 
by air from Montreal, Sept Îles, Goose Bay, St. John’s or Wabush.  
 
The Houston deposits and the Malcolm 1 deposit are located within reach of existing infrastructure 
approximately  20  km  southeast  of  Schefferville  and  can  be  reached  by  existing  gravel  roads, 
although LIM plans to construct a new 10km all-weather access road to directly connect Houston 
with Silver Yards and the Redmond mine site.  
 
A haul road is required to connect the Houston 1 & 2 Project to the existing road to the James and 
Redmond mines. The road will be approximately 7.3 kilometers in length and 11.5 meters in width.  
 
A rail siding will be constructed along the TSH main line to facilitate loading of product onto rail 
cars. The proposed rail siding is expected to measure approximately 5.9 kilometers in length and is 
expected to be located within the existing rail right-of-way.
5.2 Climate
The  Schefferville  area  and  vicinity  have  a  sub-arctic  continental  taiga  climate  with  very  severe 
winters.  Daily  average  temperatures  exceed  0°C  for  only  five months  a  year.  Daily  mean 
temperatures  for  Schefferville  average  -24.1°C  and  -22.6°C  in  January  and  February  respectively. 
Mean daily average temperatures in July and August are 12.4°C and 11.2°C, respectively. Snowfall in 
November,  December  and  January  generally  exceeds  50 cm  per  month  and  the  wettest  summer 
month is July with an average rainfall of 106.8 mm. 
 
Exploration  work  in  the  area  can  typically  be  carried  out  year-round,  however  RC  drilling  and 
trenching programs are typically preferred during the months of May to November.  
 
Mine development operations can be carried out year-round as well. Operations during extreme cold 
conditions can stop intermittently. Production and shipping were historically limited to the months 
of May until November.

Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 26
5.3 Local Resources
It  is  assumed  that  the  majority  of  the  workforce  will  come  from  the  province  of  Newfoundland 
Labrador and employees will also be recruited from the Quebec communities close to the project 
site.
5.4 Infrastructure
The Houston property is located approximately 20 km southeast of Schefferville and approximately 
10 km from LIM’s Redmond deposit which, together with the James Mine, currently forms part of 
LIM’s first phase mine development.  
 
The town of Schefferville has a Fire Department with mainly volunteer firemen, a fire station and 
fire-fighting equipment. The Sûreté Du Québec Police Force is present in the town of Schefferville 
and the Matimekush-Lac John reserve. A clinic is present in Schefferville with limited medical care. 
A municipal garage, small motor repair shops, a local hardware store, a mechanical shop, and a local 
convenient store, 2 hotels, numerous outfitters accommodations are also present in Schefferville. 
 
A  modern  airport  includes  a  2,000  metre  paved  runway  and  navigational  aids  for  passenger  jet 
aircraft. Regular air service is provided to and from Wabush, Labrador, and to Montreal and Quebec 
City, via Sept-Îles. 
 
A community radio station, recreation centre, parish hall, gymnasium, playground, childcare centre, 
drop-in centre are also present in Schefferville. 
 
The Menihek power plant is located 35 km southeast of Schefferville. The hydro power plant was 
built  to  support  iron  ore  mining  and  services  in  Schefferville.  Back-up  diesel  generators  are  also 
present.

The approximately 560 km (355 mile) main rail line between Schefferville and Sept‐Îles, which was 
continuous  operation  for  over  fifty  years.  The  QNS&L,  a  wholly‐owned  subsidiary  of  IOC,  was 
established in 1954 by IOC to haul iron ore from the Schefferville area mines to the port of Sept‐
and freight service between Sept‐Îles and Schefferville up to 2005.  
approximately 360 km (225 miles) to Sept‐Îles.
In 2005, QNS&L sold the section of the railway known as the Menihek Division (235 km) between 
Emeril Junction and Schefferville to Tshiuetin Rail Transportation Inc. (“TSH”) (Figure 5-1). TSH 
now owns and operates the approximately 235 km (130 mile) main line track between Schefferville 
and Emeril Junction where it connects to IOC’s QNS&L Railroad, which connects the remaining
Îles. After the shutdown of IOC’s Schefferville operations in 1982, QNS&L maintained a passenger

TSH runs passengers, iron ore and freight from Schefferville to Emeril/Ross Bay Junction; QNS&L 
hauls iron concentrates and pellets from Labrador City/Wabush area via Ross Bay Junction to Sept-
Îles;  Bloom  Lake  Railway  hauls  ore  from  the  Cliffs  Bloom  Lake  mine  to  Wabush;  and  Arnaud 
Railways hauls iron ore for Wabush Mines and the Bloom Lake Mine between Arnaud Junction and 
Pointe Noire. CRC hauls iron concentrates from Fermont area to Port-Cartier for Arcelor Mittal.. 
The latter railway is not connected to TSH, QNS&L, Bloom Lake or Arnaud. 
 
LIM has constructed a 6 km rail spur line that connects the TSH railroad to LIM’s Silver Yards.  It is 
anticipated that iron ore products from the Houston and Malcolm 1 project areas will be delivered 
by  highway-style  haulage  trucks  to  stockpiles  located  adjacent  to  a  new  railway  siding  to  be 
constructed on the TSH railroad. The siding will consist of nearly 6 km of track, configured into one 
main siding and several side tracks required to manipulate train sets during loading operations.  
 
Iron ore from the James Mine is currently transported by rail from the Silver Yards plant site, via the 
Company’s  six  km  spur  line,  the  TSH  railway  and  the  QNS&L  railway,  to  the  Port  of  Sept-Îles, 
where the ore is unloaded and stockpiled for shipping.
It is anticipated that Houston ore will be transported to the Port of Sept‐Îles under LIM’s existing
agreements with the railways. LIM has not concluded any arrangements for the port handling or sale 
of any iron ore beyond 2014. 
 
Under LIM’s 2011 rail services agreement with Western Labrador Rail Services (“WLRS”)  WLRS, 
operates and maintains up to five SD 40-3 locomotives which are used to haul LIM’s iron ore from 
Silver Yards, over the TSH Railway, to Emeril Junction.  WLRS also operates LIM’s six km rail spur 
which  connects  LIM’s  Silver  Yards  processing  facility  to  the  main  TSH  Schefferville  to  Emeril 
Junction rail line. 
LIM’s June 2012 agreement with TSH provides for approximately $25 million in contributions over 
the next four to five years towards the costs of the TSH rail line upgrade program.  LIM also paid 
TSH  a  refundable  capacity  reservation  deposit  of  $1.5  million  and  has  committed  to  minimum 
annual tonnages over its eight month annual operating season.   
Under  LIM’s  confidential  rail  transportation  contract  signed  with  QNS&L  in  2011  LIM  is 
committed  to  minimum  tonnages  per  month  over  the  anticipated  eight  month  annual  operating 
season.  QNS&L provides the locomotives and operating personnel for LIM’s ore haulage on the 
QNS&L railway.   
LIM  owns  544  railcars  configured  in  four  trains  sets  each  consisting  of  124  cars.    These  are  re-
conditioned  coal  cars  intended  for  short-term  use.   In  the  longer  term  LIM  plans  to  lease  rotary 
gondola ore cars with a capacity of 100 tonnes. LIM also owns the Centre Ferro maintenance and 
repair facility in Sept-Îles which is used to maintain the Company’s fleet of rail cars.

5.6 Physiography
The topography of the Schefferville mining district is bedrock controlled with the average elevation 
of the properties varying between 500 m and 700 m above sea level. The terrain is generally gently 
rolling to flat, sloping north-westerly, with a total relief of approximately 50 to 100 m. In the main 
mining district, the topography consists of a series of NW-SE trending ridges while the Astray Lake 
and  Sawyer  Lake  areas  are  within  the  Labrador  Lake  Plateau.  Topographic  highs  in  the  area  are 
normally formed by more resistant quartzites, cherts and silicified horizons of the iron formation 
itself. Lows are commonly underlain by softer siltstones and shales. 
 
Generally, the area slopes gently west to northeast away from the land representing the Quebec – 
Labrador border and towards the Howells River valley parallel to the dip of the deposits. The finger-
shaped area of Labrador that encloses the Howells River drains southwards into the Hamilton River 
watershed and from there into the Atlantic Ocean. Streams to the east and west of the height of land 
in Quebec, flow into the Kaniapiskau watershed, which flows north into Ungava Bay. 
 
The mining district is within a “zone of erosion” in that the last period of glaciation has eroded away 
any pre-existing soil/overburden cover, with the zone of deposition of these sediments being well 
away from the area of interest. Glaciation ended in the area as little as 10,000 years ago and there is 
very little subsequent soil development. Vegetation commonly grows directly on glacial sediments 
and the landscape consists of bedrock, a thin veneer of till as well as lakes and bogs. 
 
The  thin  veneer  of  till  in  the  area  is  composed  of  both  glacial  and  glacial  fluvial  sediments.  Tills 
deposited  during  the  early  phases  of  glaciations  were  strongly  affected  by  later  sub  glacial  melt 
waters during glacial retreat. Commonly, the composition of till is sandy gravel with lesser silty clay, 
mostly  preserved  in  topographic  lows.  Glacial  melt  water  channels  are  preserved  in  the  sides  of 
ridges both north and south of Schefferville. Glacial ice flow in the area has been recorded as an 
early major NW to SE flow and a later less pronounced SW to NE flow. The early phase was along 
strike with the major geological features and the final episode was against the topography. The later 
NE flow becomes more pronounced towards the southern end of the district near Astray Lake or 
Dyke Lake.

History
6.
The following information was provided by LIMHL 
 
The Quebec-Labrador Iron Range has a tradition of mining since the early 1950’s and is one of the 
largest  iron  producing  regions  in  the  world.  The  former  direct  shipping  iron  ore  operations  at 
Schefferville operated by IOC produced in excess of 150 million tonnes of lump and sinter fine ores 
over the period 1954-1982. The properties comprising LIMHL’s Schefferville area projects were part 
of the original IOC Schefferville operations and formed part of the 250 million tonnes of reserves 
and resources identified by IOC but were not part of IOC’s producing properties. This is a historic 
estimate made in compliance with the standards used by IOC. 
 
There are currently four major iron ore producers in the Labrador City-Wabush region to the south, 
IOC, Arcelor Mittal, Cliffs Natural Resources Bloom Lake Mine and Wabush Mines. Tata Steel is 
currently constructing a Direct Shipping Ore project 30 kms north of Schefferville. A number of 
other projects in the Labrador area are in the exploration and review process.  
 
The Labrador Trough which forms the central part of the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula is a remote 
region which remained largely unexplored until the late 1930’s and early 1940’s when the first serious 
mineral  exploration  was  initiated  by  Hollinger  and  LM&E.  These  companies  were  granted  large 
mineral concessions in the Quebec and Labrador portions of the Trough. Initially, the emphasis was 
on exploring for base and precious  metals but, as the magnitude of the iron deposits in the area 
became  apparent,  development  of  these  resources  became  the  exclusive  priority  for  a  number  of 
years. 
 
Mining and shipping from the Schefferville area began in 1954 under the management of the IOC, a 
company specifically formed to exploit the Schefferville area iron deposits.  
 
In  1954,  IOC  started  to  operate  open  pit  mines  in  Schefferville  containing  56-58%  natural  iron 
(Fe%),  and  exported  the  direct-shipping  product  to  steel  companies  in  the  United  States  and 
Western Europe. The properties and iron deposits that currently form LIMHL’s Houston-Malcolm 
1 Project were part of the original IOC Schefferville area operations. 
 
As the technology of the steel industry changed over the ensuing years more emphasis was placed 
on  the  concentrating  ores  of  the  Wabush  area  and  interest  and  markets  for  the  direct  shipping 
Schefferville ores declined. 
 
During the 1960’s, higher-grade iron deposits were developed in Australia and South America and 
customers’ preferences shifted to products containing +62% Fe or higher. In 1963, IOC developed 
the  Carol  Lake  deposit  near  Labrador  City  and  started  to  produce  concentrates  and  pellets  with 
+64% Fe, so as to satisfy the customers’ requirements for higher-grade products. High growth in 
the demand for steel, which began after the end of World War II, came to an abrupt end in the early 
1980’s due to the impact of increasing oil prices. The energy crisis affected steel production in the 
U.S.  and  Western  Europe  as  consumers  switched  to  energy-efficient  products.  As  a  result,  the 
demand for iron ore plummeted, creating a severe overcapacity in the industry. In 1982, the IOC
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 31
closed its operations in the Schefferville area. From 1954 to 1982, a total of some 150 million tonnes 
of ore was produced from the area. 
 
Hollinger, a subsidiary of Norcen Energy Ltd., was the underlying owner of the Quebec iron ore 
mining leases in Schefferville area. Following the closure of the IOC mining operations, ownership 
of the mining rights held by IOC in Labrador reverted to the Crown. In the early 1990’s, Hollinger 
was acquired by La Fosse Platinum Group Inc. (“La Fosse”) who conducted feasibility studies on 
marketing, bulk sampling, metallurgical test work and carried out some stripping of overburden at 
the  James  deposit.  La  Fosse  sought  and  was  granted  a  project  release  under  the  Environmental 
Assessment Act for the James deposit in June 1990 but did not go ahead with project development 
and the claims subsequently were permitted to lapse. 
 
With the exception of the pre-stripping work carried out on the James deposit and the mining of the 
Redmond #1 ore body by IOC (adjacent to LIM’s current Redmond property), none of the iron 
deposits within the LIM mineral claims were previously developed for production during the IOC 
period of ownership. 
 
Between September 2003 and March 2006, Fenton and Graeme Scott, Energold and NML began 
staking claims over the soft iron ores in the Labrador part of the Schefferville camp. Recognizing a 
need  to  consolidate  the  mineral  ownership,  Energold  entered  into  agreements  with  the  various 
parties that have subsequently been assumed by LIM. LIM later acquired additional properties in 
Labrador by staking. 
 
In December 2009, LIMHL, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired control over an additional 
50 million tonnes of historical direct shipping iron ore in the Province of Quebec, together with a 
large package of mineral claims in Quebec in the Schefferville area which are considered prospective 
for exploration for iron ore and which also host a number of small high grade manganese deposits. 
 
During the period from September 2005 to 2012, LIMHL conducted exploration, development and 
other  work  in  the  Schefferville  area.  Such  work  consisted  of  geological  evaluation,  sampling, 
geophysical surveys, trenching, drilling, bulk sampling, resource verification, assaying, metallurgical 
test work, mine planning, community consultation, transportation studies and other work. 
 
In 2011, LIM commenced mining operations at its James Mine and constructed a processing plant at 
Silver Yards.  To the end of 2012 LIM had produced and sold 2 million tonnes of iron ore from the 
James Mine.

Geological Setting & Mineralization 
7.1 Regional Geology
The following summarizes the general geological settings of the Houston and Malcolm properties 
and the other properties making up LIMHL’s Scheffervile area iron ore projects in western Labrador 
and northeastern Quebec . The regional geological descriptions are based on published reports by 
Gross (1965), Zajac (1974), Wardel (1979) and Neale (2000) and were first prepared by LIMHL for 
an internal scoping study report in 2006. 
 
At least 45 hematite-goethite ore deposits have been discovered in an area 20 km wide that extends 
100 km  northwest  of  Astray  Lake,  referred  to  as  the  Knob  Lake  Iron  Range,  which  consists  of 
tightly folded and faulted iron-formation exposed along the height of land that forms the boundary 
between Quebec and Labrador. The iron deposits occur in deformed segments of iron-formation, 
and the ore content of single deposits varies from one million to more than 50 million tonnes. 
 
The Knob Lake properties are located on the western margin of the Labrador Trough adjacent to 
Archean basement gneisses. The Labrador Trough otherwise known as the Labrador-Quebec Fold 
Belt extends for more than 1,000 km along the eastern margin of the Superior craton from Ungava 
Bay  to  Lake  Pletipi,  Quebec.  The  belt  is  about  100 km  wide  in  its  central  part  and  narrows 
considerably to the north and south. 
 
The  western  half  of  the  Labrador  Trough,  consisting  of  a  thick  sedimentary  sequence,  can  be 
divided into three sections based on changes in lithology and metamorphism (North, Central and 
South).  The  Trough  is  comprised  of  a  sequence  of  Proterozoic  sedimentary  rocks  including  iron 
formation, volcanic rocks and mafic intrusions known as the Kaniapiskau Supergroup (Gross, 1968). 
The Kaniapiskau Supergroup consists of the Knob Lake Group in the western part of the Trough 
and the Doublet Group, which is primarily volcanic, in the eastern part. 
 
The Central or Knob Lake Range section extends for 550 km south from the Koksoak River to the 
Grenville  Front  located  30 km  north  of  Wabush  Lake.  The  principal  iron  formation  unit,  the 
Sokoman  Formation,  part  of  the  Knob  Lake  Group,  forms  a  continuous  stratigraphic  unit  that 
thickens and thins from sub-basin to sub-basin throughout the fold belt. 
 
The southern part of the Trough is crossed by the Grenville Front. Trough rocks in the Grenville 
Province  to  the  south  are  highly  metamorphosed  and  complexly  folded.  Iron  deposits  in  the 
Grenville part of the Labrador Trough include Lac Jeannine, Fire Lake, Mounts Wright and Reed 
and the Luce, Humphrey and Scully deposits in the Wabush area. The high-grade metamorphism of 
the Grenville Province is responsible for recrystallization of both iron oxides and silica in primary 
iron formation producing coarse-grained sugary quartz, magnetite, specular hematite schists (meta-
taconites) that are of improved quality for concentrating and processing. 
 
The main part of the Trough north of the Grenville Front is in the Churchill Province and has been 
subjected  to  low-grade  (greenschist facies)  metamorphism.  In  areas  west  of  Ungava  Bay, 
metamorphism increases to lower amphibolite grade. The mines developed in the Schefferville area 
by IOC exploited residually enriched earthy iron deposits derived from taconite-type protores.

Geological conditions throughout the central division of the Labrador Trough are generally similar 
to those in the Knob Lake Range. A general geological map of Labrador is shown in Figure 7-1.

7.2 Local Geology
The general stratigraphy of the Knob Lake area is representative of most of the Knob Lake Range, 
except that the Denault dolomite and Fleming Formation are not uniformly distributed. The Knob 
Lake Range occupies an area 100 km in length by 8 km in width. The sedimentary rocks, including 
the  cherty  iron  formation,  are  weakly  metamorphosed  to  greenschist  facies.  In  the  structurally 
complex  areas,  leaching  and  secondary  enrichment  have  produced  earthy-textured  iron  deposits. 
Unaltered, banded, magnetite iron formation, often referred to as taconite, occurs as gently dipping 
beds west of Schefferville, in the Howells River area. 
 
The  sedimentary  rocks  in  the  Knob  Lake  Range  strike  northwest,  and  their  corrugated  surface 
appearance is due to parallel ridges of quartzite and iron formation which alternate with low valleys 
of shales and slates. The Hudsonian Orogeny compressed the sediments into a series of synclines 
and anticlines, which are cut by steep angle reverse faults that dip primarily to the east. 
 
Most  of  the  secondary,  earthy  textured  iron  deposits  occur  in  canoe-shaped  synclines;  some  are 
tabular bodies extending to a depth of at least 200 m, and one or two deposits are relatively flat lying 
and cut by several faults. In the western part of the Knob Range, the iron formation dips gently 
eastward over the Archean basement rocks for about 10 km to the east, then forms an imbricate 
fault structure with bands of iron formation, repeated up to seven times. 
 
Subsequent,  supergene  processes  converted  some  of  the  iron  formations  into  high-grade  ores, 
preferentially in synclinal depressions and/or down-faulted blocks. Original sedimentary textures are 
commonly preserved by selected leaching and replacement of the original deposits. Jumbled breccias 
of enriched ore and altered iron formations, locally called rubble ores, are also present. Fossil trees 
and leaves of Cretaceous age have been found in rubble ores in some of the deposits (Neal, 2000).
7.2.1  Geology of Schefferville Area
The stratigraphy of the Schefferville area is as follows: 
 
Attikamagen Formation –  is  exposed  in  folded  and  faulted  segments  of  the  stratigraphic 
succession where it varies in thickness from 30 m near the western margin of the belt to more than 
365 m  near  Knob  Lake.  The  lower  part  of  the  formation  has  not  been  observed.  It  consists  of 
argillaceous material that is thinly bedded (2-3 mm), fine grained (0.02 to 0.05 mm), grayish green, 
dark grey to black, or reddish grey. Calcareous or arenaceous lenses as much as 30 cm in thickness 
occur locally interbedded with the argillite and slate, and lenses of chert are common. The formation 
grades upwards into Denault dolomite, or into Wishart quartzite in area where dolomite is absent. 
Beds  are  intricately  drag-folded,  and  cleavage  is  well  developed  parallel  with  axial  planes, 
perpendicular to axial lines of folds and parallel with bedding planes. 
 
Denault Formation – is interbedded with the slates of the Attikamagen Formation at its base and 
grades  upwards  into  the  chert  breccia  or  quartzite  of  the  Fleming  Formation.  The  Denault 
Formation consists primarily of dolomite, which weathers buff-grey to brown. Most of it occurs in 
fairly massive beds which vary in thickness from a few centimetres to about one metre, some of 
which are composed of aggregates of dolomite fragments. 
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 35
Near  Knob  Lake  the  formation  probably  has  a  maximum  thickness  of  180 m  but  in  many  other 
places it forms discontinuous lenses that are, at most, 30 m thick. Leached and altered beds near the 
iron  deposits  are  rubbly,  brown  or  cream  coloured  and  contain  an  abundance  of  chert  or  quartz 
fragments in a soft white siliceous matrix. 
 
Fleming Formation – occurs a few kilometres southwest of Knob Lake and only above dolomite 
beds  of  the  Denault  Formation.  It  has  a  maximum  thickness  of  about  100 m  and  consists  of 
rectangular  fragments  of  chert  and  quartz  within  a  matrix  of  fine  chert.  In  the  lower  part  of  the 
formation the matrix is dominantly dolomite grading upwards into chert and siliceous material. 
 
Wishart Formation –  Quartzite  and  arkose  of  the  Wishart  Formation  form  one  of  the  most 
persistent units in the Kaniapiskau Supergroup. Thick beds of massive quartzite are composed of 
well-rounded fragments of glassy quartz and 10-30% rounded fragments of pink and grey feldspar, 
well cemented by quartz and minor amounts of hematite and other iron oxides. Fresh surfaces of 
the rock are medium grey to pink or red. The thickness of the beds varies from a few centimetres to 
about  one  metre  but  exposures  of  massive  quartzite  with  no  apparent  bedding  occur  most 
frequently. 
 
Ruth Formation – Overlying the Wishart Formation is a black, grey-green or maroon ferruginous 
slate, 3 to 36 m thick. This thinly banded, fissile material contains lenses of black chert and various 
amounts  of  iron  oxides.  It  is  composed  of  angular  fragments  of  quartz  with  K-feldspar  sparsely 
distributed  through  a  very  fine  mass  of  chlorite,  white  mica,  iron  oxides  and  abundant  finely 
disseminated carbon and opaque material. Much of the slate contains more than 20% iron. 
 
Sokoman Formation –  More  than  80%  of  the  ore  in  the  Knob  Lake  Range  occurs  within  this 
formation. Lithologically the iron formation varies in detail in different parts of the range and the 
thickness of individual members is not consistent. A thinly bedded, slaty facies at the base of the 
formation  consists  largely  of  fine  chert  with  an  abundance  of  iron  silicates  and  disseminated 
magnetite  and  siderite.  Fresh  surfaces  are  grey  to  olive  green  and  weathered  surfaces  brownish 
yellow to bright orange where minnesotaite is abundant.  
 
Thin-banded oxide facies of iron formation occurs above the silicate-carbonate facies in nearly all 
parts of the area. The jasper bands, which are 1.25 cm or less wide and deep red, or in a few places 
greenish yellow to grey, are interbanded with hard, blue layers of fine-grained hematite and a little 
magnetite. 
 
The thin jasper beds grade upwards into thick massive beds of grey to pinkish chert and beds that 
are very rich in blue and black iron oxides. These massive beds are commonly referred to as “cherty 
metallic” iron formation and make up most of the Sokoman Formation. The iron oxides are usually 
concentrated in layers a few centimetres thick interbedded with leaner cherty beds. In many places 
iron-rich layers and lenses contain more than 50% hematite and magnetite. 
 
The upper part of the Sokoman Formation comprises beds of dull green to grey or black massive 
chert that contains considerable siderite or other ferruginous carbonate. Bedding is discontinuous 
and the rock as a whole contains much less iron than the lower part of the formation.

Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 36
Menihek Formation – A thin-banded, fissile, grey to black argillaceous slate conformably overlies 
the Sokoman Formation in the Knob Lake area. Total thickness is not known, as the slate is only 
found in faulted blocks in the main ore zone. East or south of Knob Lake, the Menihek Formation 
is more than 300 m thick but tight folding and lack of exposure prevent determination of its true 
thickness. 
 
The Menihek slate is mostly dark grey or jet black. It has a dull sooty appearance but weathers light 
grey or becomes buff coloured where leached. Bedding is less distinct than in the slates of other slate 
formations but thin laminae or beds are visible in thin sections.
7.2.2  Iron Ore
The earthy bedded iron deposits are a residually enriched type within the Sokoman iron formation 
that formed after two periods of intense folding and faulting, followed by the circulation of meteoric 
waters in the fractured rocks. The enrichment process was caused largely by leaching and the loss of 
silica, resulting in a strong increase in porosity. This produced a friable, granular and earthy-textured 
iron ore. The siderite and silica minerals were altered to hydrated oxides of goethite and limonite. 
The  second  stage  of  enrichment  included  the  addition  of  secondary  iron  and  manganese  which 
appear  to  have  moved  in  solution  and  filled  pore  spaces  with  limonite-goethite.  Secondary 
manganese minerals, i.e., pyrolusite and manganite, form veinlets and vuggy pockets. The types of 
iron  ores  developed  in  the  deposits  are  directly  related  to  the  original  mineral  facies.  The 
predominant blue granular ore was formed from the oxide facies of the middle iron formation. The 
yellowish-brown ore, composed of limonite-goethite, formed from the carbonate-silicate facies, and 
the  red  painty  hematite  ore  originated  from  mixed  facies  in  the  argillaceous  slaty  members.  The 
overall ratio of blue to yellow to red ore in the Schefferville area deposits is approximately 70:15:15 
but can vary widely within and between the deposits. 
 
Only  the  direct  shipping  ore  is  considered  amenable  to  beneficiation  to  produce  lump  and  sinter 
feed which will be part of the resources for LIMHL’s development projects. The direct shipping ore 
was classified by IOC in categories based on chemical, mineralogical and textural compositions. This 
classification is shown in Table 7-1.

The blue ores, which are composed mainly of the minerals hematite and martite, are generally coarse 
grained and friable. They are usually found in the middle section of the iron formation. 
 
The yellow ores, which are made up of the minerals limonite and goethite, are located in the lower 
section of the iron formation in a unit referred to as the “silicate carbonate iron formation” or SCIF. 
The red ore is predominantly a red earthy hematite. It forms the basal layer that underlies the lower 
section of the iron formation. Red ore is characterized by its clay and slate-like texture.  
 
Direct  shipping  ores  and  lean  ores  mined  in  the  Schefferville  area  during  the  period  1954-1982 
amounted to some 150 million tonnes. Based on the original ore definition of IOC (+50% Fe <18% 
SiO2 dry basis), approximately 250 million tonnes of iron resources remain in the Schefferville area, 
exclusive of magnetite taconite. LIM has acquired the rights to approximately 50% of this remaining 
historic  iron  resource  in  Labrador.  These  numbers  are  based  on  historic  estimates  made  in 
compliance  with  the  standards  used  by  IOC.  The  information  in  this  paragraph  was  provided  by 
LIMHL.
7.2.3  Manganese
For an economic manganese deposit, there needs to be a minimum primary manganese content at a 
given market price (generally greater than 5% Mn), but also the manganese oxides must be amenable 
to concentration (beneficiation) and the resultant concentrates must be low in deleterious elements 
such  as  silica,  aluminum,  phosphorus,  sulphur  and  alkalis.  Beneficiation  involves  segregating  the 
silicate and carbonate lithofacies and other rock types interbedded within the manganese-rich oxides.  
The  principle  manganese  occurrences  found  in  the  Schefferville  area  can  be  grouped  into  three 
types: 
 
Manganiferous iron that occurs within the lower Sokoman Formation. These are associated with 
in-situ residual enrichment processes related to downward and lateral percolation of meteoric water 
and ground water along structural discontinuities such as faults and fractures, penetrative cleavage 
associated with fold hinges, and near surface penetration. These typically contain from 5-10 % Mn. 
 
Ferruginous manganese, generally contain 10-35% Mn. These types of deposits are also associated 
with  structural  discontinuities  (e.g.,  fault,  well  developed  cleavage,  fracture-zones)  and  may  be

hosted by the Sokoman (iron) Formation (e.g., the Ryan, Dannick and Avison deposits), or by the 
stratigraphically  lower  silica-rich  Fleming  and  Wishart  formations  (e.g.  the  Ruth  A,  B  and  C 
deposits). These are the result of residual and supergene enrichment processes. 
 
So  called  manganese-“ore”  contains  at  least  35%  Mn.  These  occurrences  are  the  result  of 
secondary (supergene) enrichment and are typically hosted in the Wishart and Fleming formations, 
stratigraphically below the iron formation.

Deposit Types 
8.1 Iron Deposits
The Labrador Trough contains four main types of iron deposits:
1.  Soft iron ores formed by supergene leaching and enrichment of the weakly metamorphosed 
cherty  iron  formation;  they  are  composed  mainly  of  friable  fine-grained  secondary  iron 
oxides (hematite, goethite, limonite).
2.  Taconites,  the  fine-grained,  weakly  metamorphosed  iron  formations  with  above  average
magnetite content and which are also commonly called magnetite iron formation.
3.  More  intensely  metamorphosed,  coarser-grained  iron  formations,  termed  metataconites; 
which contain specular hematite and subordinate amounts of magnetite as the dominant iron 
minerals.
4.  Occurrences  of  hard  high-grade  hematite  ore  occur  southeast  of  Schefferville  at  Sawyer
Lake, Astray Lake and in some of the Houston deposits.
The  LIMHL  deposits  are  composed  of  iron  formations  of  the  Lake  Superior-type.  The  Lake 
Superior-type iron formation consists of banded sedimentary rocks composed principally of bands 
of  iron  oxides,  magnetite  and  hematite  within  quartz  (chert)-rich  rock,  with  variable  amounts  of 
silicate, carbonate and sulphide lithofacies. Such iron formations have been the principal sources of 
iron throughout the world. 
 
The  Sokoman  iron  formation  was  formed  as  chemical  sediment  under  varied  conditions  of 
oxidation-reduction  potential (Eh)  and  hydrogen  ion  concentrations (pH)  in  varied  depth  of 
seawater. The resulting irregularly bedded, jasper-bearing, granular, oolite and locally conglomeratic 
sediments are typical of the predominant oxide facies of the Superior-type iron formations, and the 
Labrador Trough is the largest example of this type. 
 
The facies changes consist commonly of carbonate, silicate and oxide facies. Typical sulphide facies 
are  poorly  developed.  The  mineralogy  of  the  rocks  is  related  to  the  change  in  facies  during 
deposition, which reflects changes from shallow to deep-water environments of sedimentation. In 
general,  the  oxide  facies  are  irregularly  bedded,  and  locally  conglomeratic,  having  formed  in 
oxidizing shallow-water conditions. Most carbonate facies show deep-water features, except for the 
presence  of  minor  amounts  of  granules.  The  silicate  facies  are  present  in  between  the  oxide  and 
carbonate facies, with some textural features indicating deep-water formation.  
 
Facies contains typical primary minerals, ranging from siderite, minnesotaite, and magnetite-hematite 
in the carbonate, silicate and oxide facies, respectively. The most common mineral in the Sokoman 
Formation is chert, which is closely associated with all facies, although it occurs in minor quantities 
with the silicate facies. Carbonate and silicate lithofacies are present in varying amounts in the oxide 
members. 
 
The  sediments  of  the  Labrador  Trough  were  initially  deposited  in  a  stable  basin  which  was 
subsequently modified by penecontemporaneous tectonic and volcanic activity. Deposition of the

contamination by volcanic and related clastic material derived from the volcanic centers in the Dyke-
Astray area.
8.1.1  Houston and Malcolm 1
The Houston and Malcolm 1 properties are located approximately 20 km southeast of Schefferville 
and can be reached by existing gravel roads. The Houston project area is composed of what appear 
to be at least three separate areas of iron enrichment with a continuously mineralized zone of over 3 
km  in  strike  length  and  which  remains  open  to  the  south.  These  three  areas  of  enrichment  are 
referred to as the Houston 1, Houston 2 and Houston 3 deposits. Houston 3 is currently less well 
explored and there appears to be significant additional DSO potential to the south of Houston 3 
which requires additional drilling.  
 
The Houston and Malcolm 1 DSO iron deposits are stratigraphically and structurally controlled, and 
consist of hard and friable banded, blue and red hematite that locally becomes massive. Airborne 
magnetometer  survey  data  available  from  the  Geoscience  Data  Repository  of  Natural  Resources 
Canada suggests that the iron ore is concentrated along the western flank (gradient) of a modest to 
strong magnetic feature, which trends approximately 330°. The Houston 1 and Houston 2S deposits 
are not coincident with the strongest magnetic features, due to the poor magnetic susceptibility of 
this type of mineralization. IOC drilled and trenched the Houston deposit and prepared reserve and 
resource calculations which were contained in their Statement of Reserves at December 31, 1982. 
 
LIM carried out drilling during the 2006 and 2008 to 2012 programs in Houston which indicated 
that  the  majority  of  the  potentially  economic  iron  mineralization  occurs  within  the  lower  iron 
formation (LIF) and middle iron formation (MIF). The majority of the economic mineralization in 
the Houston area is hosted within the Ruth Chert Formation. 
 
Striking  northwest  and  dipping  to  the  northeast,  both  Houston  1  &  2  mineralizations  have  been 
found to extend down dip to the northeast. These down dip extensions had not been previously 
tested  by  IOC  when  mining  operations  in  the  area  ended.  At  the  present  time  there  remains 
potential for additional mineralization believed to be extending to the southeast of the main deposit 
of Houston 1 and east of Houston 3. 
 
The  Houston  3  deposit  appears  to  be  more  vertical  in  nature  and  drill  holes  testing  the  eastern 
margin of the known deposit have not intercepted any eastward extensions. However, this deposit 
has yet to be tested to its maximum vertical depth or for at least an additional 2 km of strike to the 
south.
8.2 Manganese Deposits
The  manganese  deposits  in  the  Schefferville  area  were  formed  by  residual  and  second  stage 
(supergene)  enrichment  that  affected  the  Sokoman  (iron)  Formation,  some  members  of  which 
contain  up  to  1%  Mn  in  their  unaltered  state.  The  residual  enrichment  process  involved  the 
migration of meteoric fluids circulated through the proto-ore sequence oxidizing the iron formation, 
recrystallizing iron minerals to hematite, and leaching silica and carbonate. The result is a residually 
enriched iron formation that may contain up to 10% Mn. The second phase of this process, where it
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 41
has occurred, is a true enrichment process (rather than a residual enrichment), whereby iron oxides 
(goethite, limonite), hematite and manganese are redistributed laterally or stratigraphically downward 
into the secondary porosity created by the removal of material during the primary enrichment phase.  
Deposition along faults, fractures and cleavage surfaces, and in veins and veinlets is also seen, and 
corroborates  the  accepted  belief  that  the  structural  breaks  act  as  channel-ways  for  migrating 
hydrothermal  fluids  causing  metasomatic  alteration  and  formation  of  manganiferous  deposits.  All 
the manganese occurrences in the Labrador Trough are considered to have been deposited by the 
processes described above.
8.2.1  Houston Deposit
The manganese mineralization in the Houston deposits is present in relatively low concentrations 
(~1%  average)  with  sporadic  concentrations  of  up  to  24%  apparently  structurally  controlled  by 
folding and faulting along the western block of the east dipping reverse fault system.

Exploration 
9.1 Past Exploration
In 1929, a party led by J.E. Gill and W.F. James explored the geology around Schefferville, Quebec 
and named the area Ferrimango Hills. In the course of their field work, they discovered enriched 
iron-ore, or “direct-shipping ore” deposits west of Schefferville, which they named Ferrimango Hills 
1, 2 and 3. These were later renamed the Ruth Lake 1, 2 and 3 deposits by J.A. Retty.  
 
In  1936,  J.S.  Wishart,  a  member  of  the  1929  mapping  expedition,  mapped  the  area  around  Ruth 
Lake and Wishart Lake in greater detail, with the objective of outlining new iron ore occurrences. 
 
In 1937, W.C. Howells traversed the area of the Ruth Lake Property as part of a watercourse survey 
between the Kivivic and Astray lakes – now known as Howells River. 
 
In 1945, a report by LM&E describes the work of A.T. Griffis in the “Wishart – Ruth – Fleming” 
area. The report includes geological maps and detailed descriptions of the physiography, stratigraphy 
and geology of the area, and of the Ruth Lake 1, 2 and 3 ore bodies. Griffis recognized that the iron 
ore unit (Sokoman Formation) was structurally repeated by folding and faulting and remarked that 
“The potential tonnage of high-grade iron deposits is considered to be great.” 
 
In 1946 and 1947, geological mapping of the southeast area of the Wishart-Knob Lake area towards 
Astray Lake carried out by LM&E noted a number of areas with potential economic mineralization 
that led the discovery of the Houston 1 & 2 deposits in 1950. 
 
Most exploration on the properties was carried out by the IOC from 1954 until the closure of their 
Schefferville operation in 1982. Much of the data used in the current evaluation status was provided 
in the numerous documents, sections and maps produced by IOC or by consultants working for 
them.
9.2 LIMHL Exploration from 2005 - 2012
9.2.1  2005 Program
Initial exploration was conducted over LIM’s Labrador area properties during the summer of 2005, 
including the Houston project. The work consisted of surveying old workings (trenches, pits and 
drill holes), prospecting, mapping and collecting rock samples.
9.2.2  2006 Program
A  diamond  drill  program  totalled  605  m  in  11  holes  during  the  summer  season  of  2006  on  the 
Houston as well as the James, Knob Lake No.1, and Astray Lake deposits using Cartwright Drilling 
Inc.  of  Goose  Bay,  Labrador.  Also,  a  short  program  of  bulk  sampling  was  carried  out  in  2006 
consisting of 75 m of trenching for bulk sampling at the Houston deposit.

9.2.3  2007 Program
The exploration program for 2007 comprised prospecting and trenching.
9.2.4  2008 Program
In addition to a drilling program, LIMHL contracted Eagle Mapping Ltd of Port Coquitlam, BC to 
carry out an aerial topographic survey flown over its properties in the Schefferville Area, including 
the  Houston  property.  The  survey  covered  an  area  of  16,230  ha  and  233,825  ha  at  map  scale  of 
1:1,000  and  1:5,000  respectively.  Using  a  differential  GPS  (with  an  accuracy  within  40  cm),  LIM 
surveyed the 2008 RC drill holes, as well as the trenches and a total of 90 old IOC RC drill hole 
collars that were still visible and could be located. 
 
A  bulk  sampling  program  was  carried  out  with  material  from  the  Houston  as  well  as  the  James, 
Redmond  and  Knob  Lake  deposits.  A  total  of  2,000  tonnes  of  blue  ore  was  excavated  from  the 
Houston deposit as well as 1,400 tonnes of blue ore from the James South deposit, 1,500 tonnes of 
blue ore from the Redmond 5 deposit and 1,100 tonnes of red ore from the Knob Lake deposit. 
 
The material was excavated with a T330 backhoe and a 950G front end loader and loaded into 25 
ton  dump  trucks  for  transport  to  their  individual  stockpÎles  at  the  Silver  Yard  area  where  the 
crushing  and  screening  activities  were  carried  out.  The  samples  were  crushed  and  screened  to 
produce two products:
Lump Ore (-50 mm + 6 mm) 
Sinter Fines (- 6 mm)
Representative samples of 200 kg of each raw ore type were collected and sent to SGS Lakefield 
laboratories for metallurgical test work and assays. Representative samples of 2 kg of each product 
were collected and sent to SGS Lakefield laboratories for assays. Other samples were collected for 
additional screening tests. Five train cars were used for the transport of the samples to Sept-Îles.

9.2.5  2009 Program
In addition to a drilling program, LIMHL completed a survey the 2009 RC drill holes, trenches as 
well as any historical IOC RC drill holes using a differential GPS. 
 
The 2009 Houston trenching program was focused on the Houston 3 deposit, completing 479 m in 
9 trenches. 
 
The exploration programs were intended to confirm and validate historic resources reported by IOC 
and  to  bring  them  into  compliance  with  NI-43-101.  Appendix  I  list  drill  holes  and  trenches 
completed by LIMHL between 2006 and 2012.
9.2.6  2010 Program
The 2010 program in Houston consisted of reverse circulation drilling. Drilling was targeted to test 
the presence of mineralization between cross sections 330 and 340 and as infill drilling in Houston 1 
and Houston 2S. In 2010, 26 RC drill holes were completed at Houston for a total of 1,804 m. 
 
During the 2010 exploration season an airborne gravity and magnetic survey was flown over four 
claim  blocks  of  LIM’s  Schefferville  area  properties  centered  on  the  Howse,  Houston/Redmond, 
Astray  and  Sawyer  Lake  areas.  High  gravity  anomalies  associated  with  lower  magnetism  are 
considered prospective for DSO deposits. In total 1895.7 line kms was flown for the gravity and 
magnetic surveys. A total of 473.6 line kms were surveyed over the Howse area, 851.8 kms over 
Houston/Redmond areas, 354.6 kms over Astray and 215.7 line kms over the Sawyer Lake area.  
 
An interim interpretation and evaluation of the processed and plotted airborne gravity gradiometer 
and magnetic data has confirmed the utility of the survey in detecting and outlining iron deposits 
and identified a number of new drill targets with the potential to expand currently known resources.
9.2.7  2011 Program
The 2011 exploration program consisted of reverse circulation drilling in Houston and Malcolm 1, 
with  additional  trenching  and  bulk  sampling  in  Houston.  Drilling  was  conducted  to  infill  the 
Houston deposits and upgrade areas within Houston’s inferred resources as defined with SGS report 
dated March 2011. See Section 10 for all current drilling data. 
 
Trenching was used to confirm the limits of the Houston deposit and to collect samples from Plant 
Feed and DRO quality from both the hanging wall and foot wall of the Houston deposit. 
 
Bulk sampling was conducted to collect Plant Feed and DRO quality samples for metallurgical testing 
on the Houston deposit. The results are described in section 13.

9.2.8  2012 Program
For  the  2012  exploration  program,  LIMHL  conducted  a  reverse  circulation  drill  program  at 
Houston and at Malcolm 1 with Cabo Drilling out of Kirkland Lake, Ontario. In addition, LIMHL 
re-instituted a diamond drill program with Major Drilling from Val d’Or, QC. New techniques were 
used  that  rectified  past  historical  recovery  problems  associated  with  diamond  drilling  with  these 
types of deposits.  Section 10 presents all the relevant data, and drilling results are summarized in 
Table 10-1 and Table 10-2.

Drilling
10.
Diamond  drilling  of  the  Schefferville  iron  deposits  has  been  historically  challenging  in  that  the 
alternating hard and soft ore zones tend to preclude good core recovery. Traditionally IOC used a 
combination of reverse circulation (RC) drilling, diamond drilling and trenching to generate data for 
reserve  and  resource  calculation.  A  large  number  of  original  IOC  data  have  been  recovered  and 
reviewed by LIMHL and are included in the data base that is used for the estimation of resources. 
However in 2012, diamond drilling was re-introduced by LIM into the program as newer techniques 
rectified past historical challenges. 
 
LIMHL carried out exploration drilling programs in the 2006 and 2008 to 2012 summer-fall seasons. 
The drill holes location maps and chart of the Houston mineral deposit are available in Appendix I. 
The drill holes location map and relevant best intercepts of Malcolm 1 mineral deposit are available

Houston
In 2006, 5 diamond drill holes of BQ size were drilled totalling 253 m on the Houston property 
using Cartwright Drilling Inc. of Goose Bay, of which only 1 drill-hole was successfully completed. 
 
Between  2008  and  2012,  LIM  used  Acker  RC  tricone  drill  rigs  from  Cabo  Drilling  using  75mm 
(27/8inch) diameter rods. The drill rigs were mounted on Flex Trac Nodwell carriers or skids and 
outfitted with sample cyclones. In 2012, LIM started using HQ (3.5 inch) diameter diamond drilling 
from Major Drilling out of Val D’Or, QC. All diamond drill rigs were skid mounted. 
 
In 2008, 11 RC drill holes were drilled in Houston for a total of 791 m. 
 
In 2009, 46 RC drill holes were completed at Houston for a total of 3,136 m. 
 
In 2010, 26 RC drill holes were completed at Houston for a total of 1,804 m. 
 
In 2011, 44 RC drill holes were completes at Houston for a total of 3,118 m. 
 
In 2012, 24 RC drill holes were completed at Houston for a total of 1,468.0 m. 42 diamond drill 
holes were completed for a total of 4,502 m, which include 15 geotechnical holes (1,386.20 m) and 
19  metallurgical  holes  (1,865.0  m),  which  were  conducted  under  the  supervision  of  Piteau 
geotechnical consulting.

Total saleable product will be the aggregate of the Wet Plant Product as above and dry screening 
product.   In  peak  years  dry  screening  will  produce  about  1.5mtpa  being  the  difference  between 
tonnes of ore mined and tonnes treated in the wet plant.  Overall production will therefore expected 
to be about 3mtpa made up of 1.5mtpa of dry screened product at 100% recovery and 1.5mtpa of

Sampling Preparation, Analysis and Security
11.
During the time that IOC operated in the area, sampling of the exploration targets were by trenches 
and test pits as well as by drilling. In the test pits and trenches geological mapping determined the 
lithologies  and  the  samples  were  taken  over  10 feet  (~3 m).  The  results  were  plotted  on  vertical 
cross sections. No further information was provided regarding the sampling procedures followed by 
IOC but verbal information from consultants, former IOC employees and others suggests that the 
procedures used by LIMHL were similar to IOC’s during its activities in the Schefferville area. 
 
LIMHL  followed  industry  sampling  standards  and  protocols  for  exploration.  Sealed  boxes  and 
sample bags were handled by authorized personnel and sent to the preparation lab in Schefferville. 
RC  sampling  was  done  at  the  drill  site.  Logging  was  carried  out  at  the  drill  sites  by  LIMHL 
geologists. 
 
Samples  obtained  during  the  2008  to  2012  programs  were  prepared  in  the  sample  preparation 
laboratory set up in Schefferville by LIMHL.  
 
The sampling procedures outlined below were designed and formulated by SGS – Geostat. 
 
The entire lengths of the RC drill holes were sampled. The average length of the RC samples was 
three m. A description of the cuttings was made at every metre drilled. A representative sample was 
collected and placed in plastic chip trays for every metre drilled. The chip trays were labelled with 
Hole  ID  and  the  interval  represented  in  each  compartment.  The    drilled  with  no  recovery  were 
marked with an X inside the chip tray compartment. 
 
In 2012 LIMHL started drilling DDH holes in addition to RC holes. A geotechnician observed the 
drilling process and conducted basic geotech descriptions of the core at the drill. The drill core was 
boxed and tied with metal wire. The core was brought back to the LIMHL core shed on a regular 
basis. A geologist logged the core at the core shed, the core boxed we resealed with tape and the 
witness  samples  are  stored.  A  technician  split  the  core  manually  in  combination  with  a  hydraulic 
splitter and the samples were sent to LIMHL lab for preparation.

In  order  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  sample  at  the  RC  drill  site  to  approximately  7.5  kg,  the  drill 
cuttings were split 4 ways after leaving the cyclone, during the 2008 drilling program (Figure 11-1).  
The cuttings from three of the exit ports were discarded and the cuttings from the fourth exit were 
collected in 5 gallon buckets. As part of the QA/QC program the cuttings from three of the four 
exits were routinely sampled. 
 
Samples  were  taken  by  truck  directly  to  the  preparation  lab  in  Schefferville  under  supervision  of 
SGS – Geostat. Upon arrival at the Preparation Lab, samples came under the care of SGS – Geostat 
personnel.

11.1.2
Rotary Splitter RC Sample Size Reduction (2009-2012)
Starting  2009,  the  RC  drill  cuttings  were  split  with  a  rotary  splitter  mounted  directly  under  the 
cyclone. The Rotary splitter is divided into pie shape spaces and is equipped with a hydraulic motor. 
The speed of the rotation of the splitter and the closing of the pie shape spaces was set in order to 
have a 7.5-10 kg sample from the 3 metre rod sample. Cuttings from the remaining material were 
discarded  on  site.  As  part  of  the  QA/QC  program  the  cuttings  from  the  remaining  discarded 
material were routinely sampled. 
 
Upon arrival at the Sample Preparation Lab in Schefferville, samples came under the care of LIMHL 
personnel. The use of the rotary splitter sampling system demonstrated efficacy, therefore LIMHL 
decided to continue its use in future programs. 
 
Starting 2010, LIMHL followed the same on-site sample reduction as described above; however the 
samples  were  collected  in  the  pails  lined  with  Sentry  II  Micro  Pore  bags  which  allowed  water  to 
slowly drain through while capturing very fine sample material (Figure 11-2).

11.1.3
2006-2011 Trench Sampling
In 2006, 2008 and 2009 trenches were dug in several properties for resource estimations and ore 
body surface definition. The trenches were excavated with a Caterpillar 330 excavator with a 3-yard 
bucket. The excavator was able to dig a 1metre-wide trench with depths down to 3 m, which was 
enough to penetrate the overburden.  
 
Trenches were sampled on 3-metre intervals with the sample considered to be representative of the 
mineral content over that interval. After cleaning off the exposure, samples were collected from the 
sides  of  trenches.  Samples  were  collected  with  a  small  rock  pick  along  a  line  designated  by  the 
supervising geologist. In most cases the material sampled was soft and friable. 
 
The standardized procedures for the preparation and reduction of samples collected during the 2008 
and 2009 RC drilling campaigns were prepared by SGS – Geostat and adopted by LIMHL for its 
sample preparation laboratory in Schefferville.  
 
SGS – Geostat were not in possession of the exact sampling procedures carried out historically by 
IOC  but  verbal  information  from  former  employees  and  drillers,  suggests  that  the  described 
procedures is similar to that used by IOC during their activities in Schefferville.

11.2
Diamond Drill Core Sampling
Core was delivered from the rig to the company core shed on a regular basis by LIM employees or 
the  drill  contractors.  Geotechnicians  would  first  calculate  recovery  and  photograph  the  core.  A 
geologist would log the core and mark out sample intervals. After this, the geotechnicians would 
take a split of the core for assaying leaving a ½ split in the box for reference.
11.3
Sample Preparation and Size Reduction in Schefferville
At  the  end  of  every  shift,  the  samplers  and  geologist  delivered  the  samples  to  the  preparation 
laboratory. Sample bags were placed in sequential order on a draining table and a “Sample Drop 
Off” form was completed noting the date, time, person, number of samples and sample sequence. 
These bags were left over night, so that the fine material could settle.  
In 2012 core samples were brought to the preparation laboratory on a regular basis. Samples were 
place in sequential order in durable zip tied plastic bags. Sample numbers where written on the bags 
and a ticket was placed in the bag.
11.3.1
2008
Sample preparation and reduction was done at LIMHL’s preparation lab in Schefferville which was 
operated by SGS – Geostat personnel. In addition to the preparation lab personnel, SGS – Geostat 
also provided a geologist and two geo-technicians to perform sampling duties on one of the two rigs 
utilized for the drill program. This procedure was implemented in order to facilitate the shipping and 
analysis to the SGS-Lakefield laboratory in Ontario.  
 
The  majority  of  samples  have  a  width  of  3  m,  equal  to  the  length  of  the  drill  rods.  As  soon  as 
samples were delivered to the Schefferville preparation laboratory, they fell under the responsibility 
of  SGS  –  Geostat.  The  sampling  procedures  were  designed  and  formulated  by  SGS  –  Geostat. 
These procedures were followed in the preparation laboratory of Schefferville, Quebec. Note that 
samples obtained from RC drills were wet. All samples were dried and reduced by riffle splitting and 
then sent to SGS-Lakefield in Ontario. A witness portion of the samples is kept in Schefferville.
11.3.2
2009
The 2008 procedures were adopted in 2009 for sample preparation and sample reduction and were 
carried  out  by  LIMHL  in  its  sample  preparation  laboratory  in  Schefferville.  LIMHL  had  a  lab 
supervisor and well trained geo-technicians to perform the sampling duties on the two rigs utilized 
for  the  drill  program.  Some  later  improvements  were  made  to  the  procedures  but  overall  they 
followed guidelines developed by SGS in 2008. All samples were dried and reduced by riffle splitting 
prior to shipment for analyses at Actlabs in Ancaster, Ontario.

11.3.3
2010 - 2011
The  2010  and  2011  sample  preparations  consisted  of  cataloguing  and  drying  samples  before 
shipping.
11.3.4
2012
For the 2012 season, two types of samples were gathered: RC chips and diamond drill half core. 
 
RC drill cuttings and diamond drill core followed previously established procedures from following 
years. All samples were delivered to LIM’s James Mine Laboratory for sample preparation. The mine 
lab  would  prepare  a  pulp  and  coarse  reject  of  each  sample.  The  pulp  would  then  be  shipped  via 
Canada Post to Actlabs (Ancaster) and the coarse reject would be stored on site for future reference.

Sample Preparation at ACTLABS
During  the  2009  to  201  exploration  programs,  all  trench  and  RC  drill  samples  were  shipped  to 
Activation Laboratories (ACTLABS) facility in Ancaster, Ontario. Trench samples were taken to the 
preparation lab in Schefferville at the end of the day. The trench samples were not prepared in the 
same way as RC drill samples, being just bagged and shipped to the analytical laboratory. In 2012, all 
exploration samples were sent to the Silver Yard mine lab for preparation to reduce the samples to 
pulps and then sent to ActLabs in Ancaster, Ontario.  
 
As a routine practice with rock and core samples, ACTLABS ensured the entire sample was crushed 
to a nominal minus 10 mesh (1.7 mm), mechanically split (riffled) to obtain a representative sample,
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 54
and then pulverized to at least 95% minus 150 mesh (105 microns). All of their steel mills are now 
mild  steel,  and  do  not  induce  Cr  or  Ni  contamination.  As  a  routine  practice,  ACTLABS 
automatically used cleaner sand between each sample at no cost to the customer.  
 
Quality of crushing and pulverization is routinely checked as part of their quality assurance program. 
Randomization of samples in larger orders (>100) provides an excellent means to monitor data for 
systematic errors. The data is resorted after analysis according to sample number. The following is a 
table (Table 11-4) describing the rock, core and drill cuttings sample preparation protocols used at 
the ACTLABS.

Sample Analysis and security at ACTLABS
Following  is  a  description  of  the  exploration  analysis  protocols  used  at  the  Actlabs  facility  in 
Ancaster, Ontario.
11.8.1
X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis Code: 4C
To minimize the matrix effects of the samples, the heavy absorber fusion technique of Norrish and 
Hutton (1969, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, volume 33, pp. 431-453) are used for major element 
oxide analysis. Prior to fusion, the loss on ignition (LOI), which includes H2O+, CO2, S and other 
volatiles, can be determined from the weight loss after roasting the sample at 1050°C for 2 hours. 
The  fusion  disk  is  made  by  mixing  a  0.5  g  equivalent  of  the  roasted  sample  with  6.5  g  of  a 
combination of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate with lithium bromide as a releasing agent. 
Samples are fused in Pt crucibles using an AFT fluxer and automatically poured into Pt molds for 
casting.  Samples  are  analyzed  on  a  Panalytical-Axios  Advanced  XRF.  The  intensities  are  then

measured  and  the  concentrations  are  calculated  against  the  standard  G-16  provided  by  Dr.  K. 
Norrish of CSIRO, Australia. Matrix corrections  were  done  by  using  the  oxide  alpha  –  influence 
coefficients provided also by K. Norrish. In general, the limit of detection is about 0.01 wt% for 
most of the elements.

The  following  is  a  description  of  the  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  protocols  used  at  the 
ACTLABS facility. This description is based on input from ACTLABS.  
 
A  total  of  34  standards  are  used  in  the  calibration  of  the  method  and  28  standards  are  checked 
weekly to ensure that there are no problems with the calibration. 
 
Certified Standard Reference Materials (CSRM) are used and the standards that are reported to the 
client vary depending on the concentration range of the samples. 
 
The  re-checks  are  done  by  checking  the  sample’s  oxide  total.  If  the  total  is  less  than  98%  the 
samples are reweighed, fused and re-analyzed. 
 
The amount of duplicates done is decided by the Prep Department, their procedure is for every 50 
samples  only  if  there  is  adequate  material.  If  the  work  order  is  over  100  samples  they  will  pick 
duplicates every 30 samples.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 56
General QC procedure for XRF is: The standards are checked by control charting the elements. The 
repeats and pulp duplicates are checked by using a statistical program which highlights any sample 
that fails the assigned criteria. These results are analyzed and any failures are investigated using our 
QCP Non-Conformance (error or omission made that was in contrast with a test method (QOP), 
Quality Control Method (QCP) or Quality Administrative Method (QAP).
11.9
Sample Security and Control
LIMHL Sample Quality Assurance, Quality Control and Security 
 
From  the  beginning  of  the  2008  RC  drilling  &  trenching  campaign,  LIMHL  initiated  a  quality 
assurance and quality control protocol. The procedure included the systematic addition of in-house 
blanks, in-house reference standards, field duplicates, and preparation lab duplicates (not included in 
2010 sequence) to approximately each 25 batch samples sent for analysis at SGS Lakefield. 
 
The sealed sample bags were handled by authorized personnel from LIMHL and SGS – Geostat 
(2008 RC drilling campaign) and sent to the preparation lab in Schefferville. Authorized personnel 
did the logging and sampling in the secured and guarded preparation lab.  
 
Each sample was transported back to the preparation lab with a truck at the end of each shift by the 
lab  supervisor  on  a  regular  basis.  The  samples  were  transported  to  the  lab  near  Schefferville,  a 
warehouse facility rented by LIMHL. During the 2012 field season core boxes were brought back to 
the warehouse facility on a regular basis by LIMHL personnel. They were stacked either in crossbox 
formation or on core racks. All core boxes are sealed with wire before transport from the drill site. 
The  lab  was  locked  down  during  the  night.  Sample  batches  were  sealed  and  sent  by  train  or  by 
express  mail  (by  air).  Traceability  was  present  throughout  the  shipment  to  Lakefield  and/or 
Ancaster.
11.10
Field Duplicates
11.10.1
RC duplicates
The procedure included the systematic addition of field duplicates to approximately each 25 batch 
samples  sent  for  analysis  to  the  lab.  In  2008,  the  cuttings  from  the  second  and  third  exits  were 
routinely sampled every 25th batch. The 24th sample was collected at exit 2. The 26th sample was 
collected at exit 3. These samples went through the same sample preparation, analysis and security 
procedures  and  protocols  as  the  regular  3  metre  samples  collected  from  the  exit  1.  From  2009 
through  2012,  the  sample  was  split  by  a  cyclone  rotary  splitter.  One  half  of  the  material  was 
discarded  outside  the  drill,  and  the  second  half  was  sent  into  sampling  buckets  underneath  the 
splitter. The field duplicate was taken for the material discarded outside the rig at every 25th sample. 
The 26th sample was the duplicate of the 25th sample. This QA/QC procedure enabled SGS and 
LIMHL any bias in the RC sampling program to be verified.

11.10.2
DDH Duplicates
There we no field duplicates included in the 2012 field program only lab duplicates for DDH core.
11.11
Preparation Lab Duplicates
11.11.1
RC Lab Duplicates
The procedure included the systematic addition of preparation lab duplicates to approximately each 
batch of 25 samples sent for analysis at SGS-Lakefield. In 2008, a second portion of cuttings from 
the first exit size reduction procedure was routinely sampled every 25 batch similarly as described 
above. In 2009, the every 25th sample was taken the same way as a regular sample describe above. 
Its duplicate sample was tied empty to it. Once at the lab, the sample was dried, and riffle split 4 
times.  From  the  material  riffle  split,  a  lab  duplicate  was  composed.  In  2010,  there  was  no  lab 
duplicates because the sample bags were not riffle split. 
 
LIMHL started a quality assurance and quality control protocol for its 2008 RC, DDH, and trench 
sampling program. The procedure included the systematic addition of field duplicates, preparation 
lab  duplicates  to  approximately  each  25  samples  sent  for  analysis  at  SGS-Lakefield  along  with  a 
blank at every 50 sample. This protocol was adopted and used during the 2009 and 201 exploration 
programs with modifications mentioned above.
11.11.2
DDH Lab Duplicates
The procedure included the systematic addition of lab duplicates of approximately 1 in 25 samples 
sent to the lab for analysis. In 2012 a split of the sample pulp is made and sent as a blind sample to 
the laboratory.
11.11.3
Blanks
Blank samples were created onsite in Schefferville from barren slates located south east of the town. 
These  blanks  were  used  to  check  for  possible  contamination  in  laboratories.  Some  were  sent  to 
SGS-Lakefield and others to Corem and ALS-Chemex for verification of the average tenure in the 
blanks. Blank samples were inserted every 50 samples. SGS – Geostat homogenized an average 200 
kg of material on site at the preparation lab in Schefferville. LIMHL and SGS – Geostat also sent 
two  separate  batches  of  fifteen  (15)  blank  samples  to  the  Corem  and  ALS-Chemex  independent 
laboratories of Vancouver and Quebec City, respectively, for analysis. 
 
An average 4.82% Fe and 61.96% SiO2  was  noted  for  the  entire  batch  of  60  blank  samples.  For 
SGS-Lakefield, an average of 5.37% Fe and 61.40% SiO2 was noted. For ALS-Chemex, an average 
of 4.22% Fe and 62.60% SiO2 was reported. For COREM, an average of 4.34% Fe and 62.25% SiO2 
was reported.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 58
Since the original batch of 200kg LIMHL has retrieved more blank material from the same location 
and homogenized the material using similar techniques, further sample was retrieved in 2010 and 
2012 field seasons.  
 
During the 2012 field season blanks were inserted into the RC sample stream one (1) for every 50 
samples. The 2010 blank material was fully exhausted for the 2012 RC program, the similar type of 
blank material collected in 2012 was used for the DDH program and inserted into the DDH sample 
stream one (1) for every 20 samples sent to the laboratory.
11.12  Reference Material (Standard)
LIMHL  introduced  in-house  reference  material  (“standards”)  with  high  grade  James  Mineralized 
material collected from a bulk sample taken in 2008. In 2009, LIMHL sent 20 samples to Actlabs 
and  10  sent  to  both  SGS  Lakefield  and  ALS  Chemex  starting  the  process  of  characterizing  the 
standard  material.  In  2010,  there  were  additional  30  samples  of  the  high  grade  James  standard 
material sent to Actlabs and 40 samples sent to both SGS and ALS Chemex. There was a second 
standard  picked  which  was  composed  of  medium  grade  Knob  Lake  mineralized  material  with  50 
samples sent to SGS, Actlabs and ALS Chemex. The James Standard material was the only standards 
inserted into the sample sequence until 2010. In 2011 LIMHL introduced its in-house Knob lake 
standard into the sample sequence. The table below (Table 11-7) shows the results of the statistical 
analysis for each reference material.

11.12.1
2008 Exploration Program
The data verification of the iron (Fe), Phosphorus (P), Manganese (Mn), silica (SiO2) and alumina 
(Al2O3) values was done with the assay results from the 2008 RC drilling program. SGS – Geostat 
introduced a series of quality control procedures including the addition of preparation lab duplicates, 
exit 2 duplicates, exit 3 duplicates and blanks. SGS – Geostat supervised the RC sampling. In 2008, a 
total of 166 duplicates were taken and analyzed. SGS – Geostat followed the QAQC and considered 
the data to be precise and reliable. 
 
During the 2009 program, a total of 46 blanks were inserted. The analytical results showing that the 
results remained within ±1%, which is relatively good and unbiased.

11.12.2
2009 Exploration Program
LIMHL followed the same method of taking duplicates as in 2008. However, the field duplicate did 
not come from three  exits but from two. The field duplicate came from a single discharge tube that 
flowed outside of the rig into a bucket. The lab duplicate sample bag was left empty and stapled to 
the sample bag that contained the sample that would serve as the host for the lab duplicate. The 
duplicates were treated as normal samples, and were prepared, riffle split and sent to Actlabs for 
analysis. 
 
The analysis of data indicated that the repeatability of results is acceptable and the process of taking 
duplicates is good and reliable. There is very little variation in the data except for two (2) outliers, 
which could be a result of contamination while processing or taking the sample.
11.12.3
2010 Exploration Program
During 2010, the field duplicate came from a single discharge tube that flowed outside of the rig into 
a bucket. There were no lab duplicates taken because no riffle splitting was necessary. Samples and 
duplicates were collected and sealed using Sentry II Micropore Polywoven bags. These bags allowed 
the excess water to flow through catching the fines.  The  samples  were  dried  in  ovens  for  3-4hrs 
prior  shipping  or  storing.  There  were  a  total  of  54  duplicates  taken  over  the  course  of  the  2010 
program.  The  analysis  of  Fe  data  indicated  that  the  repeatability  of  results  is  acceptable  and  the 
process of taking duplicates is good and reliable. 
 
During the 2010 program, a total of 62 samples of blank material were systematically inserted in the 
sample batches sent for analyses. The results remained within the zone between the average value 
and the 2. This states that the sampling procedures within the lab are very good, and there is very 
little  to  no  bias.  Blank  sample  329707  that  went  outside  the  (±)  3  zones  is  possibly  related  to 
contaminated  blank  since  the  standards  and  duplicates  included  in  the  same  batch  showed  not 
apparent problems.

2011 Exploration Program
During the 2011 RC drilling and exploration program, LIMHL followed its quality assurance and 
quality  control  protocol.  The  procedure  included  the  systematic  addition  of  in-house  blanks,  in-
house reference standards, field duplicates, and preparation lab duplicates to approximately each 25 
batch samples sent for analysis at ACTLABS. 
 
A  total  of  75  blank  samples  were  used  to  check  for  possible  contamination  in  the  analytical 
laboratories during the 2011 campaign including 22 on the RC drilling at Houston. A total of 16 out 
of the 75 blanks were outside the ±3σ line, however, all of the blanks are under 5% iron grade. SGS 
- Geostat suggested that LIMHL to buy pure blanks that do not contain any iron. 
 
In 2011, LIMHL inserted 76 in-house standards. There may have been some potential errors within 
the KL-STD; however most of the standards demonstrated controlled results.

In 2011 LIMHL sent 141 field duplicates. No preparation lab duplicates were analysed in 2011. The 
correlation is good between original and field duplicate results however, a bias was found. The bias 
identified in this statistical analysis of the 2011 samples indicates that the Fe grades may have lower 
analytical results for Fe. Furthermore 82% of the Fe % sample data is less than ±10% different and 
63% of the data is less than 5% different. There is not a significant difference but there is a bias 
trend towards the field duplicates.

2012 Exploration Program
During the 2012 Exploration season, LIMHL drilled holes with both RC rigs and DDH rigs. RC 
drilling was conducted at both Malcolm 1 and Houston, and the diamond drilling was conducted for 
Houston. 
 
For  the  2012  RC  drilling  and  diamond  drilling  exploration  program,  LIMHL  followed  its  quality 
assurance and quality control protocol (QAQC). The procedure included the systematic addition of 
in-house  blanks,  in-house  reference  standards,  field  duplicates,  and  preparation  lab  duplicates  to 
batch samples sent for analysis at ACTLABS. 
 
During the 2012 RC drilling and exploration program, LIMHL followed its quality assurance and 
quality control protocol. The procedure included the systematic addition of in-house blanks (1 per 
50), in-house reference standards (1 per 50), field duplicates (1 per 25). The approximate amount of 
control samples is 8% of the batch samples sent for analysis at ACTLABS. These sample bags were 
sent to the sample receiving warehouse empty, and the appropriate material was put into the bags 
before  going  to  the  prep  laboratory  in  Silver  Yard.  The  field  duplicates  (or  rig  duplicates)  were 
collected from the “discard line”. 
 
For the 2012 DDH drilling and exploration program, LIMHL inserted control samples along with 
their  diamond  drill  samples.  For  the  2012  field  season  the  standards  remained  the  same  as  those 
used for the RC program. The procedure included the systematic insertion of in-house blanks (1 per 
20), in-house reference standards (1 per 20), and lab duplicates (1 per 25). The total is about 14% of 
the  samples  submitted  for  analyses  are  control  samples.  The  lab  duplicates  constitute  a 
representative split of the original pulp.
11.12.6
Blanks
A  total  of  170  blank  samples  were  used  to  check  for  possible  contamination  in  the  analytical 
laboratories during the 2012 campaign, including 21 for the RC campaign at Houston and Malcolm 
1 and 149 for DDH holes including metallurgical and geotechnical holes. During 2008, SGS Geostat 
prepared blank samples from a known slate outcrop near Schefferville (Section 11.11.3). Since then 
LIM has accumulated more material from the same outcrop, homogenized it using similar processes 
to create additional blank material. 
 
For QAQC on the diamond drill rig, while diamond drill core was being logged, the QAQC sample 
locations  were  marked  out  by  the  logging  geologist.  A  geotechnician  then  inserted  standards  and 
blanks as required approximately 1 per 20 samples.

The only sample that does not fall within the zones of acceptance is 527460 for both the iron and 
silica content. The results for the blanks samples up to 524757 show small variance and fall within 
the zones of acceptance. However, after sample 524757, the blanks show a drastic fall in the iron 
content, and drastic rise in the silica content. The first sample after 524757 is 525220, which is a 
blank for the diamond drill samples, and the rest of the blank samples after 525220 pertain to blanks 
within the diamond drill samples, as shown in Figure 11-3 and Figure 11-4. 
 
The blank material used with the RC samples (samples up to 524757) was from material collected 
and homogenized during 2010. However, this material ran out, and was replenished in 2012. The 
newly  collected  material  started  to  be  used  with  the  blanks  introduced  into  the  diamond  drill 
samples. The blank material was collected from the same Dolly Shale along the road to Houston. 
The only explanation that could have caused the drastic change from the RC blanks to the diamond 
drill blanks is that the material may have been collected from deeper down from the surface of the 
Dolly Shale. The material collected in 2010, were surface samples, and material was not collected 
deeper from the surface.

Given the variability of the new blank material compared with that of the 2008 results, Figure 11-5 
was plotted using the standard deviation of the 170 blanks from 2012 as the control gates. With that 
in mind only two samples are outside the +3σ. We also get a clear picture of how the mean has 
shifted  down  for  the  new  material.  Given  this  information,  it  may  be  difficult  to  interpret 
contamination issues, however since all the values are below 9% Fe and the mean value is 3.53% Fe 
then it is not likely there is any major contamination. This is further supported by the analysis of the 
standards in the next section. It is recommended that LIMHL buy pure blanks (either commercial 
silica sand or decorative pebbles) that do not contain any iron.

To  quantify  the  number  of  standards  between  each  standard  deviation  (performance  gate)  the 
following table (Table 11-8) has been tabulated. The number of samples outside of the ±3σ based 
on the 2008 defined control gates is 126 samples or 90% of the samples. Performance gates were 
recalculated based only on the ACTLABS results of the 140 samples in the second chart and with a 
wider standard deviation and lowered mean. Only 2 samples are outside the natural 3rd standard 
deviation,  or  1.4%  of  the  data.  If  LIM  does  not  want  utilize  store  bought  blank  material,  it  is 
recommended to re-homogenize the material and do another round of inter-laboratory testing.

In 2012, LIMHL inserted a total of 163 standards for analysis, of which 88 were James standards, 
and 75 were Knob Lake standards. Figures Figure 11-7 and Figure 11-8 show the results plotted for 
JM-STD and KL-STD. Because the standards are the same for RC and DDH drilling we combined 
them all into one study. 
 
For the James standard two (2) of the standards were below the -3σ and four (4) above the +3σ for a 
total of 7% of the samples outside of the ±3σ lines. Slightly better performance was witnessed for 
the SiO2 results with only 6% of the samples outside of the ±3σ lines. There appears a shift in the 
population for 2012 compared with 2011, where the 2012 results are slightly higher than the average 
and the 2011 results were slightly lower than the average. However, both years have proven to be 
adequately within the performance gates. The slight bias high is reflected in the sign test for iron
(0.39≰(cid:2777).(cid:2784)(cid:2780)≰0.61), and the silica values have no apparent bias which is also reflected in the sign 
test (0.39(cid:3407)(cid:2777).(cid:2781)(cid:2782)(cid:3407)0.61). Based on the charts for iron and silica of the James Standards I would
conclude there is not likely any serious contamination or mislabels or other issues.  
 
The  James  standard  samples  that  fell  outside  the  zones  of  acceptance  for  the  iron  content  are 
526850, 528250, 528630, 528810 and 529790; those for silica content are 526450, 526490, 526690, 
526850 and 528630. There are only two samples that fell outside the zones of acceptance for both 
the iron and silica content, which are 526850 and 528630 as shown in Figure 11-7 and Figure 11-8. 
It is possible that the material for these two standard samples could have been composed of slightly 
lower grade material within the larger barrel of the standard material.

For the knob lake standards only one (1) standard was below the -3σ and zero (0) above the +3σ for 
iron, representing 1% of the samples outside the control limits. Furthermore there were three (3) 
silica value above the +3σ and none below the -3σ. Again there is a bias high for the iron values, as
visible on the figure and from the sign test (0.38≰(cid:2777).(cid:2785)(cid:2784)≰0.62), and there is no apparent bias
from the sign test for silica however there is a slight elevated mean compared to the 2008 control 
values (8.6% vs. 8.3% SiO2). Regardless of the sign test bias the entire population of iron results 
were lower than the +3σ indicating there is no significant bias high. There was one standard with 
low iron value and that may warrant further investigation. 
 
The Knob Lake standards that fell outside the zones of acceptance for the iron content are 527630, 
and 528930. For the silica content are 525550, 527630 and 528930. There are two samples that fell 
outside the zones of acceptance for both the iron and silica content, which are 527630 and 528930, 
illustrated in Figure 11-9 and Figure 11-10. The explanation for this could be that the material for 
these  two  standard  samples  could  have  been  composed  of  slight  amount of lower grade material 
within the larger barrel of the standard material.

Lim  sent  in  82  samples  to  ACTLABS  and  also  to  ALS  Chemex  for  duplicate  analysis.  The 
coefficient of correlation is 0.9937 for iron and 0.9902 for silica, indicating a strong correlation. The 
t-stat for silica does not indicate any bias; however, there is a bias for iron, even though the two sets 
are  strongly  correlated  (from  Figure  11-11),  there  is  an  obvious  bias  high  on  iron  results  from
ACTLABS  compared  to  ALS,  this  bias  is  also  reflected  in  the  sign  test  (0.39≰(cid:2777).(cid:2779)(cid:2779)≰0.61)
indicting that only 22% of the time the ALS values are higher than ACTLABS, and a comparison of 
the means 35.115Actlabs T_Fe% versus 34.832ALS T_Fe%. There is no strong bias for silica values. 
Even though there is significant bias, it is not concerning because the correlation is so high and the 
absolute  difference  between  samples  is  so  low,  furthermore  almost  all  of  the  data  is  within  20%

difference. The bias could be explained by small differences in analytical techniques and digestions at 
the two different labs. From Figure 11-12 most of the data is below the 1% line and all of the data is 
below  the  5%  line,  using  the  10%  line  as  a  cautionary  line  and  the  20%  line  as  warranting 
investigation. The spread of the data indicates that as grade increases there is less difference between 
the pairs of results between laboratories, and there is a small overall difference in the two values 
compared with the paired mean value for iron and silica. This indicates that there are no extremely 
strong outliers. 
 
There were three samples that were outsiders on the analytical graphs for the iron and silica content, 
which were 524892, 529893 and 529879.  Figure 11-11 and Figure 11-13 show these results. 
 
It  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  good  correlation  between  ACTLABS  results  and  ALS  Chemex 
results, indicating that there is confidence in the exploration results.

DDH Duplicates
Lim sent in 92 duplicate samples to ACTLABS from their DDH core. The coefficient of correlation 
is 0.9989 for iron and 0.9963 for silica, indicating a very strong correlation. The t-stat for iron and 
silica does not suggest any serious bias, the sign test may indicate a small bias for silica but no bias 
for iron, and in fact iron has a 50:50 high and low distribution for DDH duplicates. The result of the 
DDH duplicate testing is indicative of very strong repeatability of core samples.  
 
There were three samples that were considered as outsiders on the analytical graphs for the iron and 
silica content, which were 526720, 528125 and 526367.  Figure 11-15 and Figure 11-17 illustrate the 
comparisons, with Figure 11-16 and Figure 11-18 summarizing statistical significance. 
 
All of the pairs have values less than 10% on the HARD plots and most of the data less than 1%. 
There  is  demonstrated  similarity  between  the  difference  of  the  pairs  and  their  paired  mean, 
providing reasonable correlation. Of the 5 points above the 1% line on the hard plots for silica and 
iron 3 of those points have paired values near 1% or less. It is expected that there may be higher 
variation at lower grades.

RC Duplicates
LIM sent in 63 RC duplicate samples to ACTLABS. The coefficient of correlation is 0.8786 for iron 
and 0.8872 for silica. This is a fairly strong correlation, however less strong than the DDH samples. 
There is no bias indicated by the sign tests and a mild bias for silica indicated by the t-test. The mild 
bias  indicates  a  slight  high  for  the  original  samples.  There  may  be  a  few  explanations  for  this 
however the bias is not very strong. From the paired duplicate charts one can easily see that there is 
more deviation from the 50:50 line compared to DDH samples. There is one large outlier sample # 
525725 and LIM may want to follow up on it, potentially there could be a mislabeled sample? The 
error could be related to the way samples are collected on the RC rig, potential the discard hose was 
not distributing the sample evenly or fines have been preferentially washed1.  
 
There were seven samples that were outsiders on the analytical graphs for the iron and silica content, 
which were 524675, 525000, 525600, 525650, 525675, 525725, 525900, and 525925. There were two 
additional samples that were outsiders on the silica content graphs which are 524800, and 525050 as 
shown in Figure 11-19 and Figure 11-21. The explanation for this would be the way in which the 
duplicates were taken. The discard hose could have been partially blocked at the time of taking the 
sample, and the acquired ¾ was not going through the discard hose. Also, finer grained material 
could  have  leaked  or  washed  through  the  microfiber sample bags, which could have affected the 
results.

1 Potentially since the discharge sample has larger volume, the silica is washing down sample from the water pressure on the discharge hose, and so 
when  it  is  time  to  take  a  subsample  they  have  been  separated.  This  would  account  for  why  the  duplicate  has  elevated  iron  and  reduced  silica. 
Furthermore because the samples are significantly smaller than the duplicates it is easier to take closer to 100% of the sample.

 Second Run Duplicates
LIMHL sent 117 duplicates twice to Actlabs for duplicate analysis. The coefficient of correlation is 
0.9938 for iron and 0.9910 for silica. This is a strong correlation, and indicates good repeatability of 
sample analyses. The difference in the means for both iron and silica is <1%, there is a bias high on 
iron  for  the  duplicate  samples,  with  78%  of  the  samples  being  greater  than  the  original.  All  the 
evidence  points  to  strong  correlation  between  samples,  furthermore  repeatability  of  the  samples. 
There were two samples that were outsiders on the analytical graphs for the iron and silica content, 
which were 524889 and 524892. 
 
The hard plots illustrate good correlation between the differences in the pairs and there paired mean, 
and only one point is above the 1% line and that sample has less 4% paired mean iron value, the ore 
grade material has strong correlation.

11.15  Assay Correlation of Twinned Holes
The  data  verification  was  done  on  the  iron  (Fe)  and  silica  (SiO2)  assay  results  from  the  IOC 
historical RC drill results and the 2008-2010 RC drilling programs results. LIMHL twinned some 
IOC RC holes in order to verify the iron (Fe) content. A total of 6 paired RC holes from Houston 
were considered. Correlation coefficients showed adequate correlation. Refer to Figure 11-27 and 
Figure 11-28.  
 
Visual  analyses  of  the  selected  pairs  also  show  satisfactory  correlation.  A  hole  showed  lower 
correlation  due  to  low  grade  ore  layers  within  the  deposit  and  sharp  changes  because  of  the 
structural complexity (see Figure 11-13).

SGS Data Validation Prior to 2012
The data verification of the iron (Fe), Phosphorus (P), Manganese (Mn), silica (SiO2) and alumina 
(Al2O3) values were done with the assay results from the 2008 RC drilling program. SGS – Geostat 
introduced a series of quality control procedures including the addition of preparation lab duplicates, 
exit 2 duplicates, exit 3 duplicates and blanks. SGS – Geostat supervised the RC sampling. In 2008, a
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 79
total of 166 duplicates were taken and analyzed. SGS – Geostat followed the QAQC and considered 
the data to be precise and reliable. 
 
During the 2009 program, a total of 46 blanks were inserted. The analytical results showing that the 
results remained within ±1%, which is relatively good and unbiased. 
 
The analysis of data indicated that the repeatability of results is acceptable and the process of taking 
duplicates is good and reliable. There is very little variation in the data except for two few outliers, 
which could be a result of contamination while processing or taking the sample. 
 
During the 2010 program, a total of 62 samples of blank material were systematically inserted in the 
sample batches sent for analyses. The results remained within the zone between the average value 
and the 2. This states that the sampling procedures within the lab are very good, and there is very 
little  to  no  bias.  Blank  sample  329707  that  went  outside  the  (±)  3  zones  is  possibly  related  to 
contaminated  blank  since  the  standards  and  duplicates  included  in  the  same  batch  showed  not 
apparent problems. 
 
The assay results of the 2010 SGS check sampling campaign allowed confirming the presence and 
the iron and SiO2 content of the selected samples, as well as the integrity of the sample results used 
in the 2010 Houston resource estimation. With the exception of a limited number of assay results 
with a significant difference, we found the results to be adequate. A series of tests was performed 
considering the small amount of samples: Sign test, and Student normal test. 
 
In March 2011, SGS Geostat sent a total of 51 samples for analysis from 4 drill holes: RC-HU-053-
2010,  RC-HU-061-2010,  RC-HU-064-2010  and  RC-HU-074-2010.  The  samples  were  sent  to  the 
SGS-Lakefield  Laboratory  in  Lakefield,  Ontario  analysis  following  the  sample  preparation  and 
analytical procedures described in Section 11.4. 
 
Overall it shows good assay correlation. The Mn and Al2O3 and P sign tests and student normal T 
tests were inconclusive. However, the average difference LIM and SGS sample results were low for 
the Mn (1%). The difference of the average grades of the P (16%) and Mn (13%) appear high. SGS 
recommends  the  continuation  of  the  QA/QC  procedures  in  order  to  verify  more  precisely  these 
differences. 
 
During the site visit conducted from August 1st to 5th, 2011 by the author, Maxime Dupéré, P.Geo., 
a total of 78 mineralized field duplicates from the Houston deposit were collected from holesRC-
HU091-2011,  RC-HU094-2011,  RC-HU095-2011,  RC-HU077-2011,  RC-HU104A-2011,  RC-
HU106-2011 and RC-HU081-2011 under supervision of the author and submitted for whole rock 
analysis  at  SGS  Minerals  laboratory  in  Lakefield,  Ontario,  Canada.  The  duplicate  samples  were 
processed using the assay procedures described in Section 0.  
 
A statistical analysis of the selected 2011 original and duplicate analytical values involving a series of 
tests (Sign test, Student logarithmic test, Student normal test) shows a potential bias as 72% of the 
original values returned greater than the duplicate values for Fe (%).
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL    Page 80
There was a poor correlation (R2=0.4 for T_Fe and R2=0.3 for SiO2) between check and original 
assays both for iron and silica in 2011. Taking out the high Fe (Fe2O3) values from the graph, the 
correlations are better. The mean averages of the check and original samples assays do not differ 
significantly.
12.2
2012 Exploration
Since LIMHL decided to start drilling DDH holes during the 2012 field season, SGS decided to do 
independent  sampling  to  test  the  validity  of  the  diamond  drill  results.  Furthermore  SGS  did 
independent  sampling  of  the  RC  witness  samples,  for  the  Malcolm  1  deposit  since  it  was  not 
independently analyzed in previous years. During the field season of 2012 Matthew Halliday under 
the supervision of Maxime Dupéré selected 31 mineralized witness samples from the Malcolm 1 RC 
program  and  submitted  them  to  SGS  Minerals  laboratory  in  Lakefield,  Ontario  for  duplicate 
analysis. There were 5 samples from each hole RC-M-20-2012, RC-M-21-2012, RC-M-23-2012, RC-
M-25-2012, RC-M-27-2012 and 6  samples from RC-M-28-2012. Additionally,  during  the  site  visit 
conducted from November 6th to 9th, 2012 by Matthew Halliday, under the supervision of Maxime 
Dupéré  a  total  of  30  mineralized  field  duplicates  from  the  Houston  deposit  were  collected  from 
holes  DD-HU-138-2012  and  DD-HU-143-2012  and  submitted  for  whole  rock  analysis  at  SGS 
Minerals laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. The duplicate samples were processed using the 
assay procedures described in Section 11.2 Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2 show the correlation plots 
for the duplicate data versus the original data. A summary of the statistical analysis conducted on the 
data is shown in Table 12-1.
12.2.1
DDH Independent Validation - Houston
A statistical analysis of the selected 2012 original and duplicate analytical values involving a series of 
tests (Sign test, Student normal test) show no potential bias. It appears that the SGS values reported 
are larger 67% of the time, for iron and only 33% of the time for silica. The mean grade of iron for 
independent testing is slightly higher, indicating that LIMHL may be slightly conservative. 
 
Table 12-2 summarized the univariate statistics for both the original and duplicate values; there is 
not a significant difference between the means however that is a large difference for the minimum 
value  for  iron  and  the  maximum  value  for  silica.  There  is  the  possibility  of  a  sample  mix-up. 
Through inspection of the duplicate paired plots Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2 it appears that there is 
an outlier.

The following figures Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2 show a poor correlation (R2=0.40 for T_Fe and 
R2=0.40 for SiO2) between check and original assays both for iron and silica. Taking out one high Fe 
value sample# 31828 from the graphs, the correlations are better R2=0.73 for T_Fe and R2=0.73 for 
SiO2).

The mean averages of the check and original samples assays do not differ significantly, except the 
minimum  value  for  silica  is  32%  difference  increasing  the  mean  difference  slightly.  The  mean 
difference between iron values is approximately 1.9%. 
 
There  is  likely  a  sample  mix  up  when  the  spurious  value  is  remove  the  population  correlated 
reasonably well. It is recommended to reanalyze sample 31828 to confirm if further investigation is 
warranted.
12.2.2
RC Independent Validation – Malcolm 1
A statistical analysis of the selected 2012 original and duplicate analytical values involving a series of 
tests for the RC sample was conducted by taking selected witness samples and sending them to SGS 
Lakefield. The Sign tests show a potential bias high for the SGS samples of the original, however 
there  is  no  obvious  bias  with  the  Student  normal  test.  The  sign  test  bias  is  slightly  outside  the 
predefined criteria for both, and indicates the 72% of the time the SGS samples contain higher iron 
and silica. The mean grades are similar for both populations and have low relative differences ≤1% 
of iron and silica, indicating that LIMHL may be slightly conservative. 
 
Table  12-3  summarized  the  univariate  statistics  for  both  the  original  and  duplicate  values,  the 
populations are very similar, all of the relative differences are less than 3%, the relative difference in 
the  mean  is  approximately  1%  and  the  min/max  range  is  similar.  Through  inspection  of  the 
duplicate paired plots Figure 12-3 and Figure 12-4 it appears that the samples 524612 and 524713

have been mixed up at the laboratory. Otherwise there is excellent repeatability between labs for the 
Malcolm 1 samples, and the values are fit for purpose.

The following Figure 12-3 and Figure 12-4 show good correlation (R2=0.96 for T_Fe and R2=0.88 
for  SiO2)  between  check  and  original  assays  both  for  iron  and  silica.  These  are  very  good  values 
considering the nature of RC sampling and there was higher repeatability in this study than the RC 
duplicates taken by LIM. Potentially indicating that the witness sample provides a better duplicate 
than the reject however, it could also indicate that the samples are not a representative as the bulk 3rd 
sample.

Data Verification Conclusions and Recommendations
12.3.1
2012
The results of the 2012 data verification indicate that the RC drilling has very good correlation and 
no significant errors were detected. 
 
The RC method has dramatically improved since the last field season and errors with the method 
decreased significantly over the 2011 field season. 
 
A resample of DDH 31828 should be conducted to determine if there was an error in sampling or in 
the laboratory, the same for RC samples 524612 and 524713 to determine if the mix-up happened in 
the field or laboratory. 
 
In  the  first  author’s  opinion,  the  information  in  the  section  appears  to  be  consistent  and  not 
misleading.

The information below was provided by LIMHL.  
 
No mineral processing and metallurgical testing was done on the Malcolm 1 deposit. Although it lies 
in  line  with  the  Houston  deposits,  it  is  recommended  to  do  additional  tests  on  the  Malcolm  1 
deposit in order to corroborate the following information.

13.1.1
Midrex Test Program
In  1989  Midrex  Technologies  Inc.  (“Midrex”),  an  international  iron  and  steel  making  technology 
company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, sampled and tested lump ore sample # 625 from the 
Houston 1 deposit for standard raw material evaluation purposes. The sample analyses are presented 
in Table 13-1.

13.1.2
2006 Bulk sampling by LIM
Bulk samples from trenches at the Houston deposit were collected during the summer of 2006 from 
two  trenches  113 m  and  78 m  long  respectively.  Three  bulk  samples  of  some  600 kg  each  were 
collected from the Houston deposit trench for testing. The testing for compressive strength, crusher 
index and abrasion index were done at SGS Lakefield. The composite crushing, dry and wet screen 
analysis, washing and classification tests were done at “RPC – The Technical Solutions Centre” in 
Fredericton, New Brunswick. An additional five composite samples from the different ore zones in 
the trench were collected and tested in the ALS Chemex Lab in Sudbury for chemical testing. 
 
The  bulk  sampling  tests  produced  data  for  rock  hardness  and  work  indices  for  crushing  and 
grinding, average density data for the various ore zones as well as chemical data. The specific gravity 
tests, completed on the bulk samples, have shown that there was a possibility that the average SG is 
higher than the 3.5 which was used in the IOC calculations. Additional SG testing was completed 
during the 2009 exploration program, obtaining a Fe-dependant variable SG. 
 
The  SG  data  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  used  in  the  calculation  of  resource  and  reserve 
volumes while the chemical test results will be used to compare them with the historical IOC data 
from neighbouring drill holes. Table 13-2 shows the summary of the results of the tests on the 2006 
bulk samples for the various ore types.

SGS Lakefield Program
A  Bulk  Sample  program  was  undertaken  during  the  summer  of  2008.  Two  thousand  tonnes  of 
samples were excavated with a CAT-330 type excavator from the Houston 1 deposit. The excavated 
material  was  hauled  to  the  Silver  Yard  area  for  crushing  and  screening.  The  raw  material  was 
screened at approximately 6 mm into two products – a lump product (-50 mm+6 mm) and a sinter 
fine product (-6 mm). The material excavated from each deposit and the products produced from 
each deposit were kept separate from the others. 
 
Representative  200  kg  samples  of  each  raw  ore  type  was  collected  and  sent  to  SGS  Lakefield 
Laboratories  for  metallurgical  tests  and  other  (angle  of  repose,  bulk  density,  moisture,  and  direct 
head assay and particle size analysis determinations).  
 
Preliminary scrubber tests were performed. The potential of beneficiation by gravity was explored by 
Heavy Liquid Separation. Vacuum filtration test work was also carried out. The results of the bulk 
sample test are shown in Table 13-3 and Table 13-4.

The material collected from the 2008 bulk samples at both Houston and the James deposits was sent 
to  a  number  of  other  laboratories  for  additional  test  work,  including  Derrick  Corporation  for 
screening tests, Outotec.
13.1.4
Derrick Corporation (2008)
Eight  -  45-gallon  drums  of  the  sample  were  sent  to  Derrick  Corporation  in  Buffalo,  NY  for 
screening test work. The purpose of the test work was to determine optimum screen capacity and 
design for sinter fines production. 
 
Different screen openings were used to investigate the dependence of the recovery from the size of 
the product. 
 
The test results proved that both 300 µm and 600 µm openings give very promising recoveries:

Trench Samples Metallurgical Test Program
Presented in this section is a description of the metallurgical test works done by third party testing 
facilities  on  Houston  trench  samples.  In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2011,  LIM  collected  bulk  trench 
samples from Houston ore and they were classified as Hanging Wall (HU1), Foot Wall (HU2) and 
DRO.  These  samples  were  sent  to  the  following  laboratories  for  the  following  designated  tests

13.2.1
Mineralogical Tests and Head Assay
Reports  of  the  laboratories  that  performed  mineralogical  testing  on  the  trench  samples  have 
indicated that the main iron bearing minerals for all three types are hematite (Fe2O3) and goethite 
(FeO(OH)).  Gangue  is  predominated  by  quartz  (SiO2),  with  minor  amounts  of  kaolinite  and 
relatively lower levels of other impurities such as Al2O3, MgO, P2O5, CaO, etc. RPC noted that the 
Fe oxides are present as liberated grains, as binary grains of hematite and goethite or as complex 
particles  with  quartz.  In  the  silicon  deportment  analysis  done  by  SGS  on  all  three  samples,  it  is 
shown that most of the Si exists as quartz, Fe-silicates and micas/clays.  
 
Based on the reported values of three testing facilities, the average head assays of HU1, HU2 and 
DRO are 63% and, 55.47% and 60.67% Fe, respectively.

Density Separation Test
Outotec performed a series of tests to determine how well the trench samples would respond to 
Floatex Density Separator and also to determine what set of conditions will result to highest silica 
rejection in the final product. Materials of particle size -8mesh (-2.38mm) were screened out from 
the three samples and were subjected to density separation tests. The parameters that were varied in 
the study were Floatex “set point” and teeter water. Outotec reported recoveries of 80.8%, 85% and 
80.3% for HU1, HU2 and DRO respectively, using the best set of conditions from this set of tests. 
Generally, highest iron recoveries were achieved at lower “set point” and lower teeter water settings. 
Outotec noted that in the size fraction tested, for all three samples, iron minerals are insufficiently 
liberated  from  silica  as  indicated  by  the  nearness  of  the  iron  recovery  to  weight  recovery.  The 
following  is  a  table  (Table  13-9)  showing  the  best  recoveries  achieved  by  Outotec  on  the  trench 
samples, including the set of conditions used.

As part of the density separation studies on the trench samples, MBE carried out jigging tests on the 
lump ore (+8mm-30mm) and sinter fines (+1mm-30mm) portion of HU1 and HU2 using a pilot 
scale BATAC 0510. In their report, MBE described some basic features of the BATAC jig including 
the parameters that were varied in the tests such as the number of strokes per minute, the stroke 
diagram,  working  air  pressure  and  the  amount  of  hutch  water.  Significant  amount  of  ultra-fine 
materials (-15micron) was observed on surfaces of the lump and sinter fines BATAC feed for both 
ore types. Further investigation on the chemical characteristics of the ultra-fines fraction revealed 
that an increase of 1-3%Fe could be attained on the feed material grade just by separating this size 
range  from  the  coarse  fractions.  Excluding  the  positive  effect  of  ultra-fines  removal,  a  set  of 
performance curves was generated by MBE on the jigging performance of the BATAC jig for HU1 
and HU2. From these curves, it can be concluded that the beneficiation of the HU1 lump ore and 
sinter fines using BATAC is impractical because both fractions are already marketable in grade and 
that only minimal upgrading is achieved in jigging these fractions. The performance curves of HU2 
however  show  that  the  jigging  the  lump  ore  and  sinter  fines  portion  yields  98%  and  51%  of 
concentrate at 60% Fe grade.

LIM also instructed RPC to conduct jigging tests on the scrubbed lump ore (+8mm-25mm) and the 
sinter  fines  (+1mm  -8mm)  products  of  HU1,  HU2  and  DRO.  Mineralogical  tests  done  by  RPC 
revealed,  however,  that  the  scrubbed  products  for  testing  contain  relatively  high  percentage  of 
hematite and low amount of gangue in the trench samples. With this, RPC thought of initially doing 
a heavy media separation (HMS) tests to determine the theoretical ratio of float and sink minerals, 
which  were  agreed  upon  by  LIM.  The  HMS  results  utilizing  tetrabromoethane  (SG  2.97)  and 
Methylene iodide (SG 3.31) as media, have resulted to very low amount of “float” materials for the 
size fractions tested for all ore types. RPC concluded that most of the silica or gangue materials had 
already been removed from the lump ore and sinter fines in the scrubbing test thus leaving them 
with very small amount of low SG impurities. Gravity concentration methods including jigging are 
therefore impractical for the coarse fractions of the trench samples.

13.3
Scrubber Test
Due to the expected high amount of mica/clay on the Houston deposit, having a material scrubbing 
stage could be very critical and advantageous in the beneficiation process. LIM recognized the need 
to  investigate  the  importance  of  a  pre-washing  step  and  have  instructed  Met-Solve  and  RPC  to 
conduct scrubber tests on the trench samples.
13.3.1
Process Parameter
Scrubber tests conducted by Met-Solve were geared towards defining the basic process parameters 
for  the  pre-washing  stage  specifically  the  determination  of  the  optimum  rate  of  agglomerate 
disintegration as a function of time and the pulp density, as well as defining the level at which the 
rocks can be freed from fines and clay adherence. Scrubber tests were performed at 50%, 60% and 
65% solids on each of the iron ore samples (HU1, HU2 and DRO). Thirty seconds scrubbing period 
intervals were planned with a visual inspection to be done after the end of each period to assess the 
need to extend the washing process. Based on the report of Met-Solve, “near complete scrubbing” 
was achieved on the first period for all the trench samples even at the highest pulp density tested 
(65% solids).

weight, respectively.

Fe Distribution Relative to Size Fraction
Further to the study conducted by Met-Solve, RPC also did scrubber tests on the trench samples 
and performed whole rock chemical analysis of the scrubber products. After carrying out material 
scrubbing,  the  washed  product  was  screened  using  sieve  sizes  25mm,  8mm  and  1mm  thereby 
producing four products - bulk lumps (+25mm), lump ore (+8mm-25mm), sinter fines (+1mm -
8mm), and fines (-1mm). The weight of each fraction was determined and sent for assaying. The 
summary of the significant information from the chemical analysis is shown in Table 13-12.

RPC reported that for all the trench samples, the fractions of scrubbed product that is larger than 
1mm, which includes bulk lump, lump ore and sinter fines, contain more than 60% iron and less 
than 5% silica and are therefore could be generally sold directly to smelters. The significant weight 
fraction  and  the  high  silica  content  of  the  fraction  less  than  1mm  has  dictated  the  need  of  a 
concentration stage to upgrade its %Fe.
13.4
Magnetic Separation Test
MBE  and  RPC  tested  the  possibility  of  upgrading  the  -1mm  and  +0.425mm  size  fraction  of  the 
trench samples by Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS). In order to come up with 
sufficient amount of material for testing, the two laboratories crushed and screened the as-received 
trench  samples  to  achieve  the  target  sizes.  Process  parameters  affecting  WHIMS  separation 
efficiency were varied to determine the most effective operating conditions.  
 
MBE tested HU1 and HU2 samples using a Jones P40 WHIM, which was operated at 2.5mm gap 
groove plate setting and with wash and scouring water flow rate equivalent to 115m3/h (@6 bar) 
and  58m3/h  (@3  bar)  for  a  Jones  DP317  that  is  240times  larger  in  capacity  than  P40  model. 
Magnetic field intensity and feed solid concentration were the two test parameters varied. The test 
were  conducted  at  magnetic  field  intensities  of  8,000,  9,000  and  11,000  Gauss  and  at  solid 
concentrations of 500 and 550g/L. WHIMS test results show that the -1mm portion of the trench 
samples was upgradable by a concentration ratio of 1.3 using the optimum test conditions for these 
sets of test. The table below (Table 13-13) shows that highest Fe recoveries for combined mags and 
“mid” on HU1 and HU2 were achieved using magnetic field setting of 11,000 Gauss at 500g/L feed

RPC conducted WHIMS tests on the three as-received samples of HU1, HU2 and DRO as well as 
on  scrubber  lump  ore  and  sinter  fines  products  that  were  crushed  to  pass  0.425mm  screen.  The 
WHIMS magnetic (mags) and non-magnetic (non-mags) products produced on all tests were sent 
for  chemical  analysis.  RPC  came  up  with  a  conclusion  that  WHIMS  mags  product  generally  has 
higher  iron  content  compared  to  non-mags  on  all  samples  tested.  MBE  concluded  in  their  test 
program that the fine fractions (-1mm+0.015mm) can upgrade easily to a high grade product of Fe 
64%+, but at an unfavorable mass recovery. MBE suggested that introducing a secondary magnetic 
separation stage will considerably improve the mass recovery to at least 70% and proposed further 
testing to confirm this assumption. 
 
For the purposes of the flow sheet and material balance calculations LIM assumed that the 70% 
mass  recovery  on  the  final  WHIMS  product  can  be  achieved  and  used  this  assumption  in  the 
calculations of the material balance
13.5
Settling Test
Met-Solve screened out the -150micron portion of the product from the 60% scrubber tests to be 
subjected  to  settling  tests.  Because  LIM’s  instruction  was  not  to  use  flocculent  in  the  tests,  the
SGS Canada Inc.

trench samples were then examined at low (27-33%) and high (44-51%) feed pulp densities. Settling 
curves of the HU2 and DRO at the two levels of pulp densities were shown by Met-Solve in the 
table below. Though the study concluded that all three samples settled fairly quickly reaching the 
inflection points in less than 2 hours, a settling curve was not plotted for HU1 because there was no 
noticeable interface from the settling material at the top of the cylinder. Met-Solve has reported that 
majority of the HU2 feed material settled very fast but its supernatant was very cloudy and never 
cleared up even after a month of settling period. The supernatant of HU2 was then found to contain 
0.013% solids.

Though  the  use  of  flocculent  was  not  favoured  by  LIM,  WesTech  also  conducted  sedimentation 
tests  with  the  addition  of  flocculants  to  determine  its  effect  on  the  settling  rates.  Different 
flocculants were utilized and assessed on the trench samples in terms of required dosage, flocculent 
structure, settling characteristics, effluent clarity, mixing requirements. WesTech concluded that at 
35wt% feed, all the samples settled well but took a longer period of time with no polymer addition, 
compared to when polymer was used in the sedimentation process. WesTech also determined that 
17g/t of Ciba Magnafloc 10 anionic polymer at an internal feed dilution of 18wt% achieved the best 
sedimentation performance on the trench samples.  
 
Based on WesTech test results an oversized thickener was assumed for the purposes of the Capital 
cost estimating. In addition LIM will be ready to introduce the use of a polymer if required. The 
potential usage of a polymer was not included in estimating of the operating costs as the dosages 
and the costs for it are considered negligible.

In the draft result summary of the no-flocculent settling tests conducted by SGS on the -150micron 
fraction of the Footwall (HU2) sample, it was discussed that the overflow was visually clear for most 
of  the  tests  with  TSS  values  between  0-15ppm.  The  predicted  underflow  density  of  70%  solids, 
however, was not achieved even after 95 min of thickening time but only went within the range of 
58wt% at the best conditions produced.
13.6
Filtration Test
A series of vacuum filtration tests were conducted by WesTech on the thickened DRO samples with 
an initial pulp density of 71wt% solids. Regardless whether flocculent was used in the thickening of 
the feed, the moisture content of the filter cake was in the range of 15-16%. The total suspended 
solids  (TSS),  however  is  relatively  high  for  the  vacuum  filtration  of  the  thickened  DRO  with 
polymer treatment at 1,850mg/L compared to when no polymer was used (1,600mg/L).

Conclusions and Future Works
The  results  of  the  metallurgical  tests  done  on  Houston  bulk  trench  samples  have  indicated  the 
amenability of the deposit to be processed using conventional iron ore processing methods.  
The  +1mm  size  fraction  of  HU1,  HU2  and  DRO  is  generally  of  marketable  grade  hence  the 
objective  of  the  concentration  process  for  Houston  deposit  will  be  mainly  to  upgrade  the  -1mm 
portion using either wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) or a hydrosizer. The settling 
test results on the -1mm products of the trench samples generally have shown good settling rates 
even without flocculent addition therefore implying the use of conventional thickener. The vacuum 
filtration of the -300micron is one of the areas that need to be investigated further though initial 
tests  have  produced  15-16%  cake  moisture.  DRA  recommends  exploring  other  filtration 
technologies such as plate filters. 
 
Confirmatory  tests  were  completed  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2012  involving  drill  core  samples  to 
establish more confidence to the beneficiation process on a wider plant feed variation and also to 
further refine the fine fraction processing of the Houston deposit. The confirmatory test program 
will be composed of similar set of tests as the bulk trench samples and will also include a deeper 
investigation  on  fines  and  ultra-fines  dewatering  (e.g.  sedimentation  and  filtration)  methods.  It  is 
expected that the output of the upcoming tests will fine tune the preliminary flow sheet established 
by DRA and LIM.

Mineral Resource Estimation 
14.1
Introduction
This section reports the results of the mineral resource estimate for the Houston and Malcolm 1 
mineral  deposits  based  on  new  analytical  data  sampled  from  the  drilling  completed  since  the  last 
mineral resource estimate of Houston , effective March, 6th, 2012.
The mineral resources presented herein are reported in accordance with the National Instrument 43‐
101  and  have  been  estimated  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  CIM  “Estimation  of  Mineral 
Resource  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practices”  guidelines.  Mineral  resources  are  not  mineral 
reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part 
of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 
 
The mineral resources have been estimated by Maxime Dupéré P.Geo., Geologist for SGS Geostat. 
Mr. Dupéré is a professional geologist registered with the Ordre des Géologues du Québec and has 
worked in exploration for gold and diamonds, silver, base metals and iron ore. Mr. Dupéré has been 
involved  in  mineral  resource  estimation  work  over  different  iron  deposits  on  a  continuous  basis 
since he joined SGS Canada Inc. in 2006, including the participation in mineral resource estimate for 
the James, Redmond 2B, Redmond 5, Knob Lake 1, Denault, Houston and Malcolm 1 iron deposits 
in 2009, 2010,  2011 and 2012. Mr. Dupéré is an independent Qualified Person as per section 1.5 of 
the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and by virtue of education, experience 
and membership in a professional organization.  
 
The present mineral resources were estimated and are disclosed according to the IOC Classification 
of Ore described in Table 14-1.

Specific Gravity (SG)
The SG testing was carried out on core using the conventional water immersion method. The SG 
was  obtained  by  measuring  a  quantity  of  core  in  air  and  then  pouring  the  core  into  a  graduated 
cylinder containing a measured amount of water to determine the volume of water displacement. 
The core was first coated with wax. A volume of water equal to the observed displacement is then 
weighed and the SG of the chips is calculated using the equation listed below.
SG=
A
Ww
SG=Specific Gravity of Sample 
A=Weight of Sample in air (dry) 
Ww=Weight of Water displaced
A variable specific gravity, Fe dependant, was used for the resource estimation which was calculated 
using the formula below.
SG (in situ) = [(0.0371 * Fe) + 1.877] * 0.85
The in-situ specific gravity (or density) was defined using the equation stated hereafter: ((Fe)*0.0371) 
+1.877)*0.85. This equation was updated using the latest core density measurements done during 
the 2012 diamond drilling campaign. The data used was restricted to valid Houston and Malcolm 1 
area mineralized core. According to and in relation to findings on the in-situ density on James deposit 
from reconciliation, it was decided to apply 15% porosity (0.85 in the equation) for added security.

Database and Validation
No significant inconsistencies were observed. LIM entered the historical data from IOC’s data bank 
listing print outs of drill holes, trenching and surface analyses. All of the data entry was done by 
LIM. SGS did a full validation of the data in 2009 and a limited but accurate validation of the 2010, 
2011 and 2012 data. Most 2009 to 2012 certificates of analysis were verified on an average of 10-
25% 
 
Most collar coordinate locations of drill holes were obtained using a Trimble DGPS with accuracies 
under 30cms. The locations of the remaining holes and trenches as well as geology were digitized
using MapInfo v9.5 on historical maps that were geo‐referenced using the DGPS surveyed points.
The estimated accuracy of the digitized data is approximately 5 m. Historical cross sections were also 
digitized using MapInfo/Discover software then imported into Gemcom Gems software. 
 
A total of 47 Diamond drill holes (LIM), 65 test pits, 237 RC (86 IOC & 151 LIM) drill holes and 
9153 assays (all) were used for the resource estimation. The database cut-off date is March 3rd, 2013.

Geological Interpretation and Modeling
This information was provided by LIM. The geological interpretation of the Houston deposit was 
entirely constructed by LIM according to available data of the area. The mineral resource estimate 
was  completed  using  a  3D  modeling  and  block  model  interpolation  methodology.  The  Houston 
Deposit  3D  solid  was  created  form  the  topographic  survey  and  interpreted  bottom  contact  from 
RC. The 2 solids (The main one and the small one to the SE) were validated by SGS Geostat.
The Houston Deposit geological interpretation was completed considering a cut‐off grade of 45% 
Fe; however the resources reported are based on a cut‐off grade of 50%Fe for iron ore and 50% 
Fe+Mn  for  manganiferous  iron  ore.  The  IOC  ore  type  parameters  of  Non‐Bessemer  (NB),  lean 
non‐Bessemer  (LNB),  high  silica  (HiSiO2),  high  manganiferous  (HMN)  and  low  manganiferous
(LMN)  were  considered  for  the  resource  estimation.  The  geological  interpretation  cut-off  date  is 
April 4th, 2013. 
 
The geological modeling of Houston was divided in 3 area, Houston 1, Houston 2 (2N and 2S) and 
Houston 3 was done using 130 vertical cross sections with 3 different directions of 314.4°, spaced 
approximately  30  m  apart  (100  feet).  Fifty  two  (52)  available  historical  paper  cross  sections  from 
IOC were digitized and used for the geological interpretation and modeling. The original geological 
and ore interpretations were updated with information obtained during recent exploration programs.

interpretation. 
 
The study area report covers an extension of 4.7 km long x 450 m wide and 160 m vertical. Further 
infill  drilling  will  be  required  to  better  define  mineralization  in  some  areas  within  the  ore  body 
subject of this report.

Block Modeling
The Houston DSO resources are estimated through the construction of a resource block model with 
small  blocks  on  a  regular  grid  filling  an  interpreted  mineralized  envelope  and  with  grades

interpolated from measured grades of composites drill hole or trench samples around the blocks and 
within the same envelope. Blocks are then categorized according to average proximity to samples.  
 
The  block  model  covers  a  maximum  strike  length  of  3.5  km,  a  maximum  of  150  m  wide  and  a 
maximum vertical depth of 150 m below surface. The block model was defined by block sizes of 
5x5x5 m with an orientation of 314.4°. The total of blocks is 108,998. The block centers are within 
the DSO envelope interpreted by LIM geologists. The parameters of the Block Model were done 
using  the  following  parameters.  The  interpolation  was  done  by  Ordinary  Kriging.  A  set  of  5,235 
(3m)  composites  were  used  all  within  the  Houston  mineralized  solid.  No  capping  was  used.  A 
variogram according to the composites was built for the elements Fe, Mn, and P, as well as SiO2 and 
Al2O3.

Composites Used for Estimation
The Composites were built from assay intervals along sub-horizontal trenches and vertical RC holes. 
Spacing between holes and trenches varies along the 3.5km strike length but at the best, we have 
trenches and RC holes on cross-sections at 30m distance along the N314.4 strike and the spacing 
between  holes  on  the  section  is  the  same  30m.  In  practice  most  sections  just  have  a  single  hole 
(owing to the narrow width of the mineralized zone) plus a trench at the top. Only composites with 
a  center  within  the  same  mineralized  envelope  as  blocks  are  kept  (some  trench  composites  are 
outside blocks because of the yes/no block elimination around the topographical surface) and they 
need have a minimum length of 1.5 m. Altogether, there are 5,235 composites with at least a %Fe 
and a %SiO2 grades within the DSO envelope. 
Table  14-4Table  14-4  summarises  the  statistics  of  the  composite  data.  Figure  14-1  shows  the 
histogram of the composites.

Distribution of Composite Grades
Data to be populated in blocks around composites are the %Fe, %SiO2, %Al2O3, %Mn and %P grades. Statistics 
of composite grades for those elements are on Table 14-4.Table 14-4 Histograms are on Figure 14-1. Some 
correlation plots appear on Figure 14-2.	
 
As expected the distribution of the %Fe of composites is negatively skewed (tail of low values) while 
the distribution of the %SiO2 is almost its mirror image (positively skewed with a tail of high values). 
This  can  be  explained  by  the  high  negative  correlation  of  %Fe  and  %SiO2  (Figure  14-2). 
Distribution  of  alumina  and  manganese  are  heavily  skewed  with  a  long  tail  of  high  values.  By 
comparison,  the  skewness  of  phosphorus  is  moderate.  Besides  that  of  %Fe  and  %SiO2,  all  other 
correlations between variables are weak.
14.3.6
Variograms of Composite Grades
The spatial continuity of the grades of composites is assessed through experimental correlograms 
computed along specific directions. A correlogram looks at the decrease of the correlation between 
samples as the distance between samples is increasing. It is presented like a variogram with a sill of 1 
by graphing the function 1- correlogram (Figure 14-3). 
 
Correlograms have been computed along the following directions:
  vertical holes and horizontal trenches at the same time i.e.an average of all directions with a
short 3m lag to get the nugget effect and average range (in black on Figure 14-3)
  vertical holes only with the same short 3m lag (in light green on Figure 14-3) 
  horizontal trenches only with the same 3m lag (in dark green on Figure 14-3)
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 106
  average N134.4 horizontal strike with a lag of 35m corresponding to the spacing between
sections (in red on Figure 14-3: Variogram of Houston 3m-composites
  average dip of 60o to the N44.4 with a lag of 45m between holes and trenches on sections (in
blue on Figure 14-3)
  average cross dip and strike with a dip of 30o to the N234 with the same lag of 45m between
holes and trenches on sections (in brown on Figure 14-3)
The  correlograms  of  %Fe  show  (1)  a  moderate nugget  effect  of  15%  (2)  ranges  between  50  and 
100m  (3)  the  same  long  range  of  about  100m  in  both  dip  and  strike  (the  two  experimental 
correlograms are at the same place) (4) a very similar continuity for vertical drill hole samples and 
horizontal trench samples.  
 
As  it  could  be  expected  from  the  strong  negative  correlation  between  %Fe  and  %SiO2  in 
composites, the correlograms of %SiO2 are basically the same as those of %Fe (Figure 14-2). 
 
The correlograms of two minor elements (%Al2O3, %Mn) show a higher relative nugget effect of 
25%. For %Al2O3, the anisotropy pattern looks the same as with %Fe and %SiO2 (best in strike and 
dip) but ranges are shorter (30 m for short and 60 m for long). For %Mn, the range along strike is 
longer (90 m) than the range along dip (60 m). For %P, the nugget effect is around 20% and range 
along strike looks even longer (135 m) while that along dip is about 75m and the short range is 45m.  
 
All  experimental  variograms  are  modelled  with  the  sum  of  a  nugget  effect  and  an  exponential 
function.

Block grades interpolation
The %Fe, %SiO2, %Al2O3, %Mn and %P grades of each of the 108,998 blocks 5x5x5m within the 
DSO envelope are interpolated from the grades of nearby composites through the ordinary kriging 
method which fully uses the characteristics of variograms of each variable. The grade interpolation 
for %Fe, %SiO2, %P and %Mn used the same variogram model for the Houston 1, 2 and 3. The 
whole of the Houston property was interpolated by using a single block model with a single set of 
composites. A combined variographic analysis was used to establish the formulas for the kriging of 
the grades within the blocks. However, due to the slight curvature of the mineralized structure, we 
elected to use three separate search ellipses that better respect the geological trends. The restriction 
Solids were Houston 2, Houston 1 and Houston 3 (see Figure 14-8). 
 
The interpolation was done in successive runs (Passes) with minimum search conditions (ellipsoids) 
relaxed from one run to the next until all blocks are interpolated. Each Houston area blocks (1, 2, 
and 3) were estimated separately Ellipsoids were created for each deposit area: Houston 1, Houston 
2 and Houston 3 using the following parameters of Table 14-5:
Table	14‐5:	Houston	Block	Model	Search	Ellipse	Summary
Pass
X (m)
Y (m)
Z (m)
The  maximum  number  of  composites  kept  in  the  search  ellipsoid  is  30  with  a  maximum  of  3 
composites from the same hole or trench. The minimum number of composites required in order to 
the interpolation to proceed is 7 (i.e. in a minimum of 3 different holes or trenches). That minimum 
is simply lifted in the third run in order to interpolate the very few un-interpolated blocks at that 
stage.  Those  conditions  are  set  to  insure  that  a block  grade  is  truly  interpolated  from  samples  in 
several holes and trenches (on different sides of the block) and not extrapolated from a few samples 
in  the  same  drill  hole  or  trench.  Statistics  of  block  grade  estimates  from  the  different  runs  are 
summarized on Table 14-6.

As a general rule, the variability of estimates (difference max.-min., %CV) decreases from first run to 
second run. A large majority of blocks is interpolated in the first run while just a few blocks are 
interpolated in the third and last run (see Table 14-7).

Block grade validation
Block grade validation was done revolving around the idea that grade estimates of blocks close to 
samples  should  reflect  the  grades  of  those  samples  (which  is  not  necessarily  the  case  when 
variograms  show  a  high  nugget  effect).  The  sections  and  benches  were  checked  with  blocks  and 
composites,  using  the  same  color  scale  for  grade  and  making  sure  that  they  visually  match.  SGS 
considers the validation as adequate and current.
14.3.9
Resources Classification
The  current  classified  resources  of  the  Houston  Deposit  reported  below  are  compliant  with 
standards as outlined in the National Instrument 43-101. SGS used the kriging variance as a factor 
of  classification.  The  kriging  variance  is  a  statistical  method  of  describing  the  quality  of  the 
estimation on each block and ranges from 0 to 1.1. This could also be considered as semi qualitative.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 112
The kriging variance on the Fe grade was retained. Kriging variance of each block was shown bench 
by  bench  and  a  manual  selection  by  contouring  was  done  in  order  to  construct  two  solids  of 
Measured  and  Indicated  category.  The  author  also  discovered  that  almost  the  same  classification 
could be done according to the average distances of composites used for the block Fe estimation. 
Distances less than 50 m could easily be considered in the measured category.  
 
Blocks having a kriging variance from 0 to 0.7 were taken into account for the measured category 
solid construction. Blocks having a kriging variance from 0.7 to 0.8 were taken into account for the 
indicated category solid construction. Blocks having a kriging variance from 0.8 and up were taken 
into  account  for  the  indicated  category  selection  (Figure  14-9,  Figure  14-10).  The  drilling  grid  of 
30m and the presence of trenches on most of the cross sections helped acknowledge the kriging 
variance and classification boundary as a preferred tool for classification.

Houston Mineral Resources Estimation Conclusion
The current resource estimates for the Houston deposit are of 31.3 million tonnes including LMN, 
HMN and HiSiO2 at a grade of 57.55% Fe in the Measured and Indicated categories. The resources 
presented  in  this  section  are  all  inside  the  property  boundary.  The  block  model  was  cut  by  the 
topography. The block percentage had to be at least 50% inside the mineralised solid in order to be 
considered in the resource estimation. 
 
The Houston deposit remains open to the northwest and southeast and at depth. The results of the 
resource estimates for the Houston deposit are shown in Table 14-8. The Mineral resources were 
classified using the following parameters: 
 
There  are  no  known  factors  or  issues  related  to  environment,  permitting,  legal,  mineral  title, 
taxation,  marketing,  socio-economic  or  political  settings  that  could  materially  affect  the  mineral 
resource estimate.

Database and Validation
No significant inconsistencies were observed. LIM entered the historical data from IOC’s data bank 
listing print outs of drill holes, trenching and surface analyses. All of the data entry was done by 
LIM.  
 
Most collar coordinate locations of drill holes were obtained using a Trimble DGPS with accuracies 
under 30cms. The locations of the remaining holes and trenches as well as geology were digitized
using MapInfo v9.5 on historical maps that were geo‐referenced using the DGPS surveyed points.
The estimated accuracy of the digitized data is approximately 5 m. Historical cross sections were also 
digitized using MapInfo/Discover software then imported into Gemcom Gems software. 
 
The Malcolm 1 (“Malcolm 1”) database contains a total of 3,058.63 m of RC drilling in 33 RC drill 
holes and 60 m of trenches for a total of 1,006 assays. In this summary, it includes 1 historical RC 
drill holes from IOCC (M1012CC, 71.63m, 25 assay results). The database cut-off date is February 
14th, 2013. 
 
Geological Interpolation and Modeling 
 
This information was provided by LIM. The geological interpretation of the Malcolm 1 deposit was 
entirely constructed by LIM according to available data of the area.
The Malcolm 1 Deposit geological interpretation was completed considering a cut‐off grade of 45% 
Fe; however the resources reported are based on a cut‐off grade of 50%Fe for iron ore and 50% 
Fe+Mn  for  manganiferous  iron  ore.  The  IOC  ore  type  parameters  of  Non‐Bessemer  (NB),  lean 
non‐Bessemer  (LNB),  high  silica  (HiSiO2),  high  manganiferous  (HMN)  and  low  manganiferous
(LMN) were considered for the resource estimation.  
 
The  Malcolm  1  Deposit  envelope  was  created  by LIM  using  the  validated  geological  information 
from surface and from RC drilling data. It comprise of 2 volumes (The main one and a small one to 
the SE). Both volumes were validated by SGS. Some errors of snapping were encountered but do 
not affect significantly the mineral resources. A total of 1 RC (IOC) and 32 RC (LIM) drill holes and 
1006 assays (all) were used for the resource estimation. The geological interpretation cut-off date is 
April 12th, 2013. 
 
The geological modeling was done using 45 vertical cross sections with average direction of 313°, 
spaced approximately 30 m-apart (100 feet). The solids were created from the sectional wireframes 
combining geological and mineralization interpretation. 
 
The study area of the Malcolm 1 deposit included in this report covers an extension of 1.3 km long x 
60  m  wide  and  120  m  below  the  surface.  Further  infill  drilling  will  be  required  to  better  define 
mineralization in some areas within the ore body subject of this report.

Block Modeling
The Malcolm 1 DSO resources are estimated through the construction of a resource block model 
with  small  blocks  on  a  regular  grid  filling  an  interpreted  mineralized  envelope  and  with  grades 
interpolated from measured grades of composites drill hole or trench samples around the blocks and 
within the same envelope. Blocks are then categorized according to average proximity to samples.  
 
The  block  model  covers  a  maximum  strike  length  of  1.3  km,  a  maximum  of  60  m  wide  and  a 
maximum vertical depth of 120 m below surface. The block model was defined by block sizes of 
5x5x5 m with an orientation of 313° totaling 30,826 blocks. The interpolation was done by inverse 
distance squared (ID2). A set of 1006 (3m) composites were used according to the mineralized solid. 
No capping was used. A variogram according to the composites was built for reference and did not 
outline  with  much  accuracy  any  specific  spatial  continuity  or  distribution  of  grade.  However,  it 
seemed that the strike and dip were the ones with the best continuity. The elements Fe, Mn, and P, 
as well as SiO2 and Al2O3, were estimated. 
 
The mineralized solid provided by the client was validated and met both SGS and LIM geological 
interpretation  parameters.  This  equation  was  updated  using  the  latest  core  density  measurements 
done during the 2012 diamond drilling campaign on the nearby Houston deposit. The data used was 
restricted to valid Houston area mineralised core. According to and in relation to findings on the in-
situ density on James deposit from reconciliation, SGS decided to apply 15% porosity (0.85 in the 
equation) for added security.

Composites Used for Estimation
Block model grade interpolation is conducted on composited assay data. A composite length of 3 m 
has  been  selected  to  reflect  the  3  m  RC  sampling  intervals  used  on  the  Malcolm  1  deposit. 
Compositing was done on the entire RC drill holes and trenches. A minimum length of 1.5 m was 
set. No capping was necessary.

At total of 381 composites was generated relevant to Malcolm 1. The modeled 3D wireframe of the 
mineralized envelope was used to constrain the composites. The Composites were built from assay 
intervals along sub-horizontal trenches and vertical RC holes. Spacing between holes and trenches 
varies  along  the  1.4  km  strike  length  but  at  the  best,  we  have  trenches  and  RC  holes  on  cross-
sections at 30 m distance along the N313 strike and the spacing between holes on the section is the 
same 30 m. In practice a significant amount of sections just have a single hole (owing to the narrow 
width of the mineralized zone) plus a trench at the top. Only composites with a center within the 
same mineralized envelope as blocks are kept (some trench composites are outside blocks because 
of the yes/no block elimination around the topographical surface) and they need have a minimum 
1.5 m documented length. All together there are 381 composites with at least a %Fe and a %SiO2 
grade within the DSO envelope
14.4.4
Distribution of Composite Grades
Data  to  be  populated  in  blocks  around  composites  are  the  %Fe,  %SiO2,  %Al2O3,  %Mn  and  %P 
grades.  Statistics  of  composite  grades  for  those  elements  are  on  Table  14-10.  Histograms  are  on 
Figure 14-11. Some correlation plots appear on Figure 14-12. 
 
As expected the distribution of the %Fe of composites is negatively skewed (tail of low values) while 
the distribution of the %SiO2 is almost its mirror image (positively skewed with a tail of high values). 
This  can  be  explained  by  the  high  negative  correlation  of  %Fe  and  %SiO2  (Figure  14-12). 
Distribution  of  alumina  and  manganese  are  heavily  skewed  with  a  long  tail  of  high  values.  By 
comparison,  the  skewness  of  phosphorus  is  moderate  Besides  that  of  %Fe  and  %SiO2,  all  other 
correlations between variables are weak (best with R around 0.25 are between %SiO2 and %Al2O3 
 
(positive), %Mn and %Fe (negative) and %Al2O3 and %P (positive).

Block grades interpolation
The %Fe, %SiO2, %Al2O3, %Mn and %P grades of each of the 30,795 blocks 5 x 5 x 5 m within the 
DSO  envelope  were  interpolated  from  the  grades  of  nearby  composites  through  the  Inverse 
Distance Squared (ID2) method of estimation. 
 
The interpolation was done in 2 successive runs (passes) with minimum search conditions relaxed 
from one run to the next until all blocks are interpolated. The basic search ellipsoid (to collect the 
nearby  composites  around  a  block  to  interpolate)  is  oriented  according  to  the  anisotropy  of 
variogram i.e. its long radius is along the horizontal N313 strike, its intermediate radius is along the 
average dip of 60° to the N47. Two ellipsoids with the following parameters were used. The first 
pass was done with an ellipsoid of 50 m by 50 m by 25 m. Those dimensions are simply doubled in 
the second interpolation run (Table 14-11).

The  maximum  number  of  composites  kept  in  the  search  ellipsoid  is  10  with  a  maximum  of  2 
composites from the same hole or trench for pass 1. The same conditions were used for the second 
run with exception of a maximum of 2 composites from the same hole or trench for pass 2. . The 
minimum number of composites required in order to proceed is 3 (i.e. in a minimum of 3 different 
holes or trenches). That minimum is simply lifted in the third run in order to interpolate the very 
few un-interpolated blocks at that stage. Those conditions are set to insure that a block grade is truly 
interpolated from samples in several holes and trenches (on different sides of the block) and not 
extrapolated from a few samples in the same drill hole or trench.  
 
Statistics of block grade estimates from the different runs are on Table 14-12. As a general rule, the 
variability of estimates (difference max.-min., %CV) decreases from first run to second run. A large 
majority of blocks is interpolated in the first run while just a few blocks are interpolated in the third 
and last run.

Block grade validation
Block grade validation was done revolving around the idea that grade estimates of blocks close to 
samples  should  reflect  the  grades  of  those  samples  (which  is  not  necessarily  the  case  when 
variograms  show  a  high  nugget  effect).  The  sections  and  benches  were  checked  with  blocks  and 
composites,  using  the  same  color  scale  for  grade  and  making  sure  that  they  visually  match.  SGS 
considers the validation as adequate and current. The estimated block model is showed on Figure 
14-13.
14.4.7
Resources Classification
Classification was done by a process of automatic classification that selects around each composite 
falling inside a specific block, a minimum number of composites nearby, from a minimum number 
of holes inside a research ellipsoid of a given orientation and size.  
 
For the Measured category, a first phase of research was carried out with a 70 m by 70 m by 20 m 
ellipsoid (direction, dip and thickness) with a minimum of 9 composites in at least 3 different holes. 
All blocks within the research ellipse are then categorized as measured to a maximum of 60 % of its

maximum radius. The classification step of indicated resources uses a larger search ellipse (150 m by 
150 m by 40 m), a minimum of 6 composites in at least 3 different holes and a fill to a maximum of 
45% of the ellipse radius. The classification of inferred resources corresponds to the remaining part 
of the non-classified blocks during the first two stages of classification. The Figure 14-14 presents 
the classification results.

Malcolm 1 Mineral Resources Estimation Conclusion
The current resource estimates for the Malcolm 1 deposit are of 9.22 million tonnes (including LMN 
and HMN) at a grade of 57.85% Fe in the Measured and Indicated categories based on IOCC Ore 
type’s category. The resources presented in this section are all inside the property boundary. The 
block model was cut by the topography. The block percentage had to be at least 50% inside the 
mineralised solid in order to be considered in the resource estimation. 
 
The  results  of  the  resource  estimates  for  the  Malcolm  1  deposit  are  shown  in  Table  14-14.    The 
mineral resources were classified using the IOCC Ore type’s category. See Section 14.1: 
 
There  are  no  known  factors  or  issues  related  to  environment,  permitting,  legal,  mineral  title, 
taxation,  marketing,  socio-economic  or  political  settings  that  could  materially  affect  the  mineral 
resource estimate.

(Item 23) Adjacent Properties
15.
Adjacent to the Houston property are several other iron ore deposits and claims owned by LIMHL 
subsidiaries in Labrador and Quebec, some of which formed part of the former DSO operations of 
IOC during the period 1954-1982.  
 
LIM’s Schefferville Projects comprise 20 different iron ore deposits, which were part of the original 
IOC direct shipping operations conducted from 1954 to 1982  
 
Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Labrador Iron Mines Limited, LIMHL holds 3 Mining Leases 
and 55 Mining Rights Licenses (including 13 Licenses covering the Houston Property), issued by the 
Department  of  Natural  Resources,  Province  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  covering 
approximately 16,475 hectares.  
 
Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SMI, LIMHL holds interests in 277 Title Claims issued by the 
Ministry of Natural Resources, Province of Quebec, covering approximately 11,131 hectares in the 
Schefferville area. SMI also holds an exclusive operating license covering 23 parcels totalling about 
2,036 hectares.  
 
As at March 31, 2013, LIM has confirmed a total of approximately 59.5 million tonnes at an average 
grade  of  56.7%  Fe  of  NI  43-101  compliant,  measured  and  indicated  mineral  resources  on  the 
Schefferville Projects, including, the Houston and Malcolm property.  Of this total, approximately 
36.9  million  tonnes  are  measured  mineral  resources  and  approximately  22.5  million  tonnes  are 
indicated resources.  LIM has also confirmed a total of approximately 4.7 million tonnes of inferred 
resources at an average grade of 55.8% Fe. 
 
In  addition  to  the  foregoing  LIM  holds  previously  mined  historical  stockpiles,  with  a  NI  43-101 
compliant, indicated resource of approximately 3.5 million tonnes at an average grade of 49.1% Fe 
and an inferred resource of approximately 2.9 million tonnes at an average grade of 48.8% Fe. These 
previously-mined stockpiles are located within 15 km of the Silver Yards plant.   
 
LIM’s  plans  for  its  Schefferville  Projects  envision  the  development  and  mining  of  the  various 
deposits in stages. Stage 1, which is being undertaken in phases, comprises the deposits closest to 
existing  infrastructure  located  at  Silver  Yards  in  an  area  identified  as  the  Central  Zone.  The  first 
phase of Stage 1 involves mining of the James deposits in Labrador.  
 
LIM started production of its Stage 1 James deposit in the spring of 2011. LIM’s mining operations 
are  seasonal  (April  to  November),  with  a  planned  winter  closure  from  December  to  March  each 
year.  In the spring of 2013, LIM commenced its third season of mining operations at the James 
Mine.  
 
Beyond 2013, LIM plans that operations in Silver Yards will continue with mining the remaining 
portions  of  the  James  deposit  and,  subject  to  permitting  and  detailed  engineering  assessment,  a 
number of adjacent Stage 1 (Central Zone) deposits, including the Redmond andGill deposits and 
the Wishart stockpiles, in Labrador, and the Denault deposit and Ferriman stockpiles in Quebec.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 133
Stage  2,  which  will  also  be  undertaken  in  phases,  will  involve,  the  exploration,  development  and 
mining of the Houston and adjacent deposits. 
 
A feasibility study has not been conducted on any of the Schefferville Projects and LIM’s decision to 
undertake  commercial  production  from  the  James  deposit  and  ongoing  exploration  and 
development  of  the  Houston  deposits  have  not  been  based  upon  a  feasibility  study  of  mineral 
reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.   
 
It  is  intended  that  during  the  mining  of  the  Stage  1  and  and  development  of  Stage  2  deposits, 
planning will be undertaken for the future operation of the other deposits in subsequent stages.  
 
Stage 3 comprising the Howse (Labrador) and Barney (Quebec) deposits located approximately 25 
km northwest of Schefferville (North Central Zone) and relatively close to existing infrastructure. 
The Howse deposit, located about 25 km north of LIM’s James Mine and Silver Yards processing 
plant, has a historical resource of 28 million tonnes.  
 
In March 2013 LIM entered into a framework arrangement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Limited 
(“TSMC”), as part of which LIM and TSMC have agreed to enter into a transaction for the joint 
development of the Howse deposit, whereby LIM will sell a 51% interest in Howse to TSMC. In the 
future,  TSMC  may  increase  its  interest  to  70%.  It  is  hoped  that  the  agreement  with  TSMC  will 
expedite the development of the Howse deposit and that significant cost savings and synergies can 
be achieved by processing Howse ore through TSMC’s adjacent Timmins Area plant.
Stage 4 comprising the Astray and Sawyer deposits in Labrador, located approximately 50 km to 65 
km southeast of Schefferville (South Zone) and currently accessible by float plane or by helicopter.
Stage 5 comprising the Kivivic deposit in Labrador and the Eclipse, Partington and Trough deposits 
in Quebec located between 40 km to 70 km northwest of Schefferville (North Zone).
The resources that comprise Stages 3, 4 and 5 of LIM’s Schefferville Projects consist of non NI 43-
101 compliant historical resources.  There is currently insufficient detailed information available on 
these deposits to make any long-term estimate of future production schedules. Substantial additional 
exploration, infrastructure and road access will be required for the development of these stages.
Tata Steel Minerals Canada (TSMC) a Joint Venture between Tata Steel Minerals Canada, (80%) (a 
member  of  the  Tata  Group,  the  world’s  sixth  largest  steel  producer)  and  New  Millennium 
Corporation. NML (20%) is developing an adjacent DSO project on  22 deposits, some of which are 
situated  in  Labrador  and  the  remaining  situated  in  Québec  to  the  northwest  of  the  town  of 
Schefferville, approximately 25 km from LIM’s James Mine and Silver Yards plant,
NML published a Pre-Feasibility Study in April 2009 and on April 12, 2010 published a Feasibility 
Study on the development of the same project. 
 
The  TSMC  Feasibility  Study  dated  April  10,  2010  amended  as  of  February  16,  2011  is  based  on 
mining  ten  deposits  and  blending  the  ore  to  provide  consistent  feed  to  the  process  plant.  The

current schedule provides a ten-year mine life. The mining and processing operations will be carried 
out on a year round basis. The plant will process 5.0 million natural tonnes per year to produce 4.0 
million dry tonnes of sinter fines and super fines. The mining method selected is conventional open-
pit mining with a front-end loader/truck operation. The rock will be drilled, blasted and loaded into 
haul trucks that will deliver run-of-mine ore to the primary mineral sizer, located at the Timmins 
Site. The TSMC DSO Project is currently under construction and reported by New Mellenium to 
contain 64.1 million tonnes of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at an average grade of 58.8% 
Fe. 
 
A Feasibility Study is also been carried out for a joint venture between NML and Tata Steel Minerals 
Holdings on a taconite iron deposit known as the LabMag Property in the Howells River area of 
Labrador located some 30 km northwest of Schefferville.  A Pre-Feasibility study has been carried 
out on the adjacent KéMag taconite Property in Quebec. 
 
LabMag is reported by New Millennium Corp to contain 3.5 billion tonnes of Proven and Probable 
reserves at a grade of 29.6% Fe plus 1.0 billion tonnes of Measured and Indicated resources at an 
average grade of 29.5% Fe and 1.2 billion tonnes of Inferred resources at an average grade of 29.3% 
Fe.  KéMag  is  reported  by  New  Millennium  Corp  to  contain  2.1  billion  tonnes  of  Proven  and 
Probable reserves at an average grade of 31.3% Fe, 0.3 billion tonnes of Measured and Indicated 
resources at an average grade of 31.3 % Fe and 1.0 billion tonnes of Inferred resources at an average 
grade of 31.2% Fe. 
Century Iron Mines Corporation has filed a Project Description and Registration Document with 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, for its proposed Joyce Lake Direct Shipping Iron 
Ore  Project.  The  Joyce  Lake  Project  is  situated  in  Labrador,  approximately  25  km  east  of  LIM’s 
Houston  deposits,  and  20  km  northeast  of  the  town  of  Schefferville,  Québec.  The  Joyce  Lake 
property  is  reported  by  Century  Iron  Mines  to  contain  7.55  million  tonnes  of  measured  and 
indicated  resources  at  an  average  grade  of  61.62%  Fe.    The  Project  Description  and  Registration 
document for the Joyce Lake Project outlines a target production estimate of 4 million tonnes of ore 
annually. The first three years of operation would focus on production of direct shipping ore, which 
has a high iron content (~60% iron), with stockpiling of lower grade ore (< 60% iron) that would be 
beneficiated to bring it up to the desired commercial grade.  
The authors of this report have not reviewed or audited the above resource and reserve estimates of 
New Millenium or Century Iron Mines. 
In  the  Labrador  City-Fermont  area,  200  km  to  the  south  of  Schefferville,  iron  ore  mining  and 
upgrade  operations  are  being  carried  out  by  IOC  at  Carol  Lake,  by  Cliffs  Natural  Resources  at 
Wabush  and  Bloom  Lake  (formerly  Consolidated  Thompson)  and  by  Arcelor-Mittal  at  Mont-
Wright.

Introduction
The  Houston  Project  is  not  considered  an  “advanced  property”  within  the  meaning  of  National 
Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the additional 
requirements for advanced properties required by Item 15 to 22 of Form 43-101F1 have not been 
included in this Technical Report. 
 
The  Houston  Project,  including  the  Malcolm  property,  does  not  have  any  demonstrated  mineral 
reserves and a feasibility study has not been conducted on the Houston Project. LIM’s decision to 
advance the Houston Project towards development has not been based upon a feasibility study on 
mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability.   
 
The  additional  information  included  in  this  section  was  provided  by  Labrador  Iron  Mines  based 
largely on the project descriptions contained in the Project Registration documents filed with the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador for the Houston 1 and 2 Deposits Mining Project and 
the Houston Beneficiation Plant Project, and was reviewed by Mr. Justin Taylor, P.Eng who is the 
responsible author for this section of the Technical Report.
16.2
Governmental Approvals
In December of 2011, LIM submitted a project registration to the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador, outlining the development of a series of open pit mining operations on Houston #1 
and Houston #2, to be supported by an access road and a railway siding.  
 
In March 2012, the Minister of Environment and Conservation the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador informed the Company that, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act, 
the  Houston  1  and  2  Deposits  Mining  Project,  including  the  haul  road  and  railway  siding,  was 
released from further environmental assessment, subject to a number of conditions.   
 
In  February  2013,  the  Company  filed  registration  documents  with  the  Government  of 
Newfoundland  and  Labrador  and  with  the  Federal  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Agency 
(“CEAA”) for the second phase of development of the Houston 1 and 2 deposits, which includes 
the construction of a wet process beneficiation plant incorporating crushing, screening, washing and 
magnetic separation. This plant will be capable of upgrading lower grade ore (50% to 59% Fe) into 
saleable sinter and lump products.  
 
In April 2013, CEAA notified LIM that a Federal Environmental Assessment was not required and 
in  May  2013,  the  Minister  of  Environment  and  Conservation  released  this  second  phase  of  the 
Houston Project from the provincial environmental assessment process, subject to conditions.  
 
Environmental  release  of  the    various  phases  of  the  Houston  Project  allow  the  Company  to 
complete the applications for permits and regulatory approvals required for the construction of the 
haul road and rail siding, development of the Houston 1 and 2 deposits and construction of the wet

The  mining  and  surface  leases  have  been  issued  and  the  closure  and  reclamation  plan  has  been 
approved by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. The road construction permit is in 
place and approval for the rail siding construction permit is anticipated in mid-2013.

Overview
Labrador  Iron  Mines,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Labrador  Iron  Mines  Holdings  Limited,  is 
proposing to develop iron ore deposits on their Houston 1 and 2 properties located in an historical 
iron  ore  mining  district  in  the  western  central  part  of  the  Labrador  Trough  Iron  Range,  in  the 
province  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador.  The  Houston  Project  is  located  approximately  15  km 
from LIM’s existing James Mine and Silver Yards Plant currently in operation.  
 
The Houston and Malcolm deposits contain a total NI-43-101 Indicated resource estimate of 39.3 
million tonnes of iron ore of potential direct shipping quality with an anticipated 10-15 year mine 
life. 
 
This Houston Project, Phase 1, involves the development and mining of ‘direct shipping’ iron ore 
from the Houston 1 and 2 deposits, the construction of a mining haul road that will connect the 
Houston area to LIM’s existing James Mine area and the construction of a 5 km long rail siding near 
the intersection of the proposed haul road and existing TSH main rail  
 
Phase 2 of the Houston Project will involve the construction of a wet process beneficiation plant 
capable  of  upgrading  lower  grade  ore  (50%  to  59%  Fe)  into  saleable  sinter  fine  and  lump  ore 
products. 
 
It is expected that initial mine development at the Houston deposit, will include construction of the 
haulage road and railway siding, mine infrastructure and related facilities, with initial production of 
Houston ore coming from in-pit dry crushing and screening to produce direct rail ore. 
 
Mining will be conducted in a sequential manner using conventional open pit mining methods.  
 
It  is  expected  that  mining  will  commence  with  three  pits  to  maximize  access  to  the  ore.  The 
production will initially start with mining one pit in Houston 1 area and two pits in Houston 2 area, 
pending more detailed engineering studies.  
 
Direct rail ore (DRO) that does not require any beneficiation will be hauled to a loading area located 
near  the  proposed  location  of  the  rail  siding,  to  be  located  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  and 
loaded on to rail cars for transport south to the Port of Sept Iles.  
 
Lower grade ores will be hauled to a proposed new beneficiation plant site under consideration near 
the  Houston  mine  pit  area,  where  crushing,  washing,  screening,  and  gravity  separation  will  take 
place, prior to loading onto rail cars. Prior to the construction of the new Houston beneficiation 
plant some lower grade ores may be hauled to LIM’s existing processing plant at Silver Yards from 
where the processed ore would be loaded directly onto trains at Silver Yards. 
 
As with LIM’s nearby existing James Mine, the final products to be produced from the Houston 1 
and  2  deposits  will  include  lump  and  sinter  fine  ores  for  direct  shipping  to  end  users  in  Europe
SGS Canada Inc.

and/or  Asia.  As  the  Houston  deposit  is  a  high-grade  iron  ore,  no  further  processing  will  be 
conducted other than the proposed crushing and washing to be conducted in Labrador. 
 
The Houston project will benefit from the presence of existing infrastructure, such as the railway 
line between Schefferville and Sept-Îles, roads, and infrastructure constructed as part of LIM’s James 
Mine.  
 
No major improvements of the local roads or rail are anticipated. Minimal additional infrastructure 
to be developed is expected to include dewatering wells, water management features (e.g., sediment 
control  ponds,  ditches),  a  haul  road,  a  rail  siding,  and  internal  mine  roads.  It  is  anticipated  that 
power requirements for the Houston Mine site will be supplied by diesel generators.

Houston Project Description
LIM  proposes  to  advance  the  Houston  Project  in  a  number  of  Phases.  Phase  1  will  involve  the 
development and mining of ‘direct shipping’ iron ore from the Houston 1 and 2 deposits, with in pit 
dry crushing and screening. 
 
Phase 2 of the Houston Project will involve the construction of a wet process beneficiation plant 
capable  of  upgrading  lower  grade  ore  (50%  to  59%  Fe)  into  saleable  sinter  fine  and  lump  ore 
products. 
 
The Houston 1 and 2 deposit development will follow the James Mine and will benefit from much 
of  the  existing  infrastructure  developed  for  that  project.  It  is  expected  that  the  first  phase  will 
involve the development and production from the Houston 1 and 2 deposits with initial production 
of Houston ore coming from in-pit dry crushing and screening to produce direct rail ore. 
 
Overburden stripping material, waste rock material, and low grade ore material will be temporarily 
stockpiled  in  strategic  locations  near  the  open  pits  and  away  from  any  nearby  watercourses.  The 
overburden  stockpiles  would  be  used  for  future  reclamation  purposes.  Waste  rock  piles  may  be 
placed back into the pits once mining is completed.  
 
As with the James Mine, minimal blasting is anticipated and no new explosives storage areas will be 
established as part of this project. Blasting materials will be accessed from the explosive storage area 
currently in use for the existing nearby James Mine.  
 
Development of the Houston 1 and 2 deposits will require construction of an approximately 8 km
haul road from the Houston area to connect with the Silver Yards‐Redmond road as well as the
establishment of a 5 km rail siding within the existing right of way along the existing TSH main line 
to facilitate loading of ore. The haul road will require a crossing at the existing TSH main rail line. 
 
Temporary ore pile areas will be located near the intersection of the rail siding and the haul road in 
order to facilitate loading and transport. 
 
Major features of the Houston 1 and 2 Project include:
  All development will be located within Labrador in a region of historical IOC activity; 
  Nearby  existing  and  permitted  infrastructure,  including  the  Silver  Yard  laboratory, 
beneficiation area, maintenance shed and warehouse facilities, Menihek road, and the Bean 
Lake accommodation camp will be used to service the Houston Mine Project, as required;
  Additional small excavations that may be required may include side‐hill cuts associated with
  Mining will be carried out using conventional open truck and shovel pit mining methods,
employing drilling and blasting operations, as required;
the construction and maintenance of access roads, mine haulage roads, sumps and settling 
ponds;
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 141
  Where required, borrow materials will be accessed either from existing quarries in the area, 
from benign waste rock sourced from the Redmond Mine area, or sourced from waste rock 
generated from the Houston area;
  As demonstrated at the James mine, minimal explosives use is expected and, as such, no new 
explosives storage areas are planned for the Houston project. Instead, the Houston project 
will access any required explosives from the storage areas used by the James mine;
require  the  placement  of  a  clear-span‐type  bridge  above  Gillings  River  and  smaller 
bottomless‐type culverts across the smaller watercourse crossings.
  A 8 km haul road to be constructed between the Houston and Redmond areas which will
  The establishment of an approximately 5 km long rail siding along the existing TSH main 
line,  near  its  intersection  with  the  proposed  haul  road.  Temporary  ore  stockpiles  will  be 
established at this location to facilitate ore loading. 
16.4.1
Construction
The Houston 1 and 2 mine development will benefit from the presence of extensive infrastructure 
in the area. 
 
Primary access to the Houston 1 and 2 deposits will be by a new haul road to be developed between 
Houston  1  and  2  and  the  Redmond  area.  The  proposed  Houston-Redmond  haul  road  is 
approximately 8 km long. Although there are existing roads from the community of Schefferville to 
the Houston area, these roads will be avoided for ore transport to reduce potential impacts on the 
local community.  
 
The  primary  construction  activity  for  the  development  of  the  open-pit  mines  at  Houston  will 
include:
  Clearing the area of trees and brush; 
  Grubbing  the  footprints  of  the  open  pits,  haul  roads,  service  roads,  waste  disposal  areas, 
stockpile areas, laydown areas, and water management features, and stockpiling overburden 
material;
  Excavation  and  construction  for  the  water  management  features  (example  ditches  and
sediment control ponds); and
  Construction of the haul road, internal mine service roads and rail siding.
The construction period is expected to be relatively short, probably within a period of three months.
16.4.2
Houston-Redmond Haul Road and Rail Siding
The construction of the Houston-Redmond haul road is required to connect the Houston 1 and 2 
deposits to the existing Redmond Road, which is connected to the James Mine, Silver Yards plant 
and Bean Lake accommodation camp. The planned access road is 8 km of 8.5m wide. This road will 
be  configured  for  access  to  the  Houston  1  and  2  deposits  from  the  Redmond  property  which  is 
connected by existing road to LIM’s Silver Yards and James mine properties.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 142
Extensive environmental baseline data was collected from the road and rail siding areas, including 
water  course  crossings,  and  this  information,  in  combination  with  community  consultation  and 
incorporation  of  traditional  environmental  knowledge,  was  used  to  evaluate  the  preferred  road 
option.
The haul road will require the placement of a clear span‐type bridge across the Gilling River.  The
maximum length of this bridge will be less than 30 metres and the maximum width will be less than 
20 metres. The clear-span bridge would be constructed outside of the high-water mark and will be 
constructed without having to do any in-stream work andwith sufficient clearance to provide access 
to canoes and small boats.  
  
The proposed bridge will have a double layer of timber deck with geotextile sandwiched in between 
to reduce the potential for debris falling from the bridge into the river. Conceptual cross-sections are 
presented in Figure 16-4 and Figure 16-5. 
 
Minimal  other  water  crossings  will  be  required  for  the  development  of  access  routes  and,  where 
water crossings are required they can be constructed without placement of materials below the high 
water  mark  and  with  adequate  clearance  to  provide  appropriate  clearance  for  canoes  and  small 
boats).    Smaller  water  crossings  are  expected  to  consist  of  open-bottom  culverts  with  supports 
located above the high-water mark. 
 
Where required, borrow materials will be accessed either  from  existing  quarries  in  the  area,  from 
benign  waste  rock  sourced  from  the  Redmond  Mine area, or sourced from waste rock generated 
from the Houston area. 
 
The haul road will be designed and built to permit the safe travel of all of the vehicles in regular 
service. Internal mine roads will be engineered and built to permit the safe travel of all vehicles and 
in accordance with provincial regulations. These roads will be limited to only mine personnel within 
the pits. 
 
A rail siding will be constructed along the main Tshiuetin rail line connecting Schefferville to Emeril 
Junction west of Labrador City. This siding will be 5.0 km long and allow for loading of rail cars at 
that location.  Ore will initially be trucked along the new road to this siding where it will be loaded 
into rail cars for shipment south to the port of Sept Iles.

16.4.3
Site Supporting Infrastructure
It is not anticipated that any permanent structures will be erected for the mining operations at the 
Houston site. A workshop and warehouse may be established, as well as a portable office which will 
include services such as washrooms and a first aid room. All of the buildings are expected to be pre-
fabricated modular units, i.e. trailers, and will be removed upon completion of operations. General 
services and infrastructures will be shared with the contractor. 
 
The existing LIM laboratory at the Silver Yards area will be used for the Houston Project.  
 
The existing camp accommodations at LIM’s Bean Lake site will be used for accommodation. 
 
It  is  anticipated  that  power  requirement  for  the  Houston  Mine  site  will  be  supplied  by  diesel 
generators. 
16.5
Mining Operations
All mining operations will be by conventional open pit mining methods. 
 
Longitudinal and transverse conceptual pit cross-sections for Houston 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 
16-7 and Figure 16-8. The anticipated surface required for the Houston Project is shown in Figure 
16-9.

Mining  will  be  conducted  year-round  and  beneficiation  will  be  conducted  seasonally,  from 
approximately April to November each year.  
 
LIM will drill, blast, load and haul ore, waste rock and topsoil to the designated locations. The waste 
will  be  hauled  to  the  specific  waste  dump  sites.  Upon  completion  of  mining,  temporary  waste 
stockpiles may be placed back into the pits from which they originated. Temporary ore stockpiles 
will  also  be  placed  near  the  rail  siding  to  facilitate  loading.  Some  waste  rock  may  be  used  for 
construction of the proposed haul road. 
 
It is anticipated mining will be conducted by LIM with leased equipment. LIM will operate a fleet of 
new leased equipment, which will be used initially to construct the site, and to break, load and haul 
ore, waste rock and top soils to the designated locations. The in pit trucks will haul the ore from the
Houston Pits to the beneficiation plant ore stockpiles. From the Malcolm 1 property, tractor‐trailer
units will be used to haul the ore to the processing site. Vehicle maintenance will be conducted at 
the existing LIM facilities, developed as part of the James Mine.  
 
LIM is planning to carry out the direct production and service operations including: tree removal, 
overburden  stripping,  mine  construction,  waste  stripping  from  the  open  pit,  ore  mining, 
beneficiation plant operation and pit production.  
 
LIM  will  implement  the  mine  plan  and  will  perform  all  mine  planning  and  will  carry  out  all 
resource/grade control, layout, surveying, measuring and reconciliation functions.  The mine office 
will be located at the Houston plant where technical, administrative and operational personnel will 
be based. LIM will perform all strategic mine planning and will conduct resource/grade control. 
 
Mining  will  be  conducted  in  a  sequential  manner  using  conventional  open  pit  mining  methods.  
Mechanical methods will be used, where possible, to break up the rock but this may also require the 
use  of  explosives.  No  new  explosives  storage  facilities  are  planned  for  the  Houston  project.  It  is 
currently planned that the existing explosives storage at the James Mine area will be used to source 
any blasting materials. Some blasting will be required even though some of the ore and waste is free 
digging.  
 
The Houston-Malcolm 1 Open Pit Mines will have overall pit wall angles ranging from 34 degrees in 
overburden to 45 degrees in competent rock. The face angles range from 40 degrees in overburden 
to 60 degrees in competent rock. These angles are based on dewatered/depressurized pit walls and 
controlled  blasting  techniques.  The  excavations  will  be  mined  in  10  meter  benches  with  double 
benching  before  establishing  8  meters  wide  berm.  LIM’s  experience  at  the  operating  James  pit 
indicates that the pit slope and bench height assumptions are practical. 
 
The  proposed  locations  of  the  overburden  stockpile  area  and  temporary  waste  rock  stockpiles  as 
well as the preliminary pit outlines at the Houston 1 and 2 mine area are shown in Figure 16-10 
 
The waste will be hauled to the specific waste dump sites. The waste rock dumps and overburden 
stockpiles are designed for Houston 1 & 2 project are located immediately to the east of the pit.

Once mined, the ore will be hauled by truck approximately 1.5 km to the proposed beneficiation 
plant  to  be  located  adjacent  to  the  Houston  Haul  Road.  LIM  plans  to  start  mining  the  Houston 
deposits and initially process the DSO using a portable dry screening and crushing plant where the 
ore will be crushed to allow for downstream handling requirements and dry screened into Lump ore 
(6mm to 37.5 mm size), coarse sinter (2mm to 6mm size), and fines (less than 2mm size). Pending 
construction  of  the  Beneficiation  Plant,  the  ore  will  be  processed  through  the  dry  plant.    Lower 
grade  or  off-grade  material  will  be  stockpiled  and  stored  until  the  wet  beneficiation  plant  is  in 
operation.   
 
Environmental  monitoring  will  be  conducted  during  all  phases  of  the  work  program  from 
construction to closure.  
 
LIM’s  nearby  James  Mine  currently  has  an  approved  Environmental  Protection  Plan  (EPP), 
including emergency spill response and contingency programs, in place and it is expected that this 
Plan will be updated for use at the Houston 1 and 2 Mine.  
 
The  Houston  1  &  2  Development,  Rehabilitation  and  Closure  plan  has  been  submitted  to  the 
government of Newfoundland and Labrador for approval in April 2013.  
 
LIM  plans  to  conduct  all  of  the  mining  operations  for  the  Houston  Project  –  pre-stripping, 
stockpiling  of  overburden  rock  and  low-grade  ore.  LIM  currently  plans  to  contract  out  all 
transportation services including ore haulage, waste haulage, including service and maintenance of 
transportation  equipment.  LIM  estimates  that  approximately  32  full-time  direct  or  sub-contract 
positions will be created when the mine is in operation. The number of positions may change based 
on the equipment size selected for mining. 
 
Production is preliminary scheduled to commence in the last quarter of Year 2 (Table 16-6). The 
estimated production schedule based on both dry screening and the wet plant predicts production 
for the first seven years is shown in Table 16-6.

Houston Beneficiation Plant
The proposed  Houston Beneficiation Plant will be constructed 2-3 years following the initial development 
of the Houston 1 and 2 Deposits and will process ore from those deposits initially and potentially from the 
Malcolm and Houston 3 deposits at a later date. LIM anticipates that some ore from the Houston Project 
may  be  beneficiated  at  the  Silver  Yard  facility  at  James  Mine  pending  the  construction  of  the  proposed 
Houston plant. 
 
As  with  LIM’s  existing  Silver  Yard  facility,  the  proposed  Houston  Beneficiation  process  will  involve  the 
crushing, screening, washing and magnetic separation of the rock.  No chemicals will be added as water is 
the only constituent used in the beneficiation process.  The resulting wash water consists of water and fine 
rock  material  (reject  fines).  As  at  LIM’s  nearby  existing  James  Mine  project,  the  final  products  to  be 
produced from the Houston 1 and 2 deposits will include lump and sinter fine ores for direct shipping to 
end users in Europe and/or Asia.  
 
The throughput of the proposed Houston plant is designed for 600 tonnes per hour with an average daily 
production of 12,000 tonnes during peak operation. The processed ore will then be hauled approximately 6 
km to the Houston Rail Siding where it will be loaded onto rail cars for transport south to the port of Sept-
Iles. 
 
The  operation  of  the  Houston  Beneficiation  Plant  will  benefit  from  the  presence  of  existing  or  planned 
infrastructure including the Houston Haul Road and the Rail Siding which are part of the Houston Project, 
as well as the Redmond Pit. 
 
A unique feature of the proposed Houston Beneficiation Plant project is that there is no discharge to the 
environment.  Process water will be extracted from a previously flooded pit (Redmond Pit) which does not 
have an outlet and the plant rejects water will be discharged back into the Pit, i.e., a closed loop system.
16.6.1
Plant Location
LIM retained DRA Americas to conduct a comprehensive trade-off study of the alternative locations for the 
beneficiation  plant.    The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  select  a  plant  location  and  configuration  that 
optimized  the  capital  and  operating  cost  of  the  plant,  maximized  the  resource  use  of  the  area,  while 
minimizing  the  adverse  effects  to  the  surrounding  environment.    The  study  focused  on  two  major 
components,  water  management  and  plant  location.    Given  the  interdependencies  between  the  options, 
several configurations were considered and compared using both qualitative and quantitative analysis that 
took into consideration a variety of factors including environmental effects, risk, costs, technical factors and 
logistics.   
 
The Redmond Pit will be the reject water disposal location. Water will be withdrawn from Redmond Pit, 
piped to the beneficiation plant, used in the process cycle and piped back to the pit. 
 
The  selected  location  for  the  Beneficiation  Plant  is  a  site  1.5  km  from  the  Houston  1  and  2  mine  site.  
Reducing the distance for the transportation of unprocessed ore was a major consideration in the selection 
of the plant location.  Approximately 20-25% of the unprocessed ore is removed as reject material during 
processing.  By locating the plant near the mine site, the haulage distance of the unprocessed ore is 1.5 km.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 155
This results in an overall reduction of truck haulage by 20 – 25% and a coinciding reduction in exhaust 
emissions. 
 
The primary construction activities for the development of the Houston Beneficiation plant will include:
  Site preparation (clearing of vegetation, grading and excavation); 
  Transporting equipment, construction materials and related supplies to site; 
  Construction and erection of the plant;  
  Construction  /  installation  of  the  maintenance  shop,  and  other  buildings  (e.g.,  office  and
washroom); and
  Environmental monitoring.
During construction, the requirement for temporary facilities (e.g., office, lunchroom, septic, potable water, 
power supply) will be satisfied through the use of existing infrastructure at the James Mine, and / or the 
Houston mine site.  Once the beneficiation plant and all associated infrastructure have been constructed, all 
portable infrastructure from the Houston Project will be transported to the beneficiation plant location and 
utilized accordingly.  
 
Approximately 750 m of new site access/haul roads, ranging in width from 7 m to 30 m will be constructed 
at the plant site and will connect into the Houston Haul Road (Figure 16-12).  
 
Below  is  a  list  of  infrastructure  associated  with  the  Beneficiation  Plant  area.    Refer  to  Figure  16-11  and 
Figure 16-12 for infrastructure location and site layout.
  Site Roads; 
  Beneficiation Plant; 
  Truck Shop, Warehouse and Workshop; 
  Administration Offices and Lunchroom; 
  Change House & Washrooms; 
  Fuel Storage and Dispensing Facility; 
  Oil Storage; 
  Diesel Generators; 
  Sewage Treatment System;  
  Water Supply (potable and fire); 
  Stockpiles (Lump Ore, Sinter, Fines, Ultra Fines and Plant Feed); and 
  Reject and Process Water Pipelines.

16.6.2
Beneficiation Plant Operations
The  Beneficiation  plant  will  occupy  a footprint of approximately 20,660 m2  and  will  consist  primarily  of 
crushing, screening, washing equipment, magnetic separators and conveyors.  
 
The Beneficiation plant design is outdoors and due to the harsh winter climates in the Schefferville area is 
scheduled  to  operate  for  six  months  per  year  (May  through  October).    An  option  to  extend  the  plant’s 
operation for a longer period of time may be considered in the future, which would involve enclosing the 
plant within a building.  Such an option would allow the wet plant to operate longer per year, leading to 
higher volume of processed product per year and, as a result, a reduction in mine life.
16.6.3
Process Description
The beneficiation process is outlined in Figure 16-13.  The plant is designed for a nominal operating rate of 
600 tph to a maximum of 720 tph and an overall ore recovery estimated to be 75%.  The following are the 
major components of the plant, which are described below:

16.6.3.1  Plant Feed (Primary Tip and Crushing)
The plant feed area includes the ramp for the haul truck, static grizzly, inload bin, grizzly feeder, primary 
(jaw) crusher, sacrificial conveyor and plant feed conveyor (Figure 16-13). 
 
Run-of-mine ore will be dumped directly by trucks into the 250 tonne in-load bin fitted with static grizzly 
set at 300 mm bar spacing for feed top size control. A vibrating grizzly feeder set at 75 mm will draw ore 
from the in-load bin.  The grizzly feeder oversize will be fed to the jaw crusher set at 75 mm to produce a 
125 mm lump size.  The product of the primary crushing station will be transported by a series of conveyors 
to the primary screen.  A metal detector will be installed on the plant feed conveyor to prevent tramp iron 
from damaging subsequent equipment, particularly the secondary crusher.  The under-crusher conveyor will 
be fitted with a programmable hammer sampler for automatic sampling. 
 
This area includes the primary screen, scrubber, secondary crusher, secondary screen and several conveyors.  
The  plant  has  been  designed  as  a  single  line  process,  thus  eliminating  several  machines,  conveyors  and 
lessening the footprint of the plant. 
 
Primary screening will be carried out by a horizontal vibrating screen with aperture size of 32 mm which will 
be operated in closed circuit with the secondary crushing circuit.  The screen oversize with particle sizes +26 
mm will be conveyed to a 40 t secondary surge bin while the undersize -32 mm particle size, will gravitate to 
the ore scrubber.  A pan feeder will reclaim material from the surge bin feeding it to the cone crusher which 
will be fitted with a coarse profile cavity set at 45 mm producing 70 mm lump size material.  The secondary 
crusher product will be transported back to primary screening.

A short length belt conveyor will be used to aid the feeding of material to the ore scrubber to minimize 
clogging issues in the feed chute.  Ore scrubbing will be accomplished for 30 sec at 65% solid concentration 
to  disintegrate  agglomerated  fines  from  rocks.    Process  water  will  be  added  in  the  scrubber  feed  at 
controlled flows relative to the plant feed rate to maintain the operating pulp density.

16.6.3.2  Screening, Scrubbing and Secondary Crushing
The discharge of the ore scrubber will gravity flow to a double deck secondary multi-sloped vibrating screen 
equipped with water sprays.  The top and bottom deck of the secondary screen will be fitted with 6 mm and 
1  mm  opening  panels,  respectively.    Materials  retained  on  the  top  deck  (-32  mm,  +6  mm)  and  on  the 
bottom deck (-6 mm, +1 mm) will be transported to the lump ore and sinter fines stockpile, respectively, via 
transfer conveyors and stackers.  Materials passing the bottom deck (-1 mm) will be pumped to the cyclone 
cluster. 
 
Hammer samplers will be installed on the transfer conveyors of lump ore and sinter fines for product quality 
control and accounting.
16.6.3.3  WHIMS, Thickening and Filtration
This area consists of the cyclone cluster, primary and secondary WHIMS, dewatering screen, thickener, disc 
filter and a conveyor. 
 
Seven out of the nine 10” hydro-cyclones will be operated at any one time to de-slime the secondary screen 
undersize removing particles finer than 15 microns.  The overflow of the cyclone, where majority of the fine 
particles will be reporting is then pumped to the rejects tank while the underflow will be fed to the primary 
Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separator (WHIMS).   
 
The  non-magnetic  materials  from  the  primary  WHIMS  will  be  reprocessed  in  the  secondary  WHIMS  to 
maximize recovery.  The combined magnetic products of primary and secondary WHIMS will be pumped 
to the 5-deck Derrick Screen Stacksizer fitted with 300 micron aperture panels.   
 
The Derrick screen oversize (-1 mm, +0.3 mm) at 12% moisture will be conveyed to the fines stockpile 
while the undersize (-0.3 mm, +0.015 mm) will be pumped to the thickener.  Thickener underflow at 75% 
solid concentration will be pumped to a vacuum disk filter as final dewatering step.  The filter cake, with 
moisture content of 15%, will be conveyed to the ultra-fines stockpile.  
 
At regular frequency, the cloth of the disk filter will be washed to reduce blinding, thus restoring filtration 
efficiency.  The cloth wash water will be pumped back to the thickener feed well for pulp dilution.
16.6.3.4  Rejects Pumping
Three process streams will handle the plant rejects which include the cyclone cluster overflow, secondary 
WHIMS non-magnetic materials and thickener overflow.  The plant rejects will be pumped to Redmond pit 
by three pumps operating in series.  Each pump will be operated with full flow flush seal gland water that 
will be supplied by a dedicated positive displacement pump.
16.6.3.5  Plant Water
Redmond pit water will be the sole source of water for the process plant as well as for emergency supply.  
Raw water from the pit will be pumped by diesel-driven pumps to the 140 m3 process water and 10 m3 gland 
water tanks.  Water from the vacuum filter drain will be recycled back to the plant though the process water 
tank while the filtrate will be pumped to the thickener for dilution.
16.6.3.6  Services
High pressure compressed air for servicing instruments and operating pneumatic tools will be supplied by 
an air compressor installed with an air dryer and air receiver.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 162
16.6.3.7  Truck Shop, Warehouse and Workshop
The truck shop, warehouse and workshop will be housed within a Megadome measuring approximately 137 
m x 24 m x 13 m.  This will allow sufficient space for the maintenance and storage of heavy equipment (i.e., 
haul trucks) and spare parts as well as a mechanical and electrical workshop. 
 
The floor in the truck shop portion will be concrete and poured prior to the erection of the structure while 
the remainder of the flooring will be precast concrete slabs for lining only.
16.6.3.8  Administration Offices and Lunchroom
The administration offices and lunch room will be modular trailer units.  There will be a total of eight (8) 
units, each occupying a footprint of approximately 36 m2.
16.6.3.9  Change House/Washrooms/Camp
The  change  house/washrooms  (male  and  female)  will  be  a  modular  unit  occupying  a  footprint  of 
approximately 30 m2.  The camp and kitchen located at James Mine (Bean Lake Camp) will be used for both 
the construction and operation phases of the Houston project.
16.6.3.10 Fuel Storage and Dispensing Facility
The fuel storage system will consist of two bladders with a combined capacity of 227 m3.  The bladders will 
be equipped with liners for secondary containment, an oil water separator, fill pump and associated hoses 
and valves.  The fuel will be distributed via two separate fuel dispensing systems. 
 
The bladders will be used to supply fuel for the plant generators and mobile equipment and will be filled by 
a certified contractor, via mobile supply vehicles. 
 
There  will  be  containment  berms  located  around  the  bladders  and  the  oil  water  separator.    Following 
construction of the berms, the liners will be installed and then the bladders will be placed into position.
16.6.3.11 Generators
The expected peak demand load from the beneficiation process is currently estimated at 3,517.70 kW and 
total connected load is 6,068.55 kW. Electrical power will be generated by up to four (three on duty, one on 
standby) mobile diesel generators each running at 1825 kW.  The generators will be self-contained units in 
weatherproof  enclosures  placed  on  concrete  pads,  with  all  the  proper  protection,  controls  and 
synchronizations in place. 
 
A  standby/emergency  generator  will  supply  power  to  emergency  systems  including  the  fire  suppression 
system and other necessary items (e.g., lighting, pumps, air compressors).
16.6.3.12 Stockpiles
There will be five stockpiles located at the plant location: four product stockpiles: lump, sinter, fines, ultra 
fines, as well as a plant feed stockpile.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 163
16.6.3.13 Pipelines
Two pipelines are required for the wet plant as detailed below.  Both pipelines will be above-ground and 
placed along the shoulder of the Houston Haul Road. 
 
To support the pipelines, a 2 m wide by 0.75 m high support berm has been proposed for the approximate 
9-10 km distance from the plant to Redmond Pit, with concrete blocks placed every 200 m for additional 
support.   
 
Reject Water Pipeline 
 
A 40 cm high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe will carry the plant reject water to the discharge location at 
Redmond Pit.  At the Gilling River bridge, the pipe will be encapsulated in an outer protective rigid pipeline 
for addition protection against accidental rupture or breakage.  
 
Process Water Pipeline 
 
A  50  cm  HDPE  pipe,  paralleling  the  rejects  pipeline,  will  transport  process  water  to  the  plant  from 
Redmond Pit. 
16.6.4
Plant Production Schedule
The estimated production schedule is based on 600 tonnes per hour (12,000 tonnes per day) capacity with 
maximum of 720 tonnes per hour.  Based on the 12,000 tonnes per day capacity and the expected overall 
recovery of 75%, it is estimated that a total of 1.5 million tonnes of product will be recovered from 2.0 
million tonnes of feed per year over the 12 year life of mine (Table 16-2).

Environmental Assessments
Dating back to 2005, LIM initiated ongoing environmental baseline data collection programs in the 
Schefferville project area, including programs in traditional environmental knowledge, heritage and 
archaeological resources, wildlife, avifauna, fish and fish habitat, air quality, noise and vibration, acid 
rock drainage (ARD) potential, surface and groundwater quality and geochemistry. This information 
formed the basis of the Schefferville Area Iron Ore Mine Project (also known as the Schefferville 
Area  Iron  Ore  Mines),  formally  submitted  to  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Department  of 
Environment  and  Conservation  (NL  DOEC)  by  LIM  in  April  2008,  as  well  as  the  revised 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted to NL DOEC in August, 2009. 
 
In November 2009, LIM was advised by the NL Minister of Environment and Conservation that 
the EIS complied with the Environmental Protection Act and required no further work under the 
Provincial environmental assessment process. On February 12, 2010, LIM was informed that, under 
authority  of  Section  67(3)(a)  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Act,  the  Lieutenant  Governor  in 
Council released the Schefferville Area Iron Ore Mine Project (James and Redmond deposits and 
Silver Yards processing site) from further environmental assessment. Newfoundland and Labrador 
Environmental Assessment Process 
 
In  December  of  2011,  LIM  submitted  a  project  registration  document  to  the  Government  of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, outlining the development of a series of open pit mining operations 
on Houston #1 and Houston #2, to be supported by an access road and a railway siding.  
 
In March 2012, the Minister of Environment and Conservation the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador informed the Company that, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act, 
the  Houston  1  and  2  Deposits  Mining  Project,  including  the  haul  road  and  railway  siding,  was 
released from further environmental assessment, subject to a number of conditions.   
 
In February 2013, LIM filed registration documents with the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador  and  with  the  Federal  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Agency  (“CEAA”)  for  the 
second phase of development of the Houston 1 and 2 deposits, which includes the construction of a 
wet process beneficiation plant incorporating crushing, screening, washing and magnetic separation.  
 
The Houston Beneficiation Plant is subject to an environmental assessment pursuant to Part III of 
the Newfoundland and Labrador Regulations 54/03, Environmental Assessment Regulations, 2003, under 
the  Environmental  Protection  Act,  SNL  2002  Ce-14.2.    Government  of  Canada  Environmental 
Assessment Process 
 
Federal environmental assessment (EA) is regulated under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
(CEAA), 2012.  Under CEAA 2012, only projects that are included within the Regulations Designating 
Physical Activities require federal EA.  
 
The Houston Beneficiation Plant is considered a Designated Project pursuant to Section 15(b) of the 
Regulations  as  it  involves  the  construction,  operation,  decommissioning  and  abandonment  of  a 
metal mill with an ore input capacity of 4000 t/d or more.  This plant will be capable of upgrading 
lower  grade  ore  (50%  to  59%  Fe)  into  saleable  sinter  and  lump  products.  The  ore  beneficiation
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 165
target  for  the  Houston  Beneficiation  Plant  is  up  to  1.5  MT/yr,  which  is  based  on  a  12,000  t/d 
projection.   
 
In April 2013, CEAA notified LIM that a Federal Environmental Assessment was not required and 
in  May  2013,  the  Minister  of  Environment  and  Conservation  the  Government  of  Newfoundland 
and Labrador released this second phase of the Houston Project from the provincial environmental 
assessment process, subject to conditions.  
 
Environmental  release  of  the  various  phases  of  the  Houston  Project  allows  the  Company  to 
complete the applications for permits and regulatory approvals required for the construction of the 
haul road and rail siding, development of the Houston 1 and 2 deposits and construction of the wet 
processing plant for the Houston Project.
16.7.2
Environmental Setting
A  large  body  of  knowledge  exists  as  a  result  of  the  numerous  baseline  surveys  conducted  in  the 
region  and  the  extensive  literature  reviews  undertaken  in  support  of  these  environmental 
assessments.  A detailed and thorough analysis can be found within these documents while a brief 
summary is provided below. No additional regional environmental studies have been undertaken.
16.7.2.1  Rare Plants
Rare  plants  are  categorized  as  those  species  listed  in  Schedule  1  of  the  federal Species  at  Risk  Act 
(SARA) and designated endangered or threatened under the Newfoundland and Labrador Endangered 
Species  Act  (NLESA).    No  listed  plant  species,  protected  federally  under  Schedule  1  of  SARA  or 
provincially pursuant to the NLESA, have been identified or are suspected to occur in the Houston 
Project area.
16.7.2.2  Aquatic
There are no water bodies within the proposed footprint of the Beneficiation Plant.  The Gilling 
River and an unnamed tributary (Tributary 1) will be crossed by the process water and reject water 
pipelines, however the crossings will be along the Houston Haul Road. The only other water body 
within the project footprint is Redmond Pit.
16.7.2.3  Gilling River
The  Gilling  River  is  a  larger  system  that  originates  from  several  lakes  west  of  Schefferville  and 
generally  flows  in  a  NW  to  a  SE  direction.    The  proposed  corridor  crossing  is  situated  between 
Gilling Lake to the north and Astray Lake to the south.  The Gilling River is a coldwater system 
providing habitat for species such as brook trout.  Brook trout were angled by a first nation assistant 
during the field investigation (AECOM 2011).
16.7.2.4  Wildlife
Various field surveys have been undertaken to identify the presence of wildlife species in the vicinity 
of  the  Houston  Project  area.    These  include  wildlife  and  vegetation  surveys  conducted  on  the 
Houston Property in August 2009 (Stassinu Stantec 2010), two caribou surveys conducted in May 
2009  (D’Astous  and  Trimper  2009)  and  May  2010  (D’Astous  and  Trimper  2010),  and  additional 
surveys conducted by AECOM during the summer 2011.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 166
Caribou surveys conducted in May 2009 and May 2010 showed no use of the area by caribou at this 
time.
16.7.2.5  Species at Risk
No terrestrial wildlife species at risk were identified within the Project area during the field surveys 
conducted for the Houston Project.
16.7.2.6  Historic Resources
No archaeological or cultural sites are known or registered in the Houston Project area.  In 2011, an 
archaeological  assessment  was  conducted  of  the  proposed  Houston  road  by  Stantec  (formerly 
Jacques  Whitford)  on  behalf  of  LIM.    Based  on  the  review  of  available  information,  including 
published  and  unpublished  literature,  archaeological  reports,  the  Archaeological  Site  Record 
Inventory at the PAO and aerial photography, it was determined that given the nature and extent of 
ground  disturbances  that  have  occurred  in  the  area  from  past  mining  activities  as  well  as  the 
prevalent  topographic  and  hydrographic  features,  the  majority  of  locations  researched  have  Low 
historic resources potential (Labrador Iron Mines 2011).
16.7.2.7  ARD Sampling and Testing Program
A phased ARD sampling and testing program has been initiated to investigate and confirm the ARD 
potential for all geological materials (ore and waste) to be exposed at the Houston 1 and 2 Project 
area. Based on the static ARD test results available to date, it is not anticipated that any of the ore or 
waste materials for this Project will be acid generating 
16.7.2.8  Environmental Protection
In addition to the Schefferville Area Iron Ore Project Emergency Response Plan (ERP), LIM also has an 
approved  Waste  Management  Plan  (WMP)  and  an  approved  Environmental  Protection  Plan  (EPP)  in 
place for the Houston Project.  The WMP provides direction on waste handling, storage, transport and 
treatment of various waste produced.  The EPP outlines practical procedures required for all personnel, 
contractors or suppliers to reduce or eliminate potential adverse environmental effects associated with the 
project.  These documents will be updated, as necessary, to reflect any required changes and enforced for 
the duration of the project.  Prior to commencing operations all workers will be properly trained in the 
WMP, ERP and EPP procedures and responsibilities.
16.7.2.9
Rehabilitation and Closure
A  Rehabilitation  and  Closure  Plan  for  the  Houston  Beneficiation  Plant  will  be  prepared  and 
submitted for approval to the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Natural Resources, as 
required under the Newfoundland and Labrador Mining Act, Chapter M-15.1.  In accordance with the 
Act, the Plan will detail the rehabilitation processes to be implemented at each stage of the project 
up to and including closure. 
 
LIM intends to employ and promote strategies and methods that will minimize adverse effects on 
the environment throughout the construction and operational phases of the Project which will aid in 
the overall rehabilitation process.  Such mitigating strategies include:
  Terrain, soil and vegetation disturbances will be limited to that which is absolutely necessary
to complete the work within the defined project boundaries;
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 167
  Wherever possible, organic soils, glacial till, and excavated rock will be stockpiled separately
and protected for later rehabilitation work;
  Surface disturbances will be stabilized to limit erosion and promote natural re-vegetation;  
  Natural re-vegetation of surface disturbances will be encouraged. 
  LIM will incorporate environmental measures in the contract documents.
As such, contract documents will reflect the conditions specified for the construction and operation 
of  the  project.    Contractors  will  thus  be  contractually  bound  to  comply  with  the  environmental 
protection standards set by LIM and in effect, ensure compliance with the applicable federal and 
provincial regulatory requirements.
16.7.2.10 Closure
Approximately one year prior to the cessation of operations the rehabilitation and closure plan will 
be reviewed and updated in consultation with the Mines Branch, Department of Natural Resources.  
This final review will define the detailed closure rehabilitation design and procedures to fully reclaim 
the Houston Beneficiation Plant area. 
 
Closure  rehabilitation  within  the  LIM  development  footprint  will  generally  include  the  following 
activities:
  Clean-up, removal and proper disposal of potentially hazardous materials; 
  Dismantling  and  off-site  removal  of  buildings  and  structures  (e.g.,  beneficiation  buildings,
conveyors, crushing plant, laydown areas, fuel storage areas);
  Removal of process water, reject water, and sewage water pipelines;  
  Replacing overburden and re-vegetation of disturbed area; and  
  Re-establishment  of  site  drainage  patterns,  as  near  practical,  to  natural,  pre-development
conditions.
16.7.2.11 Post Closure Monitoring
As required, a post-closure monitoring program will be designed and implemented in consultation 
with  appropriate  regulatory  agencies.    Once  physical  and  chemical  stability  of  the  site  has  been 
achieved, the land will be relinquished to the Crown.   
 
In the fall of 2012, LIM commissioned a study to collect information on current land use activities 
in the region by individuals from the communities of Matimekush-Lac John and Kawawachikamach.  
Land use activities identified include hunting, gathering, fishing, trapping, recreational and cultural / 
spiritual  activities.    The  information  collected  will  be  used  by  LIM  to  plan  construction  and 
operation activities such that interactions between current and future mining and land users will be 
minimized.  Therefore, there will be no change to land use as a result of carrying out the Project.

16.7.4
Socio-Economic and Aboriginal
The  closest  community  to  the  Houston  Project  is  Schefferville,  Quebec  which  is  located  20  km 
north  of  the  Houston  Project,  less  than  2  km  from  the  border  with  Labrador.    Schefferville  was 
established by the Iron Ore Company of Canada in 1954 to support mining operations in the area. 
 
Iron ore mining at Schefferville ceased in 1982 and many of the 4,000 non-Aboriginal occupants left 
at that time, leaving a primarily Aboriginal community comprised of people who had settled there in 
the preceding 30 years.  Some houses and public facilities have been demolished since this time, but 
some  new  homes  have  been  built.    The  median  age  is  39.2 years,  with  approximately  60  families 
residing within the community. 
 
LIM’s James Mine went into full production in 2011, marking the first mining and production of 
iron  ore  from  this  historic  mining  area  in  over  30  years.    This  development  has  brought  many 
positive and direct benefits and the continued development of the Houston 1 and 2 Deposits and 
the construction of the beneficiation plant will build on this work.  Direct and indirect economic 
benefits for various communities and stakeholders are expected from the proposed development.  
The ongoing economic impact of such employment and contracting business will be very positive 
and lead to the development of other support and service sector jobs, education and training, and 
consistent and planned development and growth. 
 
The Houston Project will add an additional economic stimulus to the Schefferville area as well as to 
the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec.   
 
The EIS (LIM 2009) and the Houston 1 and 2 Project Registration (LIM 2012) both concluded that 
there are no significant adverse effects on communities or human health anticipated to occur as a 
result  of  either  Project.    No  changes  to  communities  or  human  health  will  occur  as  a  result  of 
carrying out the Houston Project.
16.7.5
Consultations
Since early exploration activities in 2005, LIM has been in continual contact with the communities 
located near the development area and with the Innu Nation of Labrador and other Aboriginal/First 
Nation communities having a stated interest or historic connection to the area.  LIM has initiated 
communications  with  occupants  of  cabins  identified  within  the  region  and  will  continue 
communications with them as the Project develops.  
 
As  well,  LIM  maintains  contact  with  the  civic  administration  of  the  towns  of  Labrador  City, 
Wabush, Happy Valley-Goose Bay and the town of Schefferville.  In these communities stakeholder 
consultation activities have included frequent meetings with Band Councils, Mayors and Councils, 
local  businesses,  local  political  representatives,  local  interest  groups,  provincial  and  federal 
regulators, educators and a wide variety of consultants that are involved with stakeholders.   
 
LIM  has  opened  community  relations  offices  at  the  existing  Schefferville  Area  Iron  Ore  Mine  – 
Silver Yards, and in Labrador City.  LIM is dedicated to providing early and clear information to the

community and working with all communities towards the common goal of positive, respectful and 
sustainable development in the area. 
 
Project design and implementation will include consideration of information resulting from ongoing 
consultation  with  the  communities,  traditional  environmental  knowledge,  environmental  and 
engineering considerations and best management practices.  These consultations and agreements will 
ensure a close working relationship with the local communities with respect to their involvement in 
the provision of labour, goods and services to the Project. 
 
LIM  has  engaged  in  substantial  community  and  public  consultation  activities  including  aboriginal 
consultation in both Labrador and Quebec (in the Schefferville area) and surrounding areas since 
2008 and will continue to do so during the construction and operation of the plant. 
 
LIM also conducted extensive consultations on the Houston 1 and 2 Deposits Mining Project.
16.7.6
Aboriginal Consultation
Consultation is a central objective of the environmental assessment process to identify and address 
issues and concerns related to the Project. 
 
The  Quebec-Labrador  Peninsula  area  probably  has  one  of  the  most  complicated  patterns  of 
aboriginal settlement in eastern Canada with six or possibly seven Aboriginal or First Nation peoples 
claiming traditional and native rights to all or part of the area underlain by LIM’s Iron Ore Project.  
Several of the communities have conflicting territorial or land claims.  This regional complication of 
Aboriginal/First  Nation  issues  has  prompted  the  Government  of  Canada  to  establish  an 
Overlapping  Commission  on  November  2010.    This  Commission  will  provide  a  forum  for 
addressing  the  issues  of  jurisdictional  overlap  for  the  territories  and  the  sharing  of  economic 
development initiatives as a result of mining and hydro-electric development in the region.  
 
The  Aboriginal  groups  of  the  Quebec-Labrador  Peninsula  most  directly  affected  by  the  Houston 
Project  are  the  Innu  Nation  of  Labrador,  the  Naskapi  Nation  of  Kawawachikamach,  the  Innu 
Nation of Matimekush-Lac John, the Innu Nation of Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam (ITUM) 
and NunatuKavut (formerly the Labrador Métis Nation). (Figure 16-14).  These groups may have 
overlapping land claims issues or traditional claims covering western Labrador.  The Naskapi Nation 
is  the  only  group  with  a  finalized  comprehensive  land  claim  agreement;  the  others  are  in  various 
stages  of  negotiation  with  the  federal  and  provincial  governments.    However,  the  land  claims  of 
Quebec Aboriginal groups in Labrador have not been accepted for negotiation by the Government 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
 
LIM  has  pursued  an  extensive  and  proactive  engagement  with  all  of  the  aboriginal  communities 
living  close  to  the  project  location  or  having  traditional  claims  to  the  surrounding  territory  and 
commenced such consultations respecting the Schefferville Area Iron Ore Mine (Western Labrador) 
Project.  
 
These  consultations  have  resulted  in  the  signing  of  IBA  agreements  with  the  Innu  Nation  of 
Labrador  (July  2008),  the  Naskapi  Nation  of  Kawawachikamach  (September  2010),  Uashat  mak

Mani-Utinem  First  Nation  (June  2011)  and  the  Matimekush  –  Lac  John  First  Nation  (February 
2012). 
 
The  respective  agreements  relate  to  the  establishment  of  a  positive  ongoing  relationship  between 
LIM and the Aboriginal/First Nation relating to the development and operation of the Project and 
to the economic benefits that will accrue to the aboriginal communities.  Specifically the agreements 
make provisions for employment, education and training, contract opportunities, social and financial 
benefits, environment and cultural protection measures. 
 
The agreements include processes for the respective communities to directly participate and/or be 
actively consulted through:
Implementation committee;
 
  Community collaboration committee; 
  Training and education committee; 
  Establishing employment and workplace conditions; 
  Business and contracting opportunities; 
  Environmental monitoring committee; 
  Traditional knowledge collection; 
  Heritage resource and cultural protection; and 
  Economic benefits.
The  Implementation  Committee  is  made  up  of  representatives  from  each  of  the  Aboriginal 
communities  and  LIM  senior  management.    The  agenda  of  these  quarterly  meetings  include:  a 
Project  Safety  report,  updates  on  operations,  environmental  performance,  upcoming  contracts, 
human resources, employment and training and upcoming activities and projects.

Aboriginal Communities
LIM  has  consulted  with  the  four  Aboriginal  communities  on  all  phases  of  the  Schefferville  Area 
Mine Project as well as the Houston Project and has obtained concurrence on the permits required 
for construction and operation activities.
16.7.8
Employment, Occupations and Economic Benefits
As demonstrated at the existing James Mine, LIM is committed to the creation and implementation 
of employment equity practices to help achieve maximum employment and training benefits for the 
region,  including  the  recruitment,  training,  and  advancement  of  qualified  visible  minorities  and 
women, and, as such, is fully prepared to implement a Women’s Employment Plan in association 
with the development and operation of the Project.  LIM is also committed to ensuring maximum 
benefit to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who reside nearest the resources.   
 
LIM currently has an approved Benefits Plan and a Women’s Employment Plan in place, which will 
be implemented during the construction and operation of beneficiation plant.

Employment
Approximately 112 employees will be required during the construction phase of the Beneficiation 
Plant.    Certain  management  positions  will  be  required  throughout  construction  and  may  overlap 
with positions at LIM’s existing operating mines at the James Mine.   
 
Approximately 23 full-time direct or contract employees will be required during the operation phase 
of the Plant.  The operating schedule is based on two 12 hour shifts per day on a continuous basis 
from May through to November annually.

Capital and Operating Cost Estimates
The  information  included  in  this  section  was  provided  by  Labrador  Iron  Mines  and  reviewed  by 
DRA.  Mr. Justin Taylor, P.Eng. is responsible for the contents of this section. 
 
The Houston & Malcolm 1 Project have been planned as a multi-phase mining operation which is 
expected to have a mine life of more than 14 years.
16.8.1
Construction
Capital costs for the Houston Phase One project for road, rail siding and Houston 1 and 2 mine site 
development is estimated at $60 million. Out of this total, $37 million, excluding any contingency, is 
budgeted in Year 1.  
 
The capital cost summary for Phase 1 is included in the following Table 16-4:

Mine  engineering  and  mine  development  costs  in  Year  One  include  mine  design,  site  design, 
acquiring all required permits, and construction costs for haul road. In Year Two, this cost includes 
mine pre-stripping including tree clearing, topsoil removal and storage for later reclamation use, and 
waste pre-stripping.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 174
The construction costs for the haul road will cover construction of a 8 km of 8.5m to 11.5 m wide 
access  road.  This  road  will  be  configured  for  access  to  the  Houston  1  &  2  deposits  as  well  as 
Houston  3  and  Malcolm  1  from  the  Redmond  property  which  is  connected  by  existing  road  to 
LIM’s Silver Yards processing facility and operating James Open Pit mine. The construction cost 
includes a steel long span panel bridge across the Gilling River that will allow for canoes and small 
watercraft to pass under and does not impact the high water mark of the watercourse.  
 
It is assumed Houston rail siding construction will occur in Year One but, depending on season and 
time  of  year,  maybe  deferred  to  Year  Two.  The  rail  siding  will  be  constructed  along  the  main 
Tshiuetin rail line connecting Schefferville to Emeril Junction west of Labrador City. This siding will 
be 5km long and allow for loading of rail cars at that location.  
 
Other  civil  and  facilities  costs  include  dewatering  planned  for  Year  One,  engineering  and 
construction  supervision  costs,  and  minor  facilities  needed  for  the  operation  such  as  temporary 
security buildings, offices, and maintenance facilities. 
 
Other  civil  and  facilities  planned  for  Year  Two  include  dewatering,  engineering  and  construction 
supervision costs, and minor facilities needed for the operation such as temporary security buildings, 
offices, and maintenance facilities. 
 
Metallurgy and process design costs in Year One refer to metallurgical testing and design, and in 
Year  2  represent  the  costs  are  for  procurement  and  installation  of  dry  crushing  and  screening 
equipment. 
 
The estimating accuracy for the capital costs contained in this report are considered to be +/- 20%, 
level  of  estimating  accuracy.  Certain  elements  in  the  capital  cost  related  to  haul  road  and  railway 
siding are at a detailed design level. Firm contractor quotations have been obtained for some of the 
Phase 1 work.  
 
An independent desktop evaluation was undertaken by DRA using the capital line items provided by 
Labrador Iron Mines and the capital numbers were arrived at independently was in the order of $60 
million  including  a  13%  overall  contingency  comprised  of  a  weighted  contingency  per  line  item. 
Based on this evaluation, the DRA numbers are within 4% of the projected capital costs estimated 
by LIM. This is within the estimating accuracy of a typical desktop study of +/- 30%, and therefore 
DRA believes these costs to be a reasonable estimate of the overall capital costs for the Houston 1 
and 2 project as described above.
16.8.2
Houston Phase 2: Wet Plant  Capital Cost Estimate
For Phase 2 of the Houston Project, the Beneficiation Plantit is estimated that ,  subject to detailed 
engineering and design, an additional investment of $65 to $70 million will be required, anticipated 
in Year 3 of the Houston Project, for the construction of the Houston wet beneficiation plant. As at 
March 31, 2013 LIM had invested $74 million on its Silver Yards Beneficiation Plant for the James 
Mine. The Silver Yards Plant is generally of a similar size and design to the proposed Houston plant, 
and represents a reasonable comparative estimate of the capital costs of the Houston Plant.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 175
16.8.3
Houston Operating Costs
Mine  operating  costs  for  Houston  Phase  1,  with  dry  crushing  and  screening  only,  are  estimated 
initially at $60 per tonne. With the introduction of the wet processing plant in Phase 2, there will be 
additional  operating  costs  but  with  the  efficiencies  associated  with  increased  production,  it  is 
expected that operating costs for Phase 2 will remain in the range of $65 per tonne. 
 
As  the  projected  Houston  operating  costs  are  generally  based  on  existing  mining  experience  at 
LIM’s  James  Mine  and  LIM’s  existing  agreements  for  railway  and  port  facilities  the  projected 
Houston operating costs are considered to be at an accuracy of +/-10%. 
 
Operating  costs  include  all  mining,  processing,  site  general  and  administrative  costs,  and  all  rail 
transportation costs, including unloading at the Port of Sept-Îles. Houston mining and processing 
costs are estimated on the basis of owner-operator, rather than contract services.

Preliminary Production Schedule
The Houston and Malcolm deposits contain a total estimate of 39.3 million tonnes of NI-43-101 
indicated resource iron ore of potential direct shipping quality with an anticipated 10-15 year mine 
life. 
 
Construction  of  Houston  Phase  1  can  commence  immediately  after  securing  financing,  and  will 
ensure initial access and development, with processing higher grade ores through a dry crushing and 
screening process.  
 
Mobilization to the site and set-up of basic site services and access can commence once the required 
permits  are  in  place.  Site  preparation,  infrastructure  construction  and  full  start-up  (ready  for 
production)  are  anticipated  to  take  at  least  three  months.  Subject  to  regulatory  approvals, 
construction is assumed to start at the Houston 1 and 2 deposits and on the Houston haul road in 
Year  1  and  first  ore  on  train  can  potentially  be  delivered  within  one  year  of  construction  start, 
depending in part on seasonal constraints.
SGS Canada Inc.
Mineral Resource Update Houston & Malcolm 1 Property, Labrador West Area, Newfoundland Labrador, Canada, LIMHL   Page 176
Production is preliminary scheduled to commence in the last quarter of Year 1 (Table 16-6) with the 
introduction of the beneficiation wet plant in Year 4.  
 
The estimated production schedule for the Houston wet process beneficiation plant is based on 600 
tonnes per hour (12,000 tonnes per day) capacity with maximum of 720 tonnes per hour.  Based on 
the 12,000 tonnes per day capacity and the expected overall recovery of 75%, it is estimated that a 
total of 1.5 million tonnes of product will be recovered from 2.0 million tonnes of feed per year over 
the 12 year life of mine, which is assumed to include Malcolm and Houston 3 (Table 16-26).

16.9.1
Malcolm 1 Project
The Malcolm 1 project is located 6 kilometers north-west of the Houston projects and is located in 
the province of Quebec. The existing access road will be upgraded to accommodate ore haulage and 
equipment movement.  
 
It is anticipated that the Malcolm 1 project would use all major infrastructure built for the Houston 
projects.  A  separate  dry  crushing  and  screening  facility  will  be  required  for  the  project.  Products 
produced from dry crushing and screening will be hauled to the Houston haulage road and onward 
to the railway siding for loading. Low grade ore will be hauled to the Houston phase 2 wet facility 
for processing.  
 
Malcolm 1 proposed open pit mines designs are not yet finalized as these properties are still in the 
early stage of planning. 
 
Figure 16-1 and Figure 16-3 show the location of the Malcolm 1 project.
16.9.2
Houston 3 Project

The Houston 3 project is located to the south of the Houston 1 & 2 project and will utilize the same 
infrastructure. The Houston 3 project will utilize the Houston haul road to deliver the ore to the 
plant for processing and the products to rail siding.

The results of LIMHL’s work to date on the Houston deposits has shown that there is sufficient 
merit to continue with the development of the Houston 1 & 2 deposits and to carry out further 
exploration work to confirm and expand the resource potential of the Houston 3 deposit, as well as 
to conduct preliminary evaluation of the potential for lower grade taconite deposits along the eastern 
flank of the Houston DSO resource zones.

merit to continue with the development of the deposit and to carry out further exploration work to 
confirm and expand the resource potential. 
 
The results of the 2012 data verification indicated that the DDH Houston check sampling had very 
good correlation and no significant errors were detected. The RC method has dramatically improved 
since  the  last  field  season  and  errors  with  the  method  decreased  significantly  over  the  2012  field 
season  No  obvious  bias  was  observed  on  Malcolm  1  check  sampling  2012  data.  The  sign  test 
identified  a  bias  while  the  student  T  test  did  not  show  any  errors.  Additionally,  the  difference 
between means for iron and silica was considered negligible.

(Item 26) Recommendations
18.
SGS Geostat recommends LIMHL to continue its continuous QA/QC program.  
 
SGS Geostat suggest inserting real blanks and certified materials as well as regular field, prep coarse 
rejects pulp duplicates and the use of a second laboratory for checks.  
 
SGS recommends the continued use of diamond drilling in order to obtain core from all of its work 
areas.  Recent  2012  DDH  drilling  campaign  demonstrated  a  good  recovery  of  core  (over  85% 
recovery) masking assay results, lithological and physical information more accessible with an almost 
constant volume in order to better define the in situ Specific Gravity and to gather material at depth 
for metallurgical tests and possibly geotechnical tests. The tests should include general mineralogy, 
QEMSCAN,  grindability  and  Bond  Work  Index,  scrubbing  tests,  size  analysis  and  assays  from 
before  and  after  scrubbing,  density  separation,  jigging  tests,  WHIMS  tests,  settling  tests  without 
using flocculants, Vacuum filtration (assuming vacuum disc filter).  
 
SGS understands that the Houston 3 deposit is at a lesser stage of development than the Houston 1 
& 2 but suggests carrying the metallurgical tests and rotary and vibrating drilling as well.  
 
LIM  currently  uses  the  IOC  Ore  Type  categories  for  resources  statements  and  disclosures  of  its 
mineral  deposits  and  projects.  This  classification  system  permits  the  reader  to  compare  historical 
resources and reserves with current LIMHL estimates. All of the mineral resources present in this 
report are current and are in accordance with NI-43-101 regulations.  
 
LIMHL has adopted new Ore Type classification system to reflect the James deposit currently in 
production  (See  bullets  below).  This  classification  system  is  based  on  marketable  material  and 
LIMHL  beneficiation  capabilities  at  the  moment.  SGS  recommends  the  disclosure  of  all  of  the 
mineral  deposits  using  the  updated  LIMHL  Ore  Type  classification  system  in  order  to  retain 
continuity in reporting of their mineral resources estimates.

SGS understands that the Houston 3 sector is at a lesser stage of development than the Houston 1 
& 2 sectors but suggest continuing the metallurgical tests and diamond drilling as well. Houston 3 
remains open to the southeast and this extension should be tested with more drilling.  
 
Infill core drilling in Malcolm 1 is recommended. The possible northern extension enrichment in 
Malcolm 1 should be tested with further drilling and in addition exploration work between Houston 
2 and Malcolm 1 should be carried out in order to determine the continuity of mineral enrichment 
between these two deposits.

The  following  budgetary  recommendations  below  are  purely  conceptual.  The  metallurgical  tests 
costs estimates are purely conceptual and LIM should inquire on the update of a formal proposal for 
such tests, assay costs only as a reference. The access, logistics, camp, meals and equipment rental 
costs are not included in this recommended work.
