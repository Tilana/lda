CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Various statements and information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) that express a
belief, expectation, or intention, or that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements include statements,
projections and estimates concerning our future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, oil and natural gas reserves, drilling program,
capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, the timing and success of specific projects, outcomes and effects of litigation, claims and disputes,
derivative activities and potential financing. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,”
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “potential,” “could,” “may,” “foresee,” “plan,” “goal” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and
assumptions about future events and their potential effect on us. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our
experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those implied or expressed by any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these
statements unless required by law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to
be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties relating
to, among other matters, the risks discussed in “Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Reports and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, as well as those factors summarized below:
·         declines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas, or sustained depressed prices we receive, for our oil and natural gas;
·         uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves;
·         drilling and operating risks;
·         the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility;
·         the effects of government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the
export of oil and natural gas;
·         the impact of potential changes in our credit ratings;
·         environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including
groundwater contamination;
·         difficult and adverse conditions in the domestic and global capital and credit markets;
·         risks related to the concentration of our operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas;
·         disruptions to, capacity constraints in or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas and other
processing and transportation considerations;
·         the costs and availability of equipment, resources, services and qualified personnel required to perform our drilling and operating activities;
·         potential financial losses or earnings reductions from our commodity price risk-management program;
·         risks and liabilities associated with acquired properties or businesses;
·         uncertainties about our ability to successfully execute our business and financial plans and strategies;
·         uncertainties about our ability to replace reserves and economically develop our current reserves;
·         general economic and business conditions, either internationally or domestically;
·         competition in the oil and natural gas industry; and
·         uncertainty concerning our assumed or possible future results of operations.
Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of
any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reserve
engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such
revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil
and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.

Concho Resources Inc.
Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
Unaudited
Note 1. Organization and nature of operations
Concho Resources Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation formed on February 22, 2006. The Company’s principal business is the acquisition,
development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily located in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.
Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its 100 percent owned
subsidiaries. The Company consolidates the financial statements of these entities. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.
Reclassifications. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net
loss, total stockholders’ equity or cash flows.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Depletion of oil and natural gas properties is determined using estimates of proved oil and
natural gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of
production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties are
subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future recoverable reserves, commodity price outlooks and prevailing market rates of
other sources of income and costs. Other significant estimates include, but are not limited to, asset retirement obligations, fair value of derivative financial
instruments, fair value of business combinations, fair value of nonmonetary exchanges, fair value of stock-based compensation and income taxes.
Interim financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have not been audited by the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm, except that the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 is derived from audited consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, management has made certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures
of contingencies. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results.
Certain disclosures have been condensed in or omitted from these consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these condensed notes to the
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Equity method investments. The Company owns a 50 percent membership interest in a midstream joint venture, Alpha Crude Connector, LLC (“ACC”),
that constructed a crude oil gathering and transportation system in the northern Delaware Basin. ACC commenced partial operations in late 2015 and
completed construction of the pipeline in April 2016. The Company has the option to purchase the membership interest of the other investor in ACC. This
purchase option became exercisable in July 2016 and remains exercisable for a period of twelve months. The Company accounts for its investment in ACC
under the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The Company’s net investment in ACC was approximately $129.0 million
and $98.9 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
The equity loss for the six months ended June 30,

2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and is included in other expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded $1.5 million of capitalized interest on its investment in ACC.
During 2015, the Company purchased a 25 percent membership interest in an entity constructing a crude oil gathering and transportation system in the
southern Delaware Basin. The system is partially operational and is expected to be completed during 2016. The Company accounts for its investment under
the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The Company’s net investment was approximately $26.0 million and $20.8
million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity
loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately $2.3 million and is included in other expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations.
Revenue recognition. Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded at the time of physical transfer of such products to the purchaser, which for the Company is
primarily at the wellhead. The Company follows the sales method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales, recognizing revenues based on the Company’s
actual proceeds from the oil and natural gas sold to purchasers.
General and administrative expense. The Company receives fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties and records such
reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expense. Such fees totaled approximately $6.0 million and $6.4 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $12.5 million and $12.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Recent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new
revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in
exchange for those goods or services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which deferred the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. An entity
can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective
method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. The
Company is evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which supersedes current lease guidance. The new lease standard requires all
leases with a term greater than one year to be recognized on the balance sheet while maintaining substantially similar classifications for finance and
operating leases. Lease expense recognition on the income statement will be effectively unchanged. This guidance is effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensations (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment
Accounting,” which changes the accounting and presentation for share-based payment arrangements in the following areas: (i) recognition in the statement
of operations of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (ii) cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (iii) minimum statutory withholding
thresholds and the classification on the cash flow statement of the withheld amounts; and (iv) an accounting policy election to recognize

evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Exploratory well costs
The Company capitalizes exploratory well costs until a determination is made that the well has either found proved reserves or that it is impaired. After an
exploratory well has been completed and found oil and natural gas reserves, a determination may be pending as to whether the oil and natural reserves can
be classified as proved. In those circumstances, the Company continues to capitalize the well or project costs pending the determination of proved status if (i)
the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (ii) the Company is making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The capitalized exploratory well costs are carried in unproved oil and natural gas
properties. See Note 16 for the proved and unproved components of oil and natural gas properties. If the exploratory well is determined to be impaired, the
well costs are charged to exploration and abandonments expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

that was initially drilled to monitor nearby pad wells and is expected to be completed in 2016. These costs became greater than one year old during the three
months ended March 31, 2016.
Note 4. Acquisitions and divestitures
Asset acquisition. In March 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of 80 percent of a third-party seller’s interest in certain oil and natural gas
properties and related assets in the southern Delaware Basin. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued to the seller approximately 2.2
million shares of common stock with an approximate value of $230.8 million, $146.2 million in cash and $40.0 million to carry a portion of the seller’s future
development costs in these properties.
Asset divestiture. In February 2016, the Company sold certain assets in the northern Delaware Basin for proceeds of approximately $292.0 million and
recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110.1 million.
Note 5. Asset retirement obligations

Note 7. Disclosures about fair value measurements
The Company uses a valuation framework based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are classified into two
categories: observable inputs and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas
unobservable inputs reflect a company’s own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and
effort. These two types of inputs are further prioritized into the following fair value input hierarchy:
Level 1:     Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The
Company considers active markets to be those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2:     Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset
or liability. This category includes those derivative instruments that the Company values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are
observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data, or supported by observable levels at
which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Level 2 instruments primarily include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter
commodity price swaps, basis swaps, collars and floors, investments and interest rate swaps. The Company’s valuation models are primarily industry-
standard models that consider various inputs including: (i) quoted forward prices for commodities, (ii) time value, (iii) current market and contractual prices for
the underlying instruments and (iv) volatility factors, as well as other relevant economic measures.
Level 3:     Prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources
(i.e., supported by little or no market activity). The Company’s valuation models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various inputs including:
(i) quoted forward prices for commodities, (ii) time value, (iii) volatility factors and (iv) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as
well as other relevant economic measures.

Derivative instruments. The fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments is estimated by management considering various factors, including closing
exchange and over-the-counter quotations and the time value of the underlying commitments. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels. The following tables summarize (i) the valuation of each of the Company’s financial instruments by required fair value hierarchy levels and (ii) the
gross fair value by the appropriate balance sheet classification, even when the derivative instruments are subject to netting arrangements and qualify for net
presentation in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company nets the fair value of derivative
instruments by counterparty in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Concentrations of credit risk. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s primary concentrations of credit risk are the risk of collecting accounts receivable and the
risk of counterparties’ failure to perform under derivative obligations.
The Company has entered into International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”) with each of its derivative counterparties.
The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide the Company and the counterparties with rights of set-off upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either
the Company or a counterparty to a derivative, whereby the party not in default may set off all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all
derivative asset receivables from the defaulting party. See Note 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s derivative activities and counterparties.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
Impairments of long-lived assets – The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas
properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for
instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. The Company reviews its oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An
impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated
undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the Company’s assets, it recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
The Company calculates the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of its long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management’s
assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for
differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible
reserves, and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s estimates of commodity prices
for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2016 price of $49.54 per barrel of oil and
$3.04 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $57.77 per barrel of oil and $3.50 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after
2023.
The Company calculates the estimated fair values of its long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value
assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for
differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible
reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were
discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value. These are classified as Level 3 fair value assumptions.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of the
Company’s Yeso field of approximately $3.4 billion exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against
earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The non-cash charge represented the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the
assets.
The following table reports the carrying amount, estimated fair value and impairment expense of long-lived assets for the indicated period:

Amount
(Level 3)
It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the Company’s long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the
need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity prices including differentials, (ii) increases
or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-
adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) changes in income and expenses from integrated assets.

Note 8. Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. Commodity derivative instruments are used to
(i) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the oil and natural gas the Company produces and sells, (ii) support the Company’s capital budget
and expenditure plans and (iii) support the economics associated with acquisitions. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes. The Company may also enter into physical delivery contracts to effectively provide commodity price hedges. Because these
physical delivery contracts are not expected to be net cash settled, they are considered to be normal sales contracts and not derivatives. Therefore, these
contracts are not recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not designate its derivative instruments to qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the Company reflects changes in the fair value of its
derivative instruments in its statements of operations as they occur.
The following table summarizes the amounts reported in earnings related to the commodity derivative instruments for the three and six months ended June

Note 10. Commitments and contingencies
Legal actions.  The Company is a party to proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the
Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to any such proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations. The Company will
continue to evaluate proceedings and claims involving the Company on a regular basis and will establish and adjust any reserves as appropriate to reflect its
assessment of the then current status of the matters.
Severance tax, royalty and joint interest audits.  The Company is subject to routine severance, royalty and joint interest audits from regulatory bodies and
non-operators and makes accruals as necessary for estimated exposure when deemed probable and estimable. Additionally, the Company is subject to
various possible contingencies that arise primarily from interpretations affecting the oil and natural gas industry. Such contingencies include differing
interpretations as to the prices at which oil and natural gas sales may be made, the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their
leases, allowable costs under joint interest arrangements and other matters. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $13.8 million and
$13.4 million, respectively, accrued for estimated exposure. Although the Company believes that it has estimated its exposure with respect to the various
laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations thereof, adjustments could be required as new interpretations and regulations are issued.

37.1 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 differed from amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax loss due primarily to state taxes and the impact of
permanent differences between book and taxable income.

Unvested restricted stock awards represent participating securities because they participate in nonforfeitable dividends or
distributions with the common equity holders of the Company. Participating earnings represent the distributed earnings of the
Company attributable to the participating securities. Unvested restricted stock awards do not participate in undistributed net losses
as they are not contractually obligated to do so.

Performance unit awards. The number of shares of common stock that will ultimately be issued for performance units will be determined by a combination
of (i) comparing the Company’s total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of a predetermined group of peer companies at the end of the
performance period and (ii) the Company’s absolute total shareholder return at the end of the performance period. The performance period is 36 months. The
actual payout of shares will be between zero and 300 percent.

Note 14. Subsidiary guarantors
All of the Company’s 100 percent owned subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company’s senior notes. The indentures governing the
Company’s senior notes provide that the guarantees of its subsidiary guarantors will be released in certain customary circumstances including (i) in
connection with any sale, exchange or other disposition, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the capital stock of that guarantor to a person that
is not the Company or a restricted subsidiary of the Company, such that, after giving effect to such transaction, such guarantor would no longer constitute a
subsidiary of the Company, (ii) in connection with any sale, exchange or other disposition (other than a lease) of all or substantially all of the assets of that
guarantor to a person that is not the Company or a restricted subsidiary of the Company, (iii) upon the merger of a guarantor into the Company or any other
guarantor or the liquidation or dissolution of a guarantor, (iv) if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor to be an unrestricted
subsidiary in accordance with the indenture, (v) upon legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture and (vi) upon written notice of such
release or discharge by the Company to the trustee following the release or discharge of all guarantees by such guarantor of any indebtedness that resulted
in the creation of such guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee.
See Note 9 for a summary of the Company’s senior notes. In accordance with practices accepted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), the Company has prepared condensed consolidating financial statements in order to quantify the assets, results of operations and cash flows of
such subsidiaries as subsidiary guarantors.
The following condensed consolidating balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, condensed consolidating statements of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, present financial information for Concho Resources Inc. as the parent on a stand-alone basis (carrying any investments in subsidiaries under the
equity method), financial information for the subsidiary guarantors on a stand-alone basis and the consolidation and elimination entries necessary to arrive at
the information for the Company on a consolidated basis. All current and deferred income taxes are recorded on Concho Resources Inc., as the subsidiaries
are flow-through entities for income tax purposes. The subsidiary guarantors are not restricted from making distributions to the Company.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This
section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes.
Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution
that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties.
Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Concho’s legacy in the Permian Basin provides
us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are also at the forefront of applying new technologies, such as horizontal drilling and
enhanced completion techniques, throughout our three core operating areas: the New Mexico Shelf, the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin. In the New
Mexico Shelf, we primarily target the Yeso formation with horizontal drilling; in the Delaware Basin, we use horizontal drilling to target the Bone Spring
formation (including the Avalon shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale formation; and in the Midland Basin, we target the Wolfcamp and
Spraberry formations with horizontal drilling. Oil comprised 59 percent of our 623.5 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 and
62.7 percent of our 25.9 MMBoe of production for the six months ended June 30, 2016. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we
operated wells that accounted for 93 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 78.9 percent of our 7,636 gross wells at December 31, 2015. By
controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and
stimulation methods used.
Financial and Operating Performance
Our financial and operating performance for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included the following highlights:
·         Net loss was $1.3 billion ($(9.94) per diluted share) as compared to net loss of $113.0 million ($(0.97) per diluted share) for the first six months of 2016
and 2015, respectively. The increase in net loss was primarily due to:
•       $1.5 billion in impairments of long-lived assets during the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf
area;
•       $271.1 million decrease in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 30 percent decrease in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the
effects of derivative activities), partially offset by a 2 percent increase in production;
•       $184.8 million increase in the loss on derivatives during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 2015;
•       $26.4 million increase in exploration and abandonment expense primarily due to leasehold abandonments during the six  months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to 2015; and
•       $19.0 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to an increase in production;
partially offset by:
•       $685.5 million change in our income tax benefit due to the increase in our net loss before income taxes;
•       $111.5 million increase in (gain) loss on disposition of assets, net primarily due to our February 2016 asset divestiture; and
29
•       $42.6 million decrease in oil and natural gas production expense.
·         Average daily sales volumes of 142,319 Boe per day during the first six months of 2016 were up slightly as compared to 139,826 Boe per day during
the first six months of 2015.
·         Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $239.1 million to $249.8 million for the first six months of 2016, as compared to
$488.9 million in the first six months of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues, partially offset by a decrease in production and
cash general and administrative expenses.
·         Cash increased by approximately $252.7 million during the first six months of 2016 primarily as a result of operating cash flows and our divestiture that
closed in February 2016, partially offset by the cash consideration related to our asset acquisition that closed in March 2016.
Commodity Prices
Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in
the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, (ii) market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.
Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, include, but are not limited to:
·         continuing economic uncertainty worldwide;
·         political and economic developments in oil and natural gas producing regions, including Africa, South America and the Middle East;
·         the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil
prices and production controls;
·         technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;
·         domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including limits on the United States’ ability to export crude oil, and taxation;
·         the level of global inventories;
·         the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities, as well as the availability of commodity processing and
gathering and refining capacity;
·         risks related to the concentration of our operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas and the level of commodity
inventory in the Permian Basin;
·         the quality of the oil we produce;
·         the overall global demand for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids;
·         the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;
·         political and economic events that directly or indirectly impact the relative strength or weakness of the United States dollar, on which oil and natural gas
commodity prices are benchmarked globally, against foreign currencies;
·         the effect of energy conservation efforts;
·         the price and availability of alternative fuels; and
·         overall North American oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids supply and demand fundamentals, including:
•       the United States economy,
•       weather conditions, and
•       liquefied natural gas deliveries to and exports from the United States.
30
Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices
for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect
that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 15 of the
Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)” for additional information
regarding our commodity derivative positions at June 30, 2016 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to June 30, 2016, respectively.
Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. In general, average oil and natural gas prices were
significantly lower during the comparable periods of 2016 measured against 2015. The following table sets forth the average New York Mercantile Exchange
(“NYMEX”) oil and natural gas prices for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same

Bbl and $2.77 per MMBtu, respectively.
31
Recent Events
Asset acquisition. In March 2016, we completed an acquisition of 80 percent of a third-party seller’s interest in certain oil and natural gas properties and
related assets in the southern Delaware Basin. As consideration for the acquisition, we issued to the seller approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock
with an approximate value of $230.8 million, $146.2 million in cash and $40.0 million to carry a portion of the seller’s future development costs in these
properties.
Asset divestiture. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in the northern Delaware Basin for proceeds of approximately $292.0 million and recognized a
pre-tax gain of approximately $110.1 million.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instrument exposure. At June 30, 2016, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net asset of $176.0 million. All of our
counterparties to these financial derivatives are parties or affiliates of parties to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative
exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit
facility, we do not have exposure to potential “margin calls” on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our
counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender
against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party or its affiliates.
New commodity derivative contracts. After June 30, 2016, we entered into the following oil price swaps, oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to
hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production:

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Oil and natural gas revenues.  Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $396.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
$141.1 million (26 percent) from $537.4 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices. Specific
factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:
·         total oil production was 8,137 MBbl  for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease  of 894 MBbl  from 9,031 MBbl  for 2015;
·         average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $41.68 per Bbl during the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
20 percent  from $52.14  per Bbl during 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.88) per
Bbl, or a realization of approximately 91.5 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(5.66) per Bbl, or a realization of
approximately 90.2 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin.
Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our
realized oil price. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a
price reduction of $0.17 per Bbl and $0.60 per Bbl, respectively;
·         total natural gas production was 30,434 MMcf  for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase  of 4,151 MMcf  (16 percent) from 26,283 MMcf 
for 2015; and
·         average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $1.88 per Mcf during the three months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of 26 percent  from $2.53 per Mcf during 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately 83.9 percent and
92.3 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price
(excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percent of NYMEX during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 include (i) a decrease in the
posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate, (ii) increased deductions and fees
from the natural gas price on which we are paid, comparatively and (iii) the average Mont Belvieu price of $18.16 per Bbl compared to $18.67 per Bbl during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
During December 2015, a third-party natural gas processing plant located in the northern Delaware Basin became inoperable following an explosion. The
plant became fully operational during April 2016.

Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate,
but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices.
Lease operating expenses were $72.3 million ($5.47 per Boe) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which was a decrease of $19.8 million from $92.1
million ($6.86 per Boe) for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses during the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to 2015 was due primarily to (i) a focused effort to identify operational cost efficiencies, (ii) reduced water disposal costs and (iii) an overall
decrease in the costs for goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating
expenses noted above while production remained relatively flat period over period.
Workover expenses were approximately $4.8 million and $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was
primarily related to less overall activity during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015.
Production taxes per unit of production were $2.26 per Boe during the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 20 percent from $2.83 per Boe
during 2015. Over the same period, our revenue per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 25 percent. The decrease in production taxes
per unit of production was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Included in the second quarter of 2015 were tax credits of
approximately $1.3 million that related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance taxes. Notwithstanding the impact of these tax credits,
production taxes per unit of production would have decreased 24 percent period over period.

Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and
core analysis.
Our exploratory dry hole costs during the three months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Delaware Basin area that
was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the three months ended June 30,
2015 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Delaware Basin area that was attempting to establish production in a zone not previously
producing in the general area.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $11.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our abandonments were primarily within our Delaware Basin area where we identified (i) drilling locations which,
based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage.

Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $275.3 million ($20.84 per Boe) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
$24.5 million (8 percent) from $299.8 million ($22.35 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per
Boe coupled with a slight decrease in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe period over period was primarily due to a non-cash
impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by an overall decrease in proved reserves period over
period caused by (i) lower commodity prices and (ii) reclassification of proved reserves to unproven that are no longer expected to be developed within the
five years of their initial recording as required by SEC rules, which were partially offset by capital cost reductions.
36
The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items.
Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and
their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there
are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are
less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
estimated fair value of the asset.
We calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management’s assumptions and
expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital
expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and (vii) prevailing market rates of
income and expenses from integrated assets. At June 30, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash
flows are based on the NYMEX strip, which ranged from a 2016 price of $49.54 per barrel of oil and $3.04 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $57.77 per
barrel of oil and $3.50 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023.
We calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions
associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials,
(iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii)
prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an
annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The
primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs,
(iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv)
results of future drilling activities and (v) changes in income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would
have been approximately 10 percent lower as of June 30, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve
volumes, no impairment would be indicated.

General and administrative expenses were approximately $53.4 million ($4.04 per Boe) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $7.5 million
(12 percent) from $60.9 million ($4.54 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of a general
company-wide initiative to reduce general and administrative costs, while the decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an
increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in general and
administrative costs noted above while production remained relatively flat period over period.
As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production
phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $6.0 million and $6.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which
could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to
the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses.

The decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit
facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering. The increase in interest expense was due to a reduction in capitalized interest
period over period, partially offset by an overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance.
39
Income tax provisions.  We recorded an income tax benefit of $158.2 million and $70.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The change in our income tax benefit was primarily due to the increase in our net loss before income taxes. The effective income tax rates for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 37.3 percent and 37.0 percent, respectively.
40
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Oil and natural gas revenues.  Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $679.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
$271.1 million (28 percent) from $950.9 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices. Specific
factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:
·         total oil production was 16,237 MBbl  for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease  of 860 MBbl  (5 percent) from 17,097 MBbl  for 2015;
·         average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $35.80 per Bbl during the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
25 percent  from $47.99  per Bbl during 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.85) per Bbl,
or a realization of approximately 90.3 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(5.34) per Bbl, or a realization of
approximately 90.0 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin.
Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our
realized oil price. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a
price reduction of $0.01 per Bbl and $1.29 per Bbl, respectively;
·         total natural gas production was 57,991 MMcf  for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase  of 8,723 MMcf  (18 percent) from 49,268 MMcf  for
2015; and
·         average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $1.70 per Mcf during the six months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of 36 percent  from $2.65 per Mcf during 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately 80.2 percent and
95.3 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price
(excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percent of NYMEX during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the
posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate, (ii) increased deductions and fees
from the regional natural gas price, comparatively and (iii) the average Mont Belvieu price of $16.32 per Bbl compared to $18.99 per Bbl during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
During December 2015, a third-party natural gas processing plant located in the northern Delaware Basin became inoperable following an explosion. We
estimate that this event negatively impacted production for the six months ended June 30, 2016 by approximately 2.4  MBoepd. The plant became fully
operational during April 2016.

Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate,
but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices.
Lease operating expenses were $159.3 million ($6.15 per Boe) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which was a decrease of $16.4 million from $175.7
million ($6.94 per Boe) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to 2015 was due primarily to (i) a focused effort to identify operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the costs for goods and
services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above while there was a
slight increase in production period over period.
Workover expenses were approximately $10.2 million and $13.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was
primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015.
Production taxes per unit of production were $1.81 per Boe during the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 32 percent from $2.66 per Boe during
2015. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices and due to tax credits of approximately $3.7 million received during the
first quarter of 2016 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates as compared to approximately $1.3 million of similar tax
credits received during the second quarter of 2015. Over the same period, our revenue per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 30
percent.

Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and
core analysis.
Our exploratory dry hole costs during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Delaware Basin area that was
attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the six months ended June 30, 2015
were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Delaware Basin area that was attempting to establish production in a zone not previously producing in
the general area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf area.
For the six  months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $31.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For
the six months ended June 30, 2016, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf areas
which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf areas where we have no future
development plans and (iii) expiring acreage.

Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $580.0 million ($22.39 per Boe) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $17.9 million
(3 percent) from $562.1 million ($22.21 per Boe) for 2015. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to a modest increase in production in
addition to a slightly higher depletion rate per Boe period over period. The increase in depletion expense per Boe period over period was primarily due to a
decrease in proved reserves caused by (i) lower commodity prices period over period and (ii) reclassification of proved reserves to unproven that are no
longer expected to be developed within the five years of their initial recording as required by SEC rules, both of which were partially offset by capital cost
reductions. Additionally, these factors were largely offset by a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016.
The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items.
43
Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and
their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there
are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are
less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
estimated fair value of the asset.
We calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management’s assumptions and
expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital
expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and (vii) prevailing market rates of
income and expenses from integrated assets. At June 30, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash
flows are based on the NYMEX strip, which ranged from a 2016 price of $49.54 per barrel of oil and $3.04 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $57.77 per
barrel of oil and $3.50 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023.
We calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions
associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials,
(iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii)
prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an
annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our
Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of
approximately $1.5 billion. The non-cash charge represented the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets. We
did not recognize an impairment charge during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to
impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in
production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable
and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and
natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of June 30, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs,
operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated.

General and administrative expenses were approximately $107.2 million ($4.14 per Boe) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $12.5
million (10 percent) from $119.7 million ($4.73 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of a
general company-wide initiative to reduce general and administrative costs, while the decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to
an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in general and
administrative costs noted above while there was a slight increase in production period over period.
As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production
phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $12.5 million and $12.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which
could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to
the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses.
Gain on disposition of assets, net. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in the northern Delaware Basin for proceeds of approximately $292.0 million,
and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110.1 million.

The decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit
facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering. The
46
increase in interest expense was due to a reduction in capitalized interest period over period, partially offset by an overall decrease in the weighted average
debt balance.
Income tax provisions.  We recorded an income tax benefit of $752.0 million and $66.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The change in our income tax benefit was primarily due to the increase in our net loss before income taxes. The effective income tax rates for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 36.9 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively.
47
Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, midstream joint ventures and
other capital commitments, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any
combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility or proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources,
as discussed in “— Capital resources” below.
Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $525.6 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to our reduced drilling and
completion activity level during the first half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease is primarily related to our intent to adjust our capital
spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow
expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition and timing of payments. The 2016
expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2016 divestiture and (iii) our issuance of
approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition.
2016 capital budget.  In November 2015, we announced our 2016 base capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.4 billion, with drilling
and completion capital accounting for approximately $1.2 billion.
During the remainder of 2016, our intent is to manage our capital spending, as we did during the first half of 2016, to be within our cash flows. Based on
current commodity prices and costs, our capital plan is in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. However, if we were to outspend our cash flows, we could
use our (i) cash on hand, (ii) credit facility and (iii) other financing sources to fund any cash flow deficits. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures
may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we
do not operate, the costs of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments and market conditions. In
addition, under certain circumstances, we may consider increasing, decreasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. Our 2016 capital program is
expected to continue focusing on horizontal drilling across all our core areas.
Acquisitions. The following table reflects our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015:

Contractual obligations.  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, cash interest expense on debt, operating lease obligations, purchase
obligations, employment agreements with officers, derivative liabilities, investment contributions related to Alpha Crude Connecter, LLC, our other midstream
entity in the southern Delaware Basin and other obligations. Since December 31, 2015, the changes in our contractual obligations are not material. See Note
9 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)” for additional
48
information regarding our long-term debt and “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for information regarding the interest on
our long-term debt and information on changes in the fair value of our open derivative obligations during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Off-balance sheet arrangements.  Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Capital resources.  Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from (i) operating activities and cash settlements received from
derivatives, (ii) borrowings under our credit facility, (iii) proceeds from bond and equity offerings and (iv) proceeds from the sale of assets. During the
remainder of 2016, our intent is to manage our capital spending, as we did during the first half of 2016, to be within our cash flows. Based on current
commodity prices and costs, our capital plan is in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. However, if we were to outspend our cash flows, we could use our
(i) cash on hand, (ii) credit facility and (iii) other financing sources to fund any cash flow deficits.

Cash flow from operating activities. The decrease in operating cash flows during the six  months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
2015 was primarily due to (i) a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $271.1 million and (ii) approximately $64.8 million of negative
variances in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by (i) approximately $42.6 million decrease in cash production expense, (ii) an increase in
operating cash flow of approximately $40.7 million due to a cash tax benefit of approximately $12.0 million for the six  months ended June 30, 2016
compared to cash tax expense of approximately $28.7 million during 2015 and (iii) a cash decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately
$10.1 million.
Our net cash provided by operating activities included a reduction of approximately $25.9 million and a benefit of approximately $38.9 million for the six 
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, associated with changes in working capital items. Changes in working capital items adjust for the
timing of receipts and payments of actual cash.
Cash flow used in investing activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we invested approximately $0.7 billion and $1.5 billion,
respectively, for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, we received approximately $294.3 million related to proceeds from the
disposition of assets and approximately $426.7 million from settlements on derivatives during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $279.4
million from settlements on derivatives during the comparable period in 2015.
Cash flow from financing activities. Net cash used by financing activities was approximately $12.0 million for the six  months ended June 30, 2016, while
during 2015 we had net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $795.5 million. Below is a description of our significant financing activities:
·         In March 2015, we issued shares of our common stock in a public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $741.5 million. We used a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the remainder for general corporate purposes.
·         During the first six months of 2015, we had net borrowings on our credit facility of $66.5 million.
49
·         During the first six months of 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.
At June 30, 2016, we had unused commitments of approximately $2.5 billion based on bank commitments of $2.5 billion. The maturity date of the credit
facility is May 9, 2019.
Advances on our amended and restated credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JPM Prime Rate”) or
(ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate). The credit facility’s interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime
Rate advances varied, with interest margins ranging from 125 to 225 basis points and 25 to 125 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the
utilization of the borrowing base. We pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment ranging from 30.0 to 37.5 basis points per
annum, depending on utilization of the borrowing base. Subject to certain restrictions, with respect to our public debt ratings, the collateral securing the
facility may be released.
In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii)
preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Over the last three years, we have demonstrated our use of the capital markets by issuing
common stock and senior unsecured debt. There are no assurances that we can access the capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at
cost and terms that are favorable to us. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in energy
companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also
have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders
under our credit facility.
Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At June 30, 2016, we had
approximately $481.2 million of cash on hand.
At June 30, 2016, our commitments from our bank group were $2.5 billion. We expect we will maintain our $2.5 billion in commitments until our next
scheduled redetermination in May 2017. At June 30, 2016, our borrowing base was $2.8 billion. There is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be
reduced, which could affect our liquidity. Upon a subsequent redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in
open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Debt ratings.  We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are
subject to regular reviews. S&P’s corporate rating for us is “BB+” with a stable outlook. Moody’s corporate rating for us is “Ba1” with a stable outlook. S&P
and Moody’s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: the industry in which we operate, production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt
levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and
other terms associated with such additional financing.
A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a
downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our
outstanding debt. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
As of the filing of this Quarterly Report, no changes in our credit ratings have occurred since June 30, 2016; however, we cannot be assured that our credit
ratings will not be downgraded in the future.
Book capitalization and current ratio.    Our net book capitalization at June 30, 2016 was $8.7 billion, consisting of $0.5 billion of cash and cash
equivalents, debt of $3.3 billion and stockholders’ equity of $5.9 billion. Our net debt to book capitalization was 33 percent and 31  percent at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.93 to 1.0 at June 30, 2016 as compared to 2.20 to 1.0 at
December 31, 2015.
50
Inflation and changes in prices.  Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have
been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant
fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received an average of $35.80 per Bbl of oil and
$1.70 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $47.99 per Bbl of oil and $2.65 per Mcf of natural gas in the
six months ended June 30, 2015. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our
business.
51
Critical Accounting Policies, Practices and Estimates
Our historical consolidated financial statements and related condensed notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our
management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us
generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a
given rule apply to us.
In management’s opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management’s judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for
oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based
compensation, valuation of business combinations, valuation of financial derivative instruments and income taxes. Management’s judgments and estimates
in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in
similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the six months ended June 30, 2016. See our disclosure of
critical accounting policies in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 25, 2016.
Recent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“the FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new
revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in
exchange for those goods or services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which deferred the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. An entity
can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective
method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are
evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which supersedes current lease guidance. The new lease standard requires all
leases with a term greater than one year to be recognized on the balance sheet while maintaining substantially similar classifications for finance and
operating leases. Lease expense recognition on the income statement will be effectively unchanged. This guidance is effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation–Stock Compensations (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment
Accounting,” which changes the accounting and presentation for share-based payment arrangements in the following areas: (i) recognition in the statement
of operations of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (ii) cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (iii) minimum statutory withholding
thresholds and the classification on the cash flow statement of the withheld amounts; and (iv) an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they
occur. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that
this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The following market risk disclosures should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including credit risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. We address these risks through a program of risk
management which includes the use of derivative instruments. The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments
to which we are a party at June 30, 2016, and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in market interest rates or commodity prices and
losses from extension of credit. We do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonably possible
near-term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category. However, since it is not possible to accurately predict future
changes in interest rates and commodity prices, these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations.
Credit risk.  We monitor our risk of loss due to non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. Our principal exposure to credit risk is
through the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies and refineries, and to a lesser extent, our derivative
counterparties. We monitor our exposure to these counterparties primarily by reviewing credit ratings, financial statements and payment history. We extend
credit terms based on our evaluation of each counterparty’s creditworthiness. Although we have not generally required our counterparties to provide
collateral to support their obligations to us, we may, if circumstances dictate, require collateral in the future. In this manner, we could reduce credit risk.
We have entered into International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”) with each of our derivative counterparties. The terms
of the ISDA Agreements provide us and the counterparties with rights of set-off upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or a counterparty to
a derivative, whereby the party not in default may set off all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative asset receivables from the
defaulting party.  See Note 8 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)” for additional information regarding our derivative activities.
Commodity price risk.  We are exposed to market risk as the prices of our commodities are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and
demand. To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of our commodities, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, additional commodity
price risk management arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect
of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Our commodity price risk
management arrangements are recorded at fair value and thus changes to the future commodity prices will have an impact on net income. The following
table sets forth the hypothetical impact on the fair value of the commodity price risk management arrangements from an average increase and decrease in
the commodity price of $5.00 per Bbl of oil and $0.50 per MMBtu of natural gas from the commodity prices at June 30, 2016:

At June 30, 2016, we had (i) oil price swaps that settle on a monthly basis covering future oil production from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 and
(ii) oil basis swaps covering our Midland to Cushing basis differential from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The average NYMEX oil price for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $39.65 per Bbl. At August 1, 2016, the NYMEX oil price was $40.06 per Bbl.
At June 30, 2016, we had natural gas price swaps that settle on a monthly basis covering future natural gas production from July 1, 2016 to December 31,
2017. The average NYMEX natural gas price for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.12 per MMBtu. At August 1, 2016, the NYMEX natural gas
price was $2.77 per MMBtu.
A decrease in the average forward NYMEX oil and natural gas prices below those at June 30, 2016 would increase the fair value asset of our commodity
derivative contracts from their recorded balance at June 30, 2016. Changes in the recorded fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are marked to
market through earnings as gains or losses. The potential increase in our fair value asset would be recorded in earnings as a gain. However, an increase in
the average forward NYMEX oil and natural gas prices above those at June 30, 2016 would decrease the fair value asset of our commodity derivative
contracts from their recorded balance at June 30, 2016. The potential decrease in our fair value asset would be recorded in earnings as a loss. We are
currently unable to estimate the effects on the earnings of future periods resulting from changes in the market value of our commodity derivative contracts.
The fair value of our derivative instruments is determined based on our valuation models. We did not change our valuation method for our derivative
instruments during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of our derivative
instruments during the six months ended June 30, 2016:

See Note 8 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)” for
additional information regarding our derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk.  Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our
variable-rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. To reduce our exposure to
changes in interest rates we may, in the future, enter into interest rate risk management arrangements for a portion of our outstanding debt. The agreements
that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed interest rate for a portion of our variable rate debt. We may utilize interest rate
derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues. Interest rate derivatives are used solely
to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
credit facility, and the terms of our credit facility require us to pay higher interest rate margins as we utilize a larger percentage of our borrowing base.
We had no indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility at June 30, 2016.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at June 30, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal control over financial reporting.
55
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
We are a party to proceedings and claims incidental to our business. While many of these other matters involve inherent uncertainty, we believe that the
liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations. We will continue to evaluate proceedings and claims involving us on
a regular basis and will establish and adjust any reserves as appropriate to reflect our assessment of the then current status of the matters.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factor set forth below and the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, under the headings “Item 1. Business — Competition,” “— Marketing Arrangements”
and “— Applicable Laws and Regulations,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or
future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, other than updating the risk factor below. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. The updated risk factor is as follows:
Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect
our results of operations.
Declines in commodity prices may result in us having to make substantial downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves. If this
occurs, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the
carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated
useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down.
The primary factors that may affect management’s estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production
and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible
reserves, (iv) cash flows from integrated assets and (v) results of future drilling activities. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could
materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.
