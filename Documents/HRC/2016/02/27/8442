<p><b>  Mission to Uruguay</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> From 13 to 17 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur on human trafficking, 
especially women and children, conducted an official country visit to Uruguay at the 
invitation of the Government. The purpose of her mission was to learn about the 
Uruguayan legislative and institutional framework and policies in the fight against human 
trafficking, as well as the remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur highlights the positive progress made by the 
Government, such as the enactment of domestic legislation against human trafficking, as 
well as the establishment of an Inter-institutional Roundtable to address trafficking of 
women for sexual exploitation, and specialized courts and prosecutors to address the issue 
of organized crime, including trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur observed a number of challenges that the 
Government must address in order to effectively combat trafficking in persons and to 
protect the human rights of trafficked victims. Such challenges include, but are not limited 
to, the lack of comprehensive data on the trend of trafficking in persons, the weak 
coordination of anti-trafficking activities, the lack of identification and referral mechanisms 
for trafficked persons, and the insufficient level of facilities and services specifically 
designed to provide direct assistance to trafficked persons. On the basis of these

<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following an invitation by the Government of Uruguay, the Special Rapporteur on 
human trafficking, especially women and children, Ms. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo conducted a fact 
finding mission to Uruguay from 13 to 17 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its openness and 
total cooperation, which allowed her to acquire information regarding the situation of 
human trafficking in Uruguay and the current legislation and policies to combat this human 
rights violation.  
</p>
<p>3. During her mission the Special Rapporteur met in Montevideo with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Labour and Social Security, and officials of the Ministry of 
the Interior, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the National Institute for Children and 
Adolescents (INAU, for its acronym in Spanish), the Ministry of Social Development, 
including the National Women&#8217;s Institute (Inmujeres, for its acronym in Spanish) and the 
Ministry of Education and Culture, including its Director for Human Rights. Ms. Ezeilo 
further met with representatives of the National Police, including immigration officials, the 
police chief of Montevideo, and the INTERPOL office, the Captain of the Port of 
Montevideo, parliamentarians, a Minister from the Supreme Court of Justice and other 
members of the Judiciary Branch. 
</p>
<p>4. Ms. Ezeilo also travelled to the cities of Colonia, Paysand&#250; and Young, where she 
met with local authorities such as the mayors of Colonia and Paysand&#250;, local police forces 
and port authorities, local delegations of the Ministry of Social Development and the INAU 
and local judges and prosecutors. Finally, both in Montevideo and in other localities, the 
Special Rapporteur met with representatives of civil society, including non-governmental 
organizations, academics and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur sincerely thanks the Resident Coordinator, her Office and 
the United Nations Country Team in Uruguay for the invaluable support provided prior, 
during and after her country visit to the country. Ms. Ezeilo would also like to thank the 
civil society representatives who provided her with information during the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>6. Uruguay has mainly been a country of origin for victims of trafficking. Women are 
trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation into neighbouring countries such as 
Argentina and Brazil, and particularly into Europe. There is clearly a consolidated network 
of traffickers who transport Uruguayan women to Europe, specifically to Italy and Spain, 
where traffickers seem well connected with local criminals and owners of bars, nightclubs 
and brothels.1 
</p>
<p>7. Social awareness on the issue of trafficking for sexual exploitation in Uruguay rose 
in the early 1990s with broad media coverage when some cases involving a trafficking 
</p>
<p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>network that sent Uruguayan women to Milan, Italy, were made public. Although these 
cases prompted some institutional responses and also generated great interest amongst the 
population, the issue gradually lost momentum and was then relegated in the public 
agenda.2 The invisibility of this phenomenon is exacerbated by the lack of statistics or 
official estimations of the magnitude of the problem. 
</p>
<p>8. Trafficking networks operate by identifying potential victims from different 
localities in Uruguay, recruiting and &#8220;preparing&#8221; them before selling or transferring them 
again to other pimps in the network. This process sometimes begins within different 
localities, passes through Montevideo and is finalized abroad. If the trafficked persons are 
already sex workers, they are usually promised better pay and working conditions 
elsewhere. When potential victims are not in prostitution, they are usually offered jobs in 
administrative posts, at hotels or as baby sitters, through a recruitment process that includes 
&#8220;wining and dining&#8221; the victims to facilitate them accepting moving away.3 Through 
interviews carried out as part of an IOM investigation in 2006, 73 per cent of sex workers 
interviewed in Montevideo stated they had received offers to work abroad.4 
</p>
<p>9. The process previously described might not necessarily finalize with the victim 
being transferred abroad, revealing thus a situation of internal trafficking for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>10. Women and children who are recruited in the interior of the country might end up 
being exploited in Montevideo or some of the touristic spots of the country such as 
Maldonado and, Colonia del Sacramento. According to information received, there is a 
trend to offer &#8220;high cost&#8221; sexual services in these cities by women who are not necessarily 
registered as prostitutes before the Uruguayan health authorities and that offer their services 
in a very exclusive and private way, which constitutes a risk of trafficking. There was also a 
possible case of trafficking in Maldonado in which young middle class women, who were 
students or women working outside the sex industry, had been working as prostitutes but 
forced to pay high fees to their recruiters.5 
</p>
<p>11. Although Uruguay is not usually identified as country of destination for victims of 
trafficking for sexual exploitation, border areas such as Concordia-Salto and Col&#243;n-
Paysand&#250; on the border with Argentina, and Livramento-Rivera and Yaguar&#243;n-R&#237;o Branco 
on the border with Brazil are reportedly entry points for Brazilian and Argentinean women 
temporarily offering sexual services in the country.6 
</p>
<p>12. A phenomenon of concern frequently linked to trafficking for sexual exploitation is 
the prevalence of child prostitution. Given that sexual exploitation of children is an illegal 
practice which is generally linked to organized crime, it is difficult to have an accurate 
estimate of the number of children involved. Most of the information available is drawn 
from press reports, and NGOs, but there is a lack of official information on this subject.7 
This also makes it difficult to determine if these sexually exploited children are also victims

<p>of trafficking. In Uruguay prostitution is legal and the minimum age for the activity is 18 
years of age. Brothels, discos and massage parlors are inspected to ensure that minors are 
not working there. If children are found, owners are fined and the establishments may be 
closed down. Criminal charges may also be established against any adults involved in the 
exploitation of children. Nevertheless, some interviewees claimed that, due to inefficiency, 
lack of resources or even corruption of officials involved in the search of such premises, 
owners sometimes get advance information and warning about imminent raids and would 
therefore hide minors being held in prostitution and sexually exploited. 
</p>
<p>13. There are specific vulnerability factors in the region that place children at a 
particular risk of becoming trafficking victims, such as poverty, homelessness, domestic 
sexual abuse, domestic violence and child labour.8 Children sometimes engage in 
prostitution to provide economic assistance to their families who allow or actively promote 
the activity. The Special Rapporteur was presented with some cases of child sexual 
exploitation in which common &#8220;push&#8221; factors such as poverty, social exclusion, school 
desertion and domestic physical and/or sexual violence strongly influenced the child&#8217;s 
engagement in sex work.9 
</p>
<p>14. In recent years Uruguay has experienced economic growth and has slowly recovered 
from the 2001/2002 economic crisis that affected the entire Southern-cone region. Certain 
localities linked to industrial activities and tourism, such as Nueva Palmira, Maldonado and 
Colonia, have seen economic recovery. Nevertheless, social development has been unequal 
and part of the population has remained excluded from the labour market and absent from 
the schooling system. It is precisely amongst these segments of the population that the most 
vulnerable children and adolescents may be found. In terms of child sexual exploitation, 
interviews revealed that certain sectors of the population see this as a problem that cannot 
be changed, that &#8220;nothing can be done about it&#8221;. In other cases the matter is perceived as 
something that is distant, affecting only the &#8220;poor&#8221;, &#8220;drug addicts&#8221;, and people with no 
work habits. Therefore, beyond the preventive programmes that are being implemented by 
the private and public sector, community action against this phenomenon should be 
enhanced.  
</p>
<p>15. Informants in cities such as Nueva Palmira and Young argue that demand is 
basically not generated by locals but by temporary populations such as truckers who pass 
through and shipworkers at the ports. There has only been social recognition of this 
problem through some police complaints and some media coverage of the problem, but 
institutional responses, including police action, have been slow and ineffective. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficking for labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>16. There is a lack of accurate information to determine the prevalence rates, trends and 
manifestations of trafficking for labour exploitation in Uruguay. It appears to be a less 
visible problem than that of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of increasing reports of exploitation of foreign workers in fishing 
vessels, citrus fields and the wood industry. 
</p>
<p>17. Given its stability and economic growth in the last few years, Uruguay has gradually 
become a country of destination, attracting larger numbers of economic migrant that could 
eventually become victims of trafficking for both sexual and labour exploitation. This risk 
is heightened by the prevalence of unregulated work and by limited labour inspections, 
particularly in the fishing and agricultural sectors. 
</p>

<p>18. A case made public in 2005 involved Chinese workers subjected to slave labour in a 
farm located in the locality of Canelones. They entered the country legally with documents 
to work in shipping companies in the port of Montevideo but upon arrival to the country 
were taken to the fields were they were forced to work under threat and with no salaries. 
This case involved the participation of corrupt immigration officers and, although the case 
was highly publicized and investigations were carried out, no one was tried and the victims 
were repatriated.10 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister and other authorities of the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Security, who stated that no labour inspections, whether in vessels, 
fields or even in places of difficult access, had uncovered cases of trafficking in persons. 
The only irregularities found are related to health and safety issues or the registration of 
workers. They explained that sometimes foreign vessels come into the ports to make 
technical stops and the Ministry has no access to examine those ships where slave labor 
might happen. Workers sometimes are engaged to work at sea for a period of time that is 
later extended without pay and in terrible working conditions.11 
</p>
<p>20. This was confirmed during a visit made by the Special Rapporteur to a shelter for 
poor migrants located in Montevideo, where the shelter manager reported cases of 
Indonesian immigrants who had been lodged in the shelter after being subjected to terrible 
working conditions in foreign fishing vessels stopping at Montevideo. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The legislative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>21. Uruguay has ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, especially Women and Children, which supplements the Convention against 
Transnational Organised Crime12 and other relevant human rights instruments including the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and its 
Optional Protocol, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two Optional 
Protocols, and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. Uruguay has also ratified ILO Convention No. 29 on Forced or 
Compulsory Labour13 and Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour.14 
</p>
<p>22. In terms of regional instruments, Uruguay is party to the American Convention on 
Human Rights, the Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors15 and the 
Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
against Women (Convention of Belem do Para). 
</p>
<p>23. Uruguay has enacted domestic legislation against human trafficking, including the 
Immigration Law (Law 18.250/2008) which establishes penalties against both human 
smuggling (art. 77) and human trafficking (art.  78) and the Law on commercial and non-
commercial sexual violence against children, adolescents and the disabled (Law 
</p>
<p>  
 10 IOM, op. cit.. p.254.  
 11 According to interviews held with port authorities, the Uruguayan fleet is small and easier to control. 
</p>
<p>National vessels do engage foreign workers, particularly Peruvians, but these are regular migrants 
whose working conditions should be the same as those of nationals. 
</p>
<p> 12 Uruguay ratified the Convention and the two complementing protocols on smuggling and trafficking 
through Law 17.861 of 28 December 2004.  
</p>
<p> 13 Ratified through Law 16.643 of 8 December 2004. 
 14 Ratified through Law 17.298 of 15 March 2001. 
 15 Ratified through Law 16.860 of 9 September 1997. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>17.815/2004). These two laws incorporate the definitions put forward both by the Palermo 
Protocol and by the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>24. Other relevant legislation includes Law 17.060/1998  against corruption, Law 
17.343/2001 which penalizes the laundering of money derived from activities such as 
procuring, organ trafficking and human smuggling, Law 17.514/2002 on the prevention, 
early detection, attention and eradication of domestic violence, Law 17.515/2002 on sex 
work, Law 18.104 on the equality in rights and opportunities for men and women, Law 
18.026 which establishes intervention and reparation rights for victims of genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, and Law 8.080 on procuring and related crimes. 
</p>
<p>25. Child prostitution is penalized through the abovementioned Law 17.815/2004 and 
the Code of Childhood and Adolescence, which establishes the State&#8217;s duty to protect 
children against child prostitution (art. 15), to protect the rights of the child (arts. 177 et al.) 
and also defines child pornography as a form of the mistreatment and abuse of children 
(arts. 130 et al).16 
</p>
<p>26. In terms of the Criminal Code, other crimes linked to human trafficking are 
penalized, such as conspiracy to commit a crime (art. 150), falsification of identity 
documents and passports (art. 242 bis), the use of false documents or certificates (article 
243), procuring (art. 274.3), and a series of crimes against liberty including slave trafficking 
(art. 280), privation of liberty (art. 281), private violence (art. 288) and threats (art. 290).17  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also noted the existence of a law on domestic work (Law 
18.065/06), which establishes the rights and regulates the working conditions of domestic 
workers; and a law on rural work (Law 18.441/09) which establishes, amongst others, a 
workday of 8 hours for rural workers. 
</p>
<p>28. Uruguay has ratified the relevant international and regional human rights 
instruments and this is reflected in the aforementioned domestic legislation on human 
trafficking and child exploitation. In the 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice, which is the 
highest instance in the jurisdictional order, has declared that international human rights 
treaties have constitutional rank in the national legal order. Nevertheless, there is still a lack 
of awareness of these international human rights instruments among administrators of 
justice, especially judges, resulting in their limited application in judicial decisions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>29. The following institutions are involved in the fight against trafficking in Uruguay:18 
</p>
<p> (a) The Ministry of Social Development (MIDES, its acronym in Spanish) which 
is in charge of all policies relating to women, youth, family, older persons and persons with 
disabilities. The National Women&#8217;s Institute of Uruguay operates within this Ministry and 
works towards the social, political economic and cultural inclusion of women, in order to 
guarantee their full citizenship;19 
</p>
<p> (b) The National Institute for the Child and the Adolescent (INAU), charged with 
the protection of the rights of children and with the identification and prevention of 
commercial and non commercial sexual exploitation;

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p> (c) The Ministry of Public Health which runs a National Program for Gender and 
Women&#8217;s Health and runs preventive clinics that monitor the health of sex workers 
throughout the country; 
</p>
<p> (d) The Ministry of Tourism and Sports which oversees the activities of travel 
agencies, transport companies and hotels, and is currently leading a campaign against 
sexual exploitation of children and sexual tourism in the country; 
</p>
<p> (e) The Ministry of the Interior which coordinates the work of the several police 
forces in the country, including the immigration and INTERPOL offices; 
</p>
<p> (f) The Ministry of Labour and Social Security which is in charge of carrying 
out the inspection of working places and their conditions; 
</p>
<p> (g) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs which has an office of consular affairs 
charged with assisting Uruguayans living abroad; 
</p>
<p> (h) The Ministry of Education and Culture which has a Direction for Human 
Rights in charge of disseminating knowledge of these rights and providing human rights 
education in schools. 
</p>
<p>30. In 2001 a National Committee to Eradicate Child Labour (CETI, its acronym in 
Spanish) was set up under the leadership of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The 
Committee is formed by several Government institutions, including the INAU and the 
MIDES, by the National Chamber of Commerce, labour unions and Civil Society 
Organizations. The Committee receives technical assistance from ILO, the Inter-American 
Children's Institute of the OAS and UNICEF. Specific criteria have been established by the 
INAU to identify dangerous child labour and inspectors from the Ministry of Labour have 
reportedly received training to identify these situations.20 
</p>
<p>31. On 15 May 2007 the First National Plan on Equality of Rights and Opportunities for 
Women (2007-2011) was launched in Uruguay, establishing as one of its strategic lines the 
development of measures to protect women and children against human trafficking and 
smuggling. The National Women&#8217;s Institute of the Ministry of Social Development 
(Inmujeres) was designated the leading institution to coordinates these efforts in 
coordination with other Government agencies and civil society organizations.21 
</p>
<p>32. In 2008, the Inter-institutional Roundtable to address trafficking of women for 
sexual exploitation was established. It is chaired by Inmujeres and composed of 
representative of several ministries, judges, prosecutors and public defenders, civil society 
and international organizations. The work carried out by this mechanism receives the 
support of foreign donor agencies. Some of the incipient initiatives to provide assistance to 
victims of trafficking in Uruguay have been carried out by civil society organizations 
participating in this Roundtable with the assistance of the Ministry of Social Development.  
</p>
<p>33. Among the initial activities carried out by the Roundtable when it was first 
established was the organization of a one-day discussion aimed at designing a common 
intervention and a response strategy. The members of the Roundtable made an institutional 
mapping which identified successes and obstacles in addressing the issue of trafficking. 
Some of the main problems identified by the Roundtable included the lack of public 
policies to address the problem of trafficking for sexual exploitation, too few public 
officials with technical knowledge and awareness on this subject, the need to offer 
integrated assistance services for victims, lack of awareness and public debate on this issue

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>amongst the general population, the need for a national network that particularly involves 
localities in the border regions, the lack of experience in the application of laws that 
provide reparations for victims of trafficking.22 
</p>
<p>34. Based on that diagnosis, the Roundtable has made recommendations which include  
(a) the development of training programs for public officials at all State levels; (b) the 
creation of specialized and centralized police units to investigate this crime; (c) focusing 
investigations on trafficking networks and not the individual victim/perpetrator; (d) 
strengthening control of entries and the exit of children in the borders; (e) developing inter-
institutional protocols to address the issue of trafficking; (f) creating communication 
channels and focal points for the distribution of institutional information, and (g) 
establishing a telephone hotline to provide orientation and advice to victims. 
</p>
<p>35. In October 2004 the National Committee for the Eradication of Commercial and 
Non-Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents<i>,</i> chaired by the INAU, 
was created with the objective of developing a national plan of action to prevent and 
eradicate sexual exploitation of children. The First National Plan covers the period 2007-
2010, and puts forward specific institutional actions to eradicate commercial and non 
commercial sexual exploitation of children through prevention, protection, assistance and 
restitution programs. The Plan also provides for the implementation and monitoring of a 
number of activities aim: 
</p>
<p> (a) To modify the social belief systems that sustain the sexual exploitation of 
children; 
</p>
<p> (b) To raise awareness of the situation faced by children and adolescents in terms 
of sexual exploitation; 
</p>
<p> (c) To generate sufficient human resources to attend to the problem; 
</p>
<p> (d) To adjust the relevant legal framework to protect children against sexual 
exploitation; 
</p>
<p> (e) To disseminate national and international legislation on the subject; 
</p>
<p> (f) To prosecute the crime of sexual exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p> (g) To better articulate the several institutional spaces linked to this issue; 
</p>
<p> (h) To strengthen public and private systems that respond to situations of sexual 
exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p> (i) To ensure the recovery of all children in situations of exploitation; 
</p>
<p> (j) To develop strategies to deal with perpetrators;  
</p>
<p> (k) To monitor the implementation of the Plan adjust it accordingly. 
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, in 2006 the Ministry of the Interior established a Specialized Working 
Group on Commercial and Non-Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour and Trafficking.23 This group is coordinated by the National 
Direction of Social Prevention of Crime and includes police agencies such as INTERPOL 
Uruguay, the national immigration office and the police of Montevideo. This group aims at 
gathering and analysing information to produce a database of reports regarding sexual 
exploitation of children, child labour and human trafficking. It also seeks to systematize

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>good practices in regards to the investigation of these crimes, design a national response 
protocol, and propose relevant legislative amendments. 
</p>
<p>37. In spite of all these initiatives, the Special Rapporteur encountered a general lack of 
coordination and articulation among the different public institutions fighting against 
trafficking in persons as no common protocols or guidelines have been set up to jointly 
address the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>38. Most of the cases of trafficking for sexual exploitation that have been investigated, 
whether the exploitation was carried out within Uruguay or abroad, have been addressed 
following a complaint placed directly by the victim or by a relative of the victim. Currently 
there are no specific procedures or guidelines for authorities to identify victims of 
trafficking and refer them to the appropriate services. 
</p>
<p>39. Sexual work, both in Montevideo and in the interior of the country, is sometimes 
carried out in establishments that are hidden, inaccessible and difficult to inspect, making 
them more likely to hide situations of vulnerability and exploitation that are not identified 
by the authorities unless a complaint is put forward. In terms of exploitation occurring 
abroad, Uruguayan consulates and diplomatic representations have not shown a proactive 
approach towards the problem and victims do not view them as places were they can resort 
for assistance.24 The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
gives conferences and other training activities to Uruguayan diplomats before they are 
commissioned abroad, but the issue of trafficking has not been sufficiently addressed. 
</p>
<p>40. In terms of identifying trafficking for labour exploitation, inspection activities have 
reportedly been recently strengthened through the appointment of more and better qualified 
inspectors within the Ministry of Labour. These inspectors have broad investigative powers 
and there is a general culture of respect towards them. They have been provided with 
adequate equipment, vehicles, and tools to carry out their work. 
</p>
<p>41. The Ministry carries out inspections but also responds to specific complaints placed 
by workers, usually regarding free association, harassment at work and sexual harassment. 
There is a special office that receives all complaints, which can be filed anonymously 
through a free telephone line that is available throughout the country. There is an active 
presence of the work unions both during the inspections and in the response provided to 
specific complaints by workers. 
</p>
<p>42. Vessels at Uruguayan ports are inspected by both the labour inspectors and the 
Naval Prefecture before being authorized to set sail. Incoming vessels are also inspected by 
immigration officials that allow crew to disembark at the ports if they carry valid passports 
and working permits. Some of the labour inspectors have specific training to carry out the 
inspection of fishing vessels. 
</p>
<p>43. Inspections are also carried out in the interior of the country to monitor the 
agricultural sector, particularly forestry activities. Since the new law on domestic work was 
enacted in 2008, domestic work has become further formalized and may also be subject to 
labour inspections by the Ministry, although these can only be carried out following an 
official complaint and the issuing of a warrant.25 
</p>
<p>  
 24 IOM, op. cit., p. 295.  
 25 Art. 13, Law 18.065 on Domestic Work.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>44. Although inspectors have not received any training on trafficking in persons, they 
have all reportedly been trained on the worst forms of child labour. With regards to the port 
authorities, they have received general training on human rights but not on human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Protection of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>45. There are no public assistance services for victims of trafficking and most existing 
programmes target homeless children or victims of domestic abuse. Nevertheless, some 
pilot assistance initiatives have been carried out in Montevideo with the participation of 
both Government agencies and NGOs. Inmujeres has a specialized team of public servants 
who, since 2005, have received relevant training. It offers psychological and social 
assistance to victims of trafficking who have returned to the country with the assistance of 
IOM. Other assistance experiences have been carried out by NGOs offering psychological, 
social and legal assistance for women and children yet with very limited resources and 
difficulties in identifying trafficking cases.26 
</p>
<p>46. One NGO reported assisting 12 victims of trafficking of persons since 2008, yet 
only one of the cases was prosecuted as such and most of them were investigated as cases 
of procuring, pimping or violence. All victims were channelled to the NGO through the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior or partner organizations. The cases 
involved mainly Uruguayan women who had suffered sexual exploitation in Argentina, 
Italy, Mexico and Spain by trafficking networks, and also cases of internal trafficking of 
adult sex workers. 
</p>
<p>47. With the support of partner institutions, mainly those participating in the Inter-
institutional Roundtable, yet with very limited resources, this NGO provided support to the 
victims through services such as legal aid, risk assessments, psychological assessment, 
emotional support for the victim, family reinsertion, occupational training, health services, 
and general information and orientation. One specific shortcoming highlighted by the 
organization is the need to simplify and expedite the request mechanism for witness 
protection in order to adequately protect the physical integrity of the victims and their 
families. The lack of witness protection adds to the reluctance to report the crime of 
trafficking by victims and other whistle-blowers. Since witnesses are invariably required to 
secure convictions in trafficking cases and the victims are almost always the principal 
witnesses in such cases, the need to protect them in the prosecution of trafficking offences 
is imperative. 
</p>
<p>48. One important limitation faced by NGOs assisting victims of trafficking is the lack 
of shelters where victims may go through the recovery process. There are currently no 
specific shelters for victims of trafficking, but only a couple of public shelters for victims of 
domestic violence, one in the capital and one in the interior. In some cases, ad hoc spaces 
for victims have been set up within the existing shelters for vulnerable population. When 
children are involved they are sometimes received by the INAU and placed in their 
facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prosecution  
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the following mechanisms to help address 
the issue of trafficking in persons from within the judicial system: 
</p>
<p>  
 26 Tuana and Benedet, op. cit., p. 52.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Two national courts specialize in organized crime. These are located in 
Montevideo but have national jurisdiction over certain crimes, including trafficking in 
persons and the sexual commercial exploitation of children. By having a national 
jurisdiction these tribunals may cover crimes that take place within different localities of 
the country. Law 18.494 gives these tribunals special prerogatives during the investigations 
which include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provisional measures to guarantee the availability of resources that could be 
later seized from the criminals 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Electronic surveillance of the accused 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reduction or exemption of penalties for collaborators who provide 
information 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participation of undercover agents; 
</p>
<p> (b) Two specialized public defenders established by Law 18.362; 
</p>
<p> (c) Two specialized criminal prosecutors to address the issue of organized crime, 
including trafficking, established by Law 18.390. The first of these two prosecutors has 
attended 4 cases which were initiated in 2009 and 2010 and that refer to the crimes of (a) 
trafficking; (b) child exploitation; (c) prostitution, and (d) human smuggling. The second 
prosecutor has taken on cases relating to Law 17.815 on sexual violence against children 
and the disabled which have resulted in the conviction of two persons and a request to 
process two more. 
</p>
<p>50. In terms of the role of victims during prosecution, article 13 of Law 18.026 
establishes that victims, their relatives or whoever is presenting a complaint on their behalf, 
have a right to participate and have access to the totality of the judicial proceedings; they 
may propose evidence and put forward evidence and proof they might have with them; they 
can participate in all the hearings, request the re-examination of the case and ask for 
updates on the status of the case. Special modalities are provided for cases where there was 
sexual or gender violence, such as the initial testimony of the victim not having to be 
corroborated later in court and the refusal of any evidence that makes reference to the 
victims or the witnesses sexual conduct. Although the issue of compensation and 
reparations for victims is contemplated by law, there does not appear to be any precedent of 
this kind of claim being made by victims. 
</p>
<p>51. In spite of the establishment of these mechanisms and laws, the number of 
prosecutions and convictions for the crime of human trafficking is still extremely low. 
There is reportedly insufficient resources, both material and human, to carry out more in 
depth police and judicial investigations of situations that could reveal cases of human 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur was made aware of the difficulties faced by judges to carry 
out more in-depth investigations. Although Uruguay has a mixed criminal system, it is 
more an investigative than an accusatory system. This means that judges, who usually 
manage very large numbers of cases at a time, have a larger responsibility in investigating 
crimes, while prosecutors accompany the process but do not lead the investigation. 
</p>
<p>53. According to information received, only one conviction has been handed down  
specifically for the crime of trafficking. This was a case involving Uruguayan women who 
were trafficked into Spain for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and who were also used 
to transport drugs. Nevertheless, this is a case that predates the establishment of the 
specialized mechanisms, and no convictions on trafficking have emanated from the 
specialized courts. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>54. Other related cases addressed by local judicial systems from 2006-2010 include 
crimes such as (a) facilitation of the sexual exploitation of a minor; (b) facilitation of 
distribution of pornographic material; (c) pandering/pimping; (d) smuggling of a minor; (e) 
inducement to exercise prostitution, and (f) payment or promise of payment to a child for 
sexual services, to name a few. These cases were registered in the localities of Artigas, 
Cerro Largo, Ciudad de la Costa, Chuy, Flores, Maldonado, Montevideo, Pando, Paysand&#250;, 
R&#237;o Branco, Rocha, San Jos&#233;, Tacuaremb&#243; and Young. In most of these cases, the accused 
were either acquitted or identified as pimps or recruiters. 
</p>
<p>55. Nevertheless, in these cases, no further investigation was carried out to identify a 
link with a larger criminal network or with a larger number of victims, apart from the 
specific person placing a complaint. NGOs have also reported other unresolved cases which 
involve disappeared women and adolescents that have never been investigated as possible 
trafficking cases. 
</p>
<p>56. The limitations faced by judges to address possible crimes of human trafficking are 
exacerbated by the lack of adequate investigation carried out by the police forces. There are 
currently no mechanisms or protocols to identify cases of trafficking nor a judicial police in 
charge of conducting relevant investigations. Currently, any alleged case of human 
trafficking needs to be managed through the local police forces, which have not received 
the specialized training required to address these crimes and which might also be in 
collusion with local pimps and brothel owners. 
</p>
<p>57. Several advocates highlighted the need to separate and centralize all investigations 
regarding trafficking and/or sexual exploitation given the difficulties of protecting 
information and witnesses in small locations, where everybody knows each other and 
keeping the confidentiality of cases is a challenge. The creation of a specialized task force 
within the police to specifically conduct human trafficking investigations was also 
highlighted by several stakeholders as an effective way to increase the number of 
prosecutions and convictions. This should be coupled with the allocation of adequate 
resources to train and equip the police. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>58. Uruguay is experiencing new forms of social and economic exclusion which have 
challenged the State&#8217;s traditional approach to social welfare27 and which especially affect 
children and adolescents, making them more vulnerable to exploitation.28 Unless the State 
addresses these root causes of trafficking in persons, the impact of other prevention 
activities such as awareness-raising campaigns and training, will be extremely limited. 
</p>
<p>59. Together with an NGO, Inmujeres launched an awareness campaign against 
trafficking for sexual exploitation which included the distribution of a leaflet shaped as the 
Uruguayan passport in which some recommendation on safe travel are made and contact 
information for consulates in Italy and Spain are provided.29 
</p>
<p>  
 27 Several stakeholders made reference to that State&#8217;s &#8220;booth&#8221; system of providing social benefits which 
</p>
<p>requires the population to approach the institutions and seek the support, fill out forms, meet the 
requirements, etc. This mechanism will not necessarily cover those most excluded who do not have 
the initiative or the means to access these &#8220;booths&#8221;, highlighting a need for the Sate to proactively 
reach out to them.

<p>60. NGOs working closely with sex workers also launched a prevention campaign in 
2008 with funds provided by the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) through 
Inmujeres. The campaign has since been running and leaflets have been distributed amongst 
sex workers and in neighborhoods were women and girls are usually recruited to engage in 
sex work. Another campaign on &#8220;safe migration&#8221; was launched in 2010 by NGOs in 
collaboration with the IOM. It involves the printing and distribution of posters to sensitize 
the general population on the issue. 
</p>
<p>61. The Ministry of Tourism has launched a campaign against the sexual exploitation of 
children and sex tourism in general which involves the signing of cooperation agreements 
with hotels, travel agencies and service providers that commit themselves to monitor and 
prohibit child prostitution within their establishments. Leaflets include the hotline to 
contact the INAU in case of need for assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> G. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>62. Uruguay participates in the Specialized Meeting on Women of MERCOSUR (REM, 
its acronym in Spanish),30 which brings together the directors of the different women 
institutes and agencies of the participating countries. This mechanism has addressed the 
issue of trafficking for sexual exploitation, designing and approving specific anti-trafficking 
actions. It does so in coordination with other MERCOSUR bodies such as the Meeting of 
High Authorities on Human Rights and Foreign Ministries (RAADDHH, for its acronym in 
Spanish), the Meeting of Ministers of the Interior and the High Level Group for 
MERCOSUR Employment.31 
</p>
<p>63. In April 2009, with the support of the Spanish Agency for International 
Development Cooperation (AECID, its acronym in Spanish), the REM started 
implementing a project aimed at strengthening the gender perspective within MERCOSUR. 
One of the main components of this project involves the cooperation between the Spanish 
Government of Spain and the countries of origin of victims trafficked into Spain. The 
project aims to increase the debate on trafficking in the MERCOSUR region and to draft 
and adopt a regional protocol for the identification, intervention, rescue and reintegration of 
victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The project includes activities such as 
analysis of laws, mechanisms and organizations working on the issue in the different 
countries of the region, meetings of specialized MERCOSUR mechanisms, international 
seminars and exchange of experiences for public servants, and regional campaigns.32 
</p>
<p>64. Another important initiative is the &#8220;Ni&#241;@ Sur&#8221; initiative which was launched by the 
RAADDHH in 2006 and is now a permanent working group in which Uruguay participates 
through the INAU. The objective of &#8220;Ni&#241;@ Sur&#8221; is to promote the coordination of national 
efforts to comply with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the harmonization of 
national laws with relevant international instruments. In 2006, the fourth RAADDHH 
approved the &#8220;Recommendations on the rights of and assistance for children and young 
people who have been victims of trafficking or sexual exploitation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65. Another project within &#8220;Ni&#241;@ Sur&#8221; is the &#8220;Twin Cities&#8221; initiative which is aimed at 
developing a regional strategy to fight against human trafficking and smuggling of children 
and adolescents in 15 border cities of the MERCOSUR. It includes activities of prevention

</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>There is a lack of statistical information to determine the prevalence rate, 
forms, trends and manifestation of human trafficking in Uruguay, particularly of 
trafficking for labour exploitation. This has caused the phenomenon to remain 
invisible and unacknowledged amongst the population and the authorities mandated 
to address it. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Although adequate legislation is in place, sexual exploitation of children, 
especially girls, is on the rise and certain social sectors seem to remain passive in the 
face of  the phenomenon. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Human trafficking occurs in Uruguay yet the issue remains invisible to policy 
makers and the public. Very few cases have been recorded and filed through a judicial 
complaints mechanism. This is exacerbated by fear amongst some social actors and 
victims to come forward and file complaints regarding specific cases of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Although special prosecutors have been appointed, there have been very few 
convictions related to trafficking in persons and, in most of these cases, initial 
prosecution was carried out to investigate other crimes such as drug trafficking or 
pimping. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>There is little awareness, knowledge or skills amongst Government authorities 
in identifying cases of trafficking in persons, and this institutional weakness has 
helped conceal the problem. The work that is currently being carried out by public 
institutions is still at a low level. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Although Law 18.250 penalizes human trafficking, it does not provide for 
assistance and redress to victims. The lack of adequate services, such as shelter, 
health, psychological and legal services, and the lack of implementation of the right to 
an effective remedy places victims at an increased risk of being re-trafficked. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Trafficking for labour exploitation is an unrecognized phenomenon in the 
country. Reports of foreign workers in irregular situation on fishing vessels, citrus 
fields and in the wood industry suggest that stricter monitoring is needed in order to 
prevent trafficking cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Government should carry out a national survey on human trafficking in 
order to obtain updated information on the prevalence rates of this human rights 
violation within the country.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Widespread campaigns should be launched to raise public awareness on this 
issue using media, information and communication technology (ICT) and other 
channels of communication in order to send a strong message against both human 
trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>A comprehensive, holistic and integrative national plan of action on combating 
trafficking in persons should be designed, which clearly sets out strategic objectives, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>allows for cooperation among State authorities and between them and civil society 
organizations, and produces measurable indicators as well as monitoring and 
evaluation tools. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Government should consider the establishment of a central agency to 
address human trafficking that will enhance coordination, not only among central 
authorities, but also between them and authorities at local levels. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Training and capacity-building should be continually provided to all State 
authorities in particular the police, judiciary, prosecutors, immigration and labour 
inspectors. Furthermore, specific trainings should be conducted for consular officials, 
especially in Italy and Spain, other main countries of destination of victims of 
trafficking, to enhance their capacity to detect, identify and provide assistance 
including making necessary referrals. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The judiciary should establish adequate mechanisms for witness protection and 
access to justice for victims, their families and civil society actors who might be 
assisting them. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Government should strengthen its efforts to tackle the root causes that 
make potential victims more vulnerable to human trafficking such as social exclusion 
and discrimination against adolescents, high rates of school dropout amongst them 
and adolescents working in unregulated and exploitative conditions. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>More stringent inspection of brothels and other businesses should be 
guaranteed to ensure that absolutely no person under the age of 18 or trafficked 
person is engaged in prostitution. A special police squad should be set up to 
investigate exclusively these situations. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Ministry of Tourism and Sports should continue monitoring the 
compliance by hotels, agencies and other tourist operators with  the agreements it has 
signed with them regarding the prohibition of child sex tourism. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Adequate resources should be allocated to enhance the effectiveness and 
sustainability of governmental anti-trafficking initiatives, including also financial 
support to civil society organizations that are currently addressing this issue with 
their own, very limited resources. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government should work in partnership with the United Nations agencies 
in Uruguay, who are best suited to provide necessary technical expertise to undertake 
these endeavours. 
</b></p>
