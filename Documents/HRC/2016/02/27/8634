<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In resolution 12/15 the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to hold a workshop on regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights on a regular basis, and to convene one in the first 
semester of 2010 to identify concrete proposals on ways and means to strengthen 
cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements in the field of human 
rights, and report on it to the Council at its fifteenth session. The Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR) organized an international workshop on &#8220;Enhancing cooperation 
between international and regional human rights mechanisms&#8221;, which was held in Geneva, 
on 3 and 4 May 2010. Participants included representatives of regional human rights 
mechanisms in Africa, the Americas and Europe, as well as of subregional mechanisms in 
Africa. The Indonesian representative of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations) Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) attended. 
Independent experts from the United Nations treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council 
special procedures, as well as member States, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), 
prominent international, and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
academics also participated in the workshop. Participants agreed on the need to establish 
mechanisms to reinforce cooperation between international and regional human rights

<p>mechanisms. They identified information sharing and joint activities as the main areas in 
which such mechanisms can be implemented. Concerning information sharing, participants 
agreed that best practices, jurisprudence, urgent cases and situations, and the universal 
periodic review constitute the main fields in which exchange of information should be 
improved. They also identified possible joint activities by international and regional human 
rights mechanisms: country visits, reports and publications, press releases and statements, 
raising awareness and capacity-building activities, and follow-up to decisions and 
recommendations resulting from international and regional human rights mechanisms. It 
was also recommended that biannual meetings be convened with the participation of 
international, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, governments, NHRIs 
and NGOs, in order to discuss sharing of information, joint activities and follow-up, 
focusing on thematic priorities. In addition, it was agreed that focal points should be 
appointed in each human rights mechanism in order to outline a plan of work on enhancing 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms which will 
identify objectives, activities, timelines and the responsibilities of each mechanism. Finally, 
participants urged States and intergovernmental organizations to allocate the necessary 
financial and human resources in order to ensure the implementation of the 
recommendations resulting from the workshop.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following Human Rights Council resolution 12/15 on regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, and in consultation with the co-sponsors of the 
resolution, Armenia, Belgium, Mexico, Senegal and Thailand, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) organized an international 
workshop on &#8220;Enhancing cooperation between international and regional human rights 
mechanisms&#8221;, which was held in Geneva, on 3 and 4 May 2010.1 In compliance with 
resolution 12/15, the present report reflects the discussions held at the workshop and 
progress in the implementation of the resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. There has been increasing focus on the relationship between regional and 
international human rights mechanisms over the past two decades. The Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action, adopted by the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, 
highlighted the importance of intergovernmental systems to promote and protect human 
rights at the regional and subregional level. The World Conference endorsed the efforts to 
strengthen these arrangements and to increase their effectiveness, while at the same time 
stressing the importance of cooperation with the United Nations human rights activities.  
</p>
<p>3. The Commission on Human Rights also adopted a number of resolutions on the 
subject, starting with resolution 1993/51 which, inter alia, invited States in areas where 
regional arrangements in the field of human rights did not yet exist to consider reaching 
agreements, with a view to establishing suitable regional machinery for the promotion and 
protection of human rights within their respective regions, and requested the Secretary-
General to continue to strengthen exchanges between the United Nations and regional 
intergovernmental organizations dealing with human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. In September 2007 the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 6/20 calling on 
OHCHR to convene a workshop for &#8220;an exchange of good practices, added value and 
challenges&#8221; for regional human rights mechanisms. This workshop was held in November 
</p><p>2008. It highlighted the need for more coherent and regular cooperation amongst regional 
mechanisms and between regional and international mechanisms. The report of the 
Secretary-General (A/HRC/11/3) summarizes the discussions held during the workshop. 
The recommendations included the appointment of a high-level focal point within OHCHR 
to facilitate future networking and information sharing between the Human Rights Council, 
the regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, and OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>5. In response to the recommendations of the 2008 workshop, the High Commissioner 
created a focal point within OHCHR to facilitate office-wide engagement with regional 
human rights mechanisms. The mandate of the National Institutions Section was expanded 
to include regional human rights mechanisms, becoming the National Institutions and 
Regional Mechanisms Section (NIRMS). 
</p>
<p>6. In resolution 12/15 the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner to 
hold a workshop on regional arrangements on a regular basis and to convene one in the first 
semester of 2010 to &#8220;allow further sharing of information and concrete proposals on ways 
and means to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements 
in the field of human rights and the identification of strategies to overcome obstacles to the 
promotion and protection of human rights at the regional and international levels, with the 
participation of representatives of the relevant regional and subregional arrangements from

</b></p>
<p>different regions, experts and interested States Members of the United Nations, observers, 
national human rights institutions and representatives of non-governmental organizations&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>7. In preparation for the workshop, in November and December 2009 OHCHR 
organized regional consultations with regional human mechanisms in Africa in Addis 
Ababa; in the Americas in Washington D.C.; and in Europe in Strasbourg. The discussions 
mainly focused on the core functions of the United Nations human rights system and the 
respective regional human rights mechanism, as well as their methods of work and 
operational procedures. The main objective of the consultations was to identify existing and 
potential areas for greater cooperation and dialogue between the United Nations human 
rights system and the regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>8. In the course of the consultations it was recognized that regional human rights 
mechanisms had played a significant role in the development and advancement of human 
rights standards. The complementary role between the national, regional and international 
mechanisms and the need for effective cooperation, especially in the implementation of 
human rights standards at the national level was noted.  Participants also concluded that 
cooperation could be enhanced in several areas, in particular, in information sharing, 
possible joint activities and follow-up to decisions and recommendations resulting from 
international and regional human rights mechanisms.3  
</p>
<p>9. The present report summarizes the discussions that took place during the workshop 
held in May 2010, including conclusions and recommendations based on key points of the 
discussions, aimed at strengthening cooperation between international, regional and 
subregional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Cooperation between international and regional human 
rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>10. Participants in the workshop included representatives of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR); the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights; 
the Tribunal of the Southern African Development Community (SADC); the Court of 
Justice of the Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS); the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR); the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights; the Council of Europe; the Fundamental Rights Agency of the European Union 
(EU); the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); and the Indonesian 
representative of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). 
The United Nations human rights system was represented by the Chair of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; the Chair of the Committee on Migrant 
Workers; the Vice-Chair of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture; a member of the 
Human Rights Committee; and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders. Member States, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), including chairs of 
regional networks and secretariats of NHRIs, and prominent international and national 
NGOs were also invited. 
</p>
<p>11. The meeting took stock of developments regarding cooperation between regional 
and international human rights mechanisms, including the results of the regional 
consultations, as well as contributions from emerging human rights mechanisms, including 
the AICHR and the human rights bodies of the League of Arab States. The NHRIs and

</p>
<p>Africa, the Americas and Europe. </p>


<p>NGOs shared their experiences regarding interaction with international and regional human 
rights mechanisms and set out ways in which they could contribute to improving this 
cooperation. Concrete proposals of cooperation on information sharing, possible joint 
activities and follow-up to decisions and recommendations of regional and international 
human rights mechanisms were thoroughly discussed. 
</p>
<p>12. The workshop highlighted the importance of enhancing existing cooperation in order 
to reinforce the principles of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights 
and to avoid duplication, while contributing to the harmonization of international human 
rights standards and case law.  
</p>
<p>13. It was agreed that the ultimate aim of such cooperation was to make a positive 
difference for individuals at the national level.  Such cooperation will contribute to the 
strengthening of the national human rights protection system, including domestic courts, 
NHRIs and civil society organizations, to ensure the realization of all human rights. A broad 
range of national stakeholders should actively participate in the cooperation process. 
</p>
<p>14. It was also noted that cooperation between human rights mechanisms should take 
into account the realities and priorities at the international, regional, subregional and 
national levels, in order to better address a broader array of possibilities of cooperation at 
every level, and to avoid delivering contradictory messages.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation between human rights mechanisms with similar functions  
</b></p>
<p>15. Participants noted that cooperation between international, regional and subregional 
human rights mechanisms with similar functions or competences should be improved.  
</p>
<p>16. International and regional judicial and quasi-judicial human rights bodies have much 
in common. They hear complaints brought against their member States and in many cases 
issue decisions containing recommendations which indicate steps and measures that States 
should take in order to fulfil their international human rights obligations. The jurisprudence 
they have developed could be a means to various kinds of cooperation. For example, 
jurisprudence sharing mechanisms can be established between the United Nations human 
rights treaty bodies and the ACHPR, the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the 
IACHR, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, and the European Court of Human 
Rights. This cooperation could be expanded to also involve quasi-judicial United Nations 
special procedures mechanisms (i.e the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention). The ongoing process of 
harmonization of reporting procedures of the United Nations treaty bodies4 should be taken 
into account. 
</p>
<p>17. The principle of cooperation between human rights mechanisms with similar 
functions could also be applied to consulting, promotional and monitoring functions. Joint 
awareness-raising activities could be conducted, for instance, by the European Committee of 
Social Rights and the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>18.  Exchanges could also be established between the universal periodic review (UPR) 
and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), considering the similarity between their 
mandates. 
</p>
<p>19. In terms of follow-up to decisions and recommendations of international and 
regional bodies, collaboration could be established between expert mechanisms on the one 
hand, and inter-State mechanisms on the other hand, i.e. the recommendations of treaty 
bodies and special procedures could be followed up by the UPR and the APRM.  
</p>

<p><b> 7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation tools 
</b></p>
<p>20. While all participants agreed on the need to improve cooperation, approaches 
differed regarding the degree of institutionalization of cooperation. The African and the 
Inter-American systems of human rights, as well as subregional human rights mechanisms 
in Africa and several NGOs and NHRIs were in agreement that cooperation between the 
United Nations system and regional and subregional mechanisms needed to be 
institutionalized.   
</p>
<p>21. The Council of Europe encouraged a pragmatic approach that built on existing 
initiatives of cooperation. Similarly, ODIHR proposed that day-to-day information sharing 
be reinforced.  
</p>
<p>22. It was generally agreed that different mandates are not an obstacle for systematic and 
formalized cooperation between human rights mechanisms. Cooperation should be oriented 
towards the strengthening of existing cooperation initiatives with a view to making them 
more efficient.  For instance, it was noted that information provided by the Inter-American 
human rights system to the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture had been available on 
the Subcommittee&#8217;s internal web page for the last three years which facilitated its decisions 
on country visits. This information was used by the Subcommittee before deciding what 
visits to conduct in the region. It is important that similar best practices are broadly 
disseminated.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. International  
</b></p>
<p>23. There is a need for international, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms 
to agree on basic cooperation arrangements.  
</p>
<p>(a) Focal points 
</p>
<p>The majority of the participants agreed that one of the first steps towards enhancing 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms is the 
appointment of high-level focal points in OHCHR and in each regional or 
subregional human rights mechanism. Focal points will regularly communicate with 
one another and will outline a workplan, including activities to be implemented in a 
determined time frame, identifying the objectives, activities, timelines and 
responsibilities of each mechanism. The workplan will be prepared in consultation 
with all human rights mechanisms and subsequently with States, NGOs and NHRIs. 
Focal points should regularly inform their respective mechanisms about their 
activities and responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>(b) Regular meetings 
</p>
<p>International, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, governments, 
NHRIs and NGOs should hold biannual meetings to discuss sharing of information 
and joint activities, focusing on thematic priorities. This process will be dynamic and 
fed by all relevant stakeholders by establishing specific objectives, timelines and 
expected outcomes of cooperation on each topic. For instance, sharing of 
information and joint activities on topics such as human rights defenders, 
discrimination, and economic, social and cultural rights will be discussed so as to 
advance cooperation with a thematic focus. In addition, during these meetings focal 
points should report on their activities indicating results achieved and challenges 
faced by them in implementing their plan of work. Meetings could be held in 
different regions in order to reach out to as many regional and national actors as 
possible. OHCHR stands ready to coordinate the organization of these meetings on a 
regular basis. Adequate human and financial resources should be allocated to 
OHCHR for this endeavour. </p>


<p><b> 2. Specific 
</b></p>
<p>24. Human rights mechanisms can bilaterally or multilaterally decide to establish 
cooperation arrangements that go beyond the minimum agreed at the international level, 
taking into account the needs and development of each human rights mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation between regional human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>25. The United Nations, through OHCHR, can facilitate the dialogue between regional 
and subregional human rights bodies by providing a global perspective and sharing lessons 
learned and best practices. In addition, OHCHR can support the process by providing 
technical assistance. Cooperation between regional human rights mechanisms can contribute 
to the elaboration of cooperation strategies between international, regional and subregional 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Role of national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations 
</b></p>
<p>26. NHRIs and NGOs play an important role in monitoring the application of 
international human rights standards and following up on the implementation of judgments, 
decisions and recommendations emanating from United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms. Both international and regional human rights mechanisms have encouraged 
NHRIs to interact with them on a regular basis.5 NHRIs and NGOs also contribute to the 
strengthening of the capacity of States to ensure implementation of international human 
rights norms. It is therefore necessary to include them as full participants in the cooperation 
process between human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Insufficient resources 
</b></p>
<p>27. International, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, as well as NHRIs 
and NGOs have very limited human and financial resources.  
</p>
<p>28. Cooperation strategies should take into account the limited financial resources of 
stakeholders. The United Nations, regional organizations and governments, should allocate 
resources to allow effective and sustained cooperation between international, regional and 
subregional human rights mechanisms. Donor support initiatives could contribute to the 
achievement of this goal.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Lack of knowledge of international and regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>29. The participants shared the view that international, regional, subregional and 
national human rights protection systems are unknown to some relevant actors and the 
general public at the regional and national level. It was thus suggested that international and 
regional human rights mechanisms, together with NHRIs and NGOs, should undertake 
public awareness-raising about human rights mechanisms and international human rights 
standards. Information on the functioning of international, regional, subregional and 
national mechanisms and how to have access to them needs to be broadly disseminated. 
Translation of official documents and case law into local languages will help this 
dissemination, as well as cooperation at the technical level between human rights 
</p>
<p>

<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>mechanisms and other stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, NHRIs, and the general 
public. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p>30. Some human rights mechanisms are subject to the principle of confidentiality, which 
may complicate cooperation between them.  It was suggested that confidentiality practices 
be harmonized in future, after consultations between the mechanisms involved have taken 
place. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Concrete proposals on cooperation between international and 
regional human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>31. The international workshop brought about concrete proposals for cooperation, 
mainly in sharing information between, and joint activities by, human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Instruments that will facilitate smooth cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Technical tools 
</b></p>
<p>32. Participants agreed that the availability of and access to information is an issue, not 
only to individuals, but also to human rights mechanisms themselves. Information sharing 
can be facilitated through technical tools. 
</p>
<p>33. The creation of a centralized database containing updated information from both 
international and regional human rights mechanisms was proposed as an option. Such a 
database should include State party reports, conclusions, recommendations, views, reports 
and opinions which are available in the public domain. Individual complaints, provided that 
the principle of confidentiality is respected, could also be included.  In this regard, it was 
suggested that a limited accessibility system be developed within the database in order to 
include information on such cases. It was also proposed that the possibility of including 
information on follow-up to recommendations, as well as problems in implementing them, 
is explored. The database should contain contact details of international, regional and 
subregional human rights mechanisms, and be accessible to both members and the 
secretariat of human rights mechanisms. Its administration should be based on guidelines 
adopted by all mechanisms involved. 
</p>
<p>34. Electronic access to information should be improved. User-friendly web links 
leading to the web pages of other human rights mechanisms should be available on the 
websites of all human rights mechanisms, with a view to sharing reports, views, opinions, 
jurisprudence, etc. In addition, a web link to information on cooperation between human 
rights mechanisms, including meetings, focal points, joint activities, etc. should be created 
on the OHCHR website. 
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, information on current and future activities of international, regional 
and subregional human rights mechanisms can be shared through &#8220;info notes&#8221;. They can 
include reports issued and to be published, urgent matters, jurisprudence, focus on particular 
countries or issues, information from civil society and NHRIs, etc.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the workshop participants proposed holding meetings to share information on 
a bilateral and multilateral, general or thematic, regular or ad hoc basis. </p>


<p>37. Concrete proposals for thematic meetings included racism and intolerance; 
economic, social and cultural rights; and trafficking. The practice of holding thematic 
forums, e.g. the Forum on Minority Issues established by the Human Rights Council 
(resolution 6/15), was praised. 
</p>
<p>38. Participants also suggested that regular bilateral or multilateral meetings be held in 
order to discuss jurisprudence, publications, reports, guidelines, technical cooperation, 
follow-up etc. The practice of the Fundamental Rights Agency of the EU in conducting 
interagency annual meetings with the participation of the United Nations, OSCE and the 
Council of Europe to identify synergies and possible joint activities and thematic 
coordination was commended. The meetings regularly held between the United Nations 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights 
and Welfare of the Child were proposed as a practice which should be expanded to other 
human rights mechanisms with similar mandates. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, it was proposed that regular meetings be held between special 
rapporteurs of both international and regional human rights mechanisms and members of the 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders. 
Representatives from the Inter-American, African and European systems could participate in 
the annual meeting of treaty body chairs. Similarly, rapporteurs from regional human rights 
mechanisms could join the annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>40. Another possibility that should be envisaged is the organization of judicial 
colloquiums with the participation of international and regional human rights mechanisms, 
judges at national courts, NHRIs and NGOs, with a view to deepening judges&#8217; 
understanding of human rights mechanisms and encouraging them to incorporate 
international human rights standards in their decisions. 
</p>
<p>41. Finally, it was proposed that members of regional human rights mechanisms be 
invited to participate in interactive dialogues of the Human Rights Council and submit 
documentation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Inter-secretariat cooperation mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>42. Working level contacts also known as desk-to-desk cooperation between OHCHR 
and the Council of Europe have facilitated finding areas of cooperation between the 
international and European human rights systems, in particular on topics such as migration, 
arbitrary detention and the rights of the child. Participants recommended that this practice 
also be implemented in other regions. In addition, it was proposed that the possibility of 
staff exchanges between international and regional human rights mechanisms be explored. 
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, it was recognized that memorandums of intent or of understanding 
between international and regional human rights can facilitate and formalize cooperation.  
</p>
<p>44. Sharing information can also be facilitated through field presences of both 
international and regional human rights mechanisms. For instance, OSCE field presences 
can exchange information with the United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures. 
Cooperation between OHCHR field presences, the United Nations country teams (UNCT) 
and regional human rights mechanisms can be enhanced.   </p>


<p><b> 11 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Main areas of cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Sharing of information 
</b></p>
<p>45. Participants agreed on the need for adequate channels for exchange  of information 
between international and regional human rights mechanisms in a regular and systematic 
manner, and identified some areas in which sharing of information would contribute to a 
more effective protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>(a) Best practices 
</p>
<p> (i) Information sharing on best practices and lessons learned in 
promoting and protecting human rights is one pillar of cooperation. 
International and regional human rights mechanisms will implement policies, 
which have produced successful results in other mechanisms. For example, 
international mechanisms could put in place innovative practices developed 
by regional mechanisms in Africa or the Americas;  
</p>
<p> (ii) In addition, working methods, rules of procedure and reporting 
procedures should be shared among human rights mechanisms in order to 
identify areas in which cooperation is feasible. Another proposal is to share 
information on lessons learned and best practices regarding follow-up and 
implementation of recommendations by regional and international human 
rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>(b) Jurisprudence 
</p>
<p> (i) Judicial and quasi-judicial human rights mechanisms should set up a 
system for regular exchange of jurisprudence. This should include reports, 
concluding observations, general comments, opinions, views, 
communications sent by independent experts to States, rulings, decisions and 
recommendations.  In addition, participants agreed that information sharing 
should also include information prior to consideration of reports, as well as 
on follow-up to implementation of recommendations of both international 
and regional human rights mechanisms. Participants proposed the publication 
of compilations of jurisprudence, bibliographies, regular electronic bulletins, 
including main decisions adopted during a period of time, etc. These 
publications can be either jointly produced or under the auspices of one 
mechanism, i.e., OHCHR, Council of Europe, the Organization of American 
States (OAS) and the African Union (AU);   
</p>
<p> (ii) Another proposal is to hold regular meetings to discuss jurisprudence 
on specific topics, i.e., right to life, enforced disappearances, economic, 
social and cultural rights, etc. Minutes of such meetings should be published 
and widely disseminated. Moreover, it was proposed that every mechanism 
have the possibility to present amicus curiae before others.  
</p>
<p>(c) Urgent cases and situations 
</p>
<p> (i) Specific arrangements should be established between international and 
regional human rights mechanisms to share information on urgent cases or 
situations, in order to ensure a quick and effective response. For instance, 
rapporteurs of regional and international mechanisms can issue joint press 
releases on human rights violations. In this regard, the existing practice of 
joint press releases of the United Nations and Inter-American rapporteurs on 
the right to freedom of expression was highlighted;  </p>


<p> (ii) In addition, the possibility of sending urgent joint appeals to States on 
individual cases where an individual or a group of individuals are in danger 
of suffering an irreparable damage was also mentioned. For example, the 
United Nations, the Inter-American and the African rapporteurs, as well as 
the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the OSCE focal 
point on human rights defenders could put in place a system that would allow 
for cases of violations of human rights in their respective regions to be 
shared. This information sharing could be facilitated by the secretariats of 
human rights mechanisms through desk-to-desk cooperation, with the 
participation of NGOs, which in many cases are the source of information.  
</p>
<p>(d) Universal periodic review 
</p>
<p> (i) Regional mechanisms provide written contributions to the to the UPR 
process. In this regard, it was proposed that based on existing good practices 
of contributions by the Council of Europe and the Inter-American human 
rights system, documents from the regional human rights mechanisms be 
increasingly submitted as official documents to the Human Rights Council;  
</p>
<p> (ii) Furthermore, participants agreed on the advantages that would be 
implied by the reciprocal use of recommendations issued by both the UPR 
and regional human rights mechanisms. For instance, the UPR can refer to 
the non-implementation of decisions or recommendations of regional human 
rights mechanisms and vice versa. This would contribute to reinforcing the 
effectiveness of all human rights mechanisms;  
</p>
<p> (iii) It was also proposed that, in view of the similarity between the UPR 
and the African Peer Review Mechanism, systematic channels of cooperation 
and exchange of information be established between them. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Joint activities 
</b></p>
<p>46. During the workshop it was established that some joint activities of regional and 
international human rights mechanisms are already in place. Nonetheless, it was also 
demonstrated that many practical difficulties still exist. For example, many of these 
initiatives remain isolated and often depend on favourable circumstances. In addition, 
cumbersome bureaucratic procedures may hamper and even stifle cooperation. Therefore, it 
is necessary to systematize joint activities in order to achieve better results. Participants 
identified some areas in which joint activities between international and human rights 
mechanisms could be implemented.  
</p>
<p>(a) Country visits 
</p>
<p> (i) On a case-by-case basis, independent experts from international and 
regional human rights mechanisms should consider conducting joint visits on 
a more frequent basis, so as to optimize efforts by generating more visibility 
and giving greater weight to their recommendations. It was recommended 
that best practices and lessons learned from joint visits already conducted be 
taken into account, e.g. the joint visit to Togo (2008) by the United Nations 
and ACHPR rapporteurs on human rights defenders, and visits that will be 
undertaken in the near future, e.g. the upcoming joint visit to Mexico (August 
2010) of the United Nations and IACHR rapporteurs on freedom of 
expression; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Participants proposed that long-term planning of visits is established, 
including a list of visits that will be conducted by the various human rights 
mechanisms over a six- month period. This would facilitate the exchange of </p>


<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>information in advance, in particular on relevant issues in countries to be 
visited. In relation to human rights mechanisms dealing with restricted 
information - e.g. the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, the 
Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, and national preventive mechanisms 
(often NHRIs) - it was proposed that instead of undertaking joint visits, 
consultations be held among them in order to discuss strategies with regard to 
visits, and share information on planning and key issues in countries where 
visits will take place.  
</p>
<p>(b) Reports and publications 
</p>
<p> (i) Another joint activity between international and regional human rights 
mechanisms that should be expanded is the elaboration of joint reports, either 
thematic or on situations that require special attention. The joint report on 
citizen security and human rights by IACHR, the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF) and OHCHR 6  was mentioned as an example of good 
practice. Human rights mechanisms with similar scope can elaborate joint 
reports on issues of common interest. For instance, the United Nations 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the African Committee of Experts 
on the Rights and Welfare of the Child;  
</p>
<p> (ii) Participants also highlighted the advantages of adopting joint 
principles and guidelines which will contribute to human rights universality 
and the coherence of international human rights standards.  For example 
regional and international human rights mechanisms can jointly contribute to 
the ongoing process aimed at updating the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners;  
</p>
<p> (iii) Developing joint publications constitutes another possibility for 
enhancing cooperation. The role played by NGOs and NHRIs in 
disseminating and publicizing these publications to a vast range of 
interlocutors and readers cannot be overstated.  
</p>
<p>(c) Press releases and joint statements 
</p>
<p> (i) During the workshop, it was demonstrated that the practice of issuing 
joint press releases reinforces the effectiveness of human rights mechanisms 
by increasing visibility and generating greater impact on the media.  
Participants agreed that it is to be recommended that human rights 
mechanisms, both regional and international, with similar mandates or 
spheres of action, e.g. independent experts on internally displaced persons 
and on the rights of indigenous people, increase the number of joint messages 
delivered to the press; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Another proposal is to extend the practice of producing joint 
declarations and statements. Participants mentioned as a good example the 
joint declaration made every year by the United Nations, IACHR and 
ACPHR rapporteurs on freedom of expression, as well as the OSCE 
representative on freedom of the media, on key issues related to the right to 
freedom of expression. This declaration is included in the annual report to the 
Human Rights Council of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.7 Other human 
rights mechanisms with similar mandates should follow this practice by 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 6 Available at http://cidh.org/pdf%20files/SEGURIDAD%20CIUDADANA%202009%20ENG.pdf. 
 7 See, for example, A/HRC/14/23/Add.2. </p>


<p>regularly issuing joint declarations or statements related to human rights 
violations, or other important issues within their mandates. 
</p>
<p>(d) Raising awareness and technical cooperation activities 
</p>
<p> (i) Participants highlighted the need to promote awareness on 
international and regional human rights mechanisms and the standards that 
they seek to secure among as many actors as possible, in particular at the 
national level. For this purpose, joint actions should be undertaken on 
specific thematic areas, such as workshops and training sessions with the 
participation of experts and staff from the various human rights mechanisms. 
These might include the protection of human rights defenders, arbitrary 
detention, and economic, social and cultural rights. In addition, documents of 
the human rights mechanisms should be translated into as many languages as 
possible. This will ensure that the widest possible number of individuals will 
be able to access them. States could assist in funding the translation of such 
documents. The role of the NGOs was unanimously highlighted, given their 
knowledge of human rights mechanisms and their capacity to interact with a 
great number of stakeholders at the international, regional and national levels. 
They should, therefore, take part in these activities from the planning stage 
onwards; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Joint technical cooperation activities were also recommended, in order 
to allow human rights mechanisms to benefit from each other&#8217;s expertise on 
specific topics, as well as to expand their knowledge on each other&#8217;s best 
practices, jurisprudence, methods of work and rules of procedure. For 
example, European human rights mechanisms, such as the European 
Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) could help specialized 
regional and national bodies to consolidate their positions and activities on 
issues related to its mandate. The United Nations human rights mechanisms 
could also assist in strengthening the capacity of regional human rights 
mechanisms, taking into account their specific needs. For instance, special 
procedures mandate holders or treaty body members can provide advice on 
specific thematic issues, e.g. the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance could 
provide expertise to the Inter-American system on the establishment of a 
rapporteur on racism; 
</p>
<p> (iii) The need to strengthen joint efforts to provide technical cooperation to 
States was also underscored. Such efforts could include joint training and 
programmes to promote a human rights culture through promotion of human 
rights standards at all levels of society, and specifically for NHRIs, judges, 
civil society, local government, parliaments, and security and law 
enforcement agencies;  
</p>
<p> (iv) Participants agreed that capacity-building activities must be 
sustainable and genuinely helpful. The need to secure adequate resources was 
also highlighted.  
</p>
<p>(e) Follow-up 
</p>
<p> (i) A main area of cooperation between international and regional human 
rights mechanisms is the follow-up on decisions and recommendations. The 
workshop showed that despite the existence of follow-up mechanisms at the 
international and regional levels, the implementation of recommendations, 
judgments and views remains a great challenge to all human rights 
mechanisms. Participants agreed on the need to develop joint follow-up </p>


<p><b> 15 
</b></p>
<p>activities, with the participation of the various human rights mechanisms, 
NHRIs and NGOs;  
</p>
<p> (ii) Several proposals were made. Firstly, international and regional 
human rights mechanisms should conduct joint country visits to follow up on 
the implementation of their recommendations.8 In addition, international and 
regional mechanisms can use their own country visits to follow up on the 
implementation of each other&#8217;s recommendations and include their findings 
into their respective reports;  
</p>
<p> (iii) Meetings or workshops could be jointly organized by international 
and regional human rights mechanisms aimed at following up on the 
implementation of their decisions and recommendations, with the 
participation of governments, NHRIs and NGOs. Choosing a thematic focus 
would facilitate the task; 
</p>
<p> (iv) Inter-secretariat cooperation mechanisms could also be established in 
order to develop a system to better support each other in following up 
recommendations. For instance, United Nations treaty bodies special 
rapporteurs for follow-up9 could ask regional human rights mechanisms for 
relevant information, in order to assess the degree of implementation by 
States of the concluding observations and recommendations of the various 
committees;  
</p>
<p> (v) It was also proposed that the UPR be used as a follow-up tool.  
Participants agreed that the UPR should make more systematic use of cross 
references to the respective recommendations of international and regional 
mechanisms, and more systematic follow-up to UPR recommendations 
should be undertaken by human rights mechanisms;10 
</p>
<p> (vi) Finally, participants agreed on the important role played by NHRIs 
and NGOs in following up on the implementation of judgments, decisions 
and recommendations resulting from international and human rights 
mechanisms. It was suggested that cooperation arrangements be put in place 
in order to make cooperation between them more systematic, e.g. regular 
exchange of information and meetings between human rights mechanisms, 
NHRIS and NGOs on follow-up with a thematic focus. 
</p>

 8 See para. 46 (a). 
 9 The Human Rights Committee, the Committee Against Torture, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women have 
instituted similar procedures to monitor the implementation of recommendations contained in their 
concluding observations. The rules of procedure of the first three mandate one or several Committee 
members to act as Special Rapporteur or as a working group for follow-up on concluding 
observations and views. In general, the Special Rapporteur ascertains the measures taken by States 
parties to give effect to the recommendations or views of the respective Committee. The Special 
Rapporteur may make such contacts and take such action as appropriate for the due performance of 
the follow-up mandate. He or she also makes such recommendations for further action by the 
respective Committee as may be necessary and regularly reports to the Committee on 
follow-up activities. The Committees include information on follow-up activities in their 
annual reports to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p> 10 See para.45 (d) above. </p>


<p><b> IV. Cooperation with national human rights institutions   
</b></p>
<p>47. Participants agreed on the need to strengthen cooperation between NHRIs and 
international and regional human rights mechanisms. A number of resolutions on 
cooperation between NHRIs and human rights mechanisms constitute a first step in the right 
direction. OAS resolutions AG/RES. 2421 (XXXVIII-O/08) and AG/RES. 2448 (XXXIX-
O/09) recognized the important contribution that NHRIs accredited by the International 
Coordinating Committee (ICC) can make to the work of the OAS in the promotion of 
human rights, and resolved to facilitate the participation of all NHRIs in the human rights 
activities of the organs, agencies, and entities of the organization. Likewise, the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights states that States parties shall allow the 
establishment and improvement of NHRIs (article 26). General Assembly resolution 60/251 
states that the Human Rights Council should work in close cooperation with both regional 
organizations and NHRIs.11 
</p>
<p>48. During the workshop it was proposed that some mechanisms be set up in order to 
systematize cooperation between NHRIs and international and regional human rights 
mechanisms. They should cooperate in areas such as raising awareness, technical 
cooperation, and human rights education. Seminars on human rights mechanisms, including 
information on their functions, methods of work, jurisprudence, and best practices, should 
be organized by NHRIs, with the participation of representatives of both international and 
regional human rights mechanisms, national authorities and NGOs, so as to make use of 
NHRI expertise on capacity-building and facilitating networking between relevant 
stakeholders. In addition, NHRIs could contribute to strengthening State engagement with 
both United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>49. Participants also agreed on the importance of establishing NHRIs where they do not 
exist, expanding their mandates when these do not cover all human rights issues, and 
ensuring their independence and that they have a broad range powers, in compliance with 
the Paris Principles relating to the status of NHRIs. They also encouraged the creation of 
regional secretariats where they are not yet established (Europe and the Americas), which 
could act as focal points to engage with international and regional human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Cooperation with non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>50. NGOs are key actors in the process of cooperation between human rights 
mechanisms. They can contribute in many ways to strengthening the collaboration between 
regional and international human rights mechanisms. Areas of cooperation with NGOs 
identified during the international workshop included raising awareness and capacity-
building activities, as well as information sharing on country visits, best practices, 
individual cases, urgent situations, and the promotion of ratification of international and 
regional human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>51. The need to improve information sharing between human rights mechanisms and 
NGOs was highlighted. It was proposed to define long-term common strategies, including a 
mapping of the most important issues or topics in each region. In this connection, 
participants agreed that NGOs play an important role in identifying possible areas of 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms and in 
formulating ways to implement them. Their critical analysis has been vital to the 
development of human rights mechanisms, both international and regional. Thus, their 
views should be always taken into account when setting up mechanisms of cooperation.

<p><b> 17 
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>International, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms are in 
agreement in recognizing both the importance and utility of strengthening 
cooperation. They have also agreed that the ultimate aim of such cooperation is to have 
a real impact at the national level, making a difference for individuals.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Participants have also agreed on the need to establish mechanisms in order to 
reinforce cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
They have identified information sharing and joint activities as the main areas in 
which such mechanisms can be implemented.  Within each of these areas participants 
identified spheres in which cooperation arrangements can be set up, and set out 
concrete proposals for achieving this.  Concerning information sharing, participants 
agreed that best practices, jurisprudence, urgent cases and situations, and the UPR 
constitute the main fields in which exchange of information should be improved. They 
also identified a number of possible activities that could be jointly undertaken by 
international and regional human rights mechanisms: country visits; reports and 
publications; press releases and statements; raising awareness and capacity-building 
activities; and follow-up to decisions and recommendations emanating from 
international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The ongoing review of the Human Rights Council12 offers an opportunity for 
increased interaction with regional human rights mechanisms. Consideration could be 
given to enhancing cooperation with them, by progressively allowing their documents 
to be considered as official documents by the Human Rights Council, e.g. country and 
thematic reports. This would contribute to ending the existing compartmentalization 
between the United Nations and the various regional human rights systems and would 
allow the Human Rights Council to benefit from their expertise and gain a better 
knowledge of human rights issues at the regional level.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The importance of holding regular meetings with the participation of 
representatives of international and regional human rights mechanisms, governments, 
NHRIs and NGOs was also reaffirmed. Such meetings should be held biannually and 
discussions should be aimed at discussing sharing of information and joint activities, 
focusing on thematic priorities. In addition, focal points should be appointed in every 
human rights mechanism in order to maintain regular communication between 
mechanisms and facilitate the elaboration of a plan of work which will be a reference 
for cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Finally, the need to provide adequate resources to make cooperation possible 
was highlighted. In this respect, participants urged States and intergovernmental 
organizations to allocate the necessary financial and human resources in order to 
ensure the success of this endeavour.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation arrangements between international and regional human 
rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Focal points should be appointed in each human rights mechanism, including 
international, regional and subregional mechanisms. The National Institutions and 
</b></p>
<p>                                                          
 12 See http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/HRC_review.htm. </p>


<p><b>Regional Mechanisms Section</b> (<b>NIRMS), as the OHCHR focal point on regional 
mechanisms, should be responsible for coordinating the inputs from the focal points of 
the various international human rights mechanisms. Focal points will be in charge of 
outlining a workplan on enhancing cooperation between international and regional 
human rights mechanisms which will identify the objectives, activities, timelines and 
responsibilities of each mechanism. Consultations on the workplan should take place 
between the various human rights mechanisms and subsequently with States, NHRIs 
and NGOs. Focal points should keep themselves regularly informed about the activities 
of their respective mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Biannual meetings should be convened with the participation of international, 
regional and subregional human rights mechanisms, governments, NHRIs and NGOs. 
Their main objective will be to discuss sharing of information, joint activities and 
follow-up to decisions and recommendations, focusing on thematic priorities. During 
these meetings, focal points should report on their activities indicating results 
achieved, as well as obstacles encountered in the implementation of their 
responsibilities.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Regional and subregional human rights mechanisms should have the possibility 
of participating in Human Rights Council sessions relevant to their area of interest, 
intervene in interactive dialogues, and be entitled to submit documentation and written 
statements. Their reports, or at least the executive summaries thereof, should be 
systematically circulated among the members of the Human Rights Council. Regional 
human rights mechanisms documents should progressively become official documents 
of the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The field presences of intergovernmental organizations, in particular those 
which comprise territories covered by international and regional human rights 
mechanisms, as well as United Nations country teams and the regional offices of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), should reinforce their collaboration 
with human rights mechanisms, in particular regional and subregional human rights 
mechanisms located in their sphere of activity. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>States and intergovernmental organizations should politically and financially 
support cooperation initiatives resulting from the ongoing cooperation process 
between international, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms.  It is 
crucial that adequate resources be allocated to implement these recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Instruments that will facilitate smooth cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>A database which centralizes information resulting from both international and 
regional human rights mechanisms should be created. It should include State party 
reports, conclusions, recommendations, views, reports and opinions, as well as contact 
information and information on individual cases if possible. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b> Web links leading to the web pages of various international and regional 
human rights mechanisms should be available on their respective websites with a view 
to disseminating and sharing information with relevant stakeholders, in particular the 
users of international and regional human rights mechanism, including governments, 
victims, NGOs, and NHRIs.   
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>OHCHR should include a web link on its website containing information on 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms, including 
information on meetings, joint activities, focal points, information-sharing 
mechanisms, etc.  </b></p>


<p><b> 19 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Info notes should be prepared by both international and regional human rights 
mechanisms and distributed every two months among them, in order to circulate 
information on their current and forthcoming activities. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Bilateral and multilateral meetings, either regular, ad hoc, general or thematic, 
should be held between international, regional and subregional human rights 
mechanisms, in order to discuss specific topics or situations, jurisprudence, 
publications, reports, guidelines, technical cooperation, follow-up, etc. Regular 
meetings should be held between special rapporteurs of both international and 
regional human rights mechanisms and members of United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Mechanisms of cooperation between secretariats of international, regional and 
subregional human rights mechanisms should be enhanced or established where they 
do not yet exist. Working level cooperation arrangements should set up and the 
possibility of putting in place a system for exchange of staff should be considered. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Memorandums of understanding or intent can be established between 
international, regional and subregional human rights mechanisms in order to enhance 
institutionalized cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Sharing of information 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>A system should be put in place aimed at exchanging best practices and lessons 
learned between international and regional human rights mechanisms.   
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Arrangements for regular exchange of jurisprudence between judicial and 
quasi-judicial human rights mechanisms should be set up. Such arrangements can 
include thematic meetings, as well as compilations of jurisprudence, electronic 
bulletins, and bibliographies. A wide dissemination of exchanges between human 
rights mechanisms on jurisprudence should be ensured, e.g. by publishing minutes of 
thematic meetings, posting compilations of jurisprudence, bulletins and bibliographies 
on the respective websites etc. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Specific tools to share information on urgent cases and situations should be 
established. This could be facilitated by the secretariats of human rights mechanisms 
through desk-to-desk collaboration, with the full participation of NGOs, which often 
provide information on urgent cases. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Contributions from regional human rights mechanisms to the UPR should be 
increasingly considered as official documents by the Human Rights Council and States 
participating in the review. In return, regional human rights mechanisms should be 
more proactive in submitting information to the Human Rights Council, regarding 
countries to be reviewed by the UPR. In addition, the UPR could take into account the 
ratification of regional human rights instruments and implementation of the decisions 
and recommendations of regional human rights mechanisms, and vice versa. Regional 
human rights mechanisms should be considered by the United Nations and the 
international community as relevant partners in assisting States in implementing the 
outcome of the UPR, as appropriate.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Joint activities 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Independent experts from international and regional human rights mechanisms 
should consider conducting joint visits on a more regular basis. A system for sharing 
long-term planning of visits of international and regional human rights mechanisms </b></p>


<p><b>should be put in place, including a list of visits that will be conducted by the various 
human rights mechanisms over a six- month period.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The practice of elaborating joint reports, publications, standards and guidelines 
should be expanded. NGOs and NHRIs should participate in discussions on such 
initiatives, given the important role they play in disseminating and publicizing joint 
activities among a broad range of stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>International and regional human rights mechanisms with similar mandates 
should issue joint press releases, declarations and statements, regarding key issues or 
situations related to their mandates. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Joint actions should be undertaken in order to promote awareness of both 
international and regional human rights mechanisms among as many actors as 
possible at the international, regional and national levels. Given the important role 
played by NHRIs and NGOs in this matter, they should take part in these actions. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Technical assistance to States should be enhanced. Joint training and 
programmes to improve knowledge of international, regional and subregional human 
rights mechanisms should be put in place.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Joint follow-up activities should be established, including country visits, 
meetings and inter-secretariat cooperation mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Cooperation with national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Both NHRIs and NGOs should be involved as full participants in the 
cooperation process between international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Mechanisms should be set up in order to increase cooperation between NHRIs 
and international and regional human rights mechanisms, in particular regarding 
raising awareness, capacity-building and monitoring activities, as well as on follow-up 
to decisions and recommendations emanating from both international and regional 
human rights mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Arrangements for enhancing cooperation between NGOs and international and 
regional human rights mechanisms should be established, including mechanisms to 
improve exchange of information, e.g. inclusion into the (future) database of 
information provided by NGOs, bilateral meetings, common strategies regarding 
human rights issues in specific regions, etc. </b></p>

<p> Human Rights Council resolution (A/HRC/RES/12/15) called for the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to hold workshops on regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights to allow sharing of information and concrete 
proposals on ways to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional 
arrangements, including sub-regional human rights mechanisms.    
</p>
<p> In this context a Regional Consultation for Africa on <i>Enhancing Cooperation 
Between Regional an International Mechanisms for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights was</i> held in Addis Ababa Ethiopia, 30 November to 2 December 2009, under 
the auspices of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in 
cooperation with the African Union Commission - Department of Political Affairs, 
</p>
<p> Participation was drawn from representatives from: Governments, the African Union 
Commission; the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights; the African Committee of 
Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child; the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC) Court of Justice, the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice; United 
Nations experts and committee members; as well as OHCHR and other UN agencies; 
national human rights institutions (NHRIs), the Secretariat of the Network of African 
NHRIs, the Secretariat of the African Human Rights NGO Forum; civil society 
organizations and academia. Participants also expressed appreciation to the Government of 
the Federal Republic of Ethiopia for hosting the Regional Consultation. 
</p>
<p> Participants recognized that in Africa the human rights protection and promotion 
framework is at four levels: national, sub &#8211;regional, regional and international, utilizing 
different charter based and treaty based normative frameworks, standards and systems; and 
that the African regional system facilitates the contextualization of international human 
rights standards at the regional level and development of human rights principles, useful 
and relevant to Africa. They recognized that the African human rights system has played a 
significant role in the development and advancement of human rights norms in Africa and 
noted the complimentarity between all the systems and the need to have adequate 
cooperation, especially in the implementation of human rights norms at the national level.  
</p>
<p> They recognized the importance of cooperation with NHRIs and civil society 
organizations in implementation of human rights norms at the national level, and further 
indicated the importance of establishing NHRIs where they do not exist,  in compliance 
with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p> Participants noted that the Human Rights Strategy for Africa (General Assembly 
Resolution 61/296 (2007)) to be developed under the leadership of the African Union 
Commission, in the context of the UN-AU 10 year capacity building framework, constitutes 
a good framework for strengthened cooperation between the two systems. 
</p>
<p> Participants put forward the following recommendations in relation to strengthening 
cooperation between the regional (African) and international human rights systems: 
</p>
<p> 1. A system of cooperation/collaboratation should be institutionalized or 
formalized between the two human rights systems, under the auspices of the OHCHR and 
AUC to facilitate such cooperation and interaction. </p>


<p> 2. Regular meetings or forums for collaboration between the  UN and Africa 
human rights mechanisms should be encouraged starting for instance with the attendance of 
the African human rights mechanisms in annual meetings of Special Procedures Mandate 
Holders (SPMHs) , and  Chairpersons of Treaty Bodies, as well as at sessions of the Human 
Rights Council (HRC) and vice versa. 
</p>
<p> 3. An institutionalized system for exchange of information and documentation 
between the two systems should be developed. Information sharing may be on various areas 
including: 
</p>
<p>I. Jurisprudence on the normative content of human rights instruments: e.g. the 
African human rights mechanisms could consult jurisprudence of treaty bodies on 
individual communications, concluding observations/comments, and general 
comments that provide guidance on the content of civil and political rights, and 
economic social and cultural rights and relevant obligations of States parties and 
vice versa. 
</p>
<p>II. Soft law: exchange of information in areas where norms, principles and 
guidelines have been developed;  
</p>
<p>III. Information from Special Procedures mechanisms and their methods of work 
and findings, including on individual cases, country visits and follow-up, as well as 
research on thematic human rights issues; 
</p>
<p>IV. Exchange of information and experience regarding rules of procedures, 
working methods and reporting procedures, including working methods with 
different partners e.g. NGOs, NHRIs and international agencies, as well as 
guidelines for reporting with a view to facilitate States parties&#8217; fulfillment of  
reporting obligations. 
</p>
<p>V. Seek to harmonize working methods, where possible, with full respect of the 
independence of all mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>VI. Share good practices related to follow up and implementation of views, 
opinions and recommendations of international and regional mechanisms by the 
State parties. 
</p>
<p> 4. Encourage provision of information on the different processes of the 
respective mechanisms, including by providing information prior to the consideration of 
reports, disseminating the conclusions and recommendations of the respective systems and 
ensuring collaboration in the follow-up to their recommendations. 
</p>
<p> 5. An electronic data base could be created to share information including State 
parties&#8217; reports, conclusions, recommendations, individual complaints, views, reports and 
opinions of UN human rights mechanisms and regional mechanisms which are available 
and accessible, information could also be placed on CD roms. 
</p>
<p> 6. A link from the OHCHR website to websites of the African human rights 
mechanisms should be created to facilitate information sharing and vice versa. 
</p>
<p> 7. Documents from the African mechanisms could be submitted as official 
documents of the  UN Human Rights Council, by Governments and  NHRIs accredited with 
A-status. 
</p>
<p> 8. Facilitate cooperation with institutions with complementary jurisprudence 
and thematic focus(opportunities): 
</p>
<p>I. The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and Universal Peer Review 
Mechanism (UPR) could cooperate and learn from each other. </p>


<p><b> 23 
</b></p>
<p>II. Members of African mechanisms could be invited to attend the Human 
Rights Council sessions and participate in interactive dialogues, as well as to 
participate in human rights Treaty Body sessions regarding country considerations 
and thematic discussions 
</p>
<p>III. The Human Rights Council may invite for cooperation appropriate African 
and sub regional human rights mechanisms to carry out monitoring and follow up 
activities regarding countries reviewed, at the request of and on behalf of the HRC  
</p>
<p>IV. Joint field missions with African and UN mechanisms e.g. the African 
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the UN 
Committee on the Rights of the Child should further explore the conduct of field 
visits to follow up on recommendations and holding joint meetings to discuss areas 
of mutual cooperation. 
</p>
<p>V. The Human Rights Council Open-ended Working Group to explore the 
possibility of elaborating on an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child will hold its first meeting in December 2009, and may benefit from the 
experience of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the 
Child that already has this procedure.  
</p>
<p>VI. Thematic areas for mutual cooperation between special procedures mandate 
holders that have a similar mandate, e.g.  The Special Rapporteurs on Human Rights 
Defenders: both UN and African SRs conducted joint missions and issued joint press 
releases, which led to greater visibity and gave more weight to their 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>VII. Cooperate with Special Procedures mechanisms to receive communications 
and send joint appeals. 
</p>
<p>VIII. The Protocol for women&#8217;s rights under the African system and the 
complementarities with CEDAW could be further explored. 
</p>
<p>IX. Cooperate in strengthening the participation of NHRIs and NGOs in regional 
and international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> 9. Jointly carry out promotional and sensitization activities; disseminate, 
publicize and popularize jurisprudence, mechanisms and procedures in collaboration with 
relevant partners. 
</p>
<p> 10. Discuss ways to cooperate to ensure greater access of individuals, civil 
society and NHRIs to the regional and African human rights mechanisms; ensure 
ratification of human rights instruments by States  and fewer reservations, and encourage 
reporting and greater implementation of international obligations 
</p>
<p> 11. Identify strategies to support follow up and implementation of all views, 
findings, conclusions and recommendations by international and regional mechanisms by 
State parties. 
</p>
<p> Participants at the Regional Consultation<i>: 
</i></p>
<p> 12. Encouraged States parties to commit to providing sufficient support to the 
African regional human rights mechanisms; to fulfill their reporting obligations; and 
commit to implementing their human rights obligations at the national level, including by 
developing rules of procedures on the implementation of decisions and recommendations 
and identifying focal points for different ministries to follow up the same. 
</p>
<p> 13. Encouraged States parties, regional and international human rights 
mechanisms to continue to enhance cooperation with NHRIs, human rights NGOs, civil 
society and the media. </p>


<p> 14. Called on UN mechanisms to assist in strengthening the capacity of the 
African mechanisms especially with regard to implementation of human rights norms at all 
levels but especially at the national level. 
</p>
<p> 15. Agreed to promote a human rights culture in their countries through 
promotion of human rights education at all levels of society, and specifically human rights 
programs for security and law enforcement agencies, the judiciary as well as 
parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p> 16. Welcomed the UN-AU cooperation, and called for regular meetings on 
thematic and procedural issues concerning their respective mechanisms to be convened 
between the two organizations. 
</p>
<p> Participants agreed to contribute these recommendations to the next international 
meeting to be held in Geneva in May 2010.

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Regional consultation for the Americas 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussions   
</b></p>
<p> Experts from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights, the United Nations (UN), representatives of Governments, national 
human rights institutions (NHRIs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from the 
region as well as staff from the OAS and OHCHR participated in the above-mentioned 
consultation. They underlined the need for an institutionalized cooperation between the 
Inter-American and the UN human rights systems.  Such cooperation would entail regular 
exchanges between the two systems at various levels and greater opportunities for 
consultation, joint actions, country visits, as well as regular sharing of information and 
documentation.  Participants recognized that it would be important for the OAS to 
designate a high-level focal point for this purpose and/or a Unit that could follow-up on the 
recommendations formulate by this meeting.  Such cooperation, which could be formalized 
through a Memorandum of Intent or a Memorandum of Understanding, could start 
immediately and be gradually expanded, taking into account the proposals discussed during 
the meeting.   
</p>
<p> 1. It is important that both systems develop internal coordination mechanisms in 
order to facilitate enhanced cooperation.  
</p>
<p> 2. Subject to availability of resources, the two systems should hold thematic 
discussions on priority issues, such as the prevention of torture and the protection of human 
rights defenders. Further opportunities for cooperation at different levels (international, 
regional and national) should be considered and modalities of cooperation developed 
accordingly, taking into account the important role that NHRIs and NGOs could play in 
strengthening the national human rights protection systems.  
</p>
<p> 3. Regarding jurisprudence, the Inter-American system has been regularly 
consulting the jurisprudence developed by the UN human rights system. A more formalized 
system of interaction is required. For instance, both systems could exchange and circulate 
an electronic biannual bulletin which could include the main decisions adopted during that 
period. Information and data can be made available through user-friendly web-links. 
</p>
<p> 4. A main area of cooperation is the following-up on decisions and 
recommendations that are of mutual concern to both systems. Except for the hearing 
procedure of follow-up by the Inter-American Court, as a priority other follow-up 
mechanisms need to be improved. The international system recognizes that despite the 
existence of follow-up mechanisms, the implementation of recommendations and views 
remains a great challenge. It would be welcomed to develop possibilities for joint follow-up 
of decisions and recommendations resulting from both systems.  
</p>
<p> 5. Both systems should meet periodically in order to discuss possible strategies 
of cooperation including specific objectives, timelines and expected outcomes.  
</p>
<p> 6. Mechanisms of cooperation/collaboration in specific areas could be 
institutionalized or formalized through: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The strengthening of coordination and planning with respect to country visits of 
Special Rapporteurs, including consideration of the possibility to carry out joint 
visits and joint follow-up actions;  </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The preparation of joint reports on situations that require special attention;  
&#8226; The reports from the regional human rights mechanisms could be increasingly 
</p>
<p>submitted &#8211;as official documents- to the UN Human Rights Council (i.e. country 
reports), so that they could be referred to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) (i.e. 
OHCHR&#8217;s compilation); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The presentation of technical briefs on cases that are before either system. For 
instance, a Special Rapporteur of either system could present an amicus curiae brief 
before the system that hears a case, provided it is relevant to the mandate in 
question; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Both systems could make reference and consult each other&#8217;s jurisprudence, 
including in relation to the non-implementation of the decisions or 
recommendations. For example, the compilation prepared by OHCHR for the UPR 
could refer to the non-implementation of a decision or recommendation from the 
Inter-American Commission or the Inter-American Court; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regular meetings should be held between Special Rapporteurs of both systems, 
members of the Inter-American Commission and the Inter-American Court and 
members of UN human rights treaty bodies. For example, members of the Inter- 
American Commission and the Court could participate in the annual meeting of 
treaty bodies&#8217; chairpersons. Similarly, Rapporteurs from the Inter-American 
Commission could join the Annual Meeting of UN special Rapporteurs, 
Representatives, Independent Experts and Chairpersons of Working Groups of the 
Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Issuing joint press releases, by UN and Inter-American System&#8217;s Special 
Rapporteurs; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting workshops and training sessions with the participation of experts and 
staff from both systems on specific thematic areas, such as the protection of human 
rights defenders, arbitrary detention, etc;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The creation of an electronic database and user-friendly web links available on the 
respective web-pages, with a view to sharing information, including State parties&#8217; 
reports, conclusions, recommendations, individual complaints (confidentially), 
views, reports and opinions from the UN and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> 7. On the issue of collaboration and advice on specific thematic issues, the UN 
system could &#8211;for instance- provide expertise to the Inter-American System in the 
establishment of a Special Rapporteur on racism.  
</p>
<p> 8. NHRIs could explore the possibility of working in a more coordinated 
manner with NGOs, especially on the interaction with the UN and the regional human 
rights systems.  
</p>
<p> 9. The important role played by NGOs in following up decisions and 
recommendations resulting from both human rights systems was highlighted. NGOs and 
NHRIs could jointly ensure greater accountability and monitor closely the required follow 
up by the Government to the decisions and recommendations resulting from the 
international and regional human rights systems.  NHRIs and NGOs could also actively 
contribute to the strengthening of the Government&#8217;s capacity to ensure the implementation 
of international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p> 10. In the future, members of the constitutional courts of the OAS region could 
be invited to participate in meetings between the two systems, to deepen their </p>


<p><b> 27 
</b></p>
<p>understanding of the two systems and also to encourage them to incorporate international 
human rights standards in their decisions.  
</p>
<p> 11. Coordination with sub-regional mechanisms (such as the existing and 
emerging mechanisms of South America) should be established to contribute to the work 
already undertaken by the regional mechanism itself.  
</p>
<p> 12. It is important to strengthen the role of both systems in the elaboration and 
implementation of national human rights action plans.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Regional consultation for Europe 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussions 
</b></p>
<p> Experts from the Council of Europe (CoE), including members of different 
Committees and Groups of Experts, representatives of the European Court of Human 
Rights, the Directorate General of Human Rights and Legal Affairs and the Office of the 
CoE Commissioner for Human Rights, the European Union Agency for Fundamental 
Rights (FRA), the OSCE&#8217;s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), 
as well as United Nations human rights experts, representatives of Governments, National 
Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) from the region, NGOs, and staff of the Office of the 
High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) discussed existing ways and means of 
cooperation and new approaches to developing and deepen them. 
</p>
<p> Participants recognized the importance of cooperation between the UN human rights 
system and the various European human rights mechanisms, for the purpose of better 
promoting and protecting and enhancing universality of human rights.  
</p>
<p> Participants also noted the complementarity between the international, regional and 
national human rights systems and the need to have effective cooperation, especially in the 
implementation of human rights norms at the national level.  
</p>
<p> They also highlighted the importance of cooperation with NHRIs and civil society 
organizations in the implementation of human rights norms at the national level, and further 
indicated the importance of establishing NHRIs where they do not exist, expanding their 
mandates when these do not cover all human rights issues and ensuring their independence 
and that they have a broad range powers, in compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p> The following recommendations were discussed: 
</p>
<p> 1. Both systems should build upon their existing means of cooperation from the 
planning stage onwards.  
</p>
<p> 2. The strengthening of the regular exchange of information between the UN 
and the European mechanisms could include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing a more regular and formalized system of exchange of jurisprudence, 
which could be facilitated through improvements to websites and databases.  
Judicial colloquia could also be organized, with the active participation of NGOs 
and NHRIs, in order to exchange experiences and jurisprudence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; More reciprocal use made of findings and recommendations by European and UN 
human rights mechanisms, thereby contributing to the universality of human rights 
and the coherence of international human rights case law. 
</p>
<p> 3. Joint efforts to follow up judgments, decisions and recommendations 
resulting from the UN and European mechanisms would be a welcome development since, 
even though there are already some mechanisms for follow-up, implementation of 
judgments, recommendations and views still remains a great challenge.  
</p>
<p> 4. Existing cooperation with NHRIs should be enhanced so as to facilitate their 
role in monitoring the application of international human rights standards and in following-
up on the implementation of judgments, decisions and recommendations resulting from UN </p>


<p><b> 29 
</b></p>
<p>and European human rights mechanisms. This could be assisted by the establishment of a 
secretariat for the NHRIs Network in Europe and inviting NHRIs to be observers in 
meetings and consultations. 
</p>
<p> 5. Civil society, including international and local NGOs, should be encouraged 
to actively participate in the process of enhancing cooperation between the UN and the 
European human rights systems, given their knowledge of the functioning of both systems.  
</p>
<p> 6. More specific means of cooperation could include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Meetings between members of the European human rights mechanisms and 
members of UN Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting joint missions, taking into account specific criteria to determine its 
convenience in each concrete case.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Exchanging information and experience regarding rules of procedures, working 
methods and reporting procedures, in order to better define cooperation and to learn 
from best practices. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Keeping under review thematic areas and issues for mutual cooperation, for instance 
building upon the experience of the CoE Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
OSCE focal point on Human Rights Defenders and the UN Special Rapporteur on 
Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reciprocal sharing of best practices and lessons learned in the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Taking systematically into account of reports from the European human rights 
mechanisms by the UN Human Rights Council in the UPR.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reviewing the status of regional systems within the UPR. 
&#8226; Continuing exchanges between the OHCHR and the CoE (desk to desk cooperation) 
</p>
<p>and possibly developing similar exchanges with other European institutions.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Examining the possibility of exchanging staff between European and UN 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthening joint efforts to provide technical cooperation to States. This could 
include training for judges, civil society, local governments and Parliaments. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Expanding the development and use of joint publications, as well as the possible 
adoption of joint standards and guidelines. 
</p>
<p> 7. Cooperation between European human rights mechanisms and OHCHR field 
presences in the region should also be enhanced and the possibilities of effective 
collaboration with UN Country Teams and UNDP Regional Offices should be explored. 
</p>
<p> 8. The possibility of OHCHR and ODIHR becoming involved in FRA&#8217;s 
management board should be explored. 
</p>
<p> 9. Joint efforts should be undertaken by European and UN human rights 
mechanisms, together with NHRIs and NGOs, to achieve a greater understanding by the 
general public of both these mechanisms and the standards that they seek to secure. This 
should include efforts to expand the translation of official documents and case law from 
official languages. 
</p>
<p> 10. The financing of European and UN human rights mechanisms should take 
due account of the costs involved in securing effective cooperation between them.
