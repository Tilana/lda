<p> <b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council decided, in its resolution 15/26, to establish an open-
</p>
<p>ended intergovernmental working group with the mandate to consider the possibility of 
</p>
<p>elaborating an international regulatory framework, including the option of elaborating a 
</p>
<p>legally binding instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies, including their accountability, taking into 
</p>
<p>consideration the principles, main elements and draft text as proposed by the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 22/33, the Human Rights Council extended the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>open-ended intergovernmental working group for a further period of two years in order for 
</p>
<p>it to undertake and fulfil the mandate as outlined in paragraph 77 of its report on its second 
</p>
<p>session (A/HRC/22/41). The Council also requested the working group to present its 
</p>
<p>recommendations to the Council at its thirtieth session. Those recommendations, which are 
</p>
<p>based on deliberations held at the working group&#8217;s third and fourth sessions, are contained 
</p>
<p>in section V below. 
</p>
<p>3. On 26 March 2015, the Human Rights Council decided, in its resolution 28/7, to 
</p>
<p>extend the mandate of the open-ended intergovernmental working group for a further 
</p>
<p>period of two and a half years in order for it to undertake and fulfil its mandate, as 
</p>
<p>contained in resolution 22/33. 
</p>
<p>4. The open-ended intergovernmental working group has held four sessions.1 Its fourth 
</p>
<p>session, held from 27 April to 1 May 2015, was opened by the Chief of the Rule of Law, 
</p>
<p>Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch, on behalf of the Deputy High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. She highlighted several developments that had occurred since the third 
</p>
<p>session, including the establishment by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 26/9 of 
</p>
<p>an open-ended intergovernmental working group on transnational corporations and other 
</p>
<p>business enterprises with respect to human rights. She also said that the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) would shortly publish a 
</p>
<p>progress report on legal options and practical measures to improve access to remedy for 
</p>
<p>victims of business-related human rights abuses (as requested in Council resolution 26/22),2 
</p>
<p>which is intended to contribute to a more effective implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights (see A/HRC/17/31, annex).3  
</p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner stressed that private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies had a responsibility to respect human rights, as stipulated in the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights. That might include implementing training 
</p>
<p>procedures for employees, establishing grievance procedures in cases of alleged abuses and 
</p>
<p>conducting regular monitoring to ensure adequate oversight, immediate cessation of abuses 
</p>
<p>and accountability. If cases of human rights abuses occurred, States had the obligation to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they were referred to the authorities concerned for investigation, prosecution 
</p>
<p>and reparation. From a human rights perspective, she stressed the importance of ensuring 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>2012, A/HRC/22/41) and third session (21&#8211;25 July 2014, A/HRC/WG.10/3/2).

<p> 3 Endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4.  
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>that there was no protection gap and no impunity for private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies, including for those that operated transnationally.  
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner indicated that the prosecution and recent 
</p>
<p>sentencing by a United States federal judge of four Blackwater contractors who had killed 
</p>
<p>14 unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007 had sent a strong signal that human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>committed by private military and security companies should never remain unpunished. 
</p>
<p>However, as flagged by the Working Group on mercenaries in its press release of 14 April 
</p>
<p>2015: &#8220;Justice is served in this case but must be assured globally.&#8221;4 She mentioned that 
</p>
<p>other initiatives were also relevant when considering an international regulatory framework 
</p>
<p>on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies. Those included the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service 
</p>
<p>Providers and the Montreux Document on Pertinent International Legal Obligations and 
Good Practices for States related to Operations of Private Military and Security Companies 
</p>
<p>during Armed Conflict, which sought to promote respect for international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and human rights law whenever such companies were present in armed conflicts.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the fourth session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Election of the Chair-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. At its first meeting, on 27 April 2015, the working group elected the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Representative of South Africa, Abdul S. Minty, as its Chair-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>8. The list of attendance is contained in annex I to the present report. Pursuant to 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 28/7, the open-ended intergovernmental working group 
</p>
<p>invited experts and relevant stakeholders to participate in its work, including the Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur of the Working Group on mercenaries, El&#380;bieta Karska; the Director of the 
</p>
<p>Security in Complex Environments Group, Paul Gibson; senior researcher in international 
</p>
<p>law at the University of Pretoria, Stuart Casey-Maslen; and the United Nations Under-
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Safety and Security. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>9. In his introductory remarks, the Chair-Rapporteur recalled the mandate of the open-
</p>
<p>ended intergovernmental working group. He indicated that at previous sessions a range of 
</p>
<p>issues and challenges to the effective regulation of the activities of private military and 
</p>
<p>security companies had been addressed, focusing on existing law and practice, on issues of 
</p>
<p>accountability for human rights abuses linked to such activities and on the provision of 
</p>
<p>appropriate assistance and remedies for victims. He also recalled that delegations had 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed the shared goal of protecting human rights and ensuring accountability for 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses relating to the activities of private military and security companies; 
</p>
<p>and that there was widespread agreement about gaps in the current regulatory framework, 
</p>
<p>not least because only very few States had specific legislation on such companies. The 
</p>
<p>Chair-Rapporteur mentioned that how to ensure effective remedies and accountability 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Available from 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15840&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>remained one of the central challenges, and he highlighted the clear mandate of the working 
</p>
<p>group in that regard. 
</p>
<p>10. At its first meeting, on 27 April 2015, the open-ended intergovernmental working 
</p>
<p>group adopted its agenda (A/HRC/WG.10/4/1) and programme of work. 
</p>
<p>11. One delegation commended the Chair-Rapporteur for his ability to get consensus in 
</p>
<p>the past and referred in particular to paragraph 77 of A/HRC/22/41, but regretted that the 
</p>
<p>sponsor of the resolutions presented at the twenty-second and twenty-eighth sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council had disregarded the potential for consensus and had opted instead to 
</p>
<p>divide the Council, with a view to discussing a draft convention on which there had been no 
</p>
<p>consensus in 2011. The same delegation pointed to the underlying question as to why some 
</p>
<p>delegations invested in building consensus during sessions of the open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group if that consensus was meant to be undermined with a 
</p>
<p>voted resolution. It also regretted that its request to invite stakeholders to provide updates 
</p>
<p>on recent developments in the processes on the International Code of Conduct for Private 
</p>
<p>Security Service Providers and the Montreux Document had not been met. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations noted that paragraph 77 set forth the scope of the mandate of the working group 
</p>
<p>and the basis for continued cooperation. 
</p>
<p>12. Some delegations highlighted the need for victims to have the right to an effective 
</p>
<p>remedy, including reparations, and for an international legally binding instrument in 
</p>
<p>addition to national initiatives on the activities of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>Those delegations indicated that such companies, given their specificities, should not be 
</p>
<p>allowed to regulate their own behaviour, which could only be done by an independent 
</p>
<p>authority. In their opinion, the current normative framework, including the Montreux 
</p>
<p>Document and the International Code of Conduct, failed to address the complexities of the 
</p>
<p>problem, nor did they establish proper mechanisms for accountability, effective remedies 
</p>
<p>for victims, regulation, monitoring and oversight of those entities and their personnel. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations recommended that the open-ended intergovernmental working group begin 
</p>
<p>discussions on concrete elements for inclusion in a legally binding instrument during the 
</p>
<p>fourth session. 
</p>
<p>13. In that regard, Pakistan indicated that it had submitted draft elements for a possible 
</p>
<p>instrument, based on human rights instruments, the Montreux Document and the 
</p>
<p>International Code of Conduct, the draft which had been prepared by the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on mercenaries.5 The delegation urged the Chair-Rapporteur to present the text of a draft 
</p>
<p>convention based on those elements and the deliberations at the session, for the 
</p>
<p>consideration of States, before the next session. South Africa suggested that norms should 
</p>
<p>be elaborated in international law to (a) define private military and security companies; and 
</p>
<p>(b) hold such companies accountable under international humanitarian and international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. The new instrument should complement national and regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, particularly in the area of combating impunity and effective punishment. It 
</p>
<p>should also include mechanisms for recourse in cases of violations. Such mechanisms 
</p>
<p>would include a committee on the regulation, oversight and monitoring of private military 
</p>
<p>and security companies, an enquiry and a complaint procedure and reporting mechanisms 
</p>
<p>on compliance with new norms and standards in international human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law by private military and security companies.  
</p>
<p>14. Some delegations added that international regulation must be complemented by 
</p>
<p>effective national laws and policies that would allow States to investigate and prosecute 
</p>
<p>violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. In their view, as a second 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/WGMilitary/Session4/Pakistan.pdf. </p>


<p>step, any regulatory gaps in areas such as accountability, remedies, licensing and oversight 
</p>
<p>should be filled through an international legally binding instrument that would complement 
</p>
<p>existing initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> D. General discussion 
</b></p>
<p>15. Some delegations provided an update on the Montreux Document and the 
</p>
<p>International Code of Conduct Association processes. The Montreux Document, which has 
</p>
<p>been signed by 52 States and three international organizations, applies to companies 
</p>
<p>operating during armed conflicts and recalls the existing obligations of States under 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict. The Montreux Document 
</p>
<p>Forum was formally launched on 16 December 2014. Some delegations questioned the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the Montreux Document and referred to concerns expressed in <i>Progress 
</i></p>
<p><i>and Opportunities, Five Years On: Challenges and Recommendations for Montreux 
</i></p>
<p><i>Document Endorsing States</i>.6  
</p>
<p>16. Some delegations also noted recent developments regarding the International Code 
</p>
<p>of Conduct Association, which had held its first annual plenary in December 2014. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations noted that the International Code of Conduct was aligned with the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights, and that the Association was not purely a self-
</p>
<p>regulation body, as its board was composed of States, companies and civil society. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations said that the Association could develop oversight mechanisms on certification, 
</p>
<p>monitoring and compliance. In the view of some delegations, the complementarity of the 
</p>
<p>Montreux Document and the International Code of Conduct, in addition to domestic 
</p>
<p>legislation, confirmed that there was no legal vacuum.  
</p>
<p>17. Some delegations also referred to the International Organization for Standardization 
</p>
<p>(ISO) and its new <i>Management System for Private Security Operations: Requirements with 
</i></p>
<p><i>Guidance</i> (ISO 18788),7 which was expected to be released in June 2015 and which 
</p>
<p>incorporated relevant elements of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>The new standard was a development from the <i>Management System for Quality of Private 
</i></p>
<p><i>Security Company Operations: Requirements with Guidance</i> (ANSI/ASIS PSC.1-2012). 
</p>
<p>One delegation referred to the OHCHR-led project to improve access to remedy for victims 
</p>
<p>of business-related human rights abuses, which had the potential to identify effective ways 
</p>
<p>to progress on access to remedies.  
</p>
<p><i>Developments at the national level 
</i></p>
<p>18. The United States of America highlighted that the Department of State required that 
</p>
<p>companies bidding on its worldwide protective services programme must have membership 
</p>
<p>in good standing in the International Code of Conduct Association and confirmed 
</p>
<p>compliance with PSC 1-2012. It also referred to possible criminal charges under the False 
</p>
<p>Claims Act for those private security companies which falsely stated that they were in 
</p>
<p>compliance with the required standard. The delegation further referred to the Department of 
</p>
<p>Defense&#8217;s work with the International Institute of Humanitarian Law and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on separate initiatives to assist States in the 
</p>
<p>development of rules on the use of force by private military and security companies in 
</p>
<p>support of provisions in the Montreux Document. The delegation also noted the recent 
</p>
<p>convictions of four Blackwater contractors, which demonstrated the commitment and 
</p>

</p>
<p>and-Recommendations-for-Montreux-Document-Endorsing-States. 
</p>
<p> 7 Available from www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63380. </p>


<p>ability of the United States Government to pursue and obtain justice in cases of violent 
</p>
<p>crimes committed by contractors.  
</p>
<p>19. South Africa referred to the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act No. 15 of 
</p>
<p>1998, which regulated &#8220;the rendering of foreign military assistance by South African 
</p>
<p>juristic persons, citizens, persons permanently resident within the Republic and foreign 
</p>
<p>citizens rendering such assistance from within the borders&#8221; of South Africa. It added that 
</p>
<p>while law enforcement agencies had consistently sought to look into those activities, they 
</p>
<p>had not often been successful in the light of the non-cooperation of countries where the 
</p>
<p>activities had taken place, which were often those countries involved in the Montreux 
</p>
<p>Document and International Code of Conduct processes. 
</p>
<p>20. Norway referred to the 2001 Act on private security companies operating on 
</p>
<p>Norwegian territory, which had been subject to substantive changes in 2011. The purpose 
</p>
<p>of the Act was to ensure the rights of individuals who were handled by representatives of 
</p>
<p>private security companies; a high quality of services; sufficient control and oversight over 
</p>
<p>such businesses; and that they only operate within the parameters of the Act itself. Norway 
</p>
<p>became a member of International Code of Conduct Association in early 2014 and believed 
</p>
<p>that it could be significant in ensuring that private security companies in complex 
</p>
<p>environments respected international law and in improving oversight and accountability. 
</p>
<p>21. The European Union recalled its view that private military companies and private 
</p>
<p>security companies should be addressed separately, given their very broad and diverse 
</p>
<p>range of activities. With regard to accountability and access to remedies, the European 
</p>
<p>Union recalled the existing solid provisions in the &#8220;Brussels I&#8221; regulation, as revised. The 
</p>
<p>European Union noted that States and international organizations, as clients, could enhance 
</p>
<p>standards in the operations of companies. It stated that the European Union and its member 
</p>
<p>States were determined to further consider how best to make use of the International Code 
</p>
<p>of Conduct, including in their procurement processes. It added that much had been done by 
</p>
<p>the European Union and others to implement the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, as they were instrumental in preventing and remedying abuses across 
</p>
<p>sectors, including by private military companies and private security companies. 
</p>
<p>22. Australia noted that it was a signatory to the Montreux Document, was an active 
</p>
<p>member of the International Code of Conduct Association and had participated in the 
</p>
<p>development of new standards. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade required that 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies be signatories to the Code and comply with 
</p>
<p>relevant provisions of the Montreux Document in order to provide ad hoc services. Any 
</p>
<p>international regulatory framework should focus on strengthening compliance with existing 
</p>
<p>international law and on ensuring accountability. A multifaceted approach encompassing 
</p>
<p>national legislation and international cooperation was the most effective response.  
</p>
<p>23. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland referred to its Security 
</p>
<p>Industry Authority, set up under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, which was 
</p>
<p>responsible for regulating the private security industry by, inter alia, operating a licensing 
</p>
<p>regime for individual security operatives and a voluntary approvals scheme for security 
</p>
<p>businesses. Furthermore, the International Criminal Court Act 2001 provided jurisdiction to 
</p>
<p>prosecute certain crimes committed by British nationals in or outside the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>The Department of Transport also issued interim guidance to United Kingdom flagged 
</p>
<p>ships on the use of armed guards to defend against the threat of piracy in exceptional 
</p>
<p>circumstances. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service accredited auditors for 
</p>
<p>professional standards, and was a signatory to the International Accreditation Forum 
</p>
<p>Multilateral Agreement. 
</p>
<p>24. Switzerland referred to its new federal law on private security companies, which had 
</p>
<p>been adopted in September 2013 and was expected to come into force in September 2015. </p>


<p>The law would apply to individuals and companies providing security services abroad, from 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, or who would provide, in Switzerland, services linked to security services 
</p>
<p>provided abroad. The law also applied to companies established in Switzerland that 
</p>
<p>exercised control over security companies active abroad, and prohibited certain activities 
</p>
<p>relating to direct participation in hostilities or to grave violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. The Russian Federation recalled that its legislation did not provide for the 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial activities of private military and security companies, including military 
</p>
<p>activities. Those functions could only be undertaken by State institutions. In view of global 
</p>
<p>trends, legal and political experts in the Russian Federation were discussing the advisability 
</p>
<p>of expanding the activities of private military and security companies and outsourcing some 
</p>
<p>State functions. Arguments in favour included considerations of professionalism, mobility, 
</p>
<p>effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The Russian Federation noted that any such move 
</p>
<p>would need to be carried out within existing international human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, and highlighted that challenges included the lack of State control over 
</p>
<p>those activities, the lack of remedies and the current legal norms, which were insufficient or 
</p>
<p>ineffective.  
</p>
<p>26. The Chair-Rapporteur indicated several possible points for discussion such as the 
</p>
<p>implementation of existing standards by States, including grievance procedures for victims, 
</p>
<p>cases brought against companies and their outcome. 
</p>
<p>27. The Colombian Commission of Jurists referred to general comment No. 35 of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee, in which it was noted, inter alia, that when private individuals or 
</p>
<p>entities are empowered or authorized by a State party to exercise powers of arrest or 
</p>
<p>detention, the State party remains responsible for adherence and ensuring adherence to 
</p>
<p>article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>28. The Executive Director of the International Code of Conduct Association8 provided 
</p>
<p>an update on the key governance and oversight functions of the Association, indicating that 
</p>
<p>a draft certification procedure was pending consideration by the Association&#8217;s Board of 
</p>
<p>Directors and its General Assembly. The Association anticipated that its reporting, 
</p>
<p>monitoring and assessment of performance functions would be significantly developed in 
</p>
<p>the future, and would involve extensive stakeholder outreach. The Executive Director also 
</p>
<p>noted that clients of private security companies had approached the Association to discuss 
</p>
<p>making membership in the Association a requirement in contracts with companies, as well 
</p>
<p>as an authorization criterion in national legislation (Switzerland). Some had also raised the 
</p>
<p>intention of the United States Department of State to make membership in the Association a 
</p>
<p>requirement for potential contractors involved in the Department&#8217;s worldwide protective 
</p>
<p>services programme. 
</p>
<p>29. The second meeting of the fourth session concluded with an interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>One delegation and the Chair-Rapporteur queried the ability of the International Code of 
</p>
<p>Conduct Association to ensure accountability, access to remedy and transparency in the 
</p>
<p>process of examining a complaint. The Executive Director responded that the Association 
</p>
<p>was limited by its articles of association and by the powers conferred to it by its members 
</p>
<p>(Governments, companies and civil society). He added that the Association would never be 
</p>
<p>able to supplant the role of national laws and national law enforcement bodies, but it would 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 Before giving the floor to Mr. Orsmond from the International Code of Conduct Association, the 
</p>
<p>Chair-Rapporteur recalled Human Rights Council resolutions 22/33 and 28/7, in which the Council 
</p>
<p>decided that the intergovernmental working group &#8220;shall invite experts and all relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>to participate in its work&#8221;. He also recalled that during the third session, industry representatives had 
</p>
<p>been welcome to participate in the session either as an independent stakeholder or member of a 
</p>
<p>delegation (A/HRC//WG.10/3/2, para. 12).     </p>


<p>certainly have the ability to influence the industry from a business standpoint. He 
</p>
<p>concluded that, although the Association&#8217;s grievance mechanism was not as developed as 
</p>
<p>its certification mechanism, respect of national and international law was viewed as a 
</p>
<p>fundamental responsibility.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Discussion on specific topics 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Substantive report of the Chair of the Working Group on mercenaries 
</b></p>
<p><b>as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right of peoples to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>30. In her statement on 28 April 2015, Ms. Karska said that the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>mercenaries had undertaken additional research on national laws and regulations regarding 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies in eight countries in Central America and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean, eight countries in South America and four countries in Europe (A/HRC/30/34).9 
</p>
<p>Three other reports had already been submitted to the Council.10 Its 2016 report to the 
</p>
<p>Council would address the national legislation of countries in Eastern Europe, North 
</p>
<p>America and the Pacific. Those studies had assessed existing national laws regarding 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies and their effectiveness in protecting human rights 
</p>
<p>and promoting accountability for violations, and had aimed at identifying common points, 
</p>
<p>good practices and regulatory gaps that might exist. A global analysis would be presented 
</p>
<p>to the General Assembly in 2016. 
</p>
<p>31. Ms. Karska said that the Working Group had held two expert meetings and 
</p>
<p>consulted with stakeholders, including on the use of private military and security companies 
</p>
<p>by the United Nations. Those efforts had informed the discussions of the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on a possible legally binding instrument for the regulation of such companies. Those 
</p>
<p>reflections were contained in the concept note prepared by the Working Group for 
</p>
<p>consideration at the current session of the open-ended intergovernmental working group.11 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Karska added that the concept note reflected the perspectives and experiences of 
</p>
<p>government officials, experts and civil society representatives, and was the result of 
</p>
<p>extensive consultations held by previous members of the Working Group. The first draft of 
</p>
<p>a possible convention was the basis for that reflection (see A/HRC/15/25, annex), while the 
</p>
<p>concept note was also the outcome of the ongoing research on national legislation referred 
</p>
<p>to above. Moreover, the concept note represented the commitment of the Working Group to 
</p>
<p>advancing a coherent, focused and realistic framework for the consideration of the open-
</p>
<p>ended intergovernmental working group.  
</p>
<p>33. In seeking to achieve the above, the Working Group on mercenaries had distilled its 
</p>
<p>key concerns into the following eight main points:  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama; Argentina, 
</p>
<p>Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay; and France, 
</p>
<p>Hungary, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p> 10 Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Morocco, 
</p>
<p>Senegal and Tunisia (A/HRC/27/50); China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (A/HRC/27/50); and Botswana, Ghana, the Gambia, Kenya, 
</p>
<p>Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/24/45).

<p>(a) The Working Group acknowledged that certain functions were inherent to the 
</p>
<p>State, for which it retained ultimate responsibility regardless of whether or not it outsourced 
</p>
<p>that function. Some inherent State functions might not be outsourced, namely direct 
</p>
<p>participation in hostilities in armed conflict, and detention and interrogation of prisoners of 
</p>
<p>war, as defined in the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 relative to the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Prisoners of War. The Working Group proposed that recommendations for the recognition 
</p>
<p>of different classifications of service activity be included in the draft. Those classifications 
</p>
<p>were predicated on identifying which activities increased the risk of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>when undertaken by private actors. They also addressed the gap left by the Montreux 
</p>
<p>Document, which applied solely to armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p>(b) Intergovernmental organizations, as well as States, could become party to the 
</p>
<p>convention. While that was not new, it reinforced the notion of accountability of 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental organizations and supported the growing trend of such organizations 
</p>
<p>assuming their objective international legal personality in becoming party to international 
</p>
<p>instruments; 
</p>
<p>(c) The Working Group proposed one article on implementation, bringing 
</p>
<p>together the different related articles in the first draft convention. Obligations under that 
</p>
<p>article would apply to domestic and international companies, as well as to services offered 
</p>
<p>to States and to intergovernmental, non-State and corporate clients; 
</p>
<p>(d) The Working Group offered a new definition of a licence, which would serve 
</p>
<p>as a modality for establishing and enforcing standards; 
</p>
<p>(e) The Working Group put forward one coherent article on licensing covering 
</p>
<p>five focus areas, again bringing together related elements in the first draft convention; 
</p>
<p>(f) Registration should take place as a secondary step following licensing. That 
</p>
<p>built on the registry of the first draft convention and would serve as a monitoring system of 
</p>
<p>related actors and activities; 
</p>
<p>(g) The Working Group introduced a new framework of regulation of 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. The new draft sought to strengthen accountability and extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>provisions, notably to cover the complex environments in which the security industry often 
</p>
<p>operated. The framework applied the following hierarchy of principles for establishing 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction: active person; passive person; territoriality; and universal jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>(h) The Working Group deemed it essential to establish a mechanism for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of oversight and ensuring remedy and reparations for victims. The modality, be it 
</p>
<p>a committee or ombudsperson or other modality, had not yet been determined, but any 
</p>
<p>mechanism that could regularly, efficiently and comprehensively undertake monitoring and 
</p>
<p>investigation and guarantee remedy for victims was worthy of review. 
</p>
<p>34. Ms. Karska concluded by hoping that that new formulation of key principles would 
</p>
<p>be a source of fruitful and constructive discussion among the open-ended intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group, and would build a stronger foundation for mutual consideration and shared 
</p>
<p>positions as deliberations progressed. 
</p>
<p>35. During the subsequent discussion, some delegations welcomed the concept note 
</p>
<p>prepared by the Working Group. According to one delegation, the concept note 
</p>
<p>comprehensively covered the elements that might be included in the kind of legally binding 
</p>
<p>instrument for which the open-ended intergovernmental working group had been created. It 
</p>
<p>also suggested that the Chair-Rapporteur consolidate all proposals, including the concept 
</p>
<p>note, for future deliberations and as a basis for future work. Furthermore, it expressed its 
</p>
<p>appreciation for the work of the International Code of Conduct Association and the 
</p>
<p>Government of Switzerland in relation to the Montreux Document, and said that it was time 
</p>
<p>for the intergovernmental working group to pull together all those efforts in a </p>


<p>comprehensive manner. Another delegation suggested that the draft be discussed among 
</p>
<p>Governments, and not only within an expert body. 
</p>
<p>36. One delegation pointed out that the work of the Working Group on mercenaries to 
</p>
<p>map existing legislation on private security and military companies might be undermined if 
</p>
<p>it was meant to support a pre-established position that a legally binding instrument was the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;best way to ensure adequate protection of human rights&#8221; without developing arguments 
</p>
<p>that could highlight the advantages of other options. The same delegation expressed 
</p>
<p>concern about the Working Group&#8217;s plan to further elaborate a draft convention, which 
</p>
<p>seemed to go beyond its mandate and risk complicating discussion in the intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>process. Some delegations said that they did not support the draft convention elaborated by 
</p>
<p>the Working Group, which had not met with consensus at the open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group&#8217;s first session. They recalled that the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>open-ended intergovernmental working group had been broadened (see A/HRC/22/41, 
</p>
<p>para. 77). Some delegations reiterated that a convention was not necessary, but that there 
</p>
<p>was a need to strengthen domestic laws and their implementation, as well as to see how the 
</p>
<p>International Code of Conduct and other initiatives translated into practice. One delegation 
</p>
<p>noted that the concept note was highly problematic as it took discussions back to those held 
</p>
<p>during the first session of the intergovernmental working group in 2011. The delegation 
</p>
<p>suggested that other options could be explored, including guidelines, possible plans of 
</p>
<p>action, model laws, good practices and mutual legal assistance programmes. 
</p>
<p>37. The Colombian Commission of Jurists welcomed the concept note as a good starting 
</p>
<p>point, while noting that it was linked to a new set of articles that was not yet available and 
</p>
<p>that could not, therefore, be properly commented upon.  
</p>
<p>38. In response to questions from delegations, Ms. Karska said that the Working Group 
</p>
<p>was convinced that an international convention would be the best mechanism to regulate 
</p>
<p>the issue of private military and security companies. That did not exclude other options, 
</p>
<p>including guidelines, model laws and legal assistance programmes, which in the opinion of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group were complementary. Gaps in national law still existed and the analysis 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group had not shown much progress in that regard. As such, an 
</p>
<p>international convention would be an effective mechanism for a better implementation of a 
</p>
<p>system of control. Ms. Karska highlighted that the Working Group welcomed all comments 
</p>
<p>and suggestions from States on its concept note, as it sought to finalize its proposed new 
</p>
<p>draft convention by the end of 2015. In that regard, the Chair-Rapporteur of the open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group suggested that any comments should be forwarded to the 
</p>
<p>secretariat by the end of May 2015, for transmission to the Working Group on mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>39. Delegations discussed the way forward with regard to the elaboration of possible 
</p>
<p>recommendations on the future programme of work for the open-ended intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group. Some noted that there was no consensus on any further discussion on the 
</p>
<p>draft convention elaborated by the Working Group on mercenaries and discussed by the 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group in 2011. One delegation noted its preference for the 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the session not to refer to the concept note or the possibility of a 
</p>
<p>revised draft convention, while recognizing that the report of the intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group would duly reflect what was said by all delegations and speakers. 
</p>
<p>Delegations discussed the mandate of the intergovernmental working group, which one 
</p>
<p>delegation said was to look into elaborating a new instrument, while another said that it did 
</p>
<p>not call specifically for the drafting of a legally binding treaty but rather to considering the 
</p>
<p>possibility of elaborating an international regulatory framework. One delegation mentioned 
</p>
<p>that the intergovernmental working group had not explored the range of options; instead, 
</p>
<p>there seemed to be an attempt to discuss a draft on which there was no consensus.  </p>


<p><b> B. Discussion with representative of private military and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 28 April 2015, the Director of the Security in Complex Environments Group, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gibson, indicated how responsible companies within the private security sector were 
</p>
<p>embracing standards and regulations to ensure that their operations were transparent, 
</p>
<p>accountable and compliant with international and national legislation, including human 
</p>
<p>rights law. 
</p>
<p>41. Mr. Gibson first addressed the notion of the &#8220;complex environments&#8221; in which 
</p>
<p>security companies worked. He admitted that the hitherto unregulated private security 
</p>
<p>sector had fallen short of internationally recognized standards and that not all of those 
</p>
<p>shortcomings had been addressed. However, he contended that the private security 
</p>
<p>companies with which he had engaged were demonstrably embracing standards and 
</p>
<p>regulations to ensure that they operated in an appropriate and transparent manner, and 
</p>
<p>within the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>42. As for the companies that he represented, Mr. Gibson clarified that they did not 
</p>
<p>employ mercenaries, a term he labelled emotive and implying action for financial gain. 
</p>
<p>Those companies did not conduct offensive military operations but provided a range of risk 
</p>
<p>management and protective services for their clients that were essentially defensive in 
</p>
<p>nature. He said that weapons were rarely fired and then only for self-defence. 
</p>
<p>43. Mr. Gibson proceeded with an overview of self-regulation initiatives with regard to 
</p>
<p>private security companies, including the Montreux Document and the International Code 
</p>
<p>of Conduct. He highlighted the PSC-1 standard, which had been endorsed by the 
</p>
<p>Government of the United Kingdom in 2013, and stated that British companies were being 
</p>
<p>independently audited and certified against that standard. He recalled that the standard was 
</p>
<p>expected to become fully international in 2015 and would be known as ISO 18788. He 
</p>
<p>mentioned that full members of the Security in Complex Environments Group were 
</p>
<p>required to demonstrate that they were working to achieve certification under PSC-1. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gibson also recalled the core functions of the International Code of Conduct 
</p>
<p>Association, and explained his organization&#8217;s engagement with it, including to encourage 
</p>
<p>others to develop coherent, transparent and affordable standards and oversight mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>With regard to regulations in the maritime sector, Mr. Gibson briefly outlined the most 
</p>
<p>recent developments, calling the publication of ISO 28007 in March 2015 a game changer 
</p>
<p>that offered maritime security companies a robust auditable standard. 
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Gibson acknowledged that the key to the success of those standards had been 
</p>
<p>the identification of independent third-party accreditors, who ensured that companies 
</p>
<p>claiming to comply with the standard did so fully and in an auditable fashion. The United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom Accreditation Service had accredited four certification bodies and they conducted 
</p>
<p>rigorous third-party audits of companies to certify them against PSC-1 and ISO 28007. 
</p>
<p>Those bodies, for example, had to assess how well the company&#8217;s human rights impact 
</p>
<p>assessments had been incorporated in their management processes. In support of those 
</p>
<p>international standards, the Security in Complex Environments Group had established an 
</p>
<p>enhanced vetting process, using a credible and respected national body: the Disclosure and 
</p>
<p>Barring Service. Mr. Gibson also mentioned that City and Guilds had developed a Maritime 
</p>
<p>Security Operative Qualification that encapsulated all the core competencies required by 
</p>
<p>ISO 28007, and that the United Kingdom had put in place a licence regime for the export, 
</p>
<p>control and disposal of weapons used by private security companies. 
</p>
<p>45. Mr. Gibson also highlighted some of the industry&#8217;s frustration with the 
</p>
<p>understandably cautious approach of the Government of the United Kingdom in handling 
</p>
<p>operational issues affecting the sector, including with regard to floating armouries, a feature </p>


<p>of maritime security operations in the Indian Ocean. Mr. Gibson pointed out that following 
</p>
<p>sustained engagement the British Department for Business Innovation and Skills had 
</p>
<p>announced that it would issue British trade licences authorizing the use of floating 
</p>
<p>armouries for the storage of controlled equipment, including firearms. While he described 
</p>
<p>that as a significant step, he asserted that more needed to be done to facilitate a floating 
</p>
<p>armoury operating under a United Kingdom flag. He further stated that the restrictive 
</p>
<p>nature of the firearms legislation currently prevented appropriate firearms training in the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>46. Finally, Mr. Gibson commented on the decline of Western defence spending without 
</p>
<p>a commensurate decline in political ambition, creating a strategic deficit that would have to 
</p>
<p>be filled by the private sector. Governments would have to increasingly outsource contracts 
</p>
<p>to the private sector in areas that until recently had been considered to be the exclusive 
</p>
<p>prerogative of the military. He also recalled that private security companies were in the 
</p>
<p>business of making a profit, and that it was important that the costs of increasing regulation 
</p>
<p>should not make companies uncompetitive &#8212; so as not to penalize those who wished to 
</p>
<p>comply. He emphasized that it was everyone&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that clients 
</p>
<p>understood the importance of regulation, and that the additional costs arising from it were 
</p>
<p>worth accepting.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>47. Some delegations raised questions regarding the potential of the International Code 
</p>
<p>of Conduct Association to become an effective mechanism and the consequences of non-
</p>
<p>compliance with applicable law. In his response, Mr. Gibson stated that the Association 
</p>
<p>was still in an early phase of its operationalization, and that the complex issues of 
</p>
<p>certification and oversight were still being discussed. He was confident, however, that there 
</p>
<p>was a real consensus within the Association to make it an organization with teeth. The 
</p>
<p>representative of the Association similarly recalled that it was a three-pillar organization 
</p>
<p>that also included States and civil society. There was agreement that the Association must 
</p>
<p>have effective oversight mechanisms, the ability to exclude those who did not comply and 
</p>
<p>effective grievance mechanisms also offering access to remedies. Some delegates clarified 
</p>
<p>that voluntary regulatory frameworks and recourse avenues neither replaced national 
</p>
<p>legislation and regulation, which took precedence, nor replaced criminal proceedings where 
</p>
<p>appropriate. Mr. Gibson confirmed that the majority of members were from Europe or the 
</p>
<p>United States and that the success of the initiative would depend on the ability of the 
</p>
<p>Association to reach out to other regions. The Executive Director of the Association added 
</p>
<p>that the most recent applications had come from non-Western States, indicating an 
</p>
<p>increased interest and awareness in other regions. 
</p>
<p>48. Delegations sought Mr. Gibson&#8217;s views on issues regarding the use of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies in complex environments, for example: (a)  cases where 
</p>
<p>foreign nationals had engaged in military activities and committed violations, but had 
</p>
<p>benefited from diplomatic immunity; (b) cases where private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies had been in charge of administrating detention centres and prisons; (c) cases 
</p>
<p>where private military and security companies had been hired to protect extractive 
</p>
<p>industries and had committed human rights abuses; (d) reports that floating armouries were 
</p>
<p>placed on the high seas to circumvent national regulations and control; (e) the employment 
</p>
<p>of South African citizens by private military and security companies in violation of South 
</p>
<p>African law, which made it illegal for any South African to render foreign military 
</p>
<p>assistance; and (f) the industry&#8217;s lack of denials of, or credible responses to, numerous 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights abuses committed by private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>49. In his responses, Mr. Gibson stated that the companies he represented had no 
</p>
<p>diplomatic immunity and that they, their employees and subcontractors were fully 
</p>
<p>accountable under domestic and international legislation. He confirmed that some 
</p>
<p>companies had indeed been involved in the administration of detention facilities and that </p>


<p>they should be subject to regulation and be held accountable for any abuses committed. He 
</p>
<p>also conceded that some environments were particularly problematic owing to the absence 
</p>
<p>of the rule of law. He emphasized that, in order to avoid abuses, it was critical to vet and 
</p>
<p>train employees of private security companies, but also to make clients understand that they 
</p>
<p>bore responsibility for contracting reliable companies only. 
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Gibson explained that floating armouries were placed in the Indian Ocean near 
</p>
<p>the routes of ships that required protection, and not as a way to circumvent control. He said 
</p>
<p>that those armouries fell under the jurisdiction of the flag State, but also expressed 
</p>
<p>sympathy for the view that in some of those States the regulatory frameworks were not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently robust. He refuted the suggestion that staff of maritime security companies 
</p>
<p>might find it easier to shoot first and ask questions later. He explained that companies 
</p>
<p>adhered to strict rules on the use of force that mandated proportionate and escalatory 
</p>
<p>measures, that experience had shown that the firing of warning shots was enough to deter 
</p>
<p>and avert pirate attacks, and that maritime security companies did not detain pirates. He 
</p>
<p>also stated that privately contracted armed security personnel on ships wore helmets fitted 
</p>
<p>with cameras to provide full visibility and accountability for their actions.  
</p>
<p>51. With regard to the employment of South African citizens by private military and 
</p>
<p>security companies, Mr. Gibson agreed that South Africa should receive a considered 
</p>
<p>response on why there had so far been no commitment in the context of the Montreux 
</p>
<p>Document or the International Code of Conduct not to recruit South Africans in violation of 
</p>
<p>South African law. The representative of the International Code of Conduct Association 
</p>
<p>concurred with that view. With regard to the suggestion that private security companies 
</p>
<p>were not responding to allegations of human rights abuses, Mr. Gibson said the companies 
</p>
<p>he dealt with had grievance mechanisms embedded in their business models that enabled 
</p>
<p>thorough investigations to take place following an allegation of a human rights abuse. The 
</p>
<p>industry welcomed civil society and others bringing such allegations to the fore to enhance 
</p>
<p>the transparency and accountability of those investigations. In due course, oversight 
</p>
<p>mechanisms would also be in place under the auspices of the Association.  
</p>
<p>52. One delegation described the International Code of Conduct as a gentlemen&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>agreement and the Association as a gentlemen&#8217;s association, and considered them 
</p>
<p>insufficient to protect victims of human rights abuses. Pointing out that the self-regulatory 
</p>
<p>system in the banking industry had proved insufficient, it was questioned whether self-
</p>
<p>regulation processes could be trusted and whether there was any experience with such 
</p>
<p>processes functioning satisfactorily. Mr. Gibson explained that, in his view, considerable 
</p>
<p>success had been achieved with voluntary regulation in the private security sector. In a 
</p>
<p>short time frame and with the industry as catalyst, two international standards recognized 
</p>
<p>by ISO had been developed and the Association had been created. However, Mr. Gibson 
</p>
<p>added that the industry would not be opposed to an international legally binding instrument, 
</p>
<p>with the critical proviso that it must create a genuinely level playing field at the global 
</p>
<p>level. If that were achieved, the industry would be fully supportive. Some delegations 
</p>
<p>commended Mr. Gibson for that statement, recalling their view that a global and binding 
</p>
<p>convention laying out the minimum standards was necessary. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Specificities of regulating sea-based private security activities 
</b></p>
<p>53. On 29 April 2015, senior researcher in international law at the University of Pretoria 
</p>
<p>Mr. Casey-Maslen presented some of the issues regarding the use of force by private 
</p>
<p>maritime security service providers, in particular with respect to counter-piracy operations 
</p>
<p>and how they might affect the possible international regulatory framework governing 
</p>
<p>private security companies. While the Security Council, in its resolution 1851 (2008), 
</p>
<p>referred to &#8220;applicable international humanitarian law&#8221;, counter-piracy operations and </p>


<p>measures were undertaken not within the realm of the law of armed conflict, but under 
</p>
<p>international law of law enforcement, which combined international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>general principles of domestic criminal law with international criminal justice standards. 
</p>
<p>54. The use of armed private security providers to protect commercial shipping had 
</p>
<p>increased in recent years, and had been an important factor in reducing the number of 
</p>
<p>successful acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Bringing weapons on board a vessel had 
</p>
<p>its own risks, in terms of physical security to crew members and respect for a State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligations under international law on the transfer of conventional weapons and in terms of 
</p>
<p>the risk of reckless and excessive use of force, including lethal force, by personnel in an 
</p>
<p>environment where effective monitoring and oversight were exceptionally hard to ensure. 
</p>
<p>55. Mr. Casey-Maslen noted that, in carrying out their duties, State law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials were required to use force only when necessary and to employ only such force as 
</p>
<p>was necessary in the circumstances and proportionate to the threat.12 Lawful use of force by 
</p>
<p>private maritime security service providers was limited to acts carried out in defence of any 
</p>
<p>person from unlawful violence. That might encompass lawful acts involving use of force 
</p>
<p>when under imminent threat of attack, either in self-defence or in defence of others. The 
</p>
<p>determination of whether any particular use of force in the maritime environment met the 
</p>
<p>legal criteria might be contentious given the lack of detailed guidance at the domestic level 
</p>
<p>on what was and was not lawful; materially differing domestic criminal law thresholds for 
</p>
<p>justified use of force in self-defence; and a lack of consensus as to which national law 
</p>
<p>should determine legality. 
</p>
<p>56. Mr. Casey-Maslen undertook a review of selected national jurisdictions and 
</p>
<p>standards, including the 2012 interim guidance of the International Maritime Organization 
</p>
<p>(IMO).13 He also referred to the case before an Indian court in which two Italian marines 
</p>
<p>had allegedly opened fire on a vessel, killing two Indian fishermen on board; the trial of the 
</p>
<p>two marines had recently been postponed to July 2015.  
</p>
<p>57. Mr. Casey-Maslen noted that a detailed code on use of force in the maritime 
</p>
<p>environment was lacking and that that lacuna could not be filled in the proposed 
</p>
<p>international regulatory framework. He also referred to the guidelines elaborated by the 
</p>
<p>Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights in 2012.14  
</p>
<p>58. He noted that the core law enforcement function of arrest, and a concomitant power 
</p>
<p>to use force in order to effect a lawful arrest involving use of force, were functions inherent 
</p>
<p>to the State. He added that, to some extent, those powers were delegated in the maritime 
</p>
<p>environment. Whether or not private security service providers had been granted those 
</p>
<p>powers, they might need to use them, leading to concerns about treatment of suspected 
</p>
<p>pirates in detention and respect for the fundamental right to habeas corpus. 
</p>
<p>59. Finally, as recognized by the Security Council in its resolution 2184 (2014), the 
</p>
<p>solution to the problem of piracy lay on land rather than at sea. Mr. Casey-Maslen 
</p>
<p>concluded that, in the meantime, use of armed private security service providers looked 
</p>
<p>likely to continue, with all the risks that that entailed. 
</p>
<p>60. One delegation noted that it was essential to acknowledge the work undertaken by 
</p>
<p>IMO and that the Human Rights Council should not duplicate the work done by IMO. 
</p>
<p>Another delegation underlined the primary role of IMO in the context of sea-based 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See principle 9 of the 1990 Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement

<p>activities of private military and security companies and stressed the relevance of the 2012 
</p>
<p>IMO interim guidance in that regard. Some delegations requested further information about 
</p>
<p>the IMO interim guidance and its implementation. A delegation and the Chair-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>expressed regret at the absence of IMO at that session. The Chair-Rapporteur confirmed 
</p>
<p>that he would continue to invite IMO to cooperate with the open-ended intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group and provide any information relevant to its work. He also encouraged 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to provide relevant information on that issue for the consideration of the 
</p>
<p>working group. He noted that the working group was particularly concerned with 
</p>
<p>accountability and ensuring remedies for victims of human rights abuses and sought 
</p>
<p>clarification on any cases involving such issues, including evidentiary issues of incidents at 
</p>
<p>sea. 
</p>
<p>61. One delegation asked about the phenomenon of &#8220;floating arsenals&#8221; located outside 
</p>
<p>territorial waters, which by their name pointed possibly to a type of unofficial warship. It 
</p>
<p>also described the situation by which armed merchant ships would sail into territorial 
</p>
<p>waters and be granted temporary firearms permits; once that system was implemented, the 
</p>
<p>ships stopped entering the waters and instead were floating arsenals outside those waters. 
</p>
<p>The same delegation asked how the challenges with regard to the flag State (in situations 
</p>
<p>where flags of convenience were used) could be addressed. Some delegations requested 
</p>
<p>information about trends in piracy and which parts of the world were affected. One 
</p>
<p>delegation queried how national legislation could address the extraterritorial nature of 
</p>
<p>companies in that sector in the absence of a legally binding instrument. Another delegation 
</p>
<p>acknowledged other processes such as the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of 
</p>
<p>Somalia. 
</p>
<p>62. In response to a suggestion to use the terms &#8220;floating armoury&#8221; or &#8220;floating safe&#8221; 
</p>
<p>instead of the term &#8220;floating arsenal&#8221;, Mr. Casey-Maslen agreed that such terms might be 
</p>
<p>more appropriate and he acknowledged the risks associated with using them. He clarified 
</p>
<p>that they had been created as an attempt to address the problem of weapons being thrown 
</p>
<p>overboard, when vessels sought to enter ports in States that did not allow weapons to be 
</p>
<p>brought into their territorial waters. He also acknowledged the challenges associated with 
</p>
<p>flags of convenience and with vessels that did not fly a flag, and pointed out that the 
</p>
<p>general principle of the duty of the flag State15 might need to be considered in terms of the 
</p>
<p>reality of counter-piracy operations. Mr. Casey-Maslen further questioned the credentials of 
</p>
<p>some of the companies that undertook armed security services. He noted that the IMO 
</p>
<p>interim guidance was widely referred to, while he considered that it did not go into enough 
</p>
<p>detail with regard to when the use of force would be lawful. He referred to the ongoing case 
</p>
<p>in India and the questions regarding the limits of self-defence.  
</p>
<p>63. Mr. Casey-Maslen noted that the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia 
</p>
<p>had encouraged the adoption of laws to allow for prosecutions in the light of the practice of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;capture and release&#8221;. He clarified that the guidelines of the Geneva Academy of 
</p>
<p>International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights had been developed as a contribution to 
</p>
<p>the debate, and noted that existing guidance by States was not sufficiently detailed with 
</p>
<p>regard to self-defence. Demand for armed security services had been driven by a perception 
</p>
<p>of a very real risk, especially in the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Guinea and the South China 
</p>
<p>Sea, and he pointed to IMO reports on piracy for further details.16 The crime of piracy was a 
</p>
<p>domestic crime, while domestic legislation could encourage States to exercise jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>on the high seas. The United Kingdom clarified that it had moved to address the crime of 
</p>
<p>piracy and that the United Kingdom interim guidance was intended for use of British 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

<p>flagships, and not for jurisdiction over other ships. Finally, Mr. Casey-Maslen noted that 
</p>
<p>evidentiary issues and ensuring the respect for the fundamental right to habeas corpus on 
</p>
<p>vessels were a challenge. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway provided further details of its national legislation and regulations. The use 
</p>
<p>of private security companies on board ships registered in Norway was not regulated by the 
</p>
<p>act on private security companies, but by Regulation 972/2004 on Ship Security. Particular 
</p>
<p>rules governing shipowners&#8217; use of private security companies were included in the 
</p>
<p>regulation in 2011. The regulation did not provide requirements directed towards the 
</p>
<p>security companies themselves. Rather, it addressed the responsibilities of shipowners of 
</p>
<p>informing Norwegian authorities when and why use of private security services were 
</p>
<p>required; providing an assessment of the company in question including its internal 
</p>
<p>recruitment and training procedures; and its regulations on use of arms. Shipowners were 
</p>
<p>required to emphasize IMO guidelines in the selection and use of private security guards on 
</p>
<p>board. Norwegian authorities had the competency to decide that certain private security 
</p>
<p>companies might not be used by Norwegian shipowners. The regulation also stipulated 
</p>
<p>when armed guards might be used; how weapons were to be stored on board; and 
</p>
<p>procedures for the use of armed weapons. In 2011, Regulation 904/2009 Relative to Arms 
</p>
<p>was supplemented with a provision regulating the circumstances under which ships 
</p>
<p>registered in Norway might store arms on board on behalf of private security companies. 
</p>
<p>Such storage was only allowed for the objective of protecting the ship against acts of terror 
</p>
<p>or piracy, and required permission granted by Norwegian police. Only ships certified under 
</p>
<p>the International Ship and Port Facility Security-regulations of IMO might be granted such 
</p>
<p>permission, and the permission was only valid when sailing in, to or from certain 
</p>
<p>geographic areas. That regulation was also followed by reporting requirements, in line with 
</p>
<p>IMO guidelines, including to the Norwegian National Criminal Investigation Service if 
</p>
<p>there was reason to believe that the use of force had resulted in personal injury or death. 
</p>
<p>Whenever arms had been used, that had to be reported to the Maritime Directorate. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Use of private security companies by the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 29 April 2015, the Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security outlined the 
</p>
<p>main features of the current global security context. He referred to a recent report on the 
</p>
<p>safety and security of humanitarian personnel and protection of United Nations personnel 
</p>
<p>(A/69/406), according to which personnel served in increasingly dangerous environments 
</p>
<p>and encountered a variety of threats not previously encountered. He added that the existing 
</p>
<p>threat had been aggravated by the blurring of the lines between criminal and extremist 
</p>
<p>groups, the expansion of the latter and the emergence of new extremist groups. Against that 
</p>
<p>background, the United Nations had engaged armed private security companies in selected 
</p>
<p>duty stations as a last resort, in an effort to strengthen the safety and security of its 
</p>
<p>personnel and to enable the Organization to deliver its programmes and mandates in high-
</p>
<p>risk environments. That was particularly true in high-risk areas where peacekeeping forces 
</p>
<p>had yet to be deployed and where critical political or humanitarian needs existed. To date, 
</p>
<p>the United Nations had contracted armed private security services in three countries where 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping and political missions had been established (Afghanistan, Haiti and Somalia) 
</p>
<p>out of the more than 170 countries in which the United Nations maintained a presence.  
</p>
<p>66. The Under-Secretary-General stressed that the &#8220;last resort principle&#8221; guided the 
</p>
<p>United Nations as to when it might be appropriate to seek out armed private security 
</p>
<p>services. He added that armed private security services were engaged exceptionally, when 
</p>
<p>other options, namely security services by the host Government and other Member States </p>


<p>were not provided for or, alternatively, when security professionals and officers from 
</p>
<p>within the United Nations system were unavailable. The principle was articulated in the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Policy on Armed Private Security Companies,17 which clarified the roles 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities for recommending and approving the use of specific companies; and 
</p>
<p>outlined specific selection criteria, along with screening and training requirements for 
</p>
<p>contracted personnel. It also covered roles and responsibilities with respect to management 
</p>
<p>and oversight.  
</p>
<p>67. The above-mentioned United Nations policy was accompanied by Guidelines on the 
</p>
<p>Use of Armed Security Services from Private Security Companies,18 which further 
</p>
<p>specified roles and responsibilities for determining when it might be appropriate to obtain 
</p>
<p>armed private security services. They set forth specific criteria for recommending the use of 
</p>
<p>specific armed private security companies, based on the latest security risk assessment, 
</p>
<p>while identifying the types of services that might or might not be contracted out to such 
</p>
<p>companies. The Guidelines also provided further details, including on screening and 
</p>
<p>training requirements of contracted personnel. 
</p>
<p>68. The Under-Secretary-General recalled that respect for international human rights 
</p>
<p>law and international humanitarian law was among the core values of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>including the Department of Safety and Security. It took all measures in that regard, 
</p>
<p>including collaborating with other United Nations departments, offices as well as agencies, 
</p>
<p>funds and programmes on various policies, procedures, standards and other arrangements, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the Human Rights Up Front initiative. That initiative aimed to 
</p>
<p>mainstream human rights considerations in all United Nations activities and programmes 
</p>
<p>and foster engagement with Member States on human rights issues. The United Nations 
</p>
<p>Security Management System Policy Manual and related guidelines sought to contract only 
</p>
<p>with those armed private security companies with the highest standards of integrity, 
</p>
<p>competence and performance in line with internationally accepted human rights standards 
</p>
<p>and principles, while barring contracts with those convicted or implicated in human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses or criminal offences. At the same time, the most efficient way of ensuring that 
</p>
<p>international human rights and humanitarian principles were adhered to was to properly 
</p>
<p>implement such a policy and its guidelines.  
</p>
<p>69. The Under-Secretary-General congratulated the Working Group on mercenaries on 
</p>
<p>the comprehensive nature of its report to the General Assembly (A/69/338) and expressed 
</p>
<p>sincere appreciation for the opportunity to express views on its content. He referred to the 
</p>
<p>measures undertaken pursuant to one of the report&#8217;s recommendations, namely to extend 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Security Management System Policy Manual to unarmed private 
</p>
<p>security companies. In line with that recommendation, the Inter-Agency Security 
</p>
<p>Management Network recognized the importance of further clarifying the United Nations 
</p>
<p>position on the use of unarmed private security companies, and thus endorsed the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a working group on the subject. In March 2015, the unarmed private 
</p>
<p>security services working group had been formally established, had agreed upon its terms 
</p>
<p>of reference and taken initial steps in determining the need for a separate policy and related 
</p>
<p>guidelines relating to the use of unarmed private security services.  
</p>
<p>70. The Under-Secretary-General pointed out that there was arguably more to be done in 
</p>
<p>terms of how the existing United Nations Security Management System Policy Manual and 
</p>
<p>related Guidelines were implemented at the operational and tactical levels. In that regard, 
</p>

</p>

<p>one of the greatest challenges was to ensure that the contracted private security companies 
</p>
<p>had adequate internal oversight and accountability mechanisms, including complaint and 
</p>
<p>performance reporting mechanisms, as recommended by the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>mercenaries. Given current resource constraints, the United Nations had yet to allocate 
</p>
<p>additional resources for establishing external monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure the 
</p>
<p>proper execution of a given contract, and accountability of contracted companies and 
</p>
<p>personnel with respect to improper or unlawful conduct. He also noted that, at the policy 
</p>
<p>level, the main gap lay in the lack of an international normative framework on the use of 
</p>
<p>private security companies, whether armed or unarmed. He stated that that issue could not 
</p>
<p>be addressed by a single or even multiple international organizations. Key actors &#8212; 
</p>
<p>including States in which private security companies were based or operated and the private 
</p>
<p>armed security companies themselves &#8212; must also be involved in a formal process 
</p>
<p>whereby a common and internationally agreed upon normative framework could be 
</p>
<p>established.   
</p>
<p>71. In the discussion that followed, delegations raised questions about: (a) the number of 
</p>
<p>countries in which the United Nations had engaged unarmed private security companies; 
</p>
<p>(b) the involvement of private security companies in peacekeeping operations and whether 
</p>
<p>any further increase in their involvement could be anticipated in the light of their greater 
</p>
<p>use by States; and (c) whether there was a risk that companies contracted by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations would participate directly as combatants or might be involved in interrogation or 
</p>
<p>detention of prisoners of war. 
</p>
<p>72. The Under-Secretary-General replied that currently the United Nations employed 
</p>
<p>unarmed security companies in 10 missions of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, 
</p>
<p>in 11 special political missions and in its support bases in Kenya and Spain, among others. 
</p>
<p>He expressed the hope that there would be no need to increase their use, while noting the 
</p>
<p>security and safety situation in which the United Nations operated. Such a decision was not 
</p>
<p>taken lightly and would be a matter of last resort on the basis of security risk assessment 
</p>
<p>and on the advice of the security team in the mission concerned. Finally, the Under-
</p>
<p>Secretary-General confirmed that private security companies employed by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations neither participated directly as combatants nor were they involved in interrogation 
</p>
<p>or detention of prisoners of war. The principal role of private security companies was the 
</p>
<p>protection of United Nations personnel, premises and assets.  
</p>
<p>73. One delegation noted that while States might have different views on contracting 
</p>
<p>private security companies, all States were part of the United Nations and probably 
</p>
<p>recognized that their use by the Organization had become a practice, if not a necessity, for 
</p>
<p>it to operate in certain situations. With reference to oversight and accountability, the 
</p>
<p>delegation asked for further information on instances in which the United Nations had been 
</p>
<p>called upon to take steps to prevent abuses and facilitate access to remedy.  
</p>
<p>74. In his response, the Under-Secretary-General reiterated that all measures were taken 
</p>
<p>to ensure that international humanitarian law and human rights law were observed. Since 
</p>
<p>his appointment and in the prior handover period, no abuses had been brought to light. 
</p>
<p>There was a monthly review and Department of Safety and Security personnel had day-to-
</p>
<p>day responsibility for oversight. Furthermore, the process of recruitment was stringent and 
</p>
<p>designed to minimize all abuses. Should any abuses occur, they were brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Under-Secretary-General.  
</p>
<p>75. The Chair-Rapporteur enquired about the possibility of sharing United Nations 
</p>
<p>experience in using unarmed security companies, and its detailed standards and guidelines, 
</p>
<p>as a basis for discussion and possible use by States. He also queried the extent to which, 
</p>
<p>and under what conditions, national contingents of peacekeeping missions were allowed to 
</p>
<p>use private military and security companies. One delegation asked about the security 
</p>
<p>situation facing other humanitarian actors, and what collaboration the United Nations had </p>


<p>with actors in challenging security environments. In response, the Under-Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>mentioned close collaboration with States and referred to a colloquium in June 2015 to 
</p>
<p>share experiences, including on delivery of security. He also clarified that the United 
</p>
<p>Nations employed private security companies and not private military companies. Finally, 
</p>
<p>he pointed out that the United Nations collaborated with international non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations in complex and challenging security environments, including in the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic and Yemen. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>On 1 May 2015, the Chair-Rapporteur thanked the delegations and expressed 
</b></p>
<p><b>gratitude to the experts for their excellent contributions. He mentioned the increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of private military and security companies in various sectors and contexts, both on 
</b></p>
<p><b>land and at sea. Specific challenges discussed included: jurisdiction issues linked to 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;flags of convenience&#8221;; weapons storage in the context of &#8220;floating armouries&#8221; in 
</p>
<p><b>international waters, including possible circumvention of national laws limiting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>import and export of weapons; ensuring that private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p><b>respected applicable national legislation; and challenges relating to international 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation in legal matters, in particular mutual legal assistance.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Chair-Rapporteur suggested that the open-ended intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>working group consider including the following text as part of its conclusions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>[Paragraph 1] The intergovernmental working group noted the multifaceted 
</b></p>
<p><b>and diverse issues raised throughout its third and fourth sessions. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>included: the distinction between the activities of private military companies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and private security companies; measures for registering, licensing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>contracting private military and security companies; ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>and provision of assistance and remedies for victims; possibility of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>international regulatory framework; specificities of regulating sea-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>private security activities; and the use of private security companies by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations. The intergovernmental working group noted the initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken by various stakeholders relating to those issues, while highlighting 
</b></p>
<p><b>the challenges that remain.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>[Paragraph 2] Different views were offered as to how to achieve the shared goal 
</b></p>
<p><b>of protecting human rights and ensuring accountability for violations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses relating to the activities of private military and security companies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Some delegations proposed that the intergovernmental working group begin 
</b></p>
<p><b>elaborating a legally binding instrument for the regulation, monitoring and 
</b></p>
<p><b>oversight of private military and security companies, and submitted elements of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a draft convention for the consideration of the intergovernmental working 
</b></p>
<p><b>group. Other delegations proposed the consideration of the range of options to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be explored to further develop an international regulatory framework, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including international standards setting and development of guidelines, 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibly actions plans or model laws, contract templates based on the Montreux 
</b></p>
<p><b>Document, good practices and mutual legal assistance programmes.</b>  
</p>
<p><b>[Paragraph 3]</b> <b>Taking account of Human Rights Council resolution 28/7 of 26 
</b></p>
<p><b>March 2015, the intergovernmental working group will continue its work on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the above-mentioned issues and also recommends further consideration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights issues relating to, inter alia, (a) the operation of private military 
</b></p>
<p><b>and security companies in the maritime context; (b) the use of private military </b></p>


<p><b>and security companies by humanitarian actors; and (c) access to justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies for victims of violations and abuses linked to the activities of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>military and security companies.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Chair-Rapporteur regretted that, despite the approval expressed by some 
</b></p>
<p><b>delegations, the second and third paragraphs had not found consensus. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The concluding remarks of the European Union and the African Group are 
</b></p>
<p><b>reproduced, in annex II and III respectively, in the language of submission only.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The open-ended intergovernmental working group noted the multifaceted and

<p><b>  Concluding remarks by the European Union 
</b></p>
<p>The European Union would like to thank the Chair and the Secretariat for the work in 
</p>
<p>preparation of this session and during the session.  
</p>
<p>The European Union believes that private security companies need to respect international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>The European Union has actively and constructively engaged in the discussion of this 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group over the past four years. Several presentations during this 
</p>
<p>session were particularly informative and confirm that this industry is complex, and 
</p>
<p>evolving. The presentations also confirm that many steps have already been taken to 
</p>
<p>prevent abuses, and provide remedy when abuses occur. A range of obligations for States 
</p>
<p>already exists, as well as several processes to set new standards, to elaborate concrete 
</p>
<p>guidance for specific sectors, and to ensure oversight and accountability.  
</p>
<p>The discussion confirmed the specificities of regulating sea-based private security activities 
</p>
<p>and the need to look into progress made in other fora. It is particular important not to 
</p>
<p>duplicate the work carried by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). IMO has a 
</p>
<p>leading role on this issue. 
</p>
<p>The European Union is prepared to consider other options, and has come forward with a set 
</p>
<p>of possible action oriented recommendations to ensure that this intergovernmental working 
</p>
<p>group can progress in its deliberations. The European Union would like to share with the 
</p>
<p>plenary its proposed recommendations, as circulated on the third day of this session and 
</p>
<p>presented during the informal consultations on the fourth day :  
</p>
<p>In view of the substantive discussions held during the past sessions of the open-
</p>
<p>ended inter-governmental working group, and in light of the complexities of the 
</p>
<p>issues, it recommends to the Human Rights Council the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Continuation of the substantive discussions in the intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group with the participation of experts and all relevant stakeholders to take 
</p>
<p>stock of progress at the national and international levels &#8212; including in widening 
</p>
<p>the support to the Montreux Document and its Forum, and the development of the 
</p>
<p>International Code of Conduct Association &#8212; regarding the regulation, monitoring 
</p>
<p>and oversight of the activities of Private Military Companies and Private Security 
</p>
<p>Companies; 
</p>
<p>(b) Review the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, with particular emphasis on the third pillar regarding access to 
</p>
<p>remedies, in the case of the activities carried out by private military companies and 
</p>
<p>private security companies; 
</p>
<p>(c) Consideration of the range of options to be explored to further develop 
</p>
<p>an international regulatory framework, including international standards setting, 
</p>
<p>development of guidelines, possibly actions plans or model laws, contract templates 
</p>
<p>based on the Montreux Document, good practices and mutual legal assistance 
</p>
<p>programmes; </p>


<p>(d) Consideration of the tasking of a high-level group of legal experts/the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a 
</p>
<p>document for consideration at the fifth session to outline the modalities for each 
</p>
<p>possible option, drawing when possible on past experience.  
</p>
<p>The European Union showed willingness to work on a compromise which would have 
</p>
<p>allowed this intergovernmental working group to agree on a set of solid and action oriented 
</p>
<p>recommendations. The European Union would like to thank delegations from across 
</p>
<p>regions who offered compromise language, and regrets that other delegations insisted on 
</p>
<p>language which clearly would never allow for consensus. The European Union further 
</p>
<p>regrets that some delegations called inter alia for the deletion of the paragraph referring to 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and in 
</p>
<p>particular to the third pillar on access to remedies. The European Union is committed to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and hopes that all 
</p>
<p>States are also committed to their implementation.  
</p>
<p>Finally, the European Union would like to refer to the important role of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and human rights defenders who are actively engaged in this area of work.  
</p>
<p>I thank you Mr. Chair. 
</p>

<p><b>  Annex III

<p><b>  D&#233;claration et observations finales du Groupe africain 
</b></p>
<p>Le Groupe africain regrette que le Groupe de travail ne soit pas parvenu au consensus eu 
</p>
<p>&#233;gard &#224; l&#8217;importance de cette question et le Groupe africain regrette qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y ait pas eu de 
</p>
<p>consensus au cours de cette session. 
</p>
<p>Le Groupe africain souhaiterait encore une fois r&#233;it&#233;rer l&#8217;importance qu&#8217;il attache au 
</p>
<p>mandat de ce groupe de travail qui selon le Groupe doit se focaliser sur l&#8217;&#233;laboration d&#8217;un 
</p>
<p>instrument international &#224; caract&#232;re contraignant. La n&#233;cessit&#233; et l&#8217;opportunit&#233; et les 
</p>
<p>&#233;l&#233;ments qui peuvent constituer ledit instrument ont fait &#224; notre avis l&#8217;objet de pr&#233;sentations 
</p>
<p>d&#233;taill&#233;es au cours de la semaine &#233;coul&#233;e ainsi qu&#8217;au cours des sessions pr&#233;c&#233;dentes. A ce 
</p>
<p>titre, le Groupe de travail sur l&#8217;utilisation de mercenaires comme moyen de violer les droits 
</p>
<p>de l&#8217;homme et d&#8217;emp&#234;cher l&#8217;exercice du droit des peuples &#224; disposer d'eux-m&#234;mes a &#233;t&#233; 
</p>
<p>explicite &#224; ce sujet et ce, en soulignant que la mani&#232;re la plus efficiente d&#8217;adresser cette 
</p>
<p>question devrait se faire par le biais d&#8217;un instrument international &#224; caract&#232;re contraignant. 
</p>
<p>Cela permettrait sans nul doute de prendre en charge les violations des droits de l&#8217;homme et 
</p>
<p>la question de reddition de comptes. 
</p>
<p>Le repr&#233;sentant [des soci&#233;t&#233;s de s&#233;curit&#233; priv&#233;es] a mis en avant clairement l&#8217;opportunit&#233; 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;laborer un instrument international &#224; caract&#232;re contraignant. Le repr&#233;sentant des Nations 
</p>
<p>Unies &#233;galement n&#8217;a pas fait d&#8217;intervention qui &#233;tait contraire &#224; l&#8217;opportunit&#233; de travailler 
</p>
<p>sur un instrument. Je pense que cela a &#233;t&#233; dit au cours de nos diff&#233;rentes discussions qui se 
</p>
<p>sont tenues dans le cadre de ce groupe de travail aussi bien de la part du Groupe africain 
</p>
<p>que de la part d&#8217;un certain nombre de d&#233;l&#233;gations. 
</p>
<p>Pour le Groupe africain, nous appelons ce groupe de travail &#224; poursuivre ses travaux dans le 
</p>
<p>cadre du mandat qui a &#233;t&#233; mis en place et qui consiste en l&#8217;&#233;laboration d&#8217;un instrument 
</p>
<p>international &#224; caract&#232;re contraignant.
