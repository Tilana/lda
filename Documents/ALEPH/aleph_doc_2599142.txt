SUMMARY
The  Granduc  deposit,  located  40  km  northwest  of  Stewart  in  northwestern  British 
Columbia (Fig. 1), is a copper-rich syngenetic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit 
hosted in strongly deformed volcanic, chemical, and clastic sedimentary rocks.
The  Granduc  Property  (the  “Property”)  is  100%  owned  by  Bell  Copper  Corporation 
(“Bell  Copper”),  and  is  under  a  binding  Letter  of  Intent  to  be  Optioned  by  Castle 
Resources  Inc.  (“Castle”).  The  Property  consists  of  a  central  parcel  of  64  Crown 
Granted mineral claims, comprising 1090.97 hectares and 38 MCX mineral tenures, 
comprising 12,422.90 ha.
Rocks mapped on Granduc mountain and to the north are separated into two easily 
recognizable geological successions (Figs. 5,6,7): Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle 
Jurassic  age  successions, termed  in  earlier  studies  the western  and eastern  series, 
respectively. The Triassic and Jurassic successions are separated on the Property by 
the north-northwest striking South Unuk shear zone (Figure 5; Lewis, 1994).
The Late Triassic or older strata are correlated with the Stuhini Group. They consist 
of  moderately  to  highly  foliated  schists,  phyllites,  marbles  and  gneisses.  North  of 
Granduc  mountain  and  the  North  Leduc  glacier,  Late  Triassic  rocks  are  subdivided 
into six lithological rock types; similar rock types on Granduc mountain (units 1-8) 
have  been  described  by  Klepacki  and  Read  (1981)  and  include  the  Granduc  Mine 
series  (McGuigan  and  Tucker,  1981).  U-Pb  analyses  of  zircons  collected  from  the 
western series mafic volcanic rocks (North Zone) are 230.5 + 14 Ma (Childe, 1994). 
An intermediate sill that intrudes the mafic volcanics has an identical age within error 
of 232 + 3 Ma.
The Lower to Middle Jurassic age eastern series rocks are correlated with the Lower 
to  Middle  Jurassic  Hazelton  Group.  They  consist  of  relatively  undeformed,  mainly 
volcanic  rocks  that  are  subdivided  into  three  conformable  stratigraphic  units  (units 
15-17). U-Pb analysis of zircon from dacitic tuffs (unit 16) north of the North Leduc 
glacier returned a date of 186.8 + 9 Ma. An identical age within error of 185.4 + 9 
Ma  was  obtained  from  a  felsic  lapilli  tuff  approximately  7  km  to  the  south  (Childe, 
1994). This unit is similar in age to felsic units in the footwall of the precious metal 
rich  Eskay  Creek  massive  sulphide  deposit  (Bartsch,  1993)  and  correlate  with  the 
Betty Creek formation.
The  South Unuk  shear  zone  is  a north-northwest  striking  subvertical  fault  that  has 
dominantly a sinistral sense of displacement; it is mapped from the Iskut river area 
south  to  Granduc  mountain,  a  distance  of  60  km  (Lewis,  1994).  The  shear  zone 
terminates at the contact with the younger Coast Range intrusive suite lying south of 
the Property.
On  Granduc  mountain,  and  to  the  north  (Divelbliss,  Duke  and  North  Leduc  areas), 
Late  Triassic  rocks  record  strongly  heterogeneous  deformation  with  a  large 
component of simple shear in a ductile to semi-brittle environment; these features 
indicate  western  series  rocks  should  be  included  as  part  of  the  shear  zone  (Lewis, 
1994).  The  linear  associated  with  the  South  Unuk  shear  zone  north  of  the  North 
Leduc glacier is on trend with the HKF fault mapped by McGuigan and Marr (1979).
1
The HKF fault is a north-northwest striking steeply dipping fault; locally, a ultramafic 
horizon of dunite, talc-chlorite schist and chlorite-serpentine schist occurs along the 
fault.
The  first  two  phases  of  deformation  are  the  most  intense  and  affected  the 
distribution of ore bodies underground in the Granduc Mine. Lewis (1994) attributes 
F1 and F2 folds on Granduc mountain to progressive deformation associated with the 
South  Unuk  shear zone.  This  new interpretation  is  significant because  according  to 
Lewis (1994) a major F1 fold is unlikely, and its postulated occurrence should not be 
used to guide exploration.
A limited lithogeochemical study of mainly western series rocks from the North Zone 
(Figs. 6,7; Granduc mountain) indicates the volcanic rocks are mainly mafic with a 
tholeiitic magma affinity (Barrett, 1994). These rocks are most like mid-ocean ridge 
or  marginal  basin  basalts  (Wilson,  1989).  However,  the  slightly  enriched  LILE  and 
gentle negative REE pattern suggests some crustal contamination from a subduction 
zone. Rocks logged as 'cherty tuff' or 'dacitic tuff' have REE patterns similar to that 
of the mafic volcanic rocks indicating they are not dacitic in composition as logged in 
the  field.  A  ‘mafic’  sill  (field  term)  within  the  Footwall  series  rocks  is  chemically 
intermediate in composition and has a similar, but elevated REE pattern compared to 
the  mafic  volcanics.  The  similar  REE  element  chemistry  and  the  identical  U-Pb 
(zircon)  dates  from  these  units  suggest  they  are  genetically  related.  The 
intermediate sill is similar in composition and age to the Bucke Glacier stock and is 
tentatively correlated with this suite of intrusions.
Lead  (galena  and  microcline)  isotope  analysis  of two samples  from  the  B  ore body 
indicate  the  lead  is  relatively  non-radiogenic,  and  compared  to  mineralization  of 
known age within Stikinia, indicates a pre-Jurassic age (Childe, 1994).
Total  mineral  resources  for  the  Granduc  mine  were  historically  reported  as  an  “in-
situ”  estimate  of  grades  and  tonnages  with  no  allowance  for  grade  dilution  or 
recoverable  tonnages  during  mining  (Schmidt,  et  al  1983).  During  the  life  of  the 
Granduc  mine,  mineral  resource  estimates  depended  on  closely  spaced  diamond-
drilling sections and sampling of drifts and crosscuts.
Although current practice would regard the historical mineral resource information as 
an  “Indicated  Mineral  Resource”  under  the  definitions  presented  by  the  Canadian 
Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and  Petroleum,  as  the  CIM  Standards  on  Mineral 
Resources  and  Reserves  Definitions  and  Guidelines  adopted  by  CIM  Council  on 
August 20, 2000, those resources were not suitable to be termed such in this report, 
due to a lack of necessary verification by the authors. These historical estimates are 
relevant  only  as  geological  information  for  the  purposes  of  targeting  future 
exploration.
The total historic mineral estimate prepared by Newmont, in 1966, for in-situ mineral 
resources  above  the  1600  level,  was  39,442,403  tonnes  grading  1.73%  copper 
(Schmidt,  et  al  1983).  Low  copper  prices  forced  the  closure  of  the  mine  and 
demolition  of  the  mill  facilities  in  1985.  Prior  to  the  closure  of  the  mine,  the 
remaining in-situ resources were estimated to be 5,083,178 tonnes, grading 1.84% 
copper,  not  including  the  copper-rich  massive  sulphide  mineralization  in  the  North 
Zone  (Schmidt,  et  al  1983).  The  reader  of  this  report  cannot  depend  on  these
2
historical  mineral  resource  estimates  to  conform  to  the  standards  of  NI  43-101. 
Furthermore, the reader is cautioned not to rely upon these historic mineral resource 
estimates. They are considered geological information only.
The  Property  contains  mafic  to  intermediate  volcanic  rocks  within  a  clastic 
sedimentary succession of Upper Triassic age. The Granduc deposits (Figs. 6,7), are 
aerially extensive Besshi-type copper-silver volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits.
The  focus  on  this  exploration  program  should  be  for  the  discovery  of  a  new,  large 
volcanogenic  massive  sulphide  deposit.  The  Granduc  deposit  has  strong  geological 
similarities to the Windy Craggy deposit, which lies at the northwestern extremity of 
British Columbia. These similarities include host rock chemistry and lithologies, age, 
tectonic setting and mineralogy. The Windy Craggy is a good geological analogue for 
the exploration target at Granduc. The Windy Craggy is the largest Besshi deposit in 
the world and several alternate mineral resource estimates for the deposit range in 
magnitude between 210 and 320 million tonnes grading about 1.66% copper, 0.09% 
cobalt, 3.5 grams silver and 0.2 gram gold. All correspond to “Indicated Resources” 
under  the  current  standards  of  the  CIM.  These  figures  are  derived  from  public 
statements  made  by  Geddes  Resources  and  should  be  considered  geological 
information  only.  The  reader  cannot  rely  on  the  Windy  Craggy  resource  estimate 
disclosures of Geddes or this author to be in conformity with sections 1.3 or 1.4 of NI 
43-101, or to reflect the actual size and grade of the deposit.
Data  from  past  operations  indicates  it  is  geologically  reasonable  to  target  the 
following deposit characteristics:
1.  Besshi-type  (mafic-siliclastic  type)  massive  sulphide  targets  for  40  to  150 
million  tonnes  of  1.5  to  2.5%  copper  with  zinc,  silver,  gold  and  cobalt 
contents.
2.  Higher grade Besshi-type massive sulphide deposits, more proximal to a vent
source, stringer zones and with superior deposition sites;
3.  Plunging  zones  of  very  high  grade  massive  sulphides,  in  areas  of
remobilization and structural repetition by F2 fold structures;
Exploration  is  recommended  in  the  following  target  areas  to  test  for  Besshi 
volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (See Fig. 11):
1.  Target 1: Down plunge of the existing Granduc deposit, in areas down
plunge of the thickest and highest grade ore bodies, the F and B1 (Fig. 11)
2.  Target  2:  South  Zone,  beneath areas grading in excess of 3% copper, as 
diamond drilling in 2006 did not test the full succession of Mine Series rocks 
in that area.
3.  Target  3:  Under  the  South  Leduc  glacier.  The  B1  ore  body  forms  a 
distinct  magnetic  anomaly  which  was  traced  under  the  South  Leduc  glacier 
(Fig. 11) by diamond drilling in 2005. These horizons are probably modified 
by F2 folds, with steep to vertical plunges.
3
4.  Target  4:  North  Zone.  Alteration  indicates  that  this  zone  is  proximal  to  a
feeder zone, and higher grades might be encountered (Fig. 11).
5.  Target  5:  F  Zone  Extension.  The  F  Zone  terminates  on  its  northern 
extremity  against  the  Granduc  Fault  (Fig.  11).  Reconstruction  of  movement 
on  the  Granduc  and  Western  faults,  indicates  a  target  area  in  the  western 
side (hanging wall) of the Western fault zone. Target 5 is located at the same 
elevation as the F ore body, but approximately 1 to 4 km north-northwest.
A  two-year,  two  phase  exploration  program  is  recommended.  The  highest 
priority  is  the  drilling  of  Targets  1  and  3,  to  confirm  and  define  accessible  in-situ 
mineral  resource  blocks  in  and  proximal  to  the  historic  workings  of  the  Granduc 
Mine:
1.
2.
Phase One exploration program comprises 7000m of diamond drilling and 
technical work, at an estimated cost of $2.9 million, with an emphasis on 
verification  and  diamond  drill  testing  of  remaining  historic  mineral 
resources  proximal  to  the  mine  workings  (Targets  1  and  3),  and  the 
preparation  of  a  mineral  resources  estimate  that  conforms  to  the 
guidelines of the Instrument; and
Phase Two exploration program, is success contingent on Phase One, and 
is  for  15,000m  of  diamond  drilling  and  comprises  $6.0  million  of  work, 
during  the  second  year  exploration  season.  Depending  on  results  from 
Phase  One,  Phase  Two  will  infill  the  drilling  of  Targets  1  and  3,  plus 
conduct exploration on Targets 4 and 5.
The total estimated expenditure for the recommended Phase One and Phase 
Two exploration program is $8.9 million.

INTRODUCTION
The  authors  were  requested  by  Castle  Resources  Inc.  (“Castle”)  to  prepare  a 
Technical  Report  on  the  geology  and  exploration  potential  of  the  Granduc  Mine 
property, northwestern BC (the “Property”). The report has been prepared under the 
guidelines  of  National  Instrument  43-101  and  accompanying  documents  43-101.F1 
and  43-101.CP  ("NI43-101"  or  the  “Instrument”)  and  is  based  on  historical  mine 
records  (1960-85),  and  several  technical  fieldwork  studies  (1991-94)  and  recent 
exploration  programs  (2005-06).  This  report  is  an  update  of  a  previous  report 
prepared  for  Bell  Resources  Corporation  (“Bell  Copper”)  submitted  under  the 
guidelines of the Instrument (McGuigan, 2005).
The report was prepared to identify exploration targets and guide the next phase of 
exploration.  The  known  Granduc  copper  (-gold-silver)  deposits  are  included  in  this 
summary,  but  a  verification  of  the  historic  mineral  resource  estimates  reported  by 
past operators is beyond the scope of this report.
The authors visited the Property for two days in May 2010, to familiarize themselves 
with  the  latest  exploration  programs.  Prior  field  involvement  of  the  authors  in  the 
Granduc  spans  all  programs  since  1979  on  the  Property,  except  for  a  2006 
exploration program by Bell Copper. One author (McGuigan) was a Senior Geologist 
for Esso Resources Canada at the time of their operation of the Granduc Mine from 
1979 to 1984. He led the geological teams that mapped the surface of the mine and 
surrounding  areas  (McGuigan  and  Marr,  1979),  surface  diamond  drilling  and  re-
establishing  underground  mapping  procedures  (McGuigan,  1981).  The  author  is  a 
principal of Cambria Geological Ltd. that conducted surface geological mapping and 
re-logging of diamond drill core (Melnyk, 1991; McGuigan, et al 1992; and Dawson, 
et al 1994). The author (McGuigan) visited the site of the Granduc mine in 2004, and 
observed no evidence of surface or underground work since the decommissioning of 
the mine site in 1984. He has personally supervised and attended the field work on 
each  of  the  above  cited  programs.  In  2005,  McGuigan  was  retained  to  prepare  a 
NI43-101  technical  report  for  Bell  Copper.  Subsequently,  McGuigan  and  Harrison 
supervised  the  2005  exploration  program  of  Bell  Copper,  that  included  diamond 
drilling of the southern extensions of the main mineralized horizons in the Granduc 
Mine.
In  addition  to  work  supervised  by  the  authors,  important  contributions  of  other 
geologists  are  acknowledged.  McDonald  (1981)  contributed  an  early  study  on  the 
petrography  of  the  mine  series  lithologies.  Surface  structural  mapping  by  Klepacki 
and Read (1981) is used extensively in this report. Subsequently, Cambria conducted 
field research on the Property in 1991-94 for Hecla Mining Company. As part of that 
Cambria  supervised  work  (Melnyk,  1991;  Dawson,  1994),  Barrett  (1994),  Lewis 
(1994),  Childe  (1994)  of  the  Mineral  Deposits  Research  Unit  (“MDRU”)  of  the 
University of British Columbia made significant contributions.
References to Mine Grid, Levels or elevations within the mine are in Imperial units in 
order to maintain common cross-references to the historic identification of the mine 
working locations. Coordinates used otherwise are noted in each citation and given in 
UTM NAD 83 datum, in metres.

DISCLAIMER
The authors rely on several historic mineral resource estimates (and reconciliations 
to  production)  on  the  Granduc  deposit  prepared  by  qualified  independent  mining 
consultants,  and  by  Newmont  and  Esso  professionals  during  the  period  1963  to 
1983. These mineral resource estimates appear to generally conform to standards in 
use during the periods that the each estimate was made. They appear acceptable to 
the  authors  with  the  qualification  that  they  remain  unverified  and  must  be 
considered  geological  information  only.  However,  none  of  these  mineral  resource 
estimates meet current standards for reporting of mineral resources in Canada under 
the  Instrument.  The  reader  must  not  depend  on  these  historic  mineral  resource 
estimates.
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
LOCATION 
The  Granduc  Property (the “Property”)  is  located  in  northwestern  British  Columbia, 
Canada, 900 km northwest of Vancouver and 40 km northwest of Stewart (Fig. 1). It 
is located on NTS Maps 104B/1E, 1W, 8W and centered near longitude 13020' and 
latitude 5614'.
The Property is comprised of three parcels of mineral tenures (Figs. 2, 3, Appendices 
I, II):
a)  A contiguous block of 64 Crown Granted claims that total 1090.97 hectares in 
area;  the  list  of  claims  is  given  in  Appendix  I;  all  claims  are  located  in  the 
Skeena Mining Division.
b)  MCX  mineral  tenures  owned  100%  by  Bell  Copper,  comprising  15  titles  and
5637.2 hectares.
c)  MCX  mineral  tenures  (the  “Silver  Leduc”  parcel)  under  option  from  Teuton
Resources Corp., comprising 13 titles and 6785.7 hectares.
The Crown Granted claims were legally surveyed as part of the granting process and 
the  locations  of  those  surveys  has  been  tied  into  “Hole  1”  survey  monument, 
coordinates  for  which  are  known  in  both  the  Granduc  Mine  Grid  and  in  relation  to 
first-order survey monuments in the area of the mine.
All  other  mineral  tenures  are  located  under  the  MCX  system  and  do  not  require 
surveying to confirm their location and boundaries. Areas cited above are nominal, 
and do not fully reflect the prior titles of the Crown Granted claims. Prior titles will 
reduce the actual area held by the MCX mineral tenure.

BELL COPPER CORPORATION OPTION AGREEMENT 
The  Property  is  100%  owned  by  Bell  Copper  Corporation.  Bell  Copper  Corporation 
was formed  in  a business  combination  that was  completed  in May 2008.  Formerly,  
the  company  was  named  Bell  Resources  Corporation.  Herein,  they  are  together 
termed “Bell Copper”.
Castle and Bell Copper have entered into a binding LOI that will allow Castle to earn 
up to a 90% interest in the Granduc Mine and surrounding areas over a 6 year option 
period. The binding LOI is subject to a 60 day due diligence period. A $20,000 non- 
refundable payment was paid to Bell Copper upon the signing of the binding LOI. The 
transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
Castle can earn an 80% undivided interest in the Granduc Mine during this period. 
Castle  will  have  the  option  to  earn  an  additional  10%  interest  by  providing  the 
financing to Bell Copper after a positive feasibility study is made, in order to put the 
Granduc into production.
As part of the option earn-in agreement Castle will commit to spending a total of $25 
million  over  6  years  (incl.  $2.5  million  in  Year  1)  on  the  Property  and  commit  to 
spending a minimum of $2 million per year with the contingency of a one-time catch 
up year when Castle does not spend a minimum of $2 million in the previous year.
Castle  will  earn  a  51%  interest  at  the  end  of  Year  3  should  it  spend  a  total  of  $7 
million in exploration and drilling expenses.
At  closing  of  this  transaction  Castle  will  pay  $2.5  million  to  Bell  Copper  (of  which 
$500,000  will  be  spent  in  the  first  year  on  the  Granduc  Mine  to  the  credit  of  Bell 
Copper) and will pay 250,000 Castle common shares per year during the 6-year life 
of the option (total of 1,500,000 common shares).
The  Property  is  subject  to  a  2%  Net  Smelter  Return  royalty  (“NSR”),  payable  to 
Glencairn  Gold  Corporation,  now  Central  Sun  Mining  Inc.,  which  is  a  subsidiary 
company of B2Gold Corp. The NSR can be purchased by Castle for $500,000 for the 
first one percent (1%) and $1 million for the remaining one percent (1%).
Teuton Resources Corp. will retain a 1.5 % NSR on the Silver Leduc parcel and on 
Bell  Copper's  four  claims  to  the  north  of  the  Silver  Leduc  claims  (No.  415486,  No. 
415487, No. 415488 and No. 415489). Bell Copper's Granduc Crown Granted claims 
are excluded from this NSR agreement.
The  NSR  is  subject  to  an  annual  advance  royalty  payment  of  $50,000  comprising 
cash and shares. The cash component of the advance royalty will be $25,000 and the 
share component will be $25,000 payable in common shares to be calculated as the 
average price of the shares of Castle over the previous 10 trading days prior to the 
annual Dec. 31 payment date.
Neither  Bell  Copper  nor  Castle  reports  any  royalties,  back-in  rights,  payments  or 
other  agreements  and  encumbrances  to  which  the  Property  is  subject,  other  than 
disclosed above.

REGULATORY & ENVIRONMENTAL 
The authors know of no environmental liabilities to which the Property is subject, the 
mine having been closed under proper Mines Act regulations in 1985.
Taxes are fully paid on the Crown Granted claims and the titles are in good standing.
The MCX mineral tenures are all in good standing until March 1, 2016.
To diamond drill on the Property, exploration permits and bonds must be obtained; 
these permits, that cover the recommended program herein, have been applied for 
and  the  authors  expect  Castle  to  be  in  receipt  of  the  permits  before  any  surface 
diamond drilling program commences.
Crown  Granted  claims  include  the  right  to  employ  the  surface  over  these  Crown 
Grants for mine access as well as mine and mill facilities. However, if the option to 
rehabilitate the Granduc Tunnel and Summit Lake road access is chosen as part of 
any  development  plan,  Castle  must  reapply  for  the  needed  right-of-ways  to  the 
access road and tunnel. Other rights and permits would be required to conduct a full 
mining operation at this location.
The Crown Grants are within the municipality of Stewart, and surface improvements 
are  subject  to  municipal  taxes.  In  the  past  these  taxes  were  used  to  maintain 
infrastructure and schools for the community of Stewart where the mine personnel 
were housed.
ACCESSIBILITY & INFRASTRUCTURE
Topography  at  the  Property  is  mountainous,  with  elevations  ranging  from  700  to 
2000m above sea level on most of the Property (Figs. 2,3). Vegetation is mostly sub-
alpine and alpine shrubbery, with significant snow and ice coverage. Valley glaciation 
dominates. Most prominent on the Property are the North and South Leduc glaciers. 
The climate is typical of northern coastal mountain ranges.
The local community of Stewart is serviced by the Stewart-Cassiar highway (Highway 
37  &  37A).  See  Figure  1.  Connection  to  rail  service  on  the  Yellowhead  railway  is 
available  Kitwanga,  which  is  located  at  the  junction  of  Highway  37  and  the 
Yellowhead Highway 6.
Historic access to the Property is via a 35 km all weather road from the communities 
of Stewart, BC and Hyder, Alaska to a former mill site near Summit Lake. A 17 km 
long  tunnel  and  electric  tram  connected  the  mill  and  mine  operations.  The  access 
road  is  currently  closed  during  the  winter  season.  Additionally,  the  portals  of  the 
Granduc tunnel have been closed and are not available for exploration activities.
Currently, access to the Property is by helicopter from Stewart, B.C. or a marshalling 
point on the access road.
In the event of a new mining operation on the Property the most favorable access 
alternative is the rehabilitation of the Granduc tunnel. The Summit Lake road access
11
remains  suitable  for  year-round  operation,  with  a  winter  snow-clearing  program. 
Electrical transmission lines now service Stewart and have been extended to within 
20 km of the old mill site. Stewart has storage and ship loading facilities Panamax-
size dry cargo ships. Charter helicopter bases and a paved 5000 ft. airstrip capable 
of handling prop-driven aircraft and small business jets are located in the city.
HISTORY
Mineralization was first discovered on Granduc mountain by Wendell, Dawson and W. 
Fromholz in 1931. E. Kvale and T.J. McQuillan staked the copper showings in 1951 
for  Helicopter  Exploration  Company  Ltd.  Granby  Mining  Company  acquired  the 
Property  in  1952  and  completed  surface  and  underground  exploration  work  under 
their newly formed company, Granduc Mines Ltd. Newmont Mining Corporation Ltd. 
entered  into  an  agreement  with  Granby  in  1953  whereby  Newmont  would  finance 
mine  development.  Mine  development  commenced  in  the  early  1960s  with 
production in 1968 at a mine/mill capacity of 2000 tpd. Between 1970 and 1978, the 
Granduc ore body was mined by Newmont using sublevel caving mining methods.
The  Granduc  mine  was  acquired  in  1979  by  Esso  Minerals  Canada  (Canada  Wide 
Mines  division)  and  operated  until  closure  in  May,  1984.  After  purchasing  the 
Property in 1979, Esso began converting to a new mining method referred to as “slot 
and  mass  blast”.  The  initial  results  achieved  by  the  method  fell  short  of  those 
achieved  in  the  past  with  sublevel  caving.  Continued  improvements,  however, 
yielded  stope  recoveries  significantly  superior  to  sub-level  caving  and  significantly 
less dilution. After closure, the Property was returned to Granduc Mines Ltd., then a 
subsidiary of Hecla Mining Company (“Hecla”).
Exploration  on  the  Property  during  the  period  1974  to  1984  focused  primarily  on 
extending copper mineralization along strike north and south of the mine, in areas 
east  of  the  Granduc  fault  (Figs.  6,7).  Work  during  that  time  discovered  the  North 
Zone, located about 3 km north of the main mine workings (Figs. 4,6,7). No copper 
mineralization has been discovered west of the Granduc fault on Granduc mountain.
In  1991,  a  small  surface  exploration  program  was  funded  by  Hecla.  The  program 
focused on several surface mineralized zones on the Property and comprised surface 
sampling and mapping by Cambria Geological Ltd. (“Cambria”). See Melnyk (1991).
In 1993, Hecla financed a field program that retained Cambria to conduct additional 
mapping and sampling. Cambria conducted the work and in addition, supervised the 
funding  of  the  Mineral  Deposits  Research  Unit  (“MDRU”)  of  the  University  of  BC  to 
conduct  structural  mapping,  geochronology  and  lithogeochemistry  of  the  Property 
(Dawson,  et  al,  1994).  One  author  (McGuigan)  of  this  report  supervised  the  1991 
and  1993  programs.  Granduc  Mines  Ltd.  passed  into  the  ownership  of  Graincairn 
Gold Corporation, but no work was done on the Property.
In  2005,  Bell  Copper  acquired  the  Property,  initially  under  Option  from  Glencairn 
Gold Corporation, now Central Sun Mining Inc., which is now a subsidiary company 
of  B2Gold  Corp.  Bell  Copper  conducted  field  exploration  and  diamond  drilling 
programs in the summer seasons of 2005 and 2006. Bell Copper is now the 100% 
owner of the Property.

REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING
HISTORIC GEOLOGIC MAPPING PROGRAMS 
The area north of Granduc mountain along the eastern flank of the South Unuk river 
was mapped by Lewis (1994) in order to extend stratigraphic and structural features 
documented  in  the  MDRU  Iskut  River  study  (Lewis,  1993;  Lewis  et  al.,  1993) 
southward into the Granduc mountain mine area. Previous regional mapping in the 
area is by Alldrick et al. (1989) and references therein.
Stratified rocks exposed on Granduc mountain and to the north are subdivided into 
two  easily  recognizable  units,  termed  the  western  and  eastern  series,  that  are 
separated by the north-northwest striking South Unuk shear zone (Lewis, 1994: Fig 
6,7).  The  terms  western  series  and  eastern  series  predate  the  availability  of  fossil 
and radiometric age determinations, and are retained in the 1994 report and within 
this  report  for  continuity  to  work  conducted  in  the  1979  to  1993  period.  The  unit 
names  for  lithologies  are  the  same  as  adopted  in  Lewis  (1994)  and  Klepacki  and 
Read (1981), again for commonality with earlier work.
Western  series  rocks  consist  of  foliated,  greenschist  facies  metavolcanic  and 
metasedimentary rocks and include the Granduc Mine series (McGuigan and Marr, 
1979), units lying north of the North Leduc glacier and units in the hanging wall 
of  the  Granduc  fault  on  Granduc  mountain  (Figs.  6,7).  These  rocks  remain  of 
uncertain  stratigraphic  succession,  but  belong  to  the  Upper  Triassic  Stuhini 
Group.
Eastern  series  rocks  are  much  less  deformed  and  are  mainly  volcanic.  The 
boundary between western and eastern series rocks is easily identifiable north of 
Granduc  mountain,  however  on  Granduc  mountain  itself,  the  boundary  is 
uncertain. These rocks belong to the Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group.
Intrusive  suites  consist  of  the  pre-tectonic  Late  Triassic  Bucke  Glacier  stock  and 
syenite sills or dykes that intrude western series rocks and the post-tectonic Eocene 
Lee Brant pluton that intrude both western and eastern series rocks. 
STRATIGRAPHY 
Western series (Upper Triassic Stuhini Group) 
Western series rocks crop out east of the South Unuk river where they form a north-
northwest  striking  and  steeply  dipping  unit.  They  consist  of  moderately  to  highly 
foliated schist, phyllite, marble and gneiss. The stratigraphic thickness of the western 
series is uncertain because facing indicators have been destroyed by metamorphism 
and deformation. Repetition of similar lithologic units suggests structural duplication. 
North of Granduc mountain, the western series is subdivided into six lithological (not 
stratigraphic order) rock types consisting of:
(i)
(ii)
strongly foliated, medium grained biotite schist,
pale green argillite and cherty argillite,

(iii)  marble,
(iv)  mafic hornblende schist and gneiss,
(v)
intermediate schist and gneiss, and
(vi)
layered to laminated phyllitic mudstone to siltstone.
Similar rock types defined by Klepacki and Read (1981) on Granduc mountain (units 
1  to  8)  were  retained  by  Lewis  (1994);  correlation  of  individual  units  across  the 
North Leduc glacier was not attempted.
A minimum age of 220 Ma for the western series is obtained by U-Pb (zircon) dates 
from the Bucke Glacier stock north of the North Leduc glacier, and related bodies on 
Granduc mountain, that intrude western series rocks. The Bucke Glacier stock ranges 
from  220  to  223  Ma  (J.  Mortensen,  personal  communication  to  P.D.  Lewis,  1994); 
similar composition sills on Granduc mountain were 232 + 3 Ma (Childe, 1994). In 
addition,  a  U-Pb  (zircon)  analysis  from  the  footwall  andesite  on  Granduc  mountain 
(North Zone) returned an identical date within error of 230.5 + 14 Ma.
Eastern series (Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group) 
Eastern series rocks form a northwest trending package of rocks that are separated 
from  western  series  rocks  by  the  South  Unuk  shear  zone  on  the  west,  and  are 
bounded  by  the  Frank  Mackie  glacier  on  the  east.  They  are  subdivided  into  three 
lithologically distinct conformable volcanic units (from oldest to youngest) consisting 
of:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
heterolithic intermediate volcanic breccia to conglomerate,
bedded  dacitic(?)  tuffs,  tuffaceous  conglomerate  and  homolithic  breccia, 
and
andesitic pillowed flow and pillow breccia. In the North Leduc glacier area, 
sedimentary  grading  and  pillow  shapes  indicate  these  units  face 
southwest; in other areas, facing directions are uncertain.
The  age  of  the  eastern  series  is  partly  constrained  by  U-Pb  analyses  of  zircons 
separated  from  a  dacite  megaclast  collected  north  of  Granduc  mountain.  An 
interpreted  age  for  this  unit,  based  on  four  zircon  fractions,  is  186.8  +  5.6  Ma  (J. 
Mortensen, personal communication to P. Lewis, 1994). An identical age within error 
of  185.4  +  9  Ma  was  obtained  from  a  felsic  lapilli  tuff  approximately  7  km  to  the 
south on the Homestake property (Childe, 1994). These rocks are similar in age to 
felsic rocks (Hazelton Group) in the footwall of the precious metal rich Eskay Creek 
massive  sulphide  deposit  (Bartsch,  1993).  Volcanic  rocks  of  this  age  correlate  with 
the Betty Creek formation (Hazelton Group) in the Stewart – Iskut mining camps.

INTRUSIONS 
Bucke Glacier stock 
Bucke Glacier stock forms a northwesterly elongate body (approximately 10 km long 
by 2 km wide) in western series rocks north of Granduc mountain. It consists of fine 
to  coarse  grained  hornblende-biotite  diorite  to  monzodiorite.  The  contacts  of  the 
stock are parallel to subparallel to regional foliation, and the stock is foliated itself, 
however,  to  a  lesser  degree  than  the  enclosing  western  series  rocks.  Intermediate 
intrusive rocks exposed on the north side of Granduc mountain (Klepacki and Read, 
1981) and intersected in North Zone drilling (Freckelton et al., 1982) are correlated 
with  the  Bucke  Glacier  suite  based  on  similar  lithologies  and  preliminary  U-Pb 
(zircon) dates (Childe, 1994).
The  age  of  the  Bucke  Glacier  stock  is  constrained  by  two  widely  separated  U-Pb 
(zircon) dates. To the north, near the northern most exposure of the stock, a foliated 
diorite  phase  of  the  stock  returned  a  date  of  221  +  1  Ma  (M.L.  Bevier,  personal 
communication to P. Lewis, 1994). To the south, near the southern most exposure of 
the stock, a hornblende quartz monzodiorite phase returned a date of 220 - 223 Ma 
(J. Mortensen, personal communication to P. Lewis, 1994).
Similar composition sills on Granduc mountain were 232 + 3 Ma (Childe, 1994). In 
addition,  a  U-Pb  (zircon)  analysis  from  the  footwall  andesite  on  Granduc  mountain 
(North Zone) returned an identical date within error of 230.5 + 14 Ma.
Syenite sills (and dykes) 
Syenite  sills  (and  minor  dykes)  form  north-northwesterly  trending  elongate  bodies 
(<1.5  km  long  and  10's  of  metres  thick)  in  western  series  rocks  north  of  Granduc 
mountain.  Sill  contacts  are  parallel  to  subparallel  to  regional  foliation  and 
compositional  layering  measured  in  the  enclosing  western  series  rocks.  The  sills 
contain crowded megacrystic (<5 cm) potassium feldspar and are weakly foliated.
Lee Brant stock 
Lee Brant stock forms a large stock in eastern series rocks north of Divelbliss Creek. 
The  stock  consists  of  undeformed  hornblende  -  biotite  quartz  monzonite.  A  U-Pb 
(zircon) date of 55.6 + 2 Ma was obtained from a sample collected along the eastern 
margin of the body north of Divelbliss Creek (J. Mortensen, personal communication 
to P. Lewis, 1994). 
STRUCTURE 
The major structure identified in the Unuk river area is the South Unuk shear zone. It 
is  a  north-northwest  striking,  subvertical  fault  that  is  mapped  from  the  Iskut  river 
area south to Granduc mountain, a distance of 60 km (Lewis, 1994). The fault varies 
along strike (north to south) from a brittle fault (10-20 m thick) with uncertain sense 
and direction near Mount Shirley that widens to a ductile deformed zone greater than 
1 km wide south of Sulphurets creek where sinistral offset is indicated.

Further  south,  in  the Divelbliss,  Duke  and North Leduc  areas, western  series  rocks 
record strongly heterogeneous deformation with a large component of simple shear 
in  a  ductile  to  semi-brittle  environment  (Lewis,  1994);  these  features  indicate 
western series rocks should be included as part of the shear zone.
The eastern boundary of the shear zone is marked by a fault that separates the more 
deformed  Late  Triassic  (or  older)  western  series  rocks  from  relatively  undeformed 
Lower to Middle Jurassic eastern series rocks.
PROPERTY GEOLOGICAL SETTING
Work on the Property that was supervised by the authors spanned three periods of 
work:  1979-1984;  1991-1994  and  2005.  The  best  reference  to  the  geology  of  the 
Property is offered in the report of the 1993 field program by Cambria (Dawson et al 
1994).
Work  on  the  Property  during  the  1993  study  focused  on  re-logging  and  sampling 
selected  drill  holes  for  lithogeochemistry  and  geochronology.  Surface  mapping  on 
Granduc  mountain  was  limited  to  a  few  traverses  to  examine:  (i)  previous 
stratigraphic subdivisions (McGuigan and Marr, 1979; Klepacki and Read, 1981), (ii) 
previous  structural  analysis  (Klepacki  and  Read,  1981),  and  (iii)  to  help  with 
correlation of units logged in drill core and mapped north of the North Leduc glacier 
during the 1993 study (Lewis, 1994).
The following brief description of stratigraphy, structure and mineralization is based 
mainly  on  mapping  by  McGuigan  and  Marr  (1979)  and  Klepacki  and  Read  (1981), 
Lewis (1994) and re-logging selected drill holes (Dawson et al 1994).
The detailed map of the lithologies cannot be present herein, due to the size format 
of the current NI 43-101 standard. The reader is referred to McGuigan (2005) for the 
details of the local surface mine geology. 
STRATIGRAPHY 
Previous  surface  mapping  on  the  Property  by  McGuigan  and  Marr  (1979)  outlined 
three major rock assemblages: (i) Hangingwall series, (ii) Mine series, and (iii) the 
Footwall series—all of which are part of the western series rock assemblage. These 
assemblages  were  further  subdivided  by  Klepacki  and  Read  (1981)  into  47  map 
lithologic  units.  Rapid  facies  changes,  faulting  and  folding  makes  correlation  of 
individual units difficult.
The  western  series  rocks  on  Granduc  mountain  are  an  assemblage  of  volcanic  and 
sedimentary  rocks  approximately  1,500  m  thick;  the  exact  thickness  is  difficult  to 
determine because of likely stratigraphic repetition, due to folding and faulting.
Footwall series rocks consist of pillowed and massive andesite to basalt flows which 
are overlain by flow breccias, crystal and lithic andesite tuff. Mine  series rocks are 
cyclic  mafic  tuffs  and  chemical  sediments  that  include  chert,  magnetite  iron 
formation  and  sulphides.  Hangingwall  series  rocks  consist  of  siliceous  and  mafic 
wacke followed by andesite tuff, argillite, siltstone and limestone.
21
As  will  be  discussed  herein  in  the  section  on  Interpretations  and  Conclusions,  the 
facing of the units described here is uncertain, due to folding and faulting, and local 
overturning of the section. The terms Footwall, Mine Series and Hangingwall are the 
terms  employed  in  earlier  studies,  and  are  repeated  to  maintain  consistency  with 
previous generations of mapping. They do not imply a particular stratigraphic order.
Footwall series (Units 1 and 2)
Lower Footwall sequence
Footwall series rocks have been divided into a Lower Footwall and an Upper Footwall 
sequence.  The  Lower  Footwall  sequence  consists  mainly  of  augite  phyric  andesite 
flows (1v), siliceous wacke (1w), and augite phyric andesite tuff (1t). These units are 
locally  calcareous  and  contain  rare  disseminated  magnetite,  pyrrhotite  and 
chalcopyrite.  A  thin  ultramafic  horizon  consists  of  dunite,  talc-chlorite  schist  and 
chlorite-serpentine schist; locally it marks the western fringe of the Lower Footwall 
sequence.
Upper Footwall sequence
The Upper Footwall sequence is distinctly more sedimentary and thinner bedded than 
the  Lower  Footwall  sequence.  It  consists  of  argillite  (2p2-5),  phyllite  (2p1), 
tuffaceous sandstone (2ss), and tuffaceous argillite and minor augite phyric andesite 
flows  (2v).  Locally,  units  are  calcareous  and  contain  disseminated  magnetite, 
pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.
Mine series (Unit 3) 
Mine series rocks consist primarily of interbedded tuff (3v1-2), chert (3c), and minor 
chloritic+calcareous wacke (3w1), argillite (3p1-2) and the Granduc limestone (3l). 
Mine  series  rocks  were  subdivided  by  McGuigan  and  Tucker  (1981)  into  the:  (i) 
Lower  Mine  unit,  (ii)  Middle  Mine  unit,  and  (iii)  the  Upper  Mine  unit.  They  are 
separated  by  faults  of  small  displacement.  The  three  units  each  represent  similar 
cycles of argillite, siltstone, mafic tuff deposition, marked by an interval of exhalative 
mineralization  comprised  of  massive  sulphide,  graphite-  and  tourmaline-bearing 
chert and magnetite iron formation.
These units are not distinguished on the surface map included in this report, as the 
contacts are defined only in detailed underground mapping.
Lower Mine Unit
The Lower Mine unit is at the same stratigraphic level as the B1 and possibly the F 
ore body. The unit has a limited strike extent and does not extend north of 12000 N 
on  surface.  It  consists  of  laminated  brown  chert  at  its  base,  succeeded  by 
interbedded amphibolitic tuff, chert, and biotitic feldspar phyric dacite tuff (probably 
a mafic tuff, see the Section on Lithogeochemistry). The tuffs contain disseminated 
magnetite,  pyrrhotite  and  chalcopyrite.  The  top  of  the  unit  consists  of  laminated 
brown chert. The B1 ore body consists of massive pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite within an 
interval of chert and magnetite iron formation (see the section on Mineralization).
22
Middle Mine Unit
The Middle Mine unit corresponds to the same stratigraphic level as the C and B2 ore 
bodies.  Surface  exposures  are  limited  due  to  overburden  and  surface  cave  from 
underground mining. Underground, the unit consists of a lower tuff, a middle course 
chert marker, and an upper thinly laminated chert and tuff unit. Minor disseminated 
magnetite,  pyrrhotite  and  chalcopyrite  occur  throughout  the  unit.  It  is  separated 
from  the  Lower  Mine  unit  by  a  minor  fault  (0.3  m  fault  gouge).  The  C  and  B2  ore 
bodies are comprised of cherty magnetite iron formations.
Upper Mine Unit
The Upper Mine unit corresponds to the same stratigraphic level as the A ore bodies 
underground. The unit consists of equal amounts of interbedded tuff and laminated 
brown  chert.  Tuff  decreases  northward  where  chert  and  fine  grained  siliciclastics 
predominate.  Tuffaceous  sulphide-bearing  magnetite  iron  formation  (1.5  -  3.0  m 
thick) occurs near the top of the formation.
Granduc Limestone
Granduc  limestone  overlies  the  Upper  Mine  unit.  It  consists  of  grey  to  black 
tuffaceous limestone and calcareous-chloritic dacite tuff. The unit grades upward into 
thick bedded feldspar phyric ash and lapilli tuff that is locally calcareous. The top of 
the unit is locally cut by the Granduc fault.
Hangingwall series (Units 4 to 8) 
Hangingwall  series  rocks  are  separated  from  the  underlying  Mine  series  by  the 
Granduc  fault  (Figs.  6,7).  The  unit  has  been  subdivided  into  the:  (i)  Gash  Banded 
Tuff sequence, (ii)  Varied sequence, (iii)  Siliceous Wacke sequence, and (iv) Upper 
Volcanic sequence.
Gash Banded Tuff
Gash  Banded  Tuff  sequence  crops  out  mainly  between  the  Granduc  and  Western 
faults  (Figs.  6，7).  It  consists  of  tuffaceous  sandstone  (4t),  wacke  (4w1-2),  and 
massive  limestone  (4l).  Fine  carbonate  veinlets  are  abundant  in  many  of  the 
sandstone  and  wacke  beds,  and  are  likely  related  to  carbonate  formation  in 
extensional fractures adjacent to F3 folds and shears.
Varied sequence
Varied sequence is separated from the underlying Gash Banded Tuff sequence by the 
Western  fault  (Figs.  6，7).  The  sequence  consists  of  a  heterogeneous  package  of 
thinly bedded sediments and volcanic rocks. In decreasing order of abundance, they 
include  argillite  (5p1-6),  siliceous  wacke  (5w1-2),  foliated  andesite  volcanics  (5v1-
2), tuffaceous sandstone (5ss) and limestone (5c). Facing indicators throughout this 
unit are right-way up.
23
Mafic Wacke sequence
Mafic  Wacke  sequence  conformably  overlies  the  Varied  sequence  (Figs.  6,  7).  It 
consists  of  dark  green  wacke  (6w1-3),  argillite  (6p),  foliated  amphibole  phyric  tuff 
(6v), calcareous tuff and limestone (6t), chert (6c1-2) and feldspathic arenite (6s).
Siliceous Wacke
Siliceous  Wacke  sequence  is  separated  from  the  underlying  Mafic  Wacke  by  a  thin 
basal limestone (Figs. 6，7). The rest of the unit is a relatively homogeneous fine to 
medium grained siliceous wacke (7w) that contains rare pyrite clots.
Upper Volcanic sequence
Upper  Volcanic  sequence  conformably  overlies  the  Siliceous  Wacke  sequence  (Figs. 
6, 7). It consists of foliated feldspar and augite phyric andesite flows and tuffs (8v), 
and white to black chert (8c).
Lithogeochemistry 
Thirty four rock samples were collected by Barrett (1994) from long drill holes mainly 
in the North Zone at Granduc mountain for a lithogeochemical study. The objectives 
of  the  study  were:  (i)  to  'fingerprint'  similar  lithological  units  to  aid  in  structural 
interpretations,  (ii)  determine  the  magma  series,  (iii)  chemically  classify  the  rocks, 
and  (iv)  compare  their  compositions  with  those  of  known  tectonic  setting.  This 
section on lithogeochemistry is summarized from Barrett (1994).
Methods  developed  by  MacLean  (1988)  and  Barrett  et  al.  (1992)  were  used  by 
Barrett (1994) to evaluate the effects of primary igneous fractionation and the extent 
of  alteration  in  volcanic  rocks  from  Granduc  mountain.  Initial  interpretations  by 
Barrett  (1994)  indicate  most  samples  are  mafic  volcanics  or  an  intermediate  sill 
which  have  Zr/Y  ratios  equal  to  3-4;  this  is  consistent  with  an  overall  tholeiitic 
magmatic  affinity.  On  a  number  of  binary  plots,  the  mafic  volcanics  show  the 
following  trends:  (i)  increasing  Al2O3  and  Zr  is  interpreted  to  represent  a  mafic 
fractionation trend; two mafic samples and two cherty iron formation samples appear 
to be derived from a different magma source that has higher Zr and TiO2 content, 
(ii) decreasing MgO and Cr2O3 likely reflects the removal of olivine (Mg) and spinel 
(Cr)  by  fractionation,  (iii)  increasing  Al2O3  with  decreasing  Cr2O3  likely  reflects 
increasing  plagioclase  content  as  olivine  (Cr)  and  spinel  (Cr)  are  removed  by 
fractionation,  and  (iv)  increasing  Na2O  with  decreasing  SiO2  likely  reflects 
fractionation  with  the  mafic  volcanic  sequence  involving  increasingly  more  sodic 
plagioclase.
Rare earth element (REE) plots by Barrett (1994) show that the mafic volcanic rocks 
have a uniform REE composition with La/Yb (chondrite normalized) ratios of 3.5 to 
5.0 suggesting a transitional chemical affinity between mid-ocean ridge basalts (flat 
to slight light REE depleted pattern) and an island arc setting (enriched in large ion 
lithophile  elements  [LILE]  and  a  gentle  negative  REE  pattern).  The  slightly  more 
differentiated intermediate sill has a similar, but higher REE pattern than the mafic 
volcanics  that  suggests  they  may  be  genetically  related.  Banded  tuffaceous  or
24
volcaniclastic rocks logged as 'cherty tuff' or 'dacitic tuff' have REE patterns almost 
identical  to  those  of  the  mafic  volcanic  rocks  indicating  they  are  not  dacitic  in 
composition as logged in the field.
Tectonic  discrimination  diagrams  constructed  from  mafic  volcanic  rocks  in  modern 
day  tectonic  settings  indicate  that  mafic  volcanic  samples  from  Granduc  mountain 
(North  Zone)  plot  mainly  in  the  low  potassium  tholeiite  field  on  a  Ti  vs.  Zr  plot 
(Pearce and Cann, 1973). On a Nb/2 - Zr/4 - Y plot (Meschede, 1986), samples plot 
in the plume-mid ocean ridge basalt (P-MORB) and normal - mid ocean ridge basalt 
(N-MORB)  fields,  however,  some  samples  plot  along  the  line  discriminating  MORB 
from volcanic arc basalt (VAB) field. Samples plot in a straight line within the ocean 
floor basalt field (OFB) and along the discrimination line separating the calcalkaline 
basalt (CAB) and island arc basalt (IAB) field on a Ti/100 - Zr - Sr/2 plot (Pearce and 
Cann, 1973). This may indicate some Sr exchange with seawater during calcareous 
alteration of the basalt, since the Sr cation can exchange for the Ca cation in calcite. 
Samples  plot  mainly  in  the  ocean  floor  basalt  field  (OFB),  however  some  samples 
plot in the low potassium tholeiite field (LKT) on a Ti/100 - Zr - Y/3 plot (Pearce and 
Cann, 1973). 
INTRUSIONS 
Bucke Glacier stock 
Bucke Glacier stock forms a northwesterly elongate body (approximately 10 km long 
by 2 km wide) in western series rocks north of Granduc mountain. It consists of fine 
to  coarse  grained  hornblende-biotite  diorite  to  monzodiorite.  The  contacts  of  the 
stock are parallel to subparallel to regional foliation, and the stock is foliated itself, 
however, to a lesser degree than the enclosing western series rocks.
Intermediate  intrusive  rocks  exposed  on  the  north  side  of  Granduc  mountain 
(Klepacki and Read, 1981) and intersected in North Zone drilling (Freckelton et al., 
1982) are correlated with the Bucke Glacier suite based on similar lithologies and U-
Pb (zircon) dates (Childe, 1994).
The  age  of  the  Bucke  Glacier  stock  is  constrained  by  two  widely  separated  U-Pb 
(zircon) dates. To the north, near the northern most exposure of the stock, a foliated 
diorite  phase  of  the  stock  returned  a  date  of  221  +  1  Ma  (M.L.  Bevier,  personal 
communication to P. Lewis, 1994). To the south, near the southern most exposure of 
the stock, a hornblende quartz monzodiorite phase returned a date of 220 - 223 Ma 
(J. Mortensen, personal communication to P. Lewis, 1994).
Similar composition sills on Granduc mountain were 232 + 3 Ma (Childe, 1994). In 
addition,  a  U-Pb  (zircon)  analysis  from  the  footwall  andesite  on  Granduc  mountain 
(North Zone) returned an identical date within error of 230.5 + 14 Ma.
Syenite sills (and dykes) 
Syenite  sills  (and  minor  dykes)  form  north-northwesterly  trending  elongate  bodies 
(<1.5  km  long  and  10's  of  metres  thick)  in  western  series  rocks  north  of  Granduc 
mountain.  Sill  contacts  are  parallel  to  sub-parallel  to  regional  foliation  and
25
compositional  layering  measured  in  the  enclosing  western  series  rocks.  The  sills 
contain crowded megacrystic (<5 cm) potassium feldspar and are weakly foliated.
The age of these intrusions are not known but are likely early Jurassic or older.
Lee Brant stock 
Tertiary  Lee  Brant  stock  forms  a  large  stock  in  eastern  series  rocks  north  of 
Divelbliss  Creek.  The  stock  consists  of  undeformed  hornblende  -  biotite  quartz 
monzonite.  A  U-Pb  (zircon)  date  of  55.6  +  2  Ma  was  obtained  from  a  sample 
collected  along  the  eastern  margin  of  the  body  north  of  Divelbliss  Creek  (J. 
Mortensen, personal communication to P. Lewis, 1994).
Similar  composition  intrusions  cross-cut  the  Mine  series,  within  the  Granduc  Mine 
and are, in turn, displaced by late movement on the Granduc and parallel faults. At 
the southern extremities of the Property, both the Stuhini and Hazelton group rocks 
are intruded by the Coast Range batholitic intrusions. 
STRUCTURE 
Folding
First Phase Deformation
Surface mapping on Granduc mountain by Klepacki and Read (1981) identified four 
phases  of folding.  The  earliest  deformation  is  characterized  by  minor  isoclinal  folds 
(F1) that plunge shallow to the southeast in the northern part of the map, and to the 
southwest  in  the  southern  part  of  the  map.  The  axial  planes  of  these  folds  are 
parallel  to  layering.  The  intersection  of  axial  planar  cleavage  (S1),  defined  by  the 
alignment of biotite and muscovite, with bedding (So) results in lineations (L1) that 
plunge similar to the (F1) minor folds.
Second phase deformation
Second  phase  deformation  is  characterized  by  tight  to  open,  minor  to  major  folds 
(F2)  that  verge  to  the  east.  Axial  planes  of  F2  folds  strike  north-northeasterly  and 
dip steeply east or west. F2 fold axes plunge steeply north in the northern part of the 
map, and steeply south in the southern part of the map. Locally, F2 minor folds have 
axial surfaces which diverge and form box-shaped folds.
Third & Fourth phase deformation
Third  phase  deformation  produced  small  open  folds.  F3  axial  planes  strike  east  to 
northeasterly and dip shallow to moderately south. They are best developed in the 
Gash Banded Tuff Unit (Unit 4) and appear to be spatially related to the Granduc and 
Western faults. Fourth phase deformation is defined by gentle warps that cause the 
gradual change in orientation of older features across the map sheet.
26
Progressive Deformation within the South Unuk Shear Zone
Lewis  (1994)  attributes  S1  foliation,  F1  and  F2  folds  on  Granduc  mountain  to 
progressive deformation associated with the South Unuk shear zone. The South Unuk 
shear zone is several km wide and has dominantly a sinistral sense of displacement. 
This  new  interpretation  is  significant  because,  previously,  the  consistent  northerly 
striking and steeply west dipping S1 foliation measured by Klepacki and Read (1981) 
was interpreted to represent the single limb of a major F1 fold. According to Lewis 
(1994), a major F1 fold is unlikely, and its postulated occurrence should not be used 
to guide exploration. For a more in-depth discussion of the South Unuk shear zone 
and associated structural elements the reader is referred to Lewis (1994).
Faulting
South Unuk Shear Zone
The  HFK  fault  mapped  by  McGuigan  and  Marr  (1979)  may  represent  the  southern 
continuation  of  the  South  Unuk  shear  zone mapped  north  of  Granduc  mountain  by 
Lewis (1994). The South Unuk shear zone separates deformed Late Triassic western 
series  (Stuhini  Group)  rocks  in  the  west,  that  host  the  Granduc  deposit,  from  less 
deformed Early to Middle Jurassic eastern series (Hazelton Group) rocks in the east.
Granduc and Western Faults
Younger faults identified by Klepacki and Read (1981) and all previous studies on the 
Property  include  the  Granduc  and  Western  faults.  These faults  strike  northerly  and 
dip  moderately  to  steeply  west.  Analysis  of  the  data  by  Klepacki  and  Read  (1981) 
shows the Granduc and Western faults record movement in a right-lateral, strike slip 
sense,  with  approximately  4km  of  displacement,  in  total,  across  the  two  fault 
structures. Right lateral movement cross-cuts and displaces late quartz diorite dykes 
in the Granduc Mine series lithologies and the Hangingwall series.
27
DEPOSIT TYPES
The principle exploration target on the Property is for volcanogenic massive sulphide 
(VMS) deposits of the Besshi-type. Besshi-type deposits are named after deposits on 
the southern Japanese island of Shikoku – Slack, 1993). The descriptive model name 
for this class of deposit is the mafic-siliclastic VMS.
Besshi VMS sulphide mineralization consists predominantly of iron sulphides (pyrite 
and/or pyrrhotite), with lesser chalcopyrite; sphalerite may or may not be present. 
Besshi deposits can contain highly varied and complex sulphide mineralogy, including 
arsenopyrite,  galena,  bornite,  tetrahedrite-tennantite,  cobaltite,  stannite  and 
molybdenite.  Quartz  (chert),  tourmaline,  carbonate,  albite,  sericite,  chlorite  and 
amphibole can be found as gangue minerals in the deposits. Barite is usually absent, 
but  other  chemical  sedimentary  rocks  (chert, carbonates or  oxide-facies  iron  beds) 
and/or magnetite may be associated.
The  Besshi  massive  sulphide  deposits  are  stratiform  and  tabular.  The  massive 
sulphides  may  be  finely  or  coarsely  layered,  or  massive  and  can  be  finely 
interlaminated  with  chert,  tuff,  calcareous  sediment,  and  magnetite;  the  sulphide 
lenses  can  be  just  several  metres  thick  but  can  extend  for  several  kilometres. 
Chloritic alteration haloes are commonly in the host rocks surrounding the sulphide 
horizons, a relic of pre-deformational alteration. Other alteration minerals that may 
occur are quartz, carbonate, pyrite, sericite and graphite. Locally, tourmaline can be 
distinctly abundant.
Crosscutting  the  massive  sulphide  horizons,  there  may  be  veins  of  recrystallised 
pyrite  and/or  chalcopyrite,  opened  and  filled  when the horizons  were  deformed.  In 
highly  deformed  environments,  sulphides  may  be  thickened  in  fold  closures,  and 
remobilized into axial plane shears.
The  sulphide  horizons  generally  occur  in  thick  sequences  of  marine  sedimentary 
rocks, ranging from black shale to arkose to greywacke. The clastic hosts themselves 
are generally finely laminated sedimentary rocks, possibly turbidites. There can also 
be tuffaceous interlayers. The clastic sediments are typically graphitic.
There  are  usually  no  felsic  volcanic  rocks  present,  though  flows,  and  sub-volcanic 
sills  of  basalt  are  often  present  in  the  sequence  of  sediments.  The  basalts  have  a 
tholeiitic composition.
The host rocks, mineralogy and chemistry of Besshi deposits lie along a continuum 
between  sedimentary-exhalative  deposits  and  copper-zinc  massive  sulphides.  The 
deposits are the products of hydrothermal exhalation at vent sites (“black smokers”) 
or hydrothermal brine pools that formed on the seafloor depressions after exhalation. 
Some  replacement  mineralization  of  sub-seafloor  clastic  sedimentary  rocks  by 
sulphur-bearing hydrothermal fluids is postulated.
Besshi-type volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits range in size from under 
a  million  to  300  million  tonnes  and  grade  between  0.64%  and  3.3%  copper.  The 
Besshi deposits themselves contain 30 million tonnes of 2.5% copper and 0.3% zinc, 
plus  7  grams  per  tonne  silver  and  0.2  gram  gold  per  tonne.  The  largest  Besshi
28
deposit  in  the  world  is  the  Windy  Craggy,  in  northwestern  British  Columbia,  which 
contains between 210 and 320 million tonnes grading 1.66% copper, 0.09% cobalt, 
3.5 grams silver per tonne and 0.2 gram gold per tonne. Figures compiled by Slack 
(1993) are tabulated below (Table 1). The methods employed to calculate the size 
and grades of the deposit examples cited in this section have not been reviewed by 
the  authors  for  compliance  with  the  Instrument  for  reporting  of  mineral  resources. 
The figures have been cited below are therefore for geological information only.
Besshi-type  deposits  appear  to  have  formed  in  a  variety  of  tectonic  environments, 
from oceanic crust to early-forming rift basins in continental plates. The host rocks 
are thick, terrigenous clastic sedimentary sequences with lesser volumes of tholeiitic 
mafic  magmatism.  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  size  of  the  deposit  reflects  the 
volume of mafic volcanic rocks in the ore-forming system; the more mafic volcanic 
rocks  that  occur  in  the  basinal  stratigraphy,  the  more  copper  there  may  be  in  the 
exhalative sulphide body.

MINERALIZATION
VOLCANOGENIC MASSIVE SULPHIDE ZONES 
The  principle  copper-silver  bearing  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide  zones  on  the 
Property  are  located  in  a  north-south  trending,  steeply  westward  dipping  strata  of 
Unit  3  (Mine  series)  and  Unit  2,  part  of  the  Late  Triassic  western  series  (Stuhini 
Group) (Figs. 6, 7). Three major mineralized zones have been identified-North Zone, 
Granduc deposit and South Zone (Fig. 4).
Photo 1.  Granduc Deposit - B1 ore body: Massive pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pyrite in a
strongly foliated calcareous, chloritic mafic tuff.
Syngenetic mineralization consists of sulphides-pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, rare 
sphalerite and galena-and magnetite iron formation hosted within chert, mudstones 
and  pyroclastic  rocks  of  the  Granduc  Mine  series.  Subsequent  deformation  has 
remobilized  and  recrystalized  the  sulphides  as  disseminations,  layers  that  parallel 
foliation,  and  crosscutting  remobilized  sulphide  breccia  zones  along  axial  planar 
jointing  and  shear  surfaces  (Photos  1  and  2).  The  remobilized  sulphides  comprise 
angular to rounded distorted schistose wallrock and brittle chert and magnetite iron 
formation fragments in a recrystalized deformed sulphide groundmass consisting of 
more  ductile  sulphides  such  as  chalcopyrite,  pyrrhotite  and  lesser  sphalerite  and 
galena. The structure results from the detachment, fragmentation, rolling, kneading 
and  grinding  of  wallrock  and  brittle  sulphide  fragments  in  a  ductile  sulphide 
groundmass. The common term for the texture is “Durchbewegt ore” (Photo 3).
30
GRANDUC DEPOSIT 
The main Granduc deposit consists of a number of individual ore bodies-A, B1, B2, C 
and F-that are structurally controlled by south plunging F2 folds (Fig. 4). The A, B1 
and F ore bodies average 1.9% Cu, while the B2 and C ore bodies average 1.3% and 
1.7% Cu, respectively. The deposit is separated into a northern and southern block 
that is separated by a weakly mineralized to barren zone. The F ore body lies in the 
northern  block  (north  of  11  300  N  at  the  2600  level)  while  all  others  lie  in  the 
southern  block.  Mineralization  is  essentially  stratabound,  however  deformation  has 
caused  sulphide  remobilization  resulting  locally  in  cross-cutting  relationships.  It 
consists  of varying  proportions  of chalcopyrite,  pyrrhotite,  magnetite,  minor  pyrite, 
and rare sphalerite and galena.
Photo 2.  Granduc Deposit-B1 Ore body: Small F2 fold closure in massive sulphides
Structurally  modified  sulphides  form  an  important  part  of  the  B1,  B2,  C  and  F  ore 
bodies.  Based  on  measurements  at  the  2600  level  and  higher  in  the  mine,  the 
thickest  parts  of  those  bodies  plunge  in  fold  closures  with  an  average  F2  fold  axis 
orientation  of  55o  towards  230o.  The  average  axial  plane  measurement  was 
0200/700W  (McGuigan  and  Tucker,  1981).  Minor  folds,  and  displacement  across 
chloritic  shear  surfaces  (“transpositional  slips”)  indicate  a  dominance  of  left  lateral 
shear displacement of the sulphide and the sulphide-bearing, cherty magnetite-rich 
mafic tuffs.

NORTH ZONE 
North Zone is between 14 600N and 15 800N on the Granduc mine (Imperial) grid, 
approximately  1.5  km  north  of  the  Granduc  Mine  (Figs.  4,5,7).  Mineralization  was 
first  intersected  in  surface  drill  hole  153-1  by  Newmont  Ltd.  in  1977.  Assays  from 
this  hole  [over  the  intervals  529.5  m  to  540.0  m  and  558.3  m  to  566.85  m  were 
1.39%  (10.14  m  true  thickness)  and  3.29%  (8.28  m  true  thickness),  respectively] 
were 1.39% Cu over 10.7 m and 3.29% Cu over 8.7 m. These intersections led to a 
surface diamond drilling program (approximately 7 620 m in nine drill holes) by Esso 
Minerals  Canada  Ltd.  in  1980  and  1982.  Two  separate  mineralized  zones  were 
identified in the Upper Footwall series (Unit 2). 
SOUTH ZONE 
South  Zone  is  between  6  000  and  5  000N  on  the  Granduc  mine  (Imperial)  grid, 
approximately 1.5 km south of the Granduc Mine (Figs. 4,5,7). Granduc Mines Ltd. 
explored this area in 1961 and completed a 152 m adit and a number of surface and 
underground drill holes. Drill hole 250 intersected two zones assaying 3.84% Cu over 
the  interval  143.7  m  to  157.8  m  (4.13  m  true  thickness)  and  3.27%  Cu  over  the 
interval  204  m  to  211.5  m  (7.32  m  true  thickness).  Mineralization  is  hosted  in 
volcanic  conglomerate  thought  to  be  the  facies  equivalents  of  the  Granduc  Mine 
series. Intersections on the South Zone most closely correlate with the horizon that 
hosts the A zone in the Granduc Mine, or alternately a unit higher in the succession.

EXPLORATION
EXPLORATION PROGRAMS 2005-2006 
Castle has not conducted exploration on the Property.
The  last  phase  of  major  diamond  drilling  on  the  Property  was  during  the  Esso 
Minerals  Canada  ownership  of  the  mine,  prior  to  1984.  Bell  Copper  conducted  two 
exploration  programs  on  the  Property,  focused  on  targets  under  the  South  Leduc 
glacier and in the South Zone. Progress was disclosed in news releases in 2005 and 
2006 but no technical reports have been made publicly available. However, the 2006 
exploration is reported in Wasterneys (2007, Assessment Report 28912 in the ARIS 
system) and is now released from confidential.
Work  was  conducted  out  of  an  exploration  camp  located  at  an  abandoned  airstrip, 
which is located near the 2475 level portal of the Granduc Mine. All programs were 
helicopter-supported.
In 2005, Bell Copper conducted a limited diamond drilling program and an airborne 
geophysical survey. Work accomplished was as follows:
a)  Diamond  drilling  in  5  holes,  for  a  total  of  2087.6  metres,  at  the  south 
extension  of  the  main  mineralized  horizons  of  the  Granduc  Mine,  under  the 
north side of the South Leduc glacier.
b)  AeroTEM II surveys, for 1206 line km. comprising magnetic and AeroTEM II
helicopter electromagnetic system.
The 2005 work conducted by Cambria and was supervised by one of the authors of 
this report (Harrison).
In  2006,  Bell  Copper  conducted  a  limited  diamond  drilling  program  and  surface 
prospecting. Work accomplished was as follows:
a)  Prospecting  in  the  area  recommended  by  McGuigan  (2005),  where  massive 
sulphide  boulders  were  discovered  on  the  north  side  of  Granduc  mountain 
(Melnyk, 1991).
b)  Diamond drilling in 12 holes, for a total of 3927.5 metres, at the south side of
the South Leduc glacier and under the South Zone.
This work was supervised by Bell Copper employees (Wasterneys, 2007).
No other drilling has been conducted on the Property since 2006.
33
AEROTEM II AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY 
In 2005, Bell Copper commissioned an airborne geophysical survey of the Property 
from Aeroquest Limited, comprising 1206 line-km. Surveys employed a magnetic and 
AeroTEM  II  helicopter  electromagnetic  system.  The  AeroTEM  II  is  a  coincident  coil 
helicopter-borne time domain EM system. See Rudd (2005).
Magnetic Response  
The magnetic data provide a high resolution map of the distribution of the magnetic 
mineral content of the survey area. The sources for anomalous magnetic responses 
are  thought  to  be  predominantly magnetite because  of the  relative  abundance  and 
strength of response (high magnetic susceptibility) of magnetite over other magnetic 
minerals such as pyrrhotite.
According  to  Rudd  (2005),  the  magnetic  data  (Fig.  9)  ranges  from  lows  of 
approximately 55,500 nT to highs of up to 60,660nT with an average background of 
56,375 nT. The area is characterized by a series of broad and multi-lobed magnetic 
highs which likely define mafic lithologies, such as the basalts and the Bucke Glacier 
intrusive  suite.  The  highest  magnetic  response  is  observed  approximately  2  km 
northwest  of  the  Granduc  mine  site    (Fig.  9;Point  A).  This  feature  has  a 
comparatively  small  strike  length  (750  m)  and  is  semi-circular  with  a  amplitude  of 
over 3,700 nT. However the body does not show an associated EM response which 
may indicate that the body has remnant magnetization. Subsequent drilling by Bell 
Copper showed this body to be part of the Bucke Glacier intrusive suite.
Higher frequency magnetic response images the strike of the sedimentary packages 
in  the  western  portion  of  the  survey  block  and  the  magnetite-bearing  Mine  series 
sedimentary and tuff succession. Of potential significance in the interpretation of the 
Mine  series  exploration  potential  is  the  pattern  of  magnetic  response  along  strike 
southward  from  the  North  Leduc  glacier,  across  Granduc  mountain,  through  to  the 
South  Zone.  Magnetic  responses  appear  to  be  most  intense  at  lower  elevations  on 
the  flanks  of  the  Granduc  mountain.  This  correlates  with  geological  mapping  data 
that suggests lower copper grades and less sulphide-magnetite mineralization in the 
Mine series at higher elevations. Best copper grades are found at the 3200 level and 
below (near or below the South and North Leduc glacier ice  levels). Thickness and 
grades of the Mine series exhalative mineralization attenuates up dip.
Faulting can also be identified by patterns in the magnetic data contours or colours. 
Faults often appear as lineaments and often have strike length of several kilometres. 
Offsets  in  narrow,  magnetic  stratigraphic  trends  also  delineate  structure.    Sharp 
contrasts  in  magnetic  lithologies  may  indicate  large  displacements  along  strike-slip 
or thrust faults. Several faults can be interpreted from the magnetic data throughout 
the survey area. Most prominent in the survey is the north-south lineament of the 
Granduc-Western fault system.
AeroTEM II Electromagnetic Survey 
According to Rudd (2005), the EM data show that the majority of the bedrock in the 
area is highly resistive. However, several anomalous conductive zones throughout 
the survey area have been identified where the EM response persist to the later

channels (Fig. 10).  Anomalies that have attenuated amplitude in the early channels 
accompanied by a slow rate of decay (persisting to the later channels) indicate the 
better bedrock conductors (Fig. 10; red and orange symbols).
The area of the Granduc mine site shows well defined EM responses (Fig. 9, Point B) 
which  trend  north -south  and  closely  follow  a  magnetic boundary  discussed  above.  
Perhaps the most interesting observed response occurs south of the Granduc mine 
site, under the South Leduc glacier (See Rudd, 2005 and refer to picks on L10750 
through  L1070).    Here  the  anomalies  show  moderately  high  conductance  (higher 
than the mine site) and occur on a magnetic high (Fig. 9, Point C).
In interpreting the EM responses over the Granduc mine, it is important to observe 
that  the  massive  sulphide  and  magnetite-bearing  ores  have  been  mined  out  to 
surface.
Subsequent to the airborne geophysical program, Point C was drilled later in 2005. 
The southward continuation of the Mine series succession was intersected, including 
the A and B zones. In addition to significant pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-magnetite 
mineralization, several zones of graphic chert were intersected. The combination of 
the  conductive  sulphides  and  graphite  explain  the  strong  EM  response.  The  Mine 
series in this area contains about 15% or more magnetite, explaining the coincident 
magnetic responses.
The linear zone of better bedrock conductor picks on Granduc mountain are mapping 
the  expression  of  the  Mine  series  and  Upper  Footwall  series  lithologies.  The  EM 
responses are likely detecting the presence of graphite, sulphides and clays with the 
Mine series, and within the Granduc Fault.
The linear zone of better bedrock conductor picks on the north and east side of the 
(North)  Leduc  glacier  are  mapping  the  expression  of  the  Lower  to  Middle  Jurassic 
Hazelton  group  sedimentary  rocks  and  possibly  a  sub-parallel  fault  to  the  Granduc 
fault. This area has not been prospected by Bell Copper.   
PROSPECTING 
In  2006,  Bell  Copper  personnel  followed  up  on  the  recommendations  of  McGuigan 
(2005) to prospect the area of massive sulphide boulders in talus and local till at the 
northern  fringe  of  the  retreating  ice  field  on  Granduc  mountain  (Melnyk,  1991). 
Nearby magnetic highs in the AeroTEM II survey confirmed the target.
The  area  has  now  melted  free  of  ice,  and  has  exposed  the  new  discovery  by  Bell 
Copper.  Termed  the  JK  Zone,  it  consists  of  heavily  disseminated  and  stringer 
pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and magnetite in mafic tuffs and sediments, near the 
contacts with intermediate to mafic intrusions. (Marsh, Oct. 25, 2006 News Release).

DRILLING
DIAMOND DRILLING 
The  Property  is  a  past  producing  mine.  Diamond  drilling  was  conducted  as  part  of 
exploration,  development  and  ore-definition  during  the  operation  of  the  Property 
from  1953  to  1984.  A  total  of  1,901  diamond  drill  holes  that  total  141,374  m  are 
recorded  in  the  mine  and  exploration  diamond  drill  logs  for  the  Property,  prior  to 
2005.  It  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  report  to  verify  and  summarize  the  extensive 
drilling  on  the  Property.  That  verification  will  be  part  of  the  Phase  One  exploration 
program recommended herein.
In 2005, Bell Copper conducted a limited diamond drilling program of 5 holes, for a 
total of 2087.6 metres, at the south extension of the main mineralized horizons of 
the Granduc Mine, under the South Leduc glacier. The 2005 work was supervised by 
one of the authors of this report (Harrison).
In  2006,  Bell  Copper  conducted  a  limited  diamond  drilling  program  12  holes,  for  a 
total of 3927.5 metres Drilling was conducted at the new JK discovery, at the south 
side of the South Leduc glacier and under the South Zone. Work was supervised by 
Bell Copper employees (Wasterneys, 2007). 
SOUTH LEDUC - SOUTH ZONE DRILLING RESULTS 
Diamond drilling of the Mine Series succession in 2005 (Table 2) was focused on the 
northern  side  of  the  South  Leduc  glacier,  in  a  area  with  clear  geological  continuity 
with the main Granduc deposit horizons. Most of the drilling in 2005 was positioned 
to  provide  a  test  of  the  west  dipping  Mine  Series  horizons  from  hanging  wall  to 
footwall. Most intersected both the A Zone (hanging wall) and the B Zone (Footwall). 
The footwall of the Mine Series  is  a short interval of Unit 3v, mafic volcanic rocks. 
Drilling  in  2006  targeted  the  south  side  of  the  South  Leduc  glacier  and  the 
succession in the South Zone (Table 3). Drilling in that program was less successful 
in intersecting the Mine Series succession. Most drill holes intersected the A horizon 
only. The two most southerly holes, under the South Zone cliff face mineralization, 
were not drilled sufficiently deep to test the A Zone or any of the lower parts of the 
Mine Series. 
JK ZONE DRILLING RESULTS 
Bell Copper completed 5 diamond drill holes totalling 1240 metres in length, in late 
2006. Bell Copper tested the newly discovered JK Zone and an adjacent ice-covered 
aeromagnetic  anomaly  discovered  by  an  airborne  survey  in  the  spring  of  2005, 
located  up  slope  from  a  train  of  massive  magnetite  and  sulphide  till  boulders 
(Melnyk, 1991, discovery). All five holes were collared from the same drill pad and 
were  fanned  out  in  easterly  and  down-dip  directions  to  assess  the  continuity  of 
mineralization along the north-northeast-striking JK Zone (Table 3).

This array of drill holes demonstrated continuity of the footwall mineralization over 
distances of 150 metres along strike and 100 metres down dip.
According to Marsh (News Release, Jan. 2007), all five drill holes intersected the JK 
Zone and at least one of two subparallel zones of magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite iron 
formation situated 80 metres and 140 metres further into the footwall.
Drill  intersections  of  the  shallow  JK  Zone  returned  low grade  metal  values  and  are 
consequently  not  reported  in  Table  3.  However,  both  of  the  two  footwall  zones 
produced  drill  intersections  containing  substantial  thicknesses  of  magnetite-pyrite-
chalcopyrite iron formation.
The discovery of the JK Zone and drilling of the footwall mineralization demonstrates 
that  the  same  copper-bearing  zone  that  hosted  the  Granduc  Mine  extends  over  2 
kilometres further northward beyond the north end of the mine.

These results, taken together with the South Leduc-South Zone results indicate the 
Besshi-type  pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite  mineralization  is  aerially  extensive.  Fine 
grained  clastic  rocks,  chert  and  mafic  tuffs  host  mineralization  over  a  large  strike 
length on Granduc mountain, and the South Zone. Drilling and magnetic survey data 
indicate that the thicknesses and grades are increasing to depth.
SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH
Sampling  that  formed  the  body  of  diamond  drilling,  surface  and  underground  data 
supporting the interpretation and conclusions in this report are described as follows:
(a) diamond  drilling  in  the  deposit  was  conducted  on  50  ft  section  intervals, 
oriented in east-west section lines, which are orthogonal to the trend of the 
deposits;
(b) all  drill  hole  collars  were  surveyed,  and  dip  tests  taken;  after  1979,  longer 
holes  used  photographic  hole  surveys,  as  magnetic  bearings  are  unreliable 
near the pyrrhotite and magnetite bearing deposits;
(c) diamond  drilling  was  mostly  done  in  AQ  and  BQ  core  sizes,  but  longer
exploration holes, employed NQ and HQ core sizes;
(d) most  diamond  drill  holes  were  sampled  using  half  split  core,  except  in  the 
area  of  the  active  mining,  where  some  entire  core  was  sampled  during 
definition drilling work; and
(e) assay sample intervals corresponded to geological contacts, which are mostly
visible to the geologist.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
All results reported herein are cited from previous mine operations and exploration 
programs  at  the  Property. No  new  exploration  work  has  been  done  for  this  report. 
Consequently, the following fairly summarizes sample handling on the Property:
(a) sampling  and  assaying  up  to  1984  was  conducted  by  the  operators  of  the 
Property and assaying, mostly conducted by mill-site assay laboratories under 
the supervision of BC Certified Assayers;
(b) during  the  period  1991  to  1993,  the  technical  work,  including  sampling  and 
sample  handling  was  conducted  by  personnel  supervised  by  one  author 
(McGuigan), analytical work was performed by Acme Laboratories, a Certified 
Laboratory  located  in  Vancouver,  BC.  Lead  isotope  determination  and  age 
determinations  were  conducted  by  the  Mineral  Deposits  Research  Unit 
(“MDRU”), and other research facilities at the University of British Columbia, 
all conform to acceptable provincial and national testing standards;
(c) during 2005, the technical work, including sampling and sample handling was 
conducted  by  Cambria  and  personnel  supervised  by  one  author  (Harrison), 
analytical work was performed by Acme Laboratories, a  Certified Laboratory 
located in Vancouver, BC;
(d) during  2006,  the  technical  work  was  supervised  by  Bell  Copper  employees, 
under  the  direction  of  geologist  Tim  Marsh,  PhD,  and  analytical  work  was 
performed by Acme Laboratories, a Certified Laboratory located in Vancouver, 
BC;
(e) no  resource  estimates  were  made,  or  additional  samples  taken,  for  this 
report,  and  therefore,  no  quality  control  measures  were  employed,  beyond 
the in-laboratory quality control measures; and
(f)  in  the  authors’  opinion,  previous  resource  and  reserve  estimates  are 
sufficiently  reliable  for  guiding  future  exploration  of  the  Property,  however, 
prior  to  the  preparation  of  a  new  mineral  resource  estimation  under  the 
guidelines  of  the  Instrument,  a  new  verification  diamond  drilling  program 
must be initiated.
DATA VERIFICATION
The Property is a past producing mine. The authors were involved in much of the last 
phase of mine and exploration geology, and are personally aware of the exploration 
results relied upon in this report. In preparing this report, the authors conducted the 
following  checks  upon  the  data  that  is  relied  upon  and  make  the  following 
observations:
(a) data  on  the  Property  was  verified  as  part  of  the  previous  Technical  Report, 
prepared  for  Bell  Copper  prior  to  the  2005  exploration  programs,  see 
McGuigan (2005);
41
(b) the  surveyed  locations  of  Crown  Granted  claims,  underground  workings, 
Granduc  Tunnel  control  surveys,  diamond  drill  holes  and  surface  geological 
mapping  were  verified  by  retrieving  the  data  from  technical  records  of  the 
Granduc mine, and reconciling them to recent control survey work on file with 
the BC Surveyor General;
(c) the  authors  reviewed  files  on  the  production  history,  and  historic  mineral 
resource estimations on the Granduc deposit, to obtain geological information 
and  to  reconcile  those  estimations  to  the  remaining  historic  in-situ  mineral 
resource estimates on the Property;
(d) the  authors’  verification  is  limited  due  to  the  lack  of  supporting  information 
such  as  assay  records  that  were  used  to  prepare  the  diamond  drilling  logs, 
and  the  authors  did  not  expend  the  effort  to  prepare  an  alternate 
interpretation of the geology and correlations that support the historic mineral 
resource estimations;
(e) a detailed new estimation of the in-situ mineral resources was not prepared 
by the authors because the scope of this report is limited to identifying areas 
for future exploration, and the historic mineral resource estimates are relied 
upon for geological information only; and,
(f)  the  author’s  personal  experience  (McGuigan’s)  with  the  mine  geological 
department  at  Granduc  indicates  that  the  employed  polygonal  reserve 
estimates are quite sufficient to guide the exploration that is recommended in 
this report.
In 1984, one author (McGuigan) supervised the storage of all the diamond drill cores 
from exploration programs, and each fourth section of the definition diamond drilling 
within  the  mine  area,  in  a  warehouse  storage  facility  in  nearby  Stewart,  BC.  The 
inventory of the diamond drill holes in storage is given in Dawson (1994) and all core 
remains in good condition at the time of the writing of this report. This diamond drill 
core is available for future verification work, at the time of a new program of mineral 
resource estimation.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
GRANDUC MINE 
Several  mineral  resource  and  mineral  reserve  estimates  were  prepared  on  the 
Granduc deposits during mine development and production. Unpublished production 
data  from  the  Granduc  deposits  from  1968  to  1984  were  15.42  million  tonnes 
(Melnyk, 1991).
The  reader  is  cautioned  that  all  the  historic  mineral  resource  estimates  lack 
verification  by  the  authors.  Reports  detailing  these  historical  estimates  are  not 
available in detail to the authors, and no attempt has been made to reconcile those 
estimates with the current understanding of the geology of the Property. The reader 
is also cautioned not to rely upon any of these historic mineral resource estimates. 
There is no assurance that any of these historic mineral resource estimates can be 
confirmed under the categories and standards set out in sections 1.3 and 1.4 of the 
Instrument.  Accordingly,  they  cannot  be  relied  upon  except  as  geological 
information.
Table  4  (from  Schmidt,  et  al,  1983)  is  a  tabulation  of  each  major  historic  mineral 
resource estimate in the period 1963 to 1983. The location of the zones is shown on 
Figure 4.
The  historic  in-situ  mineral  resource  estimate  above  the  1600  level  prepared  by 
Newmont  in  1966  was  39,442,403  tonnes  grading  1.73%  copper  (Schmidt,  et  al, 
1983). This figure is commonly used in the literature for the size and grade of the 
Granduc  deposit.  This  historic  Newmont  mineral  resource  estimate  relied  upon  a 
geological projection of the Granduc deposits below the 2175 level, below the area of 
diamond  drilling.  This  historic  mineral  resource  estimate  was  not  prepared  in 
accordance with the  categories  or standards  set  out  in  sections  1.3 and  1.4  of the 
Instrument; and cannot be relied upon except as geological information.
However, according to Schmidt (1983) additional drilling by Canada Wide Mines Ltd. 
near  the  2100  elevation  concluded  that  the  grades  do  not  diminish  at  depth.  He 
further concluded that “in-situ averages for all zones has been extremely consistent, 
ranging  from  1.93  to  1.73  [copper].  There  are  no  indications  that  this  will  change 
with depth below Block 3 [below 2175]”.
Prior the closure of the mine, the remaining in-situ mineral resource above the 2175 
level was estimated to be 5,083,178 tonnes, grading 1.84% copper (Schmidt, et al, 
1983), not including the resources in the North Zone (see the next section). The “In-
situ Reserve” stated by Schmidt, et al, 1983 did not describe the progress of mining 
in the F ore body. The F ore body was partly developed and it is unclear if it was fully 
extracted  prior  to  mine  closure  in  1985.  The  Schmidt  “reserve”  estimate  was 
prepared prior to the establishment of the current categories or standards set out in 
sections  1.3  and  1.4  of  the  Instrument;  and  cannot  be  relied  upon  except  as 
geological information.
The  following  historical  mineral  resource  estimates  cited  in  Tables  5  and  6  do  not 
meet  the  current  standards  of  the  Instrument  with  respect  to  the  disclosure  of
43
mineral  resource  estimates  and  are  considered  geological  information  only.  In 
addition, the  authors  have  not  reconciled the total mineral  resource  inventory with 
the  historic  production.  No  estimation  of  the  remaining  mineral  resource  has  been 
made  by  the  authors.  All  figures  are  cited  are  therefore  for  geological  information 
only.

The Schmidt, et al, (1983) historic mineral resource estimates above the 2175 level 
were prepared with numerous diamond drill hole intersections and some data from 
sampling of development headings.
Drilling data from below the 2175 level (Block 5 and the 1600 elevation to sea level) 
is widely spaced. These historic mineral resource estimates were termed inferred or 
“potential” by Schmidt, et al, (1983).
The above historical mineral resource estimates do not meet the current standards of 
the  Instrument  with  respect  to  the  disclosure  of  mineral  resource  estimates. 
Additionally,  they  have  not  been  verified  by  the  authors.  Therefore  they  are 
considered  to  be  geological  information  only.  The  reader  is  cautioned  not  to  rely 
upon this information.
Much  of  the  above  geological  information  forms  the  basis  for  targeting  Phase  One 
and  Phase  Two  diamond  drilling,  with  the  aim  to  verify  these  historic  mineral 
resource estimates and to confirm the continuity, tonnage and grades of the Granduc 
deposits from 2600 level, downwards to sea level. 
NORTH ZONE 
Historical in-situ mineral resource estimates for Zone 1 and Zone 2 in the North Zone 
is 2.05 million tonnes averaging 1.84% Cu and 1.48 million tonnes averaging 1.51% 
Cu (Freckelton et al., 1982). No production development or mining has occurred in 
the North Zone.
The historical mineral resource estimates for the North Zone do not meet the current 
standards  of  the  Instrument  with  respect  to  the  reporting  of  mineral  resource 
estimates  and  are  considered  geological  information  only.  All  figures  are  cited  are 
therefore for geological information only.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
GEOLOGY 
Rocks mapped on Granduc mountain and to the north are separated into two easily 
recognizable units termed the Western and eastern series that are separated by the 
north-northwest striking South Unuk shear zone.
Western series rocks are Late Triassic or older in age, and are correlated with the 
Late  Triassic  Stuhini  Group.  They  consist  of  moderately  to  highly  foliated  schists, 
phyllites,  marbles  and  gneisses.  North  of  Granduc  mountain,  western  series  rocks 
are  subdivided  into  six  lithological  rock  types;  similar  rock  types  on  Granduc 
mountain (units 1-8) have been described by Klepacki and Read (1981) and include 
the Granduc Mine series (McGuigan and Marr, 1979).
Eastern  series  rocks are Middle Jurassic in age and correlated with the Lower to 
Middle  Jurassic  Hazelton  Group.  They  consist  of  relatively  undeformed,  mainly 
volcanic  rocks  that  are  subdivided  into  three  conformable  stratigraphic  units.  U-Pb 
(zircon) dates from the dacitic tuffs both north of the North Leduc glacier and south 
of the Granduc deposit are similar in age to felsic units in the footwall of the precious 
metal rich Eskay Creek massive sulphide deposit (Bartsch, 1993) and correlate to the 
Betty Creek formation.
Bucke  Glacier  stock  forms  a  northwesterly  elongate  body  (approximately  10  km 
long by 2 km wide) in western series rocks north of Granduc mountain. It consists of 
fine to coarse grained hornblende-biotite diorite to monzodiorite. The contacts of the 
stock are parallel to subparallel to regional foliation, and the stock is foliated itself, 
however  to  a  lesser  degree  than  the  enclosing  western  series  rocks.  Intermediate 
intrusive rocks exposed on the north side of Granduc mountain (Klepacki and Read, 
1981) and intersected in North Zone drilling (Freckelton et al., 1982) are correlated 
with  the  Bucke  Glacier  suite  based  on  similar  lithologies  and  U-Pb  (zircon)  dates 
(Childe, 1994). The age of these intrusions is late Triassic.
The South Unuk shear zone is a north-northwest striking subvertical fault that has 
dominantly a sinistral sense of displacement; it is mapped from the Iskut river area 
south to Granduc mountain, a distance of 60 km. On Granduc mountain, and to the 
north (Divelbliss, Duke and North Leduc areas), western series rocks record strongly 
heterogeneous  deformation  with  a  large  component  of  simple  shear  in  a  ductile  to 
semi-brittle  environment;  these  features  indicate  western  series  rocks  should  be 
included as part of the shear zone (Lewis, 1994). The southern segment of the South 
Unuk shear zone is the HKF fault is a north-northwest striking steeply dipping fault; 
locally,  an  ultramafic  horizon  of  dunite,  talc-chlorite  schist  and  chlorite-serpentine 
schist occurs along the fault.
Four phases of folding were documented by Klepacki and Read (1981) on Granduc 
mountain. The first two phases are the most intense and affected the distribution of 
ore  bodies  underground  in  the  Granduc  Mine.  Lewis  (1994)  mapped  similar  style 
folds north of the North Leduc glacier (Figs. 6,7) and attributes F1 and F2 folds on 
Granduc mountain to progressive deformation associated with the South Unuk shear 
zone.  This  new  interpretation  is  significant  because,  previously,  the  consistent
46
northerly  striking  and  steeply  west  dipping  S1  foliation  measured  by  Klepacki  and 
Read (1981) was interpreted to represent a single limb of a major F1 fold. According 
to Lewis (1994) a major F1 fold is unlikely, and its postulated occurrence should not 
be  used  to  guide  exploration.  Notwithstanding  Lewis’  conclusions,  repetition  of 
similar  units  on  Granduc  mountain  might  be  explained  by  some  large  F1  fold 
closures,  such  as  the  closure  documented  on  the  west  side  (hanging  wall)  of  the 
Granduc-Western fault set.
Lithogeochemical  studies  of  mainly  Unit  2  rocks  from  the  North  Zone  (Granduc 
mountain) indicates: (i) intermediate volcanic rocks (field term) are tholeiitic  mafic 
volcanics and are most like mid-ocean ridge or marginal basin basalts (Wilson, 1989) 
when  plotted  on  REE  plots  and  trace  element  tectonic  discrimination  diagrams; 
however the slightly enriched LILE and gentle negative REE pattern suggests some 
crustal  contamination  from  a  subduction  zone,  (ii)  samples  from  a  mafic  sill  (field 
term) are chemically intermediate in composition and have a similar, but higher REE 
pattern to the mafic volcanics; similar REE element chemistry and the identical U-Pb 
(zircon) dates from these units suggest they are genetically related, and (iii) rocks 
logged as 'cherty tuff' or 'dacitic tuff' have REE patterns similar to that of the mafic 
volcanic rocks indicating they are not dacitic in composition as logged in the field.
U-Pb (zircon) analysis of three samples from the Granduc mountain area returned 
the  following  dates:  (i)  the  Footwall  series  mafic  volcanic  rocks  (North  Zone)  are 
230.5  +  14  Ma,  (ii)  an  intermediate  sill  that  intrudes  the  mafic  volcanics  has  a 
identical age within error of 232 + 3 Ma, and (iii) the felsic volcanic rocks (eastern 
series) south of the Granduc deposit are 185.4 + 9 Ma.
Lead  (galena  and  microcline)  isotope  analysis  of  four  samples  from  Granduc 
mountain  indicates:  (i)  Two  samples  from  the  B  ore  body  are  relatively  non-
radiogenic, and compared to mineralization of known age within Stikinia, indicates a 
pre-Jurassic age, and (ii) two samples from veins cutting the Footwall mafic volcanics 
(North  Zone)  plot  within  the  Stewart  Mining  Camp  Tertiary  cluster  as  defined  by 
Alldrick  et  al.  (1993);  deposits  of  this  age  in  the  Stewart  area  include  the  Porter-
Idaho/Prosperity and Indian.
Phase 1 and Phase 2 Deformation: Subsequent deformation has remobilized and 
recrystallised  the  sulphides  as  disseminations,  layers  that  parallel  foliation,  and 
crosscutting  breccia  zones  along  axial  planar  joints  and  shear  surfaces.  The 
deformation is largely related to shearing in a ductile to semi-brittle shear system of 
the South Unuk shear zone (Lewis, 1994). Under the interpretation of Lewis, Phase 2 
deformation is only the culmination of an earlier stage shear deformation of Phase 1. 
Early movement was left lateral and resulted in foliated (S1) stratified rocks and less 
well foliated intrusive rocks, in F1 fold structures. This shearing continued to be left 
lateral, in a progression to a somewhat more brittle phase of movement within the 
South  Unuk  fault  zone,  resulting  in  tight  to  open  F2  fold  structures  and  shearing 
along  F2  axial  planar  (S2)  surfaces  (the  “transpositional  slips”  in  the  Granduc 
deposits). The combination of this left lateral shearing has structurally thickened the 
Granduc deposits in the hinges of F2 fold structures, attenuates the limbs, and gives 
the  dominantly  moderately  south  plunging  orientation  to  the  thickest  and  richest 
parts of the Granduc deposits (McGuigan and Tucker, 1981).
47
This progressive deformation has resulted in the western limbs of F2 fold structures 
moving significantly southward in the area of the Granduc Mine. The attitude of this 
broad ductile to semi-brittle shearing is 0200/700W and has resulted in a broad zone 
of shear deformed and comminuted sediments and volcanic rocks.
Geological Succession Similar to Windy Craggy: This above order of major units 
at Granduc is similar to the Windy Craggy succession. In this interpretation, Units 5, 
3  and  2  were  a  locus  for  the  intrusion  of  large  sills  of  Bucke  Creek  fine  to  coarse 
grained  hornblende-biotite  diorite  to  monzodiorite.  Thinner  sills  might  be  wrongly 
interpreted  as  flows.  In  part,  these  bodies  were  likely  intruded  into  wet,  partly 
unconsolidated clastic sediments, similar to the geology of the Guaymas Basin in the 
Gulf  of  California.  The  intrusions  were  responsible  for  the  initial  onset  of  mafic 
volcanism, hydrothermal activity and formation of Besshi-type volcanogenic massive 
sulphides,  tourmaline-rich  chert  and  argillite,  and  magnetite  iron  formation  and 
related stringer zone veining and alteration.
Effect of the Granduc-Western Fault zone: The Granduc-Western fault zone is a 
brittle shear structure and strikes at a low angle to the earlier South Unuk shearing 
and  foliation.  The  sense  of  movement  on  the  younger  Granduc-Western  faults  is 
right lateral. As the Mine Series trends southward, it moves progressively eastward 
of the Granduc fault,  and any mineralization is likely to be affected only by the F1 
and F2 fold structures, in a left lateral sense of displacement and folding. In contrast, 
as the Mine Series passes northward, the important conclusion from this data is that 
individual  mineralized  bodies  that  comprise  the  Granduc  deposit  will  pass  into  the 
Granduc  fault.  Specifically,  the  important  F  ore  body  is  terminated  on  its  northern 
extremity against the Granduc fault, the rake line of that intersection is evident on 
longitudinal sections of the deposit. 
MINERALIZATION 
Besshi-type  (Mafic-siliclastic)  VMS  Characteristics  Recognized.  The  data, 
taken  together  with,  and  in  comparison  to,  other  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide 
deposits  worldwide,  indicate  that  the  Granduc  deposit  is  a  Besshi-type  massive 
sulphide deposit. The descriptive model term for such deposits is “mafic-siliclastic”. 
The  Property  contains  very  significant  volumes  of  mafic  to  intermediate  volcanic 
rocks  within  a  clastic  sedimentary  succession  of  Upper  Triassic  age.  The  Granduc 
deposits,  including  those  of  the  North  Zone  and  the  South  Zone  (Figs.  4,6,7), 
demonstrate  a  very  significant  scale  of  Besshi-type  copper-silver-gold  volcanogenic 
massive  sulphide  deposits  and  a  strong  geological  similarity  to  the  Windy  Craggy 
deposit. These similarities include host rock chemistry and lithologies, age, tectonic 
setting and sulphide mineralogy. The Windy Craggy is the largest Besshi deposit in 
the world. See Table 1.
Three  Cycles  of  VMS  Deposition  Recognized:  This Late Triassic western series 
(Stuhini  Group)  succession  contains  syngenetic  mineralization  that  consists  of 
sulphides--pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, rare sphalerite and galena--and magnetite 
iron formation hosted within chert and pyroclastic rocks of the Granduc Mine series. 
The  Mine  series,  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  mine,  contains  three  cycles  of 
sedimentation, volcanism, and massive sulphide deposition, associated with graphitic 
chert, tourmaline-bearing chert and magnetite iron formation.
48
Three major mineralized zones have been identified- Granduc deposit, North 
Zone and South Zone:
(a) Granduc deposit consists of a number of individual ore bodies--A, B1, B2, C 
and F (Fig. 4)--that are structurally controlled by south plunging F2 folds. The 
A,  B1  and  F  ore  bodies  average  1.9%  Cu,  while  the  B2  and  C  ore  bodies 
average  1.3%  and  1.7%  Cu,  respectively.  The  deposit  is  separated  into  a 
northern  and  southern  block  that  is  separated  by  a  weakly  mineralized  to 
barren zone. The F ore body lies in the northern block (north of 11 300 N at 
the  2600  level)  while  all  others  lie  in  the  southern  block.  Mineralization  is 
essentially  stratabound,  however  deformation  has  caused  sulphide 
remobilization  resulting  locally  in  cross-cutting  relationships.  It  consists  of 
varying proportions of chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, magnetite, minor pyrite, and 
rare sphalerite and galena.
(b) North Zone is between 14 600N and 15 800N approximately 1.5 km north of 
the Granduc Mine (Fig. 4). Mineralization was first intersected in surface drill 
hole 153-1 by Newmont Ltd. in 1977. Assays from this hole were 1.39% Cu 
over 10.7 m and 3.29% Cu over 8.7 m. Two separate mineralized zones were 
identified  in  the  Upper  Footwall  series  (Unit  2).  Historic  mineral  resource 
estimates  are  2.05  million  tonnes  averaging  1.84%  Cu  and  1.48  million 
tonnes averaging 1.51% Cu (Freckelton et al., 1982). Both these zones are 
open to the north.
(c)  South  Zone is between 6 000 and 5 000N, approximately 1.5 km south of 
the Granduc Mine (Fig. 4). Granduc Mines Ltd. explored this area in 1961 and 
completed a 152 m adit and a number of surface and underground drill holes. 
Drill  hole  250  intersected  two  zones  assaying  3.84%  Cu  over  14.3  m  and 
3.27%  Cu  over  13.72  m;  true  thickness  are  substantially  less  than  the  drill 
indicated  metreages.  Mineralization  is  hosted  in  volcanic  conglomerate  and 
breccia thought to be the facies equivalents of the Granduc Mine series.
Geological  Setting  Re-interpreted  herein:  In  addition,  the  relative  age  of  the 
mafic volcanic rocks (flows and tuffs), intermediate foliated sills and the Bucke Creek 
stock show the Granduc deposits occur in the following setting:
(a) contact  relationships  and  age  determinations  indicate  that  the  Bucke  Creek 
intrusions  and  its  associated  sills  are  likely  co-eval  with  the  mafic  volcanic 
rocks that were termed “Mine series” and “Footwall” in earlier work;
(b) the  Bucke  Creek  stock  mostly  intrudes  Upper  Triassic  Stuhini  clastic 
sedimentary rocks, that have been previously mapped as a “hanging wall” to 
the Granduc deposits; this is contradictory to the concept that major co-eval 
intrusions should lie in the earliest, and lowest rocks in a succession;
(c)  smaller  sill-like  bodies  of  Bucke  Creek  composition  follow  the  stratified
volcanic and clastic sedimentary units of the Mine series (Unit 3) and Unit 2;
(d) mafic  flows  and  tuffs  of  similar  composition  are  interstratified  with
sedimentary rocks of Unit 2 and 3;
49
(e) therefore,  the  author  provisionally  concludes  that  the  Upper  Triassic  Stuhini 
clastic  sedimentary  rocks  are  the  footwall  to  the  Mine  series.  In  this 
interpretation,  the  general  succession  is  from  a  base  of  calcareous  wackes 
and siltstones, and graphic argillites (Units 6 to 9);
(f)  that  calcareous  clastic  section  is  overlain  by  pyritic,  graphic  argillite, 
limestone,  mafic  volcanic  breccia,  flows  and  tuffs  (Units  3,  4  and  5,  plus 
western  parts  of  Unit  2),  including  the  Mine  series  volcanogenic  massive 
sulphides, exhalative chert, and magnetite iron formation;
(g) in turn, these units are overlain by pyritic argillite, mafic tuff and flows of Unit 
2, and then, a section of mostly mafic flows and pillow basalts of Unit 1 (Figs. 
6, 7).
DISCUSSION OF EXPLORATION TARGETS  
General 
Diamond  drilling  programs  in  2005  and  2006,  combined  with  the  technical  work  in 
1991 and 1993, have successfully confirmed the following:
1.  The  mineralized  Mine  series  succession  is  confirmed  in  geophysical  and 
diamond drilling information to continue under the South Leduc glacier to the 
South Zone.
2.  Upper  Footwall  series  rocks  are  pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-magnetite 
mineralized,  with  significant  precious  metals,  at  the  JK  Zone  which  lies  one 
kilometer north of the northernmost North Zone intersections.
The Property contains very significant volumes of mafic to intermediate magmatism, 
within a clastic sedimentary succession of Upper Triassic age. The Granduc deposits, 
the North Zone and the South Zone demonstrate a world class scale of Besshi-type 
copper-silver volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits. The focus on this exploration 
program should be for the discovery of a new, large massive sulphide deposit.
The  following  target  descriptions  are  conceptual  in  nature.  Insufficient  exploration 
has  been  conducted  to  determine  if  additional  mineral  deposits  of  the  magnitudes 
cited below actually occur on the Property.
Data  from  past  exploration  and  mining  operations  indicates  that  the  full 
extent of the Besshi massive sulphide targets on the Property have not been 
fully explored. The grades and quantity of the main Cu-Au-Ag mineralized horizons 
have  not  diminished  down  plunge  on  the  main  Granduc  deposits,  to  the  limit  of 
drilling, according to Schmidt, et al, (1983). Furthermore, termination of the F Zone 
on the north extremity is against a post-deposit fault (the Granduc fault), according 
to  McGuigan  (2005).  Therefore  it  is  reasonable  to  target  the  following  conceptual 
deposit characteristics:
(a)  Besshi-type  massive  sulphide  targets of 40 to 150 million tonnes of 1.7
to 2.5% copper with zinc, silver, gold and cobalt contents;
50
(b)  Higher grade Besshi-type massive sulphide deposits, more proximal to 
a vent source, stringer zones and with superior deposition sites; South Zone 
grades  show  this  is  possible;  North  Zone  geology  also  shows  promise  for 
vent-proximal  targets;  some  portions  of  the  Granduc  deposits  and  South 
Zone  have  intersections  in  the  3  to  10%  copper  range,  but  lack  continuity. 
Facies changes towards the South Zone or, for instance, in the area of Target 
5 (see below), might allow for deposits above 2.5% copper; and
(c)  Plunging  zones  of  very  high  grade  massive  sulphides,  in  areas  of 
remobilization  and  structural  repetition  by  F2  fold  structures;  any  of  the 
existing  or  targeted  zones  might  contain  fold  structures  with  these 
characteristics.
conclusions,  derived
The 
structural, 
lithogeochemistry and geochronological studies on the Property, indicate a number of 
additional deposits, and extensions to known deposits, of Besshi-style volcanogenic 
massive  sulphides  reasonably  targeted  on  the  Property,  in  areas  of  projected 
favourable geology. They include the following diamond drilling targets.
stratigraphic,
from
the
combined
Target 1: Down plunge of the existing Granduc deposit.  
The focus for this exploration should be down-plunge of the F and B1 ore bodies (Fig. 
11).  These  deposits  have  the  greatest  thickness,  grade  and  continuity  of  all  ore 
bodies at Granduc. The latest round of drilling at Granduc showed that grades do not 
diminish towards the 2100 level according to Schmidt, et al, (1983). The F and B1 
ore  bodies  are  probably  the  fold  and  fault  continuations  of  the  same  higher-grade 
sulphide-magnetite  lens.  These  zones  occur  in  an  area  of  tight  F2  fold  structures 
(Figs. 4, 6，7), and significant structural repetition and remobilization is possible.
Drilling of Target 1 should be conducted to firstly, confirm the historic drill results, 
then secondly, to target the down plunge extensions down to at least the 1000 level, 
initially. The Target 1 combined with Target 3 areas, have the potential to add 5 to 
10 million tonnes or more to the mineral resources within a short distance of existing 
mine infrastructure. The potential is considerably higher, if the projections made by 
Schmidt, et al, (1983) can be confirmed with new diamond drilling.
Target 2: South Zone.  
The Target 2 area contains are relatively high grade (in excess of 3% Cu) diamond 
drill intersections, hosted in a rock unit that is the southern continuation of the Mine 
series rocks. Drilling in 2006 was not favourable. However, it is likely that the past 
operator tested only the highest levels of the Mine series succession.
The South Zone remains open to depth and to the south.  Drilling can be done from 
sites  constructed  on  the  southern  edge  of  the  South  Leduc  glacier.  It  is  not 
recommended to drill the higher elevations of the South Zone but rather, to focus on 
drilling the zone at the 2600 level and below.

Due to the distance between the South Zone and the main Granduc mine workings, 
Target  2  is  not  recommended  for  testing,  until  Targets  1  and  3  are  fully  and 
successfully tested with diamond drilling.
Target 3: Beneath the South Leduc glacier.  
The  B1  ore  body  forms  a  distinct  magnetic  anomaly  which  was  traced  under  the 
South  Leduc  glacier  (Fig.  11)  by  the  2005  airborne  geophysical  survey.  These 
horizons  are  probably  modified  by  F2  folds  (Figs.  6 ， 7),  with  steep  to  vertical 
plunges. Drilling in 2005 tested the entire zone, but at higher elevations. The area 
should be drilled as part of following Target 1 down plunge.
Additionally,  several  hundred  metres  of  additional  strike  length  is  available  for 
drilling that is free of the South Leduc glacier.
Target 4: North Zone.  
The North Zone has two zones of mineralization previously termed “footwall zones” 
(Zones  1  and  2;  Fig.  11).  Alteration,  sulphides,  mafic  volcanics  and  sub-volcanic 
intrusions  show  this  zone  is  very  prospective,  despite  the  distance  from  the  main 
Granduc  mine  workings.  The  zone  has  some  cobalt  showings,  and  systematic 
sampling  might  indicate  additional  potential.  The  zone  is  open  to  the  north.  Up-
section  (to  the  east)  there  might  be  additional  mineralization  at  higher  horizons  in 
the stratigraphy.
Drilling the North Zone below the 2600 level can be accomplished by extending the 
diamond drill holes that will be testing Target 5.
Should  Target  5  exploration  be  successful,  the  economics  of  exploiting  the  known 
historic North Zone mineral resources will be greatly improved.
Target 5: F Zone Extension.  
As  first  described  in  McGuigan  (2005),  the  F  Zone  (Fig.  11)  terminates  on  its 
northern extremity against the Granduc Fault. The Granduc fault is a late feature and 
is post-mineralization, therefore F zone and possibly other Mine series horizons like A 
zone, might continue in the hanging wall of this late fault.
Reconstruction  of  the  right-lateral  movement  on  the  Granduc  and  Western  faults, 
indicates a target area in the western side (hanging wall) of the Western fault zone. 
After  including  the  likely  left-lateral  movement  during  the  earliest  stages  of 
movement on the South Unuk fault zone, Target 5 is located at the same elevation 
as the F ore body, but approximately 1 to 4 km north-northwest.
The implication of this structural interpretation is that an extension of the F deposit 
should be found west or northwest of the North Zone, at the elevation of the 2600 
level exploration drift (Fig. 11). This interpretation indicates that the western side of 
the  Granduc  fault  (and  Western  fault)  is  highly  prospective  for  the  discovery  of 
additional VMS deposits. The right lateral displacement of the rock units across the 
combination of the Granduc and Western faults is a total of approximately 1 to 4 km, 
almost  entirely  in  a  strike-slip  fashion,  with  little  dip-slip  movement.  The
53
displacement might be much less, if the earlier left lateral movement in the zone of 
South  Unuk  shearing  (Phase  1  and  2)  has  positioned  the  extension  of  the  deposit 
further southward during that stage of deformation.
Magnetic  modeling  results  should  be  first  obtained  to  provide  greater  definition  on 
the position of the F Zone extension.
Using  separate  reasoning,  the  Varied  series  (Unit  5)  is  the  likely  equivalent  of  the 
Mine series (Unit 3) that hosts the Granduc deposits (including F Zone). Drilling the 
Varied series rocks at the 2600 level and below, in areas of modeled high magnetic 
susceptibility is potentially the most promising target on the Property.
The target in the F Zone Extension is permissible for discovery of Besshi-type VMS 
deposits  of  the  similar  magnitude  and  grade  at  the  historic  pre-mining  size  of  the 
Granduc  deposit.  If  there  exists  a  deposit  of  similar  size  and  magnetite  content  to 
the  Granduc  deposit,  magnetic  modeling  of  the  existing  airborne  magnetic  survey 
should yield a defined target.
The  potential  for  the  F  Zone  Extension  is  very  high  and  could  potentially  result  in 
discovery of a deposit of similar tenor and tonnage as the historic Granduc deposit.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The  following  two  year  exploration  is  recommended  on  the  Property.  The 
recommendations  for  the  geological  and  the  first  phase  of  diamond  are  not 
contingent  on  the  data  modeling  of  the  geophysical  program.  A  second  phase  of 
diamond drilling will require all the data from the Phase One program to determine 
the locations and viability of targets.  
PHASE ONE EXPLORATION PROGRAM (2010) 
The  primary  objective  of  Phase  One  exploration  is  to  confirm  the  historic  diamond 
drilling  record,  below  the  2600  level  of  the  Granduc  mine.  Subsequent  to  data 
verification and this confirmation diamond drilling, the preparation of a new mineral 
resource estimate is recommended.
Additionally, historic projections of the main Granduc deposits have been made into 
areas  lying  below  2100  level,  to  sea  level.  Diamond  drilling  is  required  to  confirm 
these geological projections.
Results from Phase One should be used in an economic scoping study, to determine 
if  the  Granduc  tunnel  should  be  re-habilitated  to  support  additional  programs  of 
exploration and definition diamond drilling.
Data Verification and Data Presentation 
Phase One includes a provision to verify the relevant technical data on the historic 
mine, diamond drilling results and historic mineral resource estimates.
54
After  verification,  a  new  sectional  interpretation  of  the  entire  Granduc  mine  is 
recommended to be constructed and a 3D geological model prepared.
Geophysical Program 
During the last decade, breakthroughs in 3D geological and rock property modeling, 
geophysical 
inversion,  and  advanced  visualization  have  made  practical  the 
preparation  of  an  integrated  3D  geological  and  geophysical  model  of  the  Granduc 
mountain.
Recommended is the assembly of all historic magnetic data and the inversion of the 
magnetic data from the 2005 airborne survey, and/or all borehole magnetic data to 
generate 3D models of susceptibility contrast. Magnetic inversion has the potential to 
define  at  a  considerable  depth  the  mineralized  horizons  that  contain  elevated 
magnetite  disseminations,  massive  magnetite  iron  formation,  and  pyrrhotite-
magnetite  massive  sulphides.  Structural  modeling  of  mafic  volcanic  units  and 
intrusions  is  also  possible  with  this  approach.  Particular  care  should  be  taken  to 
ensure  that  the  very high  magnetic  susceptibilities  of  the  magnetite iron  formation 
are properly modeled to avoid modeling errors due to self-demagnetization.
AeroTEM  II  electromagnetic  responses  should  be  located  on  the  ground  and 
correlated  with  surface  and  underground  geology.  These  conductors  might  better 
define  the  Granduc  and  Western  faults.  Conductors  located  in  the  Hazelton  Group 
(eastern series) rocks should be prospected.
During the progress of the recommended 2010 diamond drilling, down-hole magnetic 
surveys are also recommended. Collection of magnetic susceptibility data from drill 
core is also recommended to continue on all future diamond drilling programs.
Geological Program 
The  new  interpretation  must  be  examined  critically  in  the  upcoming  season. 
Additional  field  programs  are  required  to  collect  data  to  further  investigate  and 
confirm conclusions made herein.
New  stratigraphic  and  structural  interpretations  presented  herein  and  by  earlier 
programs  are  constrained  by  U-Pb  (zircon)  dates,  lead  (galena  and  microcline) 
isotopes  and  lithogeochemistry  that  were  acquired  in  1993  (Dawson  et  al,  1994). 
Together, these interpretations indicate a number of previously unrecognized targets 
of Besshi-style mineralization are present on the Property.
This work has only begun, and a strong emphasis is required on geological control of 
the  exploration,  to  follow  statabound  VMS  bodies  through  the  fold  and  fault 
structures on the Property, and to assist in the modeling of the airborne geophysical 
responses.
The  authors  recommend  a  geological  program  as  follows,  in  keeping  with  the 
interpretations  herein,  and  recommendations  made  in  Dawson  et  al  (1994),  Lewis 
(1994), McGuigan et al (1992) and McGuigan (2005).
a)  Complete  stratigraphic  and  structural  mapping  on  Granduc  mountain  to:  (i) 
correlate units mapped to the north, (ii) project favourable geology to depth
55
and north and south of the Granduc deposit, and (iii) to test structural models 
presented in Lewis, 1994.
b)  Expand the lithogeochemical study to include rocks within, to the east and to 
the west of the Granduc deposit, the North Zone and the South Zone on the 
Property  (Figs.  6,7).  This  would  require  re-examination  of  the  diamond  drill 
core stored in Stewart, BC and possibly, re-opening some of the underground 
workings for sampling.
c)  Expand  the  lithogeochemistry  study  to  include  the  eastern  series  rocks 
located  east  of  the  South  Unuk  shear  zone  (Figs.  5,6,7)  and  south  of  the 
Granduc deposit. This work would help to: (i) correlate stratigraphic units in 
areas  of  poor  exposure  or  glacier  cover,  (ii)  determine  alteration  vectors  to 
focus  exploration,  (iii)  determine  the  geological  setting,  and  (iv)  identify 
similarities of volcanic units to those at the well studied Eskay Creek precious 
metal rich massive sulphide deposit (Roth, 1993; Bartsch, 1993).
d)  Expand the lead (from galena, k-feldspar and other sulphide phases) isotope 
study  to:  (i)  various  sulphide  horizons  underground  in  the  Granduc  deposit, 
(ii)  South  Zone  mineralization,  (iii)  North  Zone  mineralization,  (iv)  other 
documented sulphide occurrences on the Property, and (iv) the intermediate 
sill  in the western series (North Zone). The spatial relationship between the 
Late  Triassic  intermediate  sill  (part  of  the  Bucke  Glacier  suite)  and  copper 
mineralization  in  the  North  Zone  suggests  this  body  may  be  a  source  of 
metals and may have important exploration implications.
e)  Map  the  hangingwall  of  the  Granduc  fault  on  the  north  side  of  Granduc 
mountain to identify northern extensions of the Mine series stratigraphy. Pay 
close attention to the Varied series (Unit 5) rocks, as they bear resemblance 
to the Mine series (Unit 3).
f)  Map the area of the JK discovery, to better define drill  targets in that area. 
The source of the massive sulphide boulders reported by Melnyk (1991) has 
yet to be located.
g)  Map  the  western  portion  of  the  Tide  tunnel  to:  (i)  delineate  the  contact 
between the Late Triassic western series (Stuhini Group) and Lower to Middle 
Jurassic  eastern  series  (Hazelton  Group)  rocks,  (ii)  identify  possible  targets 
similar to North Zone mineralization in the Upper Footwall sequence, and (iii) 
identify  possible  Eskay  Creek  type  targets  in  Middle  Jurassic  eastern  series 
stratigraphy.
Diamond Drilling Program 
A  Phase  One  program  of  diamond  drilling  of  7000  m  total  drilling  is  strongly 
recommended  for  2010  to  test  Targets  1  and  3,  located  under  the  Granduc  Mine 
workings and the down plunge projections under the South Leduc glacier (Fig. 11). 
The object of the Phase One drilling is to verify historic drill results above 2100 level 
and to extend drill testing below the 2100 level.
56
A 70 day field program in Phase One is recommended, using two diamond drill rigs 
configured  for  helicopter  operations.  The  work  will  be  supported  from  the  existing 
campsite on Granduc mountain, located next to the abandoned airstrip.
Mineral Resource Estimate 
After the completion of the above recommended work, the new drilling results should 
be  used  to  verify  historic  diamond  drilling  intersections.  A  new  sectional 
interpretation should be prepared, reflecting the latest understanding of the deposit 
model, age relationships and shear deformation. The sectional interpretation should 
be of the entire Granduc mine, however, emphasis should be placed on areas below 
the 2600 level. Based on the new interpretation, a new mineral resource estimate is 
recommended, under the guidelines of the Instrument.
Budget Estimate for Phase One Program (2010): $2.9 Million 
A 70 day field program in Phase One is recommended, using two diamond drill rigs 
configured for helicopter operations. The expected drill rig productivity is about 60m 
per day per drill.

PHASE TWO EXPLORATION PROGRAM (2011) 
A  Phase  Two  program  is  recommended  for  the  drilling  of  Targets  1,3,  4  and  5, 
contingent upon the success of Phase One.
Planning of the Phase Two program is contingent on the following information from 
Phase One:
1.  Upon  confirmation  of  the  downward  projection  of  the  Granduc  deposits  by 
Phase  One  diamond  drilling,  exploration  diamond  drilling  should  be  laid  out 
for areas below the 2100 level to define mineralization initially to sea level.
2.  Success  contingent  upon  the  results  of  the  inversion  of  magnetic  data  and 
geological  investigations,  exploration  of  the  Targets  4  and  5  should  be 
conducted.
Initial testing of those targets will require of approximately 15,000m total drilling in a 
2011 exploration program.
After  the  Phase  One  and  concurrent  with  the  Phase  Two  program,  a  success 
contingent decision must be made to engage in definition diamond drilling of Targets 
1,  3,  4  and  5.  Efficient  diamond  drilling  of  these  targets  will  require  partial  mine 
workings rehabilitation and the construction of drill stations in the underground.
Budget Estimate for Phase Two Program (2011): $6.0 Million 
The  recommended  Phase  Two  exploration  program  is  contingent  on  success  from 
Phase One drilling, geophysical modeling and technical work. Allowance is made for 
15,000 m of drilling at similar drill rig productivity to Phase One.
In  total,  $8.9  million  in  estimated  expenditures  is  required  to  conduct  the 
recommended Phase One and Phase Two exploration programs in 2010 and 2011.

APPENDIX III - QUALIFIED PERSON’S STATEMENT
CERTIFICATE OF AUTHOR – PAUL J. MCGUIGAN 
I,  Paul  J.  McGuigan,  P.  Geo.,  doing  business  at  303-5455  West  Boulevard,











I am a consulting geologist and principal of Cambria Geosciences Inc.
I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Honours Geology from the University of BC 
in 1975.
I have worked as a geologist for a total of 36 years since my graduation from 
university, mostly in North and South America and Africa.
I am a Professional Geoscientist who is registered and in good standing with 
the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC since 1991.
I have read the definition of “Qualified Person” set out in National Instrument 
43-101 (“NI 43-101”) and certify that by reason of my education, affiliation 
with  a  professional  association  (as  defined  in  NI  43-101)  and  past  relevant 
work experience, I fulfill the requirements to be a “Qualified Person” for the 
purposes of NI 43-101.
I am responsible for the preparation of all the sections of the Technical Report 
titled  Granduc  Property,  Northwestern  BC  and  dated  June  30,  2010  (the 
“Technical  Report”)  relating  to  the  Granduc  property.  I  visited  the  Granduc 
property  during  all  exploration  programs  in  the  period  1979  to  2005  on 
thePproperty. I was a Senior Geologist for Esso Resources Canada at the time 
of their operation of the Granduc Mine from 1979 to 1984. I led the geological 
teams  that  mapped  the  surface  of  the  mine  property  (McGuigan  and  Marr, 
1979),  surface  diamond  drilling  and  re-establishing  underground  mapping 
procedures  (McGuigan,  1981).  I  am  a  principal  of  Cambria  Geological  Ltd. 
that  conducted  surface  geological  mapping  and  re-logging  of  diamond  drill 
core (Melnyk, 1991; McGuigan, et al 1992; and Dawson, et al 1994).
I visited the site of the Granduc mine in May 2010, and observed no evidence 
of work since the exploration program of 2005-2006.
I  have  personally  supervised  and  attended  the  field  work  on  each  of  the 
above cited programs, except for the 2006 program. No other field programs 
have been conducted on the property to the date of this report.
I  am  not  aware  of  any  material  fact  or  material  change  with  respect  to  the 
subject  matter  of  the  Technical  Report  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  Technical 
Report,  the  omission  to  disclose  which  makes  the  Technical  Report 
misleading.
I  am  independent  of  the  issuer  applying  all  of  the  tests  in  section  1.5  of 
National Instrument 43-101.
65

I  have  read  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1,  and  the 
Technical  Report  has  been  prepared  in compliance  with  that  instrument  and 
form.
I  consent  to  the  filing  of  the  Technical  Report  with  any  stock  exchange  and  other 
regulatory authority and any publication by them for regulatory purposes, including 
electronic publication in the public company files on their websites accessible by the 
public, of the Technical Report.
Dated this 4th day of July, 2010,
Signed in the original 
Paul J. McGuigan
