<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, widespread, systemic and systematic violations 
of human rights continue in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Reports conveyed by non-
governmental organizations, human rights defenders and individuals concerning violations of 
their human rights or the rights of others continue to depict a situation in which civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights are undermined and violated in law and in 
practice. Moreover, a lack of Government investigation and redress generally fosters a 
culture of impunity, further weakening the impact of the human rights instruments that the 
State has ratified. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur continues to seek the cooperation of the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in order to engage in a constructive dialogue and to be able to assess 
fully the allegations of human rights violations. He regrets to report that he it has not been 
able to establish a more cooperative and consultative relationship with the Government. He 
communicated his desire to visit the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to engage in dialogue 
and to investigate further the veracity of allegations of human rights violations, most recently 
on 9 May 2012. The Government remains, however, reticent on this engagement and his 
request. 
</p>
<p>3. In 2012, the Special Rapporteur also collaborated with a number of other special 
procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council in transmitting three allegation 
letters, 25 urgent appeals and seven joint press statements. In addition to the communications, 
he wrote to the Government on two separate occasions to express his concern about the 
ongoing house arrest of opposition leaders and on the restrictions placed on women&#8217;s access 
</p>
<p>to education. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the vast number of reports submitted by non-
governmental organizations and human rights defenders through interviews with primary 
sources located inside and outside the country. In this regard, 409 interviews have been 
conducted since the beginning of his mandate, 169 of which were conducted from September 
to December 2012 and submitted for the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to two cases of reprisal that were 
reported in the media in November and December 2012, in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 12/2, in which the Council called on representatives and mechanisms to 
continue to report on allegations of intimidation or reprisal. In one case, three Afghan 
nationals, Mohammad Nour-Zehi, Abdolwahab Ansari and Massoum Ali Zehi, were 
reportedly tortured and threatened with hanging for having allegedly submitted a list of 
executed Afghans to the Special Rapporteur.1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. According to other reports, five Kurdish prisoners (Ahmad Tamouee, Yousef Kakeh 
Meimi, Jahangir Badouzadeh, Ali Ahmad Soleiman and Mostafa Ali Ahmad) in Orumiyeh 
Prison have been charged with &#8220;contacting the office of the Special Rapporteur&#8221;, &#8220;reporting 
prison news to human rights organizations&#8221;, &#8220;spreading propaganda against the system inside 
prison&#8221; and &#8220;contacting Nawroz TV&#8221;.2 The prisoners were reportedly detained in solitary

<p>confinement for two months, interrogated about their contact with the Special Rapporteur and 
tortured in order to about a confession thereon. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed at the above-mentioned reports and joins the 
Human Rights Council in condemning all acts of intimidation or reprisal against individuals 
that cooperate with the human rights instruments.3 He wishes to emphasize the right of 
individuals to cooperate with the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations, and 
underscores the fact that such cooperation is integral to the ability of those mechanisms to 
fulfil their mandates.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the general observations made by the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the present report,4 appreciates its 
engagement in those observations, and continues to hope for direct engagement, as such 
observations should not preclude cooperation. In its comments, the Government primarily 
expresses its concern at (a) the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s working methodology; (b) the credibility 
of his sources of information; (c) his assertions about the Government&#8217;s cooperation with 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms; and (d) his conclusions that allegations of violations of human 
rights reported to him demonstrated a need for government investigation and remedy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur has outlined his methodology on several occasions, and 
asserts the highest standards of both rigour and consistency in its application at all times. He 
notes that evidence and testimonies submitted to him were assessed for compliance with the 
non-judicial evidentiary standards required of his mandate, that sources were cited 
appropriately and copiously, whenever possible, that only allegations that were cross-verified 
and consistently levelled by various sources were presented, and that his findings were in full 
compliance with the protocols stipulated by the United Nations system. The names of sources 
were omitted whenever requested, as required by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s code of conduct. 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has referenced periodic reports recently 
submitted to the treaty bodies by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout 
his report, but maintains that participation in or pledges made in those reports cannot in any 
way be a substitute for actions taken to concretely addressing and rectifying concerns raised 
by the human rights instruments. The Special Rapporteur also continues to underscore the 
fact that, despite the State&#8217;s standing invitation, several requests to visit the country remain 
outstanding, and that no visit has been granted to any special procedures since 2005.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Free and fair elections 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur recalls general comment No. 25 of the Human Rights 
Committee, in which the Committee stated that article 25 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights recognized and protected the right of every citizen to take part in 
the conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be elected and the right to have access to 
public service.5 This right should be enjoyed and ensured without unreasonable restrictions. 
Any conditions on this right must be &#8220;based on objective and reasonable criteria&#8221; without

<p>distinction of any kind, including race, gender, religion, and political or other opinion.6 The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that significant and unreasonable limitations placed on the 
right of Iranian citizens to stand for presidential office undermine their right to &#8220;participate in 
the conduct of public affairs through freely chosen representatives&#8221; who &#8220;are accountable 
</p>
<p>through the electoral process for their exercise of that power&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>12. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran reported that, under its Constitution, 
candidates for the office of President must be &#8220;political religious men&#8221; and faithful believers 
in the &#8220;foundation of the Islamic Republic of Iran and official religion of the country&#8221;.8 
Women are therefore excluded from the Presidency; indeed, no female candidate has been 
approved by the Guardian Council in the 34 years of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 
Constitution also deprives citizens who hold political opinions contrary to those of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and to the country&#8217;s official religion of the right to stand for 
President. The Human Rights Committee clearly stated that &#8220;political opinion may not be 
used as a ground to deprive any person of the right to stand for election&#8221;.9  
</p>
<p>13. On 11 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur joined the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
assembly and association in a statement urging the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to immediately and unconditionally release the 2009 presidential candidates Mehdi 
Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and hundreds of other 
prisoners of conscience who remain in prison for exercising peacefully their rights to 
freedom of opinion and expression or freedom of association and assembly during protests 
following the presidential election in 2009. The special procedures mandate holders 
underscored the fact that the two opposition leaders had not been charged with a crime since 
their arrest, and that, in an opinion adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 
August 2012, the Working Group had confirmed that Mr. Mousavi and Mr. Karroubi were 
subject to arbitrary detention by the Government, contrary to article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.10 In the case of Mr. Mousavi and Mr. Karroubi, it was 
reported that the Iranian Chief Prosecutor had suggested that the opposition leaders repent 
and make full restitution for transgressions against the Government and State if they were to 
participate in the presidential election to be held in 2013.11  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned at the fact that the Government has not 
established an independent electoral authority, in compliance with general comment No. 25, 
&#8220;to supervise the electoral process and to ensure that it is conducted fairly, impartially and in 
</p>
<p>accordance with established laws which are compatible with the Covenant&#8221;.12 He also has 
concerns with regard to the availability of information and materials on voting in minority 
languages in the Islamic Republic of Iran.13 Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recalls, more 
broadly, that freedom of expression, assembly and association &#8220;are essential conditions for 
the effective exercise of the right to vote, and must be fully protected&#8221;.14 Reports of 
statements by Iranian officials issuing warnings against those citizens who call for a free 
election&#8221;&#8221; and suggesting that these calls are conspiratorial and inimical to the Iranian State

<p>or the principle of <i>velayat madari</i> (obedience to the Supreme Leader)15 undermine the full 
enjoyment of article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
requires the free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues 
between citizens, candidates and elected representatives. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the continued arrest, detention and 
prosecution of dozens of journalists and Internet users under the provisions of the 1986 Press 
Law, which contains 17 categories of &#8220;impermissible&#8221; content. On 4 February 2013, the 
Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention called on the Islamic Republic of Iran to immediately halt the recent spate of 
arrests of journalists and to release those already detained, following the arrest of at least 17 
journalists, the majority of whom work for independent news outlets.16 The mandate holders 
underscored their fear that the 17 arrests made were part of a broader campaign to crack 
down on independent journalists and media outlets, accused of having collaborated with 
&#8220;anti-revolutionary&#8221; foreign media outlets and human rights organizations.  
</p>
<p>16. Prior to the above-mentioned arrests, 45 journalists were already detained in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.17 All five journalists interviewed for the present report about their 
arrest and prosecution maintained that they had not faced public trial by jury, as would be 
required by the Press Law. Two journalists reported that they had been arbitrarily detained 
without charge and without ever facing a trial; one was allegedly detained for several months 
and eventually released with a verbal warning, while the other was reportedly detained for 
three years, without charge or trial, then finally released on bail. Two female journalists also 
reported serious sexual harassment endured while in detention. 
</p>
<p>17. Mehdi Khazali began serving a 14-year sentence for criticizing the Government on his 
free-lance Internet blog in October 2012. Alireza Roshan, a reporter for the reformist 
publication <i>Shargh</i> began serving a one-year prison sentence in November 2012. Zhila Bani-
Yaghoub, editor of the website of the Iranian Women&#8217;s Club, began serving a one-year term 
on charges of &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and &#8220;insulting the President&#8221;, while her 
husband, journalist Bahman Ahmadi Amouee, is currently serving a five-year sentence on 
&#8220;anti-State charges&#8221;.18 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at reports of harassment of family members 
of journalists who live and work abroad. In a public statement, 104 journalists called for an 
end to the harassment and intimidation of their family members aimed at putting pressure on 
journalists to discontinue their work with such news agencies as BBC Persian, Vof America 
and Radio Farda. One journalist interviewed for the present report maintained that two of her 
family members had had their passports confiscated, and that the family had been threatened

<p>with the seizure of their property if the journalist persisted with her work (see annex I, 
paragraphs 15 to 17).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>19. Interviews suggest that human rights defenders continue to be subjected to 
harassment, arrest, interrogation and torture and are frequently charged with vaguely defined 
national security crimes. A preponderant number of human rights defenders interviewed for 
the present report maintained that they had been arrested without a warrant and subjected to 
physical and psychological duress during interrogations aimed at securing a signed (and 
televised) confession. A majority of the interviewees reported that they had been kept in 
solitary confinement for periods ranging from one day to almost a year, were denied access to 
legal counsel of their choice, subjected to unfair trials or, in some cases, subjected to severe 
physical torture, rape (both of males and females, by both male and female officials), electric 
shock, hanging by the hands or arms and/or forced body contortion.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur continues to share the concerns of the International Bar 
Association with regard to the erosion of the independence of the legal profession and the 
Bar Association in the Islamic Republic of Iran.19 Legislative action such as the approval of 
the Bill of Formal Attorneyship, which increases Government supervision over the Iranian 
Bar Association, is a case in point. The Special Rapporteur is also further concerned at article 
187 of the Law of the Third Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan, which led to 
the establishment of a parallel body of lawyers known as &#8220;legal advisers to the judiciary&#8221;. 
While the law has seemingly increased the number of legal professionals in the country partly 
through a simpler licensing process, the judiciary ultimately controls the licensing process of 
all above-mentioned legal advisers. The Special Rapporteur also received reports about the 
revocation of the licenses of legal advisers after they represented prisoners of conscience.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. Furthermore, the Law on Conditions for Obtaining an Attorney&#8217;s License allows Bar 
members to elect members of their Board of Directors, but requires the Supreme Disciplinary 
Court for Judges, a body under the judiciary&#8217;s authority, to confer with the Ministry of 
Intelligence, the Revolutionary Court and the police to vet potential candidates for its Board. 
Some Iranian lawyers reported that, in practice, candidates who represented human rights 
defenders had been prohibited from seeking Board membership as a result.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern at reports of the widespread use of torture 
in his report submitted to the General Assembly.20 He reported that 78 per cent of individuals 
who reported violations of their due process rights also stated that they had been beaten 
during interrogations for the purpose of soliciting confessions, that their reports of torture and 
ill-treatment were ignored by judicial authorities and that their coerced confessions were used 
against them, despite these complaints.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. In response to the above-mentioned report, the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran stated that the allegations of torture used in the country were baseless, since State laws 
forbid the use of torture and the use of evidence solicited under duress. The Special

<p>profession&#8221;, 11 October 2007 (available from 
</p>
<p>www.ibanet.org/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleUid=8281ffa3-1ce7-4976-a93d-e488cc0fa333). 
 20 A/67/369. </p>


<p>Rapporteur nonetheless continues to maintain that the existence of these legal safeguards 
does not in itself invalidate allegations of torture, and does not remove the obligation to 
investigate thoroughly such allegations. He also emphasizes that widespread impunity and 
allegations of the use of confessions solicited under duress as evidence continues to 
contribute to the prevalence of torture. 
</p>
<p>24. On 15 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur joined the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in calling on the 
Government to investigate the death of Iranian blogger Sattar Beheshti.21 Mr. Beheshti was 
reportedly arrested by the Iranian Cyber Police Unit on 30 October 2012 on charges of 
&#8220;actions against national security on social networks and Facebook&#8221;. His family was 
reportedly summoned to collect his body seven days later. During an interview for the 
present report, one source informed the Special Rapporteur that Mr. Beheshti had been 
tortured for the purpose of retrieving his Facebook user name and password, repeatedly 
threatened with death during his interrogation, and beaten in the face and torso with a baton. 
The source also stated that Mr. Beheshti had reported chest pain to other prisoners and that 
authorities were made aware of his complaints, but no action was taken. A domestic report 
released in January 2013 by the Majles&#8217; National Security and Foreign Policy 
Commission criticized the Tehran Cyber Crimes Police Unit for holding Mr. Beheshti in its 
own (unrecognized) detention centre, but fell short of alleging direct wrongdoing in his death 
or of calling for an investigation into the apparent widespread maintenance of illegal 
detention centres operated by branches of intelligence services, in contravention of Iranian 
law.22 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is also troubled by media reports that the memorial service for 
Mr. Beheshti was subject to a raid by security agents, who beat and arrested members of Mr. 
Beheshti&#8217;s family and a number of attendees. It was also reported that five security officers 
beat and dragged Mr. Beheshti&#8217;s elderly mother by her hair, and that his brother, Asghar, was 
also arrested and detained for two hours.23 
</p>
<p>26. According to other reports, in late October 2012, the home of Jamil Sowaidi was 
raided and he was detained by plainclothes officers claiming to be members of the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guards Corps. Frequent attempts by Mr. Sowaidi&#8217;s family to enquire about his 
whereabouts were reportedly rebuffed by authorities. On 6 November, authorities reportedly 
confirmed that Mr. Sowaidi had died in custody and advised his family not to pursue the 
case. The family&#8217;s request for an autopsy was reportedly denied, and Mr. Sowaidi was buried 
</p>
<p>on 8 November 2012. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to conduct a 
comprehensive and transparent investigation into Mr. Sowaidi&#8217;s death, and encourages it to 
take measures to remedy the matter, in accordance with international standards.24

<p>27. Of the 169 interviews conducted for the present report, 81 cases of reported detention 
were examined for allegations of torture. It was found that approximately 76 per cent of 
interviewees reported allegations of torture; 56 per cent reported physical torture, including 
rape and sexual abuse; and 71 per cent reported psychological torture. In an effort to 
investigate further the methods of torture reported by interviewees, the Special Rapporteur 
examined a study on the Islamic Republic of Iran by one of the world&#8217;s largest torture 
treatment centres, Freedom from Torture, which investigates and forensically documents 
evidence of torture in accordance with the standards of the Manual on Effective Investigation 
and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (the Istanbul Protocol).25 Data collected was both quantitative and qualitative, 
detailing the history of detention, specific torture disclosures and the forensic documentation 
of the physical and psychological consequences of torture.26 The medical/legal evidence 
presented in the study appears to be consistent with a substantial number of statements 
submitted to the Special Rapporteur in which allegations of torture were reported.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. The above-mentioned study examined 50 of some 5,000 documented cases of torture 
reported by Iranians to the Freedom from Torture centre since 1985. Twenty-nine of the 
individuals whose cases were examined for the study were detained in 2009, 14 in 2010 and 
seven in 2011. Fifty-six per cent of the cases were detained only once in the period 2009-
2011, while 44 per cent were detained more than once and up to three times before leaving 
the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>29. The study concluded that methods of physical torture described in the 50 cases 
included blunt force trauma (see table 1),27 including beating, whipping and assault (100 per 
cent of cases), finding that:  
</p>
<p>the main forms of blunt force trauma consisted of repeated and sustained assault by 
kicking, punching, slapping and of beatings with a variety of blunt instruments 
including truncheons, cables, whips, batons, plastic pipes, metal bars, gun butts, belts 
and handcuffs. People reported being assaulted or beaten on all parts of the body, 
though most commonly on the head and face, arms and legs and back. Most were 
blindfolded while beaten and many were restrained, meaning they were unable to 
defend or protect themselves.<b>

reviewed (see table 2 below):  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sexual torture, including rape, molestation, violence to genitals and penetration with 
an instrument (60 per cent of cases)

<p><b> E. Executions 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur continues to be alarmed by the escalating rate of executions 
(see table 3 below), especially in the absence of fair trial standards, and the application of 
capital punishment for offences that do not meet the standards of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; 
according to international law (such as alcohol consumption, adultery and drug-trafficking). 
It was reported that some 297 executions were officially announced by the Government, and 
that approximately 200 &#8220;secret executions&#8221; were acknowledged by family members, prison 
officials and/or members of the judiciary, making a likely total of between 489 and 497 
executions in 2012.28 
</p>
<p><b>  Table 3 
</b></p>
<p> 
32. It was reported that at least 58 public executions have been carried out in 2013. The 
Special Rapporteur joins the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
condemning the use of public executions, despite a circular issued in January 2008 by the 
head of the judiciary that banned public executions. He also joins the Secretary-General in 
his view that &#8220;executions in public add to the already cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of 
the death penalty and can only have a dehumanizing effect on the victim and a brutalizing 
effect on those who witness the execution.&#8221;29 The Special Rapporteur also remains concerned 
that provisions in the new Penal Code, while not yet adopted, seem to broaden the scope of 
crimes punishable by death.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. On 22 October 2012, Saeed Sedighi, a Tehran-based shop owner, was executed along 
with nine others on drug-trafficking charges,30 despite the calls made on 12 October 2012 by 
three special procedures mandate holders to halt the executions.31 The Government has yet to 
respond to due process-related queries, including to allegations that Mr. Sedighi was not 
permitted adequate access to a lawyer or allowed to defend himself during his trial. These 
rights are guaranteed by article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
articles 32 and 34 to 39 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as by the 
Law on Respecting Legitimate Freedoms and Citizenship Rights (2004), which determines 
criminal procedure and defines fair trial standards.<b>

<p><b> F. </b>Women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. Reported statistics show that, in the past 30 years, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
made remarkable advances in literacy, access to education for women, and women&#8217;s health. 
Literacy and primary school enrolment rates for women and girls are estimated at more than 
99 per cent and 100 per cent respectively, and gender disparity in secondary and tertiary 
education is reportedly almost non-existent.32 Statistics also indicate that women benefit from 
improved access to primary health care. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at 24.6 
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, and skilled attendance during delivery is 94.5 per 
cent, figures that put the country &#8220;on track&#8221; with regard to attaining the Millennium 
Development Goal on improving maternal health.33 
</p>
<p>35. Moreover, the country&#8217;s fifth National Development Plan calls for &#8220;focusing on the 
needs and the creation of constructive opportunities for women and youth&#8221;. The Plan also 
refers to principles of equal pay for women and the expansion of social support for &#8220;ensuring 
</p>
<p>equal opportunities for men and women and empowerment of women through access to 
suitable job opportunities&#8221;.34 Several programmes aimed at advancing these goals have 
reportedly been developed, including a scheme to generate &#8220;at home&#8221; employment for 
</p>
<p>women. The Chairman of the Health and Treatment Commission of Parliament (Majlis) also 
recently announced the extension of maternity leave from six months to nine months, 
together with two weeks of mandatory leave for fathers.35 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>36. Gender-based disparities in economic participation and political empowerment remain, 
however, problematic (see table 4 below), and some recent developments threaten to reverse the 
above-mentioned achievements in education.36 These include unsuccessful (to date) legislative 
attempts to strengthen polygamy and to reduce work hours for women, as well as current policy 
proposals that discriminate against women in education and further limit their civil rights.

<p><b> 1. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>37. In 1993, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that the 
obligation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure equal opportunity for women warranted 
particular attention, especially in relation to the right to work, family-related rights and the 
right to education.38 In 2006, the authorities partially agreed to the implementation of 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences following her visit to the country. This included the agreement to reform 
discriminatory provisions in the country&#8217;s penal and civil laws, especially with regard to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s equal rights in marriage and access to justice. In February 2010, the Government 
</p>
<p>also received and accepted eight of the 13 recommendations relating to women&#8217;s rights 
during the universal periodic review.39<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. In its second periodic report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, to be reviewed by the Committee at its fiftieth session,40 the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran discussed its programme to revise &#8220;existing rules and regulations&#8221; 
with a view to advancing women&#8217;s participation, raising public awareness about their 
&#8220;qualifications&#8221; and enhancing their skills.41 The Government also maintained that women&#8217;s 
affairs had received &#8220;special attention in the economic, social, cultural and political 
development plans of the country&#8221; commensurate with its view that &#8220;men and women 
</p>
<p>equally enjoy the protection of the law, and enjoy all human, political, economic, social, and 
cultural rights, in conformity with Islamic criteria&#8221;.42 In qualifying its position, Government 
representatives have asserted that, &#8220;men and women are equal in human dignity and human 
rights; this is not to be confused with equating men and women&#8217;s role in family, society and 
in the development process&#8221;.43<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. The above viewpoint is further elaborated in the Charter on Women&#8217;s Rights and 
Responsibilities, adopted by the State adopted in 2004. According to the preamble thereto, 
the Charter was developed in accordance with the view that &#8220;there are various traditions and 
perspectives regarding women&#8217;s rights based on their different cultures&#8221;. The Charter, 
</p>
<p>therefore, specifies the rights that the Government believes belong to both genders, and 
emphasizes the rights that it deems to be specific to women based on their &#8220;physical and 
psychological&#8221; differences.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>40. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur joins the statement made by the 
Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights in her latest report, in which asserted that, 
while the tendency to view culture as an impediment to women&#8217;s rights is both over 
simplistic and problematic, many practices and norms that discriminate against women are 
justified by reference to culture, religion and tradition.44 In this respect, the Special 
Rapporteur maintains that the above-mentioned emphasis on gender roles places limitations 
on the obligation of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to protect women&#8217;s full 
enjoyment of their civil, political, social, cultural and economic rights. He believes that this 
view arbitrarily qualifies the degree to which women may enjoy these rights as that which the

</p>
<p>Iran to the United Nations, on behalf of Maryam Mojtahedzadeh, Adviser to the President and Head of 
the Center for Women and Family Affairs, during the general discussion held by the Commission on 
the Status of Women at its fifty-sixth session, 28 February 2012. Available from

<p>Government perceives to be in conformity with Islamic criteria. The Special Rapporteur 
further maintains that this particular argument undermines the notion of universal rights, and 
compromises the rights protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for virtually half of 
the country&#8217;s population.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Socioeconomic rights 
</b></p>
<p>41. The achievements made by Iranian women in the field of education has not yet been 
matched in their current economic status. Statistics demonstrate that a significant gender 
disparity persists in their participation in the labour market; furthermore, women still occupy 
only a small percentage of senior managerial positions. According to UNICEF, only 32 per 
cent of Iranian women are actively engaged in the labour market, compared with 73 per cent 
of men and 52 per cent of women in the global labour force.45<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that certain legal limitations placed on women&#8217;s 
employment, coupled with recent revisions of laws that affect their socioeconomic rights, 
severely weaken the Government&#8217;s ability to promote gender equality and to make progress 
</p>
<p>on the recommendations made by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights46 
and at the fourth session of the universal periodic review.47 These limitations include article 
1117 of the Civil Code, which affords men the right to prohibit their wives from engaging in 
work outside the home if they can prove that the work is incompatible with the family&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>interests. Furthermore, members of the Majlis recently reportedly proposed four articles that 
require women to be married in order to become members of a university scientific 
committee or to be employed at the Ministry of Education and Training. The speaker of the 
Parliament Social Commission reported that the preconditions had not yet been approved.48 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. In June 2012, the Ministry of Science and Technology announced that women sitting 
for the national entrance exam would be prohibited from enrolling in 77 fields of study at 36 
public universities across the country.49 It was also reported that women&#8217;s enrolment in 
hundreds of courses offered during the 2012-2013 academic year at Iranian public 
universities was substantially restricted, including in courses on petroleum engineering, data 
management, communications, emergency medical technology, mechanical engineering, law, 
political sciences, policing, social sciences and religious studies.50 Furthermore, policies to 
enforce gender segregation provide &#8220;single-gendered&#8221; university majors for alternating 
semesters in lieu of entirely banning access to either male or female candidates.51 In response 
to criticism from parliamentarians who called for an explanation, the Minister for Science 
and Higher Education responded that 90 per cent of degrees still remained open to both 
sexes, that single-sex courses were needed to create &quot;balance&#8221; and that some fields &#8220;were are 
not very suitable for women&#8221;. In the light of the international obligations of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and its Constitution, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to review policies that 
could be discriminatory and set back the progress that the State has achieved in the area of 
women&#8217;s education. <b>

<p><b> 3. Right to freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>44. A married woman cannot obtain a passport or leave the country without her husband&#8217;s 
written permission. In November 2012, the Chairperson of the National Security and Foreign 
Policy Commission of the Majlis announced an amendment to the country&#8217;s passport laws 
that would require unmarried women under the age of 40 and males under the age of 18 to 
obtain the consent of a guardian or the ruling of a sharia judge in order to acquire a 
passport.52 Although the amendment was ultimately rejected, the Commission reportedly 
announced further amendments to the passport bill, which would continue to allow single 
women over the age of 18 years to obtain a passport without the above-mentioned 
permission, but would require them to obtain permission from their father or guardian on the 
paternal side in order to leave the country.53<b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. In defence of the above-mentioned amendments, the Chairperson of the National 
Security and Foreign Policy Commission reportedly stated that the Government frequently 
received requests from single women to travel outside of the country, particularly for the 
purpose of pilgrimage, and that this had prompted the Government to institute policies that 
would ensure their health and safety.54 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. According to reports, women&#8217;s rights activists continue to be harassed for making 
statements that criticize policies or government actions; organizational meetings continue to 
be disbanded; permits for peaceful assemblies are still being denied; and women believed to 
be associated with entities such as the Mourning Mothers and the One Million Signatures 
Campaign for Equality continue to face harassment, arrest and detention. Women&#8217;s rights 
advocates are frequently charged with national security crimes and &#8220;propaganda against the 
system&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>47. Activists are also reportedly subject to travel bans and other forms of suppression for 
protected activities. Women&#8217;s rights activist and member of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign for Equality Maryam Behraman was recently sentenced to an 8-month suspended 
jail term on the charge of &#8220;propaganda against the State&#8221;. She was acquitted on charges of 
having &#8220;insulted the leader and founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8221;.55 Ms. Behraman was 
arrested on 11 May 2011 in Shiraz on charges of &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, a charge 
apparently linked to her participation in the fifty-fifth session of the Commission on the 
Status of Women in March 2011, and detained for 128 days in a detention centre. On 15 
September, she was released on $300,000 bail. Ms. Behraman&#8217;s lawyer reportedly stated that 
she was able to read eight volumes of her case file and allowed to take notes, then to submit 
her defence during the three relatively lengthy court sessions.56<b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. A number of Iranian laws continue to discriminate against women. Article 1108 of the 
Civil Code, for example, requires women to be obedient to their husbands. Women cannot 
transfer nationality and citizenship to their husbands or children, a situation that has rendered 
stateless thousands of children of Iranian women who have married Afghani or Iraqi 
refugees, as well as expatriate Iranian women married to non-Iranians.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. A dearth of female representation in decision-making roles remains problematic for 
women&#8217;s participation in public life, a right enunciated by article 25 of the International 
</p>
<p>

<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Women are allowed to serve as legal counsellors, for 
example, but are prohibited from issuing and signing final verdicts.57 No woman has ever 
been appointed to the Council of Guardians and the Expediency Council. Only nine of the 
490 women that reportedly presented their candidatures for the parliamentary elections held 
in March 2012 were elected, receiving only 3.1 per cent of the 290 seats in the Majlis 
(although a slight increase from the eight female representatives in the previous Parliament). 
Prior to the elections, Iranian women&#8217;s groups called on the Speaker of the Majlis to improve 
female representation, citing the &#8220;increasing number of professional women, the importance 
of incorporating the female outlook on issues in decision-making bodies, addressing 
women&#8217;s and family issues, and eliminating legal vacuums&#8221; as reasons for their request.58 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Ahwazi Arabs 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur continues to be concerned at reports from members of the 
Arab community regarding cases of arrest, detention and prosecutions for protected activities 
that promote social, economic, cultural, linguistic and environmental rights. A majority of 
interviewees reported that they had been arrested without a warrant and had been ill-treated 
during detention. They maintained that they had been detained without charge for periods 
ranging from several days to weeks. Some reported having been psychologically and 
physically tortured during their interrogation, including by flogging or beatings, and being 
made to witness executions, threats against family members, and the actual detention of 
family members for the purpose of implicating others, or to compel others to report to the 
authorities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. One interviewee reported that a cousin, nephew and brother had been arrested in June 
2012 for the purpose of coercing their children, currently living abroad, to return to the 
country. The interviewee maintained that officers from the Ministry of Intelligence had 
arrested, detained and interrogated the family members about possible foreign contacts on a 
daily basis for more than two weeks, without any charge. They were reportedly subjected to 
psychological and physical torture, including by flogging and beating to the point of 
unconsciousness. The individuals reportedly remain in prison.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. An informed source reported that Sattar Sayyahi, a poet, died in suspicious 
circumstances in November 2012 following his release and subsequent threats made by the 
Ministry of Intelligence. Mr. Sayyahi&#8217;s uncle and neighbour were also reportedly arrested, 
interrogated and tortured by the authorities after they took Mr. Sayyahi to the hospital. The 
interviewee maintained that Mr. Sayyahi&#8217;s uncle and neighbour were questioned about their 
conversations with him prior to his death. According to other reports, the authorities attacked 
and arrested an estimated 130 to 140 funeral attendants, including Mr. Sayyahi&#8217;s 17-year old 
cousin, Ali, whose hand was reportedly broken as a result of torture while in detention. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Baloch 
</b></p>
<p>53. Sistan-Balochistan is arguably the most underdeveloped region in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, with the country&#8217;s highest poverty, infant and child mortality rates and the 
lowest for life expectancy and literacy. The Balochi are reportedly subjected to systematic 
social, racial, religious and economic discrimination, and are also severely underrepresented

</p>
<p>Available from www.payvand.com/news/12/jan/1167.html. </p>


<p>in State bodies.59 It has also been reported that the linguistic rights of the Balochi are 
undermined by the systematic rejection of Balochi-language publications, and limitations on 
the public and private use of their native languages, in contravention of article 15 of the 
Constitution and article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Moreover, the application of the Gozinesh criterion, which requires State officials and 
employees to demonstrate allegiance to Islam and to the concept of <i>velayat-e faqih</i> 
(guardianship of the Islamic jurist) further compounds their socioeconomic predicament by 
limiting employment opportunities.60<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. Accounts of the destruction of Sunni mosques and religious schools, and allegations 
of the imprisonment and assassination of Sunni clerics, have also been reported. Baloch 
activists have reportedly been subject to arbitrary arrests and torture. The Sistan-Balochistan 
province experiences a high rate of executions for drug-related offences or crimes deemed to 
constitute <i>Moharebeh </i>(&#8220;enmity against god&#8221;) in the absence of fair trials.61 Allegations were 
also received that the Government used the death penalty as a means to suppress opposition 
in the province.62 In a plea to the international community, the Balochistan People&#8217;s Party 
reported that two Baloch prisoners in Zahidan Prison had been sentenced to death following a 
demonstration in Rask City and other towns in Sarbaz in May 2012. Political prisoners in the 
detention centre who protested against the death sentences were reportedly punished by 
exile.63<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. Reports were also received that <i>netizen</i> Abdol Basit Rigi and political activists 
Abdoljalil Rigi and Yahyaa Charizahi had been charged with <i>Moharebeh </i>and sentenced to 
death following forced confessions. Abdol Basit Rigi had been arrested three years earlier, 
reportedly kept in solitary confinement for 11 months and tortured. It is furthermore reported 
that the activists were transferred to solitary confinement in the Ministry for Intelligence two 
days before their execution, where they were subjected to violent torture and forced to record 
a televised confession.64<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned at the situation of human rights of 
religious minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Reports from and interviews with 
members of the Baha&#8217;i, Christian and Sunni Muslim communities continue to depict a 
situation in which adherents of recognized and unrecognized religions face discrimination in 
law and/or in practice, including various degrees of intimidation, arrest and detention. A 
number of interviewees stated that they had been repeatedly interrogated about their religious

<p>beliefs; a majority of interviewees reported having been charged with national security 
crimes and/or propaganda against the State for religious activities. Several interviewees 
declared that they had been psychologically and physically tortured. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. </b>Baha&#8217;is<b> 
</b></p>
<p>57. In its comments on the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the General 
Assembly (A/67/369), the Government stated that, despite the fact that the Baha&#8217;i faith was 
not a recognized religion in the country, its followers had equal rights under the law and that 
they could not be prosecuted or imprisoned for adhering to their beliefs. It maintained, 
however, that propagation of the Baha&#8217;i faith was in &#8220;breach of existing laws and 
regulations&#8221;, and that activities that constituted its proselytization disrupted public order, and 
could therefore be limited, in accordance with articles 18 and 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In its general comment No. 22, however, the Human 
Rights Committee emphasized that the teaching of religious beliefs was protected and that 
the practice and teaching of religion or belief included acts integral to the conduct by 
religious groups of their basic affairs, such as the freedom to establish seminaries or religious 
schools and the freedom to prepare and distribute religious texts or publications.65<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Reports were received that 110 Baha&#8217;is were currently detained in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran for having exercised their faith, including two women &#8211; Zohreh Nikayin 
(Tebyanian) and Taraneh Torabi (Ehsani) &#8211; who were reportedly nursing infants in prison. It 
was estimated that 133 Baha&#8217;is were currently awaiting a summons to serve their sentences, 
and that another 268 Bahai&#8217;s were awaiting trial. The authorities reportedly arrested at least 
59 members from August to November 2012, some of whom have been released. Several 
sources reported that, since October 2012, authorities had raided the homes of at least 24 
Baha&#8217;is and arrested 25 people in the city of Gorgon and its surrounding provincial areas, 10 
of whom remained in custody at the end of the period under review. It was furthermore 
reported that Baha&#8217;is in the northern city of Semnan had been the focus of escalating and 
broad persecution over the past three years. Baha&#8217;is in Semnan have allegedly faced physical 
violence, arrests, arson and vandalism to their homes and grave sites. The majority of Baha&#8217;i-
owned businesses in Semnan and the northern city of Hamadan have reportedly been 
closed.66 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>59. Members of the Baha&#8217;i community are reportedly still being systematically deprived 
of a range of social and economic rights, including access to higher education. Informed 
sources have reported that authorities from three different universities expelled five Baha&#8217;i 
students in November 2012. Four of these students were reportedly offered the possibility of 
being readmitted if they denied or pledged to abandon their religious practices. The students 
were reportedly expelled for refusing the offer.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Christians 
</b></p>
<p>60. In its comments and observations on the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to 
the General Assembly (A/67/369), the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran stressed 
that &#8220;recognition of Christianity by the Constitution &#8230; does not constitute judicial immunity&#8221; 
</p>
<p>for its followers. The Special Rapporteur believes that Christians should not face sanctions 
for manifesting and practising their faith, and therefore remains concerned that Christians are

<p>reportedly being arrested and prosecuted on vaguely-worded national security crimes for 
exercising their beliefs.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. Sources have reported that at least 13 Protestant Christians are currently held in 
detention centres across the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that more than 300 Christians have 
been arrested since June 2010. Those currently in prison include Pastor Behnam Irani and 
church leader Farshid Fathi, who are both serving six-year sentences on such charges as 
&#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, &#8220;being in contact with enemy foreign countries&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;religious propaganda&#8221;. Sources maintain that the evidence used against Mr. Fathi was 
related to his church activities, including distributing Persian-language Bibles and 
coordinating trips for church members to attend religious seminars and conferences outside 
the country. Several Protestant churches with majority Assyrian- or Armenian-speaking 
congregations have also been forced to cease Persian-language services; furthermore, it was 
recently reported that the Janat Abad Assemblies of God Church in Tehran, which held all-
Persian services, was shut down on 19 May 2012.67<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the right of Iranians to choose their 
faith is increasingly at risk. Christian interviewees consistently reported being targeted by 
authorities for promoting their faith, participating in informal house churches with majority 
convert congregations, allowing converts to join their church services and congregations, 
and/or converting from Islam. A majority of interviewees who identified themselves as 
converts reported that they had been threatened with criminal charges for apostasy while in 
custody, and a number of others stated that they had been asked to sign documents pledging 
to cease their church activities in order to gain release.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Dervishes 
</b></p>
<p>63. In interviews and in the information submitted to the Special Rapporteur continue to 
indicate that Gonabadi Dervishes, who are Shia Muslims, are subjected to attacks in their 
places of worship, and are arbitrarily arrested, tortured and prosecuted. Sources noted that, as 
at November 2012, 12 Gonabadi Dervishes remained in official custody, including four 
lawyers (Farshid Yadollah, Amir Eslami, Omid Behroozi and Mostafa Daneshjoo). Sources 
also reported that, on 12 December 2012, six Dervishes from the city of Kovar were tried in a 
revolutionary court in Shiraz, some for the capital offence of <i>Moharebeh</i>. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Other faith groups and spiritual practices 
</b></p>
<p>64. Representatives of the Yarsan, a religious minority active among Kurdish Iranians, 
reported that their religious gatherings were routinely repressed. Furthermore, the leader of 
the Yarsan, Seyyed Nasradin Heydari, is allegedly under house arrest. Yarsan who pass 
university entrance exams and profess that they practice the Yarsan faith are reportedly 
refused admission. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about reports regarding the 
arrest of leaders of spiritual, semi-spiritual and meditation groups in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran; for example, sources reported that Peyman Fattahi, leader of the spiritual community of 
the El-Yasin, was detained for almost three weeks in October and November 2012.<b>

christians&amp;Itemid=279). </p>


<p><b> I. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur continues to share the concern of the Human Rights 
Committee that members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community 
face harassment, persecution and cruel punishment, and are denied basic human rights. The 
new draft Islamic Penal Code criminalizes same-sex relations between consenting adults. 
Articles 232 and 233 of the new Penal Code would mandate a death sentence for the 
&#8220;passive&#8221; male involved in sodomy, regardless of whether his role was consensual. Under the 
new law, &#8220;active&#8221; Muslim and unmarried males may be subject to 100 lashes as long as they 
are not engaged in rape. Married and/or non-Muslim males may be subject to capital 
punishment for the same act. According to the new Penal Code, men involved in non-
penetrative same-sex acts or women engaged in same-sex acts would also face 100 lashes..  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that criminalizing same-sex relations could lead 
to the violation of core human rights guarantees, including the right to life, the right to 
liberty, the right to be free from discrimination and the right to be protected against 
unreasonable interference with privacy, provided under international human rights 
instruments, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
Special Rapporteur joins the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights in their call for an end to violence and discrimination against all people, 
irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.68 
</p>
<p>67. Interviews with 24 members of the Iranian LGBT community for the present report 
substantiated many of the concluding observations made by the Human Rights Committee.69 
Fifteen interviewees stated that they had been arrested at least once for their sexual 
orientation or for associating with other LGBT persons. Thirteen reported that, in detention, 
security officers had subjected them to some form of torture or physical abuse, including 
punching, kicking or baton strikes to the head or body and, in a few cases, sexual assault and 
rape. Several people reported that they had been coerced into signing a confession. The 
criminalization of same-sex relations facilitates physical abuse in the domestic setting as 
well. A majority of these individuals reported that they had been beaten by family members 
at home but could not report these assaults to the authorities out of fear that they would 
themselves be charged with a criminal act. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Socioeconomic rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>68. In addition to the limitations put on access to education for women and some religious 
minorities, reports continue to indicate that students engaged in political activities are being 
deprived of their education (see table 5 below). In a letter to the Special Rapporteur, an 
Iranian student organization, Daftar Tahkim Vahdat, reported an increase in punitive action 
against student organizations, publications and activities in reaction to peaceful efforts aimed 
at improving academic life and defending student and human rights.

<p> 69 See CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para. 10. </p>


<p><b>  Table 5 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>69. Citing statistics based on information gathered from news sources, the Commission 
maintains that, since March 2005, there have been at least 945 cases of students deprived of 
continuing education for either one or more semesters, and at least 41 cases of professors 
expelled from university. Of the 986 reported cases, more than 140 cases applied solely to 
Allameh Tabataba&#8217;i University (14 professors and 57 students), headed by Sadreddin 
Shariati, and Amirkabir Polytechnic University of Tehran (72 students), headed by Alireza 
Rahaei. Moreover, three student publications or associations have been forcibly closed. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. Individuals interviewed for the present report maintained that they had been denied 
access to universities despite achieving high scores on university entrance examinations for 
higher degrees, because of their political activities. One top-ranking political science student, 
for example, reported having been denied entrance to a Masters degree programme until a 
pledge to abstain from student activism for the duration of studies was signed. The person 
was later denied access to PhD studies, alleging having been informed that the Ministry of 
Intelligence had placed that person&#8217;s name on a list of students banned from continuing their 
education.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at allegations that university professors in 
the field of humanities continue to be expelled for their views (see table 6 below). The 
Minister for Science and Technology, Kamran Daneshjoo, reportedly asserted that professors 
uncommitted to <i>velayat</i>&#8211;<i>e faqih</i> (guardianship of the Islamic jurist) or who have a &#8220;secular or 
liberal-democracy point of view&#8221; are not needed in the Islamic Republic of Iran.70 One 
professor reported having been subjected to immense pressure from the head of the university 
to prove devotion to Islamic values and the Iranian State by demanding that the professor join 
daily prayers at the university. Refusal to cooperate was reportedly followed by death threats 
from the Ministry of Intelligence, which informed the professor that refusal to cooperate with 
the Islamic guidelines of the university would lead to the professor being &#8220;expelled, killed 
and buried in an undisclosed grave&#8221;. The professor also reported that 12 colleagues had been 
expelled or forced into early retirement for alleged non-cooperation with the Islamic 
guidelines of the university in the past five years.

<p><b>  Table 6 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Economic sanctions 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur joins the Secretary-General in reiterating his concern for the 
potentially negative humanitarian effect of general economic sanctions imposed on the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.71 In its general comment No. 8, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights pointed out that the inhabitants of a given country do not forfeit their 
basic economic, social and cultural rights by virtue of any determination that their leaders 
have violated norms relating to international peace and security.72 The Committee also stated 
that the imposition of international sanctions does not in any way nullify or diminish the 
obligations of a State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights to do its utmost to ensure that every individual, without discrimination, enjoys the 
rights stipulated by the Covenant and to seek measures to protect vulnerable groups.73<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. Furthermore, the Committee makes clear that imposing sanctions bestows obligations 
upon the imposing parties to respect the economic and social rights of the sanctioned 
country&#8217;s population.74 Principles introduced in a 1995 non-paper on the humanitarian impact 
of sanctions submitted to the Security Council by the five Permanent Members thereof called 
for &#8220;unimpeded access to humanitarian aid&#8221; within the targeted country and for monitoring 
</p>
<p>the humanitarian effects of sanctions, while a letter addressed to the Council by the 
Secretary-General urged sanctions regimes to account for human rights and humanitarian 
standards.75  
</p>
<p>74. While the Special Rapporteur takes note of the efforts made by parties imposing 
sanctions, including the &#8220;humanitarian exemptions&#8221; to exempt foodstuffs, medical supplies 
and other humanitarian goods from the sanctions, reports of shortages of the drugs used in the 
treatment of illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, haemophilia and multiple sclerosis give 
rise to concerns that such exemptions might not always meet their intended purpose.76 In the

</p>
<p> </p>


<p>light of such reports, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the efficacy of 
international safeguards intended to reduce the adverse impact of general sanctions on the 
Iranian population. He will therefore continue to seek the cooperation of the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and that of sanction-imposing countries to report on the 
effectiveness of humanitarian safeguards. Some reports point to sanctions aimed at the 
country&#8217;s financial sector, which could pose an impediment to conducting transactions for 
exempted items, despite humanitarian waivers.77 The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at 
the severe rise in inflation, increased commodity prices and subsidy cuts, which could also 
hinder access to essential goods.78 According to certain sources, domestic authorities could 
take steps to mitigate some of the humanitarian effects of sanctions and better meet 
obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur stresses that further investigation into the above issues is 
necessary, and therefore requests the assistance and cooperation of the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in facilitating an unfettered visit to the country in order to allow an 
adequate assessment of the humanitarian consequences of sanctions and their impact on the 
economic and social rights of Iranians. He also appeals to relevant United Nations agencies 
and sanctions-imposing Governments to aid in the evaluation of the impact of sanctions on 
the general population.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>After reflecting on the past two years of his mandate and the findings in the 
present report, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there the seriousness of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran has increased. Frequent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disconcerting reports of punitive State action against various members of civil society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions that undermine the full enjoyment of human rights by women, religious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic minorities, and retributive State action against individuals suspected of 
</b></p>
<p><b>communicating with the mandate holder </b>raise serious concern about the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>resolve to promote respect for human rights in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur continues to be alarmed at the rate of executions in the 
country, especially for crimes that do not meet serious crimes standards, and especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the face of allegations of widespread and ongoing torture for the purposes of 
</b></p>
<p>soliciting confessions from the accused. The Government&#8217;s ability to address 
</p>
<p><b>meaningfully the matters raised by a number of human rights instruments and the

</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran take the following actions to address the issues raised in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>present and previous reports by the mandate holder: 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Investigate immediately all allegations of reprisals against individuals who

weeks in solitary confinement in Evin before being transferred to Section 3, Ward 209 of the 
prison. While in solitary confinement, Abedini&#8217;s interrogators allegedly disoriented him with 
</p>
<p>tactics such as sleep deprivation. During his time in Ward 209, Abedini&#8217;s interrogators 
reportedly beat him; he was initially denied access to medical treatment for his injuries but 
later was allegedly taken for treatment. His family was able to hire a lawyer for his defense in

In detention, Golchin&#8217;s interrogators subjected him to psychological torture in the form of 
</p>
<p>threats of physical violence and of execution. He was released on 25 July 2010 on 
200,000,000 tuman bail. On 19 April 2011 Branch 28 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court 
sentenced Golchin to one year in prison. His lawyer was reportedly not allowed to speak 
during the court session. Golchin appealed this sentence and was acquitted of all charges six 
months later, but received no documentation to this effect. Golchin continued to experience

repeatedly threatened by authorities for his activities and was arrested on 9 February 2011 at 
his home without a warrant by unknown authorities, and was pepper-sprayed at the time of 
arrest. The authorities then reportedly confiscated his Arabic books, computer, and cell 
phone. The interviewee maintained that his family was unaware of the place of his detention 
for a month and that Mr. Sorkhi was only able to contact his family after four months when 
he was transferred to Karoun Prison. The source stated that Mr. Sorkhi was charged with 
&#8220;establishing anti-state Arabic groups&#8221;, &#8220;cooperating with Arab countries in the region&#8221;, 
&#8220;disturbing public order&#8221;, and &#8220;participating in the Arab national movement.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>interviewee alleged that Mr. Sorkhi has been tortured, and reported that he remains in 
detention and has not yet been sentenced. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Hameed was a student studying in Syria and was arrested on 19 June 2008 during 
a visit to Iran. He reported that he was arrested at the airport by plainclothes security forces </p>


<p>and accused of founding an Arab Ahwaz group in Syria, and of being active against the 
Islamic Republics. After being interrogated he was released, only to be rearrested in July 
</p><p>2008. He was arrested in his home, blindfolded, handcuffed, and taken to the security office 
of Ahwaz, where he reported being held in solitary confinement until 6 September 2008. 
After 10 days of being interrogated he was charged with &#8220;propaganda against the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran&#8221; and with &#8220;contact with the Refagh [Arab Nationalist] Party&#8221;. He served 
two months in detention, during which he was physically assaulted, resulting in a separated 
retina. He asserted that he did not have adequate access to medical services for his injury. 
Moreover, Mr. Hameed stated that prison officials demanded he confess to &#8220;writing about 
</p>
<p>discrimination against Ahwazi Arabs in an effort to stir up trouble&#8221;. He was denied access to 
</p>
<p>a lawyer, and was eventually released on bail.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kurdish Cases 
</b></p>
<p>27. Mohammad Ali Afraza, a Kurdish human rights activist, was arrested in Sanandaj in 
</p><p>2008. He reported that eight security forces arrested him, and beat and verbally abused him. 
He reported that he was charged with &#8220;disrupting social security&#8221;, that he was kept solitary 
confinement for 21 days, and that he was physically and psychologically tortured. He was 
reportedly blindfolded during interrogations and threatened with execution. He was 
eventually taken to the court in Sanandaj Prison prison where the conditions were reportedly 
poor. These conditions allegedly included severe overcrowding, and the widespread, 
consistent torture of prisoners. Mr. Afraza stated that other prisoners were ordered not to 
speak to him, which he said was psychologically taxing. He was released on bail after five 
months, tried two months later, and sentenced to four months in prison, with a five year 
suspended sentence. He alleged that his trial lasted seven minutes and that he was convicted 
of &#8220;spying for sources outside of the country&#8221; and with &#8220;propaganda and illegal political 
</p>
<p>organizations&#8221;. He was released after his trial, and has since left Iran.  
</p>
<p>28. An informed source reported that s(he) was part of a student organization that 
informed Kurdish students about their rights as a minority group in Iran. S(he) was 
suspended by his/her university&#8217;s disciplinary committee for one year for participating in a 
</p>
<p>banned student newspaper. The source reported being summoned to the Ministry of 
Intelligence 11 times between May and June 2010. During these sessions, (s)he was accused 
of being a separatist, a spy, and of acting against the Supreme Leader. The source reported 
being blindfolded, verbally abused, and humiliated during these interrogations. (S)he was 
charged with &#8220;Membership in the Democratic Union of Kurdish Students&#8221;, &#8220;acting against 
</p>
<p>the regime through propagating falsehoods&#8221;, &#8220;creating public anxiety and disrupting public 
</p>
<p>order through organizing protest demonstrations&#8221;, and &#8220;interviewing with foreign media&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>(S)he was reportedly sentenced to several months in prison, cash fines, and lashes. His/her 
prison sentence was revoked upon appeal, and (s)he was able to pay a fine in lieu of flogging. 
(S)he reported that (s)he was denied access to a lawyer. In 2012, the source reported that 
(s)he was arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence, that (s) he was physically abused during 
his/her arrest, detained in solitary confinement for three weeks, and interrogated on six 
separate occasions. During this time the source was again accused of being a spy and a 
member of Kurdish political parties. (S)he reported that his/her request for a lawyer was 
mocked and denied, that (s)he was asked to call other Kurdish activists who have been 
executed &#8220;terrorists&#8221; during his/her interrogations, and that (s)he was released on excessive 
bail after approximately three weeks in detention. (S)he has been banned from attending 
university and believes that (s)he has been blacklisted from finding work. The source has 
since left Iran. </p>


<p><b> V. Student activists cases 
</b></p>
<p>29. Ismaeil Jalilvand was a student and social activist who has been arrested four times 
and was eventually expelled in 2011 for his activities. He was arrested on 4 February 2009, 
was charged with &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, &#8220;disturbing public opinion&#8221;, &#8220;insulting 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Leader and the President&#8221;, and &#8220;propagation against the State&#8221; within 24 hours 
</p>
<p>of his arrest. He maintained that he spent 11 days in solitary confinement, and was 
interrogated seven-to-eight times, for up to six hours each time, while blindfolded. He was 
eventually fined and released. There was no trial. Mr. Jalilvand was arrested agin four 
months later on 20 June 2009. He reported that he was detained by the Ministry of 
Intelligence for 30 days, that he didn&#8216;t have access to a lawyer, was blindfolded during the 
interrogations, and that he was convicted on charges of &#8220;insulting Government officials&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, &#8220;propagation against the Islamic Republic&#8221;, &#8220;disturbing 
</p>
<p>public opinion, and &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader and the President&#8221;. He stated that he was 
</p>
<p>asked to defend himself and that his trial lasted one hour. He is currently released from prison 
and has left the country.  
</p>
<p>30. On 10 February 2010 Ali Ajami was arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence for his 
involvement in the 2009 post-election protests. He spent five days in solitary confinement at 
a Revolutionary Guard office without access to a lawyer. He was transferred to Evin Prison, 
where he spent 40 days in solitary confinement and was officially charged with &#8220;publicizing 
false information,&#8221; &#8220;acting against national security,&#8221; &#8220;propagation against the state,&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader.&#8221; At Evin Prison he was repeatedly interrogated about his 
</p>
<p>student publications and online activities for up to eight hours per day, while blindfolded. 
During these interrogations he was repeatedly beaten and punched, made to stand for long 
periods of time, and his family threatened. Mr. Ajami reported that in court the judge denied 
his request for a lawyer and that he was only able to see a lawyer on the day of his hearing. 
After an appeal he was sentenced to two years in Rajaei Shahr Prison for &#8220;propaganda 
</p>
<p>against the state&#8221; and &#8220;acting against national security.&#8221; During his imprisonment he faced 
</p>
<p>extremely poor prison conditions, including severe abuse by prison officials. The deputy 
director of the prison allegedly hit Mr. Ajami so severely in the ear that it caused bleeding 
and a torn eardrum. After eventually being released, Mr. Ajami received a letter from the 
university stating that he was banned from continuing his education.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Cases 
</b></p>
<p>31. An anonymous source reported that he was imprisoned twice for activities related to 
his sexual orientation. He maintained that in the first instance, a Government agent entrapped 
him by posing as another gay man on a gay dating website. It was reported that the source 
was physically abused and strip-searched, that he was detained for several days without 
contact with family, that he was coerced to sign a document that he had engaged in &#8220;Tafkhiz&#8221; 
(non-penetrative sex) with other males, and that he was verbally abused by a judge who 
sentenced him to 100 &#8220;hadd&#8221; lashes on his torso and appendages, some of which were 
</p>
<p>reportedly applied. The source was arrested again at an airport with a group of friends after 
dropping a friend off there. The group of men were charged with &#8220;the creation of a 
</p>
<p>prostitution center to facilitate the occurrence of sexually illegal activities&#8221; and with 
</p>
<p>&#8220;committing sinful acts like cross-dressing, wearing makeup, and lustful kissing&#8221;. They were 
then brought to prison for 12 days, where they were allegedly kept in unsanitary and cramped 
conditions, and the source was eventually issued a flogging sentence. The sentence was later 
dropped, and he was released on excessive bail. The source&#8217;s parents used their property as 
</p>
<p>collateral for their son&#8217;s release. He has since left the country. </p>


<p>32. An interviewee reported that he was beaten by his father and punished by school 
administrators because of his &#8220;effeminate&#8221; behavior. He maintained that he suffered from 
</p>
<p>depression as a result of his constant abuse, and could not remain gainfully employed. In 
2007 the source attended a party primarily for gay men in his town. He asserted that the party 
was raided by plainclothes officers, who reportedly forced the attendees to lay down with 
their hands behind their backs and poured alcohol the officers allegedly brought on them, 
while stepping on them and beating them with batons and glass bottles. The source 
maintained that dozens of the attendees were taken to the local Intelligence center, were 
verbally humiliated, strip-searched, and forced to sleep on the floor of their cells before being 
transferred to a prison where they spent 4-5 more days. They were allegedly kicked, strip-
searched, verbally humiliated, kept in an overcrowded cell, and asked humiliating sexual 
questions by interrogators there. The source was sentenced to two years&#8217; imprisonment for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;facilitating and organizing a party in which alcohol is consumed and immoral acts are 
performed&#8221;, despite the source&#8217;s claim that there was no alcohol at the party. When the story 
</p>
<p>became public, employers would not hire him, or would fire him when they connected him 
with the story. The source has since left the country.  
</p>
<p>33. The witness attended the same party as the previous source. He separately reported 
that agents raided the party, ordered all attendees to the ground, and stepped on them with 
boots, while beating some with batons. The source was taken to the same detention facility in 
handcuffs and a blindfold, and slept on the floor with co-detainees. He was brought before a 
judge, who insulted him. He received a fine sentence, and was released; he believes he was 
not detained for as long as the others because he denied knowing that the party was for gay 
men or being gay himself. He has since left the country. 
</p>
<p>34. A source reported that a child, teachers corporally punished him for behavior they 
considered &#8220;effeminate&#8221;, and his principal called his parents to complain. As a teenager, male 
children in his neighborhood gang-raped him. He did not call the police because, as he 
claimed: &#8220;I live in a society in which the police do not protect me. On the contrary, the police 
</p>
<p>come after people like me&#8221;. As a young adult, the witness was arrested on four occasions by 
local police in a park known for gay encounters. Each time, they told him to sign a pledge to 
act &#8220;appropriately&#8221; before being released. He was arrested by different officers each time, but 
believes that if he had been tagged as a multiple offender, the consequences would have been 
more severe. He has since left the country.  
</p>
<p>35. The witness, a Kurdish F-to-M transgender man, maintained that he was constantly 
beaten by his father for behavior that his father considered &#8220;un-feminine&#8221;. He did not go to 
the police, because &#8220;as [someone legally considered a girl], my father could legally do 
</p>
<p>anything he wanted with me&#8221;. After one year under de facto house arrest by his father, the 
witness returned to school, but plainclothes officers detained him one night when he was with 
his female romantic companion. The officers noticed on his ID that he was legally a female, 
and brought him to a female prison, where they verbally humiliated him and physically 
touched and searched his genitals and breasts. He was forced to sign a pledge that he would 
dress and act &#8220;correctly&#8221; as a woman as a condition for his release. He has since left the 
</p>
<p>country.  <b>

<p><b>  Freedom from Torture </b>&#8211;<b> Country Reporting Programme Torture in 
post-election Iran, 2009</b>&#8211;<b>2011 
</b></p>
<p>36. Freedom from Torture (formerly known as the Medical Foundation for the Care of 
Victims of Torture) is a UK-based human rights organisation and one of the world&#8217;s largest 
torture treatment centres. Since our foundation in 1985, more than 50,000 people have been 
referred to us for rehabilitation and other forms of care and practical assistance. In 2011 
Freedom from Torture provided treatment to more than 1200 clients from around 80 different </p>


<p>countries. Every year our medico-legal report service prepares between 300 and 600 medico-
legal reports (MLRs) for use in UK asylum proceedings. 
</p>
<p>37. Freedom from Torture seeks to protect and promote the rights of torture survivors by 
drawing on the evidence of torture that has been recorded over almost three decades. In 
particular, we aim to contribute to international efforts to prevent torture and hold perpetrator 
states to account through our Country Reporting Programme, based on research into torture 
patterns for particular countries, using evidence contained in our MLRs. 
</p>
<p>38. Freedom from Torture&#8217;s MLRs are detailed forensic reports documenting physical and 
psychological consequences of torture. They are prepared by specialist clinicians according 
to standards set out in the UN Istanbul Protocol&#8217;. Each is subject to a detailed clinical and 
legal review process. While the primary purpose of our MLRs is to assist decision-makers in 
individual asylum claims &#8211; and for these purposes our clinicians act strictly as independent 
experts &#8211; collectively they also represent an invaluable source of evidence of torture that can 
be used to hold perpetrator states to account. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Freedom from Torture&#8217;s history of working with Iranian torture 
<b>survivors 
</b></p>
<p>39. Freedom from Torture has consistently received more referrals for Iranians than for 
any other nationality. Since our foundation, over 5000 Iranians have been referred to us for 
clinical services &#8211; this represents 10% of the more than 50,000 total referrals we have 
received. Nearly 30% of Freedom from Torture&#8217;s current treatment clients are of Iranian 
origin and at least 16% of all MLRs we have produced over the past three years have been for 
Iranian clients. 
</p>
<p>40. Our Iranian clients, both past and present, together embody and provide evidence of 
the history of torture perpetrated by the Iranian state from the 1980s to the present day. The 
MLRs we have produced for Iranians provide substantial and robust evidence of torture in 
Iran and are the source of data for this snapshot study of torture perpetrated by the Iranian 
government in the lead up to and following the Presidential election in June 2009. We hope 
the evidence from this study will be of assistance to the UN Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights situation in Iran in fulfilling his important mandate. This is against the backdrop of 
presidential elections due in Iran in 2013, during which further human rights abuses are 
feared by the international community. 
</p>
<p><b>  Case sample and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>41. The current study is focused on patterns of torture perpetrated in the context of the 
2009 Presidential election in Iran and the unrest and repression of dissent which followed. It 
is based on a systematic review and evaluation of 50 cases, selected according to criteria of 
detention and torture within the relevant date range (January 2009 onwards) and consent to 
use anonymised cases for research. 
</p>
<p>42. Data was collected and recorded systematically from 50 MLRs and included details of 
the case profile, history of detention, specific torture disclosures and the forensic 
documentation of the physical and psychological consequences of torture, based on a 
comprehensive clinical examination and assessment process in accordance with Istanbul 
Protocol standards. The data collected was both quantitative and qualitative in type and was 
anonymised and aggregated before being analysed; the findings are presented in summary 
below. </p>


<p><b>  Case profile 
</b></p>
<p>43. Of the 50 cases included in this study, 40 were male and 10 female. Forty two cases 
(84%) were between the ages of 18 and 35 and all identified themselves as heterosexual. 
Twenty one of the 50 cases were resident in Tehran at the time of detention, followed by 
seven cases in each of three Kurdish provinces and Shiraz city and three cases in each of 
Esfahan, Karaj and Ahwaz. The 50 cases comprised 32 (64%) ethnic Persians, ten Kurds, 
four Azeris, three Bakhtiaris and a Lur. Forty cases identified as Muslim. Non-Muslims in 
the sample included two who identified as Christians (converts in exile), two as Ahl-e Haq, 
and six professing no religion or specific religious affiliation. 
</p>
<p>44. Twenty six cases (52%) said they were only politically active from the 2009 election 
onwards, with another 11 reporting activism or dissent prior to 2009 on issues including 
ethnic and religious minority rights, freedom of expression and women&#8217;s rights. Another 13 
(26%) claimed never to have been active or dissentient and were detained primarily on the 
basis of the activities of family members or others and a political opinion imputed to them. 
Individuals who were politically active only from the 2009 election onwards reported 
activities including attending pre-election meetings, supporting opposition candidates, 
disseminating political materials and attending demonstrations. Individuals claiming a prior 
history of activism had reported writing blogs, compiling and disseminating materials critical 
of the government, writing political slogans in public and taking part in informal (illegal) 
discussion groups, amongst other activities. Four Kurdish individuals reported various forms 
of Kurdish activism ranging from cultural activism to supporting illegal Kurdish 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Arrest and detention patterns 
</b></p>
<p>45. Twenty-nine (58%) of the 50 cases were detained most recently in 2009, 14 in 2010 
and seven in 2011.1 While 28 (56%) of all cases were detained only once in 2009-11, others 
were detained more than once and up to three times before leaving Iran. Some cases also had 
a history of detention before the events of 2009; 10 had been detained before 2005 and eight 
had been detained in the period 2005-2009. Some of these cases had suffered repeated 
detentions during these periods. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reasons for arrests 
</b></p>
<p>46. The majority of cases (27, 54%) were arrested and detained at demonstrations and 
other protests between 13 June 2009 (the day after the election) and February 2011. Of these 
cases, many reported being detained arbitrarily when security forces descended upon 
demonstrators. Others were engaged in more specific activities that might have led to arrest 
such as: distributing leaflets, assisting others to escape arrest or assault by security forces, 
assaulting security forces, holding placards, chanting anti-government slogans, wearing green 
(identified with the opposition) and filming the events. Eight people were arrested for other 
kinds of activism around the 2009 election and its aftermath and nine because of imputed 
political opinion and activities of others associated with them, mainly family members. Two 
cases were detained for imputed religious dissent and four others for non-political offences 
such as infringement of alcohol laws and behavioral codes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detaining authorities and place of detention  
</b></p>
<p>47. Eleven of the cases report being detained by the Basij (state militia), ten by Etela&#8217;at 
(state intelligence forces), eight by the police, three by Revolutionary Guards, one by the </p>


<p>military, one by the morality forces and 16 by unknown plain clothed agents. In most cases 
(68%) the state authority that had arrested them and the one that detained and tortured them 
was thought to be the same. The largest number of cases overall reported being both arrested 
and detained by Etela&#8217;at and the Basij, with a significant number reporting that they were 
</p>
<p>detained by the police (indeed four specific police stations were identified). A small number 
of other places of detention that were identified (usually on release) included: four prisons 
(two in or near Tehran), three Etela&#8217;at facilities and two Basij bases in various locations 
</p>
<p>around the country. However, 21 people (42%) said that they did not know with certainty 
which state force they were detained by and the majority (64%) also could not identify the 
specific place where they were detained, because they were blindfolded en route and/or 
because it was an unofficial facility and could not be identified. 
</p>
<p><b>  Due process during arrest and ill treatment en route to detention  
</b></p>
<p>48. Of the 50 cases, only four reported being issued with a charge and only one with a 
warrant at the time of arrest. All 27 people who reported being arrested on a protest or 
demonstration said that they experienced violence and ill treatment both during arrest and en 
route to the detention facility. Most described being beaten with batons, sworn at with 
obscenities and other verbal abuse. Other cases who were arrested from their home or other 
private address for activities (actual or alleged) connected to the election protests reported 
similar treatment, with family members being violently treated, subject to threats and verbal 
abuse and personal property being destroyed or illegally confiscated. Most people (86%), 
whatever the cause of arrest, reported that they were blindfolded and handcuffed en route to 
detention; in some cases they were fully hooded and cuffed in stress positions. 
</p>
<p>49. It should be noted that there is typically a considerable time lag between when a 
person is detained and when they seek Freedom from Torture&#8217;s medico-legal report services 
in the UK. It is therefore likely that evidence of detention and torture from 2010 onwards will 
increase as MLRs are completed for Iranian cases referred to Freedom from Torture more 
recently. 
</p>
<p><b>  Due process during detention  
</b></p>
<p>50. All 50 cases reported being held incommunicado and tortured. The majority (80%) 
described interrogation that was concurrent with torture episodes (sometimes alternating). 
Most (74%) reported that they could not see their interrogators as they were kept blindfolded 
and in the majority of cases interrogation appeared to be focused specifically on forcing a 
confession to actual or alleged offences. These included attending demonstrations, belonging 
to or being active in illegal political groups, organising protests and involvement in other 
dissentient actions. Interrogation also focused on links with or on the activities of others, 
including family members. Some, particularly those who were or had been resident abroad, 
were questioned about links with foreign agents and exiled political groups and activists.  
</p>
<p>51. Nearly half the cases in the study (48%) said they were forced under torture to sign 
confessions or statements about future activities; all but three of these had not seen the 
contents of these documents. Six cases reported refusing to sign confessions despite being 
tortured with the stated intent of forcing them to do so. In most cases individuals reported 
being given a conditional release following a confession, while some were transferred to 
prison, pending formal summons to attend court. 
</p>
<p>52. In most cases no formal charges were made (88%) and there was no access to legal 
counsel (96%) or a judicial process (88%). Of the 50, only six cases received charges in front 
of a judge, all following a confession forced under torture. Of these, only two had access to </p>


<p>legal counsel, who had sight of the specific charges. Offences that people reported being 
accused of during interrogation sessions and formal charges they were threatened with 
included: &#8216;waging war against God&#8217; (&#8216;mohareb&#8217;), &#8216;insulting Islam&#8217;, &#8216;insulting the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Leader&#8217;, &#8216;disturbing the peace&#8217;, &#8216;participating in political and student assemblies&#8217;, &#8216;co-
operating with anti-revolutionary groups&#8217;, &#8216;having links with the UK and with foreign 
groups&#8217;, &#8216;propaganda against the regime&#8217; and &#8216;assaulting an officer&#8217;, amongst others. Only 
</p>
<p>five people reported being taken to court and one reported being tried in absentia. 
</p>
<p>53. Eight cases reported being moved to prison after periods of interrogation and torture, 
three of whom said torture continued in prison. Two cases were released from prison to 
psychiatric hospitals and at least six others were also transferred from detention to hospital 
for treatment. All of these cases were eventually able to secure release or to escape with the 
intervention of family members. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detention conditions  
</b></p>
<p>54. Detention conditions for a significant proportion of cases were extremely poor and in 
nearly 70% of cases included solitary confinement in a small cell. Half or more cases also 
reported experiencing unhygienic conditions, poor quality and inadequate food, a hard 
surface to sleep on with inadequate bedding, no access to natural light and inadequate access 
to a toilet. The majority of cases received no medical treatment while in detention. Of the 
eight who were transferred to hospital, three were taken to psychiatric hospitals and the 
others reported being transferred for treatment following rape and for specialist medical care 
due to acute injuries to the head, shoulder and knee respectively. Seven others reported 
access to limited medical treatment in the detention centre, most of whom had injuries arising 
from sharp force trauma sutured, some without anaesthetic; two of these were also treated for 
a fracture and a dislocation caused by blunt force trauma. One person reported being treated 
following rape. 
</p>
<p><b>  Duration of detention and escape or release 
</b></p>
<p>55. More than 70% of the detentions were less than a month and just under half were less 
than a week in duration. However, a significant number of people were detained for longer, 
with two cases being detained for more than a year and three cases being detained for 7-12 
months. Overall, 57 of the 62 detention episodes in 2009-11 were for six months or less. 
Eight people were able to secure a conditional release or to escape from detention following 
transfer to a medical facility and seven cases reported that they escaped from detention rather 
than being formally released, in most cases with assistance. A further 12 people reported that 
they were taken blindfolded to unknown locations and released with no explanation, possibly 
as a result of a bribe, though they reported being unaware of the exact circumstances. Eight 
people reported that conditional release was granted after the intervention of family members 
with a variety of bail conditions, including the production of property deeds and money. 
More than 40% of cases fled Iran within a month and an additional 20% within three months 
of being released from or escaping their most recent detention (note that in many cases this 
was not the first period of detention). Most of the individuals left Iran within a year of being 
released, with a small number remaining in Iran for up to two years and two people 
remaining for more than two years before eventually being forced to seek protection abroad. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pattern of torture episodes 
</b></p>
<p>56. More than half the cases (58%) said that they were interrogated and tortured in a room 
different from their detention cell, although some were also beaten, raped and otherwise ill-</p>


<p>treated in their cell. Four people said they were taken to a room specifically for torture where 
there were hooks and other devices in place for suspension. At least six others said that 
torture and interrogation occurred in their cell, while for the remainder this information was 
not recorded.   
</p>
<p>57. The authorities responsible for interrogation and torture in these cases appeared intent 
on ensuring that they could not to be identified by, in the majority of cases, keeping people 
blindfolded or hooded whenever they were out of their cells, with the likely additional intent 
of increasing their fear, disorientation and suffering. A few reported that their blindfolds were 
removed for certain episodes of torture or interrogation but on most of these occasions their 
captors were not identifiable. Only two people reported seeing uniformed personnel in the 
detention facility, in one case wearing green and in the other, dark blue uniform. Some 
people described being aware that different perpetrators, usually identified by their voices, 
were coming and going or were involved in different ways in their torture and interrogation, 
despite not being able to see them in most cases. 
</p>
<p>58. In 34% of cases people reported being tortured at least daily and sometimes several 
times a day in detention, while for 15 cases the frequency of torture was not recorded. Eight 
people reported being subjected to a limited number of episodes of torture (1-3) during their 
detention, though the duration of detention was relatively short in these cases. The remaining 
10 cases reported no regular pattern and said that they could not predict when they would be 
taken for torture or interrogation episodes. In these cases the interval appeared to range from 
successive days, to every few days, to monthly or less, with the frequency reducing over time 
where the period in detention was lengthy. 
</p>
<p><b>  Specific forms of torture disclosed 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Methods of physical torture  
</b></p>
<p>59. Methods of physical torture described by the 50 cases and documented in the MLR 
included: blunt force trauma including beating, whipping and assault (100% of cases); sexual 
torture including rape, molestation, violence to genitals and penetration with an instrument 
(60%); suspension and stress positions (64%); use of water (32%); sharp force trauma 
including use of blades, needles and fingernails (18%); burns (12%); electric shock (10%); 
asphyxiation (10%) and pharmacological or chemical torture (8%). Of the cases sampled, 
60% of females and 23% of males reported rape. 
</p>
<p>60. The main forms of blunt force trauma consisted of repeated and sustained assault by 
kicking, punching, slapping and of beatings with a variety of blunt instruments including 
truncheons, cables, whips, batons, plastic pipes, metal bars, gun butts, belts and handcuffs. 
People reported being assaulted or beaten on all parts of the body, though most commonly on 
the head and face, arms and legs and back. Most were blindfolded while beaten and many 
were restrained, meaning they were unable to defend or protect themselves. 
</p>
<p>61. Seven people were burned, some repeatedly and most with heated metal objects but 
also with lighted cigarettes or caustic substances. All were blindfolded and restrained and 
described intense pain. Most of the nine people subjected to sharp force trauma were cut with 
sharp or bladed instruments; two of these were cut during sexual torture, one by the 
fingernails of the man who raped him and the other by a blade when he attempted to resist 
assault. Electric shocks were administered in five cases to the genitals, hands and feet, legs, 
nipples and buttocks, by electrodes or &#8216;clips&#8217; or some form of &#8216;baton&#8217;. In one case the person 
</p>
<p>was shocked concurrently with sexual torture. 
</p>
<p>62. Of the 32 cases subjected to positional torture, 16 were suspended by a variety of 
techniques, including upside down or with wrists bound behind the body, from hooks in the 
ceiling or bars on the wall. A wide variety of forced or stress positions were also described in </p>


<p>11 cases, apparently designed to humiliate and to produce a powerful psychological response 
as well as severe physical discomfort and pain. Many described being suspended and 
restrained in stress positions while being beaten and otherwise tortured, as well as being 
interrogated. In some cases, restraint appears to have been designed to facilitate the 
administration of a particular form of torture, such as burning, electric shock, asphyxiation or 
sexual torture. A small number reported the use of asphyxiation techniques, including the 
repeated submersion of the head in water or contaminated water containing urine and faeces. 
One person was &#8216;water-boarded&#8217; on at least five occasions. Three people were given 
medication by force, described as mind and mood altering and extremely distressing. 
</p>
<p>63. Given the high levels of shame and stigma attached to rape and sexual assault for men 
and for women, significant under-disclosure of sexual torture is highly likely among the cases 
in this sample. Despite this, 60% of men and women in the sample reported sexual torture 
including rape, molestation, violence to genitals and penetration with an instrument. Six of 
the 10 women experienced sexual torture. All were raped in the interrogation room or in their 
cell or both, all on more than one occasion, some many times and all by two or more people. 
Disclosure of rape in all cases was extremely problematic and clinicians recorded the intense 
psychological distress and flashback symptoms experienced by these women in talking about 
sexual torture. In some cases, disclosure was only possible after extensive counselling and in 
some the clinician reported being unable to facilitate a full disclosure due to the high risk of 
re-traumatisation. Four of the six women disclosed that they had also been subjected to 
sexual humiliation including forced nakedness (with clothing being violently removed), 
verbal abuse of an extreme sexual nature and molestation. All described being forcibly 
restrained while the rape and sexual assault was taking place and most were treated with 
extreme violence; at least four were rendered unconscious. 
</p>
<p>64. Of the twenty-four men who disclosed sexual torture, nine were subjected to rape and 
a further five to penetration with instruments. In some cases several perpetrators were present 
and participating, in the cell or in the interrogation room; all cases were forcibly restrained. 
Those cases who reported rape and anal penetration described brutal attacks during which 
they were penetrated, sometimes repeatedly, including with objects such as batons and 
bottles. Two other cases reported violent assault to their genitals, while a further eight 
described being sexually molested while being verbally abused and threatened with 
penetration or rape. In all cases clinicians recorded observing high levels of shame and 
ongoing psychological distress and significant difficulty in disclosure. 
</p>
<p><b>  Methods of psychological and environmental torture 
</b></p>
<p>65. Psychological and environmental forms of torture, which were highly prevalent in this 
case sample, included but were not limited to humiliation (40 cases), solitary confinement 
(34), verbal abuse (32), threat of death (22), threat to family (15), sleep deprivation (12), and 
mock executions (7). 
</p>
<p>66. Psychological forms of torture included the extensive and persistent use of humiliation 
in most cases, particularly verbal abuse and profanities directed towards the individual or 
members of their family (especially female family members). Being forced to perform 
humiliating acts (most but not all with a physical element causing pain and physical stress) 
and enforced nakedness or removal of clothing were also prevalent across the cases, with 
clinicians widely reporting the strong psychological impact of this treatment. 
</p>
<p>67. Threats, particularly of further or different forms of torture, of death and of violence to 
family members, were reported in 76% of cases and used to induce terror and enforce 
compliance, particularly to force a confession. Five people reported being given false 
information that their family members had died or were critically ill, or that they had been 
detained and tortured and had confessed to an alleged offence. Seven cases were subjected to 
a mock execution, where they believed that the threat of death would be imminently carried </p>


<p>out and the same number reported being forced to witness violence or harm to others in 
detention, including rape. Many cases (34%) described being exposed to the sounds of others 
being tortured or in distress in detention. While many cases reported the use of threats as well 
as torture to induce them to give information about others, in most cases they had no 
information or refused to give it. Four people said that they were eventually forced to give 
limited information about or name family members and associates. 
</p>
<p>68. The most prevalent form of environmental torture was the use of solitary confinement 
(68% of cases), in small cells, mostly throughout the entire detention. While the duration of 
solitary confinement was between a week and a month in the majority of cases, some were 
detained in this condition for several months and at least two cases for more than a year. 
Twelve people reported that they were prevented from sleeping or that their sleep was 
deliberately interrupted throughout the detention by guards banging on their cell doors, 
dousing them in cold water or taking them for interrogation as soon as they fell asleep. 
Others were kept awake by constant bright light in their cell. 
</p>
<p><b>  Forensic evidence and psychological impact of torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Forensic evidence of torture 
</b></p>
<p>69. Forty-one of cases (82%) had forensic evidence of physical trauma documented in 
their MLRs in the form of lesions (including scars) 2 arising from torture in detention in 
2009-2011. MLRs for the other nine cases specifically focused on the psychological signs 
and symptoms of torture and in four cases were prepared by the person&#8217;s treating clinician as 
</p>
<p>examination by an independent doctor was not deemed clinically appropriate. Chronic pain 
symptoms, mostly attributed to blunt force, positional and sexual tortures, were also reported 
in 48% of cases and nine cases documented fractures resulting from torture as described. Of 
the 50 cases sampled 17 (34%) had up to five lesions attributed to torture, while 11 cases had 
significantly more. Four people had a very large number of lesions (more than 20) or groups 
of numerous individual lesions assessed together in relation to their consistency with 
common attributed causes of torture. In all cases where a physical examination was 
conducted and lesions as well as other signs and symptoms of physical trauma were 
documented, those attributed to torture were clearly differentiated by clinicians and the 
individuals themselves, from those with a non-torture attribution. 
</p>
<p>70. The form of torture that produced the largest number of lesions overall was blunt force 
trauma; more than 60% of cases had some or numerous lesions attributed to this cause. 
Freedom from Torture clinicians, using Istanbul Protocol guidelines to describe the level of 
consistency of the physical findings with the attributed cause of torture, found that in 26 
cases there were lesions assessed to be &#8216;diagnostic&#8217;, &#8216;typical&#8217; or &#8216;highly consistent&#8217; of blunt 
</p>
<p>force trauma as described by the individual (with no other possible cause, few or a few other 
possible causes). It should be noted that although used in all cases in this sample, blunt force 
trauma very often does not produce enduring physical evidence, depending on factors 
including the force of the blow, the part of the body hit, the length of time since infliction, 
whether the skin was broken and the healing process. It is also routinely observed by 
clinicians that while individual scars and groups of scars are assessed for their &#8216;level&#8217; of 
consistency with the attributed cause in line with the Istanbul Protocol, &#8216;...Ultimately, it is the 
</p>
<p>overall evaluation of all lesions and not the consistency of each lesion with a particular form 
of torture that is important in assessing the torture story...&#8221; 
</p>
<p>71. All seven cases that reported being burned had lesions assessed by the clinicians as 
being &#8216;diagnostic&#8217;, &#8216;typical&#8217; or &#8216;highly consistent&#8217; of this form of torture. Similarly most of 
</p>
<p>the sharp force trauma scars were assessed as having this high level of consistency with the 
ascribed cause of torture. Physical evidence assessed as &#8216;typical&#8217; or &#8216;highly consistent&#8217; of 
</p>
<p>positional torture was documented in seven cases and consisted of ligature or shackle scars </p>


<p>and damage to the shoulders or wrists including dislocation, chronic pain and restriction of 
movement. Ten cases manifested physical symptoms associated with rape and sexual torture 
including anal bleeding and pain, vaginal bleeding and discharge, pain and swelling in the 
genitals, lower abdominal pain, pain on passing urine and sexual dysfunction of various 
kinds. 
</p>
<p>72. According to available information, 36 cases (72%) had either been referred to or had 
been medically treated by statutory health care providers for acute and chronic physical 
symptoms associated with torture in detention. In most cases treatment had occurred in the 
UK, although a few people had also been treated in Iran immediately on release from 
detention. Many people were treated for chronic pain symptoms, but others had been referred 
for acute injuries or symptoms related to these. Most of those who had been raped had either 
been screened for sexually transmitted diseases or were referred for such screening. 
</p>
<p><b>  Psychological impact of torture  
</b></p>
<p>73. Psychological findings for the 50 cases in this study included 45 people (90%) with 
symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to the history of torture in 
detention. Of these, 32 (64% overall) had symptoms reaching the diagnostic threshold 
according to the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. In addition, 
ongoing symptoms of depression directly related to the history of detention and torture were 
reported by 42 people (84%), of which 27 (54% overall) had symptoms reaching the 
diagnostic threshold for depression. According to available information, 39 cases (78%) were 
in treatment for depression and/or PTSD symptoms at the time of the documentation process, 
receiving medication and/or psychological therapies from statutory health care providers. A 
total of 11 cases were receiving treatment services from Freedom from Torture during the 
period when their MLR was being prepared. 
</p>
<p>74. Signs and symptoms associated with PTSD were reported and observed to a very high 
level across the sampled cases and included flashbacks (84%) and intrusive memories and 
thoughts (68%) where traumatic events are repeatedly re-experienced even when the 
individual is awake and conscious. Recurrent nightmares including elements of the traumatic 
events in actual or symbolic form and fear and severe anxiety responses to cues that trigger 
an association with the trauma were reported and/or observed during clinical sessions (94% 
and 56% respectively). Other typical symptoms included avoidance of thoughts, feelings and 
activities associated with the trauma, signs of which were observed in half the cases (50%). 
Some people also reported and demonstrated a marked emotional restriction or dissociation 
when recalling events related to their torture and a difficulty recalling these events (20%). A 
marked diminished interest, detachment and social withdrawal was also documented in 62% 
of cases, while almost all reported that they had difficulties sleeping (96%). 
</p>
<p>75. Other depressive features of PTSD and depression signs and symptoms documented in 
these cases included a persistently low mood in most cases (80%), increased fatigue (38%), 
as well as diminished appetite (60%). Difficulties with concentration and recall and scattered 
thoughts were also commonly reported and observed (70%), while feelings of worthlessness 
and guilt and a bleak or pessimistic view of the future were very commonly expressed (56%). 
Some individuals, particularly those who were raped, expressed a feeling of being irreparably 
damaged and a sense of their self identity having been permanently altered as a result of the 
torture, with devastating impact. Particular psychological responses to sexual torture and rape 
documented in those cases subjected to this included: intense and overwhelming feelings of 
shame; feelings of anger towards the abuser and/or internalised anger expressed as self 
hatred; fear and severe anxiety symptoms either generalised or related to those who remind 
the person of their abuser; avoidance of anything associated with the trauma, including being 
unable to remember anything or remember details of what occurred or to make a full </p>


<p>disclosure; social withdrawal and difficulty making relationships with others, especially men; 
sexual dysfunction; suicidal ideation, self harm and suicide attempts. 
</p>
<p>76. Overall twenty seven people (54%) in this case sample expressed ideas of self harm or 
of suicide during their assessment process that were directly related to their experiences of 
detention and torture in Iran and their ongoing symptoms of PTSD and depression arising 
from this trauma, as well as their experience of seeking protection in the UK in some cases 
(particularly the fear of removal). Ten people had indeed carried out acts of self harm (20%) 
and six had made suicide attempts (12%), some in Iran but mostly in the UK following flight. 
Some individuals had made several attempts and were considered to be at continued risk of 
suicide at the time of examination.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Overall conclusions on the clinical findings </b>&#8211;<b> congruence with attribution 
of torture 
</b></p>
<p>77. In their clinical opinion and concluding observations for the MLRs in the 50 sampled 
cases, examining clinicians drew together the salient elements of the account of detention and 
torture and the clinical evidence which may or may not have supported this history. This 
included: summary of the history and torture methods described; physical findings including 
lesions and their consistency with the attributed cause of torture, or lack of physical findings 
with clinical reasons; presence of lesions attributed by the person to other causes (non-
torture), demonstrating no attempt to embellish the account; psychological findings, 
including symptoms of PTSD and depression related or unrelated to the history of detention 
and torture, with clinical reasons; mode of narration of the history including demeanour and 
affect, level of detail and consistency of the account or lack of these, with clinical reasons 
and the possibility of fabrication or embellishment of the account of torture, or of alternative 
explanation for the clinical evidence. Clinicians in all 50 cases found there to be sufficient 
physical and/or psychological evidence to support the account given and an overall 
congruence between the clinical findings and the history of detention and torture in Iran in 
the given period.
