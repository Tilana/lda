NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of the
Company's  management,  include  all  adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring  accruals)
necessary  for  the  fair  presentation  of  its  financial  position  at  June  30,  2016,  its  results  of
operations  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  six
months  ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015.  Certain  information  and  note  disclosures  normally
included  in  annual  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (‟GAAP”)  have  been  condensed  or  omitted  pursuant  to  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  rules  and  regulations.    The  impact  on  the  accompanying  financial
statements of events occurring after June 30, 2016, was evaluated through the date of issuance
of these financial statements.
Although  the  Company  believes  the  disclosures  made  are  adequate  to  make  the  information
presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, included
in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K. The interim statement of operations is not
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation
The  Company  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  crude  oil  marketing,  tank  truck  transportation  of
liquid  chemicals  and  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production.    Its  primary  area  of  operation  is
within  a  1,000  mile  radius  of  Houston,  Texas.    The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the ‟Company”) after elimination of all
intercompany accounts and transactions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include any Treasury bill, commercial paper, money market fund or
federal  funds  with  maturity  of  90  days  or  less.    Depending  on  cash  availability  and  market
conditions, investments in corporate and municipal bonds, which are classified as investments in
marketable  securities,  may  also  be  made  from  time  to  time.    Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are
maintained  with  major  financial  institutions  and  such  deposits  may  exceed  the  amount  of
federally  backed  insurance  provided.    While  the  Company  regularly  monitors  the  financial
stability of such institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the
financial viability of such institutions.
Inventory
Inventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of the
Company’s crude oil marketing operations.  Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of average
cost or market.

Prepayments
The components of prepayments are as follows (in thousands):
Cash collateral deposits for commodity purchases
Insurance premiums
Rents, license and other
Property and Equipment

Expenditures  for  major  renewals  and  betterments  are  capitalized,  and  expenditures  for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Interest costs incurred in connection with
major  capital  expenditures  are  capitalized  and  amortized  over  the  lives  of  the  related  assets.
When properties are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation, depletion and
amortization is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the
successful  efforts  method  of  accounting.    Direct  costs  of  acquiring  developed  or  undeveloped
leasehold acreage, including lease bonus, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. Exploratory
drilling  costs  are  initially  capitalized  until  the  properties  are  evaluated  and  determined  to  be
either  productive  or  nonproductive.    Such  evaluations  are  made  on  a  quarterly  basis.    If  an
exploratory well is determined to be nonproductive, the costs of drilling the well are charged to
expense.  Costs  incurred  to  drill  and  complete  development  wells,  including  dry  holes,  are
capitalized.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no unevaluated or suspended exploratory
drilling costs.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated
using  the  unit-of-production  method.    The  reserve  base  or  denominator  used  to  calculate
depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire
proved  properties  is  the  sum  of  proved  developed  reserves  and  proved  undeveloped
reserves.  For lease and well equipment, development costs and successful exploration drilling
costs,  the  reserve  base  includes  only  proved  developed  reserves.    The  numerator  for  such
calculations  is  actual  production  volumes  for  the  period.    All  other  property  and  equipment  is
depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  average  useful  lives  of  three  to
twenty years.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the
carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  Any impairment recognized is permanent
and may not be restored.  Producing oil and gas properties are reviewed on a field-by-field basis.
Fields with carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are
deemed impaired.  For properties requiring impairment, the fair value is estimated based on an
internal  discounted  cash  flow  model.    Cash  flows  are  developed  based  on  estimated  future
production and prices are then discounted using a market based rate of return consistent with
that used by the Company in evaluating cash flows for other assets of a similar nature.  During
the  third  quarter  of  2016,  the  commodity  price  for  crude  oil  has  been  in  decline  which,  if  it
continues, may require the recording of future impairments in the carrying value of oil and gas
properties.
6
On  a  quarterly  basis,  management  evaluates  the  carrying  value  of  non-producing  oil  and  gas
leasehold properties and may deem them impaired based on remaining lease term, area drilling
activity and the Company’s plans for the property.  This fair value measure depends highly on
management’s  assessment  of  the  likelihood  of  continued  exploration  efforts  in  a  given
area.  Therefore, such data inputs are categorized as ‟unobservable” or ‟Level 3” inputs.  (See
‟Fair Value Measurements” below).  Importantly, this fair value measure only applies to the write-
down of capitalized costs and will never result in an increase to reported earnings.

Since the Company is generally not the operator of its oil and gas property interests, it does not
maintain  the  underlying  detail  acreage  data  and  the  Company  is  dependent  on  the  operator
when determining which specific acreage will ultimately be drilled.  However, the capitalized cost
detail  on  a  property-by-property  basis  is  reviewed  by  management,  and  deemed  impaired  if
development is not anticipated prior to lease expiration.  Onshore leasehold periods are normally
three years and may contain renewal options.
Investments
Investments reflect the Company’s interest in operating entities where the Company holds a non-
controlling interest.  Investments where the Company’s interest is between twenty percent and
fifty  percent  of  the  ownership  are  accounted  for  under  the  “Equity  Method”.    Under  the  equity
method, the initial investment is capitalized and adjusted periodically for the Company’s pro-rata
share  of  earnings  and  losses.    Any  dividends  received  will  reduce  the  equity  investment
balance.  Investments where the Company’s interest is less than twenty percent are accounted
for  on  the  “Cost  Method”.    Under  the  cost  method,  the  initial  investment  is  capitalized,  but  no
adjustments are made to capitalized costs for the underlying earnings of the investments.  For
cost method investments, dividends are recorded as income upon receipt.
7
On  January  14,  2016  the  Company’s  wholly  owned  subsidiary  Adams  Resources  Medical
Management, Inc. (“ARMM”) acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (“Bencap”) for a
$2,200,000 cash payment.  Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims
auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.  The Company
accounts  for  this  investment  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting.    Bencap  may  require
additional funding as it completes development of its operations.  To fund such needs, on or after
September 1, 2016 but before August 31, 2018, Bencap may request to borrow from ARMM an
amount no greater than $1,500,000 and on or after September 1, 2017, but not before August 31,
2019, Bencap may request to borrow an amount no greater than $2,000,000.  ARMM is under no
obligation to make such loans.  However, in the event ARMM elects not to make such loans,
ARMM’s interest in Bencap is forfeited.  Bencap is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to
make cash distributions during any period when such loans remain outstanding.
Bencap’s predecessor entities began operating in their current form in January 2014.  Presently,
Bencap’s  primary  focus  is  developing  a  general  market  for  its  medical  claims  auditing
services.  Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap’s methodology
audits  and  pays  claims  based  on  a  multiplier  which  takes  into  consideration  a  premium  over
Medicare rates and/or a premium over the “Cost-to-Charge Ratio” which facility providers must
file  with  the  Federal  government.    The  Company  has  utilized  this  methodology  over  the  past
three  years  to  process  and  pay  medical  claims  for  its  employees,  including  all  management
personnel.  The Company believes the Bencap approach provides self-insured employers the
opportunity for substantial savings over conventional medical insurance without sacrificing the
level  of  employee  benefits.    In  fact,  employee  options  are  improved  since  the  individual
employee is no longer locked into a narrow list of providers.
In April 2016 the Company, through its ARMM subsidiary, acquired an approximate 15% equity
interest (less than 3% voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation (“VestaCare”)
for a $2,500,000 cash payment.  VestaCare provides an array of software as a service (“SaaS”)
electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare’s
most recent product offering, VestaPay™.  VestaPay™ allows medical care providers to structure
fully  automated  and  dynamically  updating  electronic  payment  plans  for  their  patients.    As
deductibles and copays have risen in recent years, medical care providers are experiencing a
significant shift in revenues from the insurance company to the individual patient.  The increasing
level  of  patient  obligations  has  led  to  significantly  increased  bad  debt  write-offs  for
providers.    The  VestaCare  product  earns  a  contingent  collection  fee  and  handling  fees  as
account collections improve.
The  Company’s  investments  are  considered  long-lived  assets  and  will  be  reviewed  for
impairment  whenever  there  is  evidence  that  the  carrying  value  of  such  assets  may  not  be
recoverable.    These  fair  value  measures  depend  highly  on  management’s  assessment  of  the
financial status of the underlying operation.  Such data inputs are “unobservable” or “Level 3”
inputs.  The Company’s Bencap and VestaCare investments are in the early stage of product
implementation.    The  Company  monitors  revenue  and  product  acceptance  trends  in  order  to
assess  the  current  fair  value  of  the  investment.    If  the  fair  value  of  these  investments  is
determined  to  be  below  their  carrying  value  and  that  loss  in  fair  value  is  deemed  other  than
temporary, an investment loss will be recognized.  No such losses were recorded during the six
months ended June 30, 2016.
Cash Deposits and Other Assets
The Company has established certain deposits to support participation in its liability insurance
program  and  remittance  of  state  crude  oil  severance  taxes  and  other  state  collateral
deposits.  Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of the Company’s insurance
carrier  and  such  investments  primarily  consist  of  intermediate  term  federal  government  bonds
and bonds backed by federal agencies.  This fair value measure relies on inputs from quoted
prices  for  similar  assets  and  is  thus  categorized  as  a  ‟Level  2”  valuation  in  the  fair  value
hierarchy.  Components of cash deposits and other assets are as follows (in thousands):

Certain commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by the Company’s marketing business
qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as
trading activity.  From the time of contract origination, such trading activity contracts are marked-
to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying financial statements.
Most crude oil purchase contracts and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading
activities  and  the  Company  considers  such  contracts  as  normal  purchases  and  sales
activity.  For normal purchases and sales, the Company’s customers are invoiced monthly based
upon  contractually  agreed  upon  terms  with  revenue  recognized  in  the  month  in  which  the
physical product is delivered to the customer.  Such sales are recorded gross in the financial
statements  because  the  Company  takes  title,  has  risk  of  loss  for  the  products,  is  the  primary
obligor for the purchase, establishes the sale price independently with a third party and maintains
credit risk associated with the sale of the product.
Certain crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of
crude  oil  to  be  bought  and  sold  at  different  locations.    These  contracts  are  entered  into  for  a
variety  of  reasons,  including  effecting  the  transportation  of  the  commodity,  to  minimize  credit
exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer.  Such buy/sell arrangements
are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial  statements.    Reporting  such  crude  oil  contracts  on  a  gross  revenue  basis  would
increase the Company’s reported revenues as follows (in thousands):

Transportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized, as the

recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The  Company’s  largest  customers  consist  of  large  multinational  integrated  oil  companies  and
independent refiners of crude oil.  In addition, the Company transacts business with independent
oil producers, major chemical concerns, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial
energy users.  Within this group of customers the Company generally derives approximately 50
percent of its revenues from three to five large crude oil refining concerns.  While the Company
has  ongoing  established  relationships  with  certain  domestic  refiners  of  crude  oil,  alternative
markets  are  readily  available  since  the  Company  supplies  less  than  one  percent  of  U.S.
domestic refiner demand.  As a fungible commodity delivered to major Gulf Coast supply points,
the Company’s crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets.  Management
believes that a loss of any customers where the Company currently derives more than 10 percent
of its revenues would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.
Accounts receivable associated with crude oil activities comprise approximately 90 percent of the
Company’s  total  receivables  and  industry  practice  requires  payment  for  such  sales  to  occur
within  20  days  of  the  end  of  the  month  following  a  transaction.    The  Company’s  customer
makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty
typically associated with receivables management.
Letter of Credit Facility
The Company maintains a Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to provide up
to a $60 million stand-by letter of credit facility used to support crude oil purchases within the
marketing segment.  This facility is collateralized by the eligible accounts receivable within the
segment and outstanding amounts were as follows (in thousands):

The issued stand-by letters of credit are cancelled as the underlying purchase obligations are
satisfied by cash payment when due.  The letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on the
Company’s  Gulfmark  Energy,  Inc.  subsidiary.    Such  restrictions  include  the  maintenance  of  a
combined  1.1  to  1.0  current  ratio  and  the  maintenance  of  positive  net  earnings  excluding
inventory valuation changes, as defined, among other restrictions.  The Company is currently in

weighted average number of shares outstanding was 4,217,596 for 2016 and 2015.  There were
no potentially dilutive securities during those periods.
Share-Based Payments
During  the  periods  presented  herein,  the  Company  had  neither  stock-based  employee
compensation plans nor any other share-based payment arrangements.
Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  the  United  States  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ  from  those  estimates.  Examples  of  significant  estimates  used  in  the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements include oil and gas reserve volumes forming the foundation for
calculating  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortization  and  for  estimating  cash  flows  when
assessing  impairment  triggers  and  when  estimating  values  associated  with  oil  and  gas
properties.    Other  examples  include  revenue  accruals,  the  provision  for  bad  debts,  insurance
related accruals, income tax permanent and timing differences, contingencies and valuation of
fair value contracts.
Income Taxes
Income  taxes  are  accounted  for  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.    Under  this  approach,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and their respective tax basis.
Use of Derivative Instruments
The  Company’s  marketing  segment  is  involved  in  the  purchase  and  sale  of  crude  oil.    The
Company seeks to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the
material to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace.  As typical for the industry, such
transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale
contracts.  Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore,
the  Company  accounts  for  such  contracts  at  fair  value,  unless  the  normal  purchase  and  sale
exception  is  applicable.    Such  underlying  contracts  are  standard  for  the  industry  and  are  the
governing document for the Company’s crude oil wholesale distribution businesses.  None of the
Company’s  derivative  instruments  have  been  designated  as  hedging  instruments.    The
accounting methodology utilized by the Company for its commodity contracts is further discussed
below under the caption ‟Fair Value Measurements”.

fuel during July 2016 through March 2017 plus 184,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of July
2016 and 92,000 barrels of crude oil for the month of August 2016.

As of December 31, 2015, one commodity purchase and sale contract comprised the Company’s
derivative valuations.  The purchase and sale contract encompasses approximately 65 barrels
per day of diesel fuel in each of January, February and March 2016.
The Company only enters into commodity contracts with creditworthy counterparties or obtains
collateral support for such activities.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
was not holding nor has it posted any collateral to support its forward month fair value derivative
activity. The Company is not subject to any credit-risk related trigger events.  The Company has
no other financial investment arrangements that would serve to offset its derivative contracts.

The carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or
short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  Marketable securities are recorded at fair value
based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets.
Fair  value  contracts  consist  of  derivative  financial  instruments  and  are  recorded  as  either  an
asset or liability measured at its fair value.  Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in
earnings  unless  the  derivatives  qualify  for,  and  the  Company  elects,  cash  flow  hedge
accounting.  The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any current
reporting periods.
Fair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing
an asset or liability and the Company uses a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the
information used to develop those assumptions.  Currently, for all items presented herein, the
Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its contracts.  On a contract by contract, forward
month  by  forward  month  basis,  the  Company  obtains  observable  market  data  for  valuing  its
contracts.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
and the lowest priority to unobservable data.  The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that may be accessed
at the measurement date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability
occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  For
Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, the Company utilizes market quotations provided by
its  primary  financial  institution  and  for  the  valuation  of  derivative  financial  instruments  the
Company utilizes the New York Mercantile Exchange (‟NYMEX”) for such valuations.
Level 2 – (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for
identical  assets  or  liabilities  but  in  markets  that  are  not  actively  traded  or  in  which  little
information  is  released  to  the  public,  (c)  observable  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  and  (d)
inputs derived from observable market data.  Source data for Level 2 inputs include information
provided  by  the  NYMEX,  published  price  data  and  indices,  third  party  price  survey  data  and
broker provided forward price statistics.
Level 3 – unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities.

When determining fair value measurements, the Company makes credit valuation adjustments to
reflect  both  its  own  nonperformance  risk  and  its  counterparty’s  nonperformance  risk.    When
adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the impact of
netting  and  any  applicable  credit  enhancements,  such  as  collateral  postings,  thresholds,  and
guarantees are considered.  Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit
scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company or its counterparties.  As of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall
valuation of the Company’s fair value contracts.  As a result, applicable fair value assets and
liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.  The
amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The
amendments  may  be  applied  retrospectively  to  each  prior  period  presented  or  retrospectively
with  the  cumulative  effect  recognized  as  of  the  date  of  initial  application.    Management  is
currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and the transition alternatives.
In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual
assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the
financial statements are issued.  The standard also provides guidance on determining when and
how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  The new guidance is
effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter,
with  early  adoption  permitted.    Management  does  not  expect  the  adoption  of  this  guidance  to
have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
14
In  March  2016,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standard  Update  No.  2016-02,  Leases  (Topic
842).    The  standard  amends  existing  accounting  standards  to  require  the  capitalization  and
recording  on  the  balance  sheet  the  assets  and  liabilities  associated  with  lease  terms  of  more
than 12 months.  The new standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,
2018.    As  of  December  31,  2015,  the  Company  had  rental  obligations  under  long-term  non-
cancellable  operating  leases  and  terminaling  arrangements  totaling  $12,393,000  payable
through 2019, with only nominal activity during 2016.  Management is currently evaluating the
impact of these amendments on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as well as the
transition alternatives.
With  the  exception  of  the  new  standards  for  revenue  recognition  and  leases,  as  discussed,
management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet
effective,  will  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.

Note 4 - Transactions with Affiliates
The late Mr. K. S. Adams, Jr., former Chairman of the Board of the Company, and certain of his
family  partnerships  and  affiliates  have  participated  as  working  interest  owners  with  the
Company’s subsidiary, Adams Resources Exploration Corporation (‟AREC”)  Mr. Adams and the
affiliates  participated  on  terms  similar  to  those  afforded  other  non-affiliated  working  interest
owners.  While the affiliates have generally maintained their existing property interest, they have
not  participated  in  any  such  transactions  originating  after  the  death  of  Mr.  Adams  in  October
2013.    In  connection  with  the  operation  of  certain  oil  and  gas  properties,  the  Company  also
charges such related parties for administrative overhead primarily as prescribed by the Council of
Petroleum Accountants Society Bulletin 5. The Company also enters into certain transactions in
the normal course of business with other affiliated entities including direct cost reimbursement for
shared phone and administrative services.  In addition, the Company leases office space from an
affiliated entity based on a lease rental rate determined by an independent appraisal.
The Company utilizes its affiliate, Bencap, to administer certain of its employee medical benefit
programs including a detail audit of individual medical claims.  See Note (1) to the accompanying
financials under the caption “Investments” for further discussion.  Bencap earns a fee from the
Company for providing such services at a discounted amount from its standard charge to non-
affiliates.

AREC  is  named  as  a  defendant  in  a  number  of  Louisiana  based  suits  involving  alleged
environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.  Such suits typically allege improper
disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging subsidence contributing to the
formation of a sink hole.  AREC is currently included in three such suits.  The suits are styled
LePetit  Chateau  Deluxe  v.  Adams  Resources  Exploration  Corporation  dated  March  2004,
Gustave J. LaBarre, Jr., et. al. v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation et. al. dated October
2012  and  Henning  Management,  LLC  v.  Adams  Resources  Exploration  Corporation  dated
November  2013.    Each  suit  involves  multiple  industry  defendants  with  substantially  larger
proportional interests in the properties except, all the larger defendants have settled their claims
in  the  LePetit  Chateau  Deluxe  matter.    The  plaintiffs  in  each  of  these  matters  are  seeking
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  While management does not believe that a
material  adverse  effect  will  result  from  the  claims,  significant  attorney  fees  will  be  incurred  to
defend these matters.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has accrued
$500,000 of future legal/or settlement costs for these matters.

From time to time as incidental to its operations, the Company may become involved in various
lawsuits and/or disputes.  Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is
a  party  to  motor  vehicle  accidents,  worker  compensation  claims  and  other  items  of  general
liability as would be typical for the industry. Management of the Company is presently unaware of
any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that
may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Crude  oil  revenues  declined  in  2016  as  a  result  of  reduced  purchase  and  sale  volumes  and
reduced  market  prices  for  crude  oil.  The  volume  decline  stemmed  primarily  from  reduced
production  and  reduced  purchase  activity 
trend  of  South
Texas.    Operating  earnings  were  adversely  affected  by  the  volume  declines  as  well  as  a
narrowing of margins in 2016.  Driver commissions are reduced both in terms of the number of
drivers employed as well as pay scale due to the decline in activity.  Fuel and insurance costs
are lower, consistent with reduced volumes.

Crude Oil – Field Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP-Measure)(1)
Two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory
valuations  and  forward  commodity  contract  (derivatives  or  mark-to-market)  valuations.    As  a
purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party
pipelines.  Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held
in  stock  at  the  end  of  a  given  period  is  reasonably  consistent.    As  a  result,  during  periods  of
increasing  crude  oil  prices,  the  Company  recognizes  inventory  liquidation  gains  while  during
periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory valuation losses.  Over time, these
gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow.  While crude oil prices
fluctuated during the first six months of 2016 and 2015, the net impact on earnings was to yield
inventory liquidation gains as shown in the table below.
 
 
Crude  oil  marketing  operating  earnings  are  also  affected  by  the  valuations  of  the  Company’s
forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates.  Such
non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying
data existing as of such date.  The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as
part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level).  Only those
contracts  qualifying  as  derivative  instruments  are  accorded  fair  value  treatment  while  the
companion  contracts  to  purchase  crude  oil  at  the  wellhead  (field  level)  are  not  accorded  fair
value  treatment.    The  period-end  valuation  of  derivative  instruments  requires  recognition  of
‟mark-to-market” gains and losses.
The  impact  on  crude  oil  segment  operating  earnings  of  inventory  liquidations  and  derivative
valuations  is  summarized  as  follows  in  reconciling  from  the  GAAP  to  non-GAAP  financial
measures (in thousands):

Field  level  operating  earnings  and  field  level  purchase  volumes  (see  earlier  table)  depict  the
Company’s day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material,
and delivery to market at the sales point.  Comparative field level operating earnings decreased
during  2016  relative  to  the  comparative  2015  periods  due  to  reduced  purchase  volumes  and
reduced unit margins.  Competition has intensified for a declining level of crude oil production
within the Company’s areas of operation.
19
Historically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility
expected  to  continue.    See  Part  I,  Item  1A,  Risk  Factors  in  the  Company’s  Annual  Report  on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Revenues net of fuel are reduced in 2016 because of reduced demand which is indicative from
the change in miles driven shown above.  In addition, shippers have demanded reduced rates
since the present level of demand created industry wide excess capacity.  The Company has
responded by selling older and excess equipment, reducing the level of personnel and working
to control maintenance costs.  Operating earnings declined at a rate faster than the decline in
revenues due to the fixed cost component contained therein.  It is believed that a change in the
current market demand scenario will not occur absent continued improvement in the overall U. S.
economy.

Oil and gas revenues and operating earnings declined in 2016 following reduced commodity
prices and volume reductions as shown in the table below.  Volumes declined consistent with
reduced drilling activity and normal production declines.  Depreciation and depletion expense is
also reduced in 2016 consistent with reduced volumes and reduced net capitalized costs.

-  Investments
In January 2016, the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Bencap LLC (Bencap) for a
$2,200,000 cash payment.  Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims
auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.  The Company
accounts  for  this  investment  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting.    Bencap  used  the
Company’s funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete
in  the  medical  benefits  marketplace.    Under  equity  method  accounting  the  Company  has
included  in  operating  earnings  its  pro-rata  share  of  Bencap’s  net  expenses  in  excess  of
revenues.
21
In  April  2016  the  Company  acquired  a  15%  equity  interest  in  VestaCare,  Inc.,  a  provider  of
electronic payment technologies to medical care providers. VestaCare is accounted for under the
“cost method” and as such, earnings will be reported as dividends are paid.
Outlook
The trend continues to indicate reduced crude oil commodity prices and slackened demand for
trucking services.  As a result, the present emphasis involves aggressive sales efforts and cost
control  pending  a  rebound  in  the  market  conditions  for  the  Company’s  products  and
services.   By preserving liquidity and operating as a low-cost provider, the Company will be well
positioned when general economic conditions improve.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore
dependent on the success of future operations.  The most significant source of liquidity is the
cash  yield  from  net  earnings  factoring  in  the  non-cash  book  expense  items  for  depreciation,
depletion, amortization and impairments.  The Company has no debt and funds all of its projects
from  this  stream  of  cash.    In  most  periods,  cash  inflows  equal  or  exceed  capital  spending
outflows.    Should  cash  inflow  subside  or  turn  negative,  the  Company  will  curtail  its  capital
spending accordingly.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of
debenture obligations.  Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day
cash  needs  and  such  amounts  and  working  capital,  the  excess  of  current  assets  over  current
liabilities, were as follows (in thousands):

The  Company  relies  heavily  on  its  ability  to  obtain  open-line  trade  credit  from  its  suppliers
especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation.  Because of this, the Company strives
to maintain substantial cash balances and avoid debt obligations.
22
At various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in
advance  of  the  normal  due  date  to  certain  suppliers  of  crude  oil  within  the  marketing
operations.  Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as
the suppliers deliver product to the Company.  In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the
Company may also ‟early pay” its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the
twentieth of the month following the month of production.  Such ‟early payments” reduce cash
and  accounts  payable  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.    The  Company  also  requires  certain
customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to
support their purchases from the Company.  Early payments and cash collateral received from
customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date.
The Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for
the issuance of up to $60 million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude
oil.  Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled as the underlying purchase
obligations are satisfied by cash payment when due.  The issuance of stand-by letters of credit
enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply.

Management believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future
operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements
(should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
The Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing,
transportation and exploration businesses, and more recently in the area of employer oriented
medical management services.  The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to
fund  its  cash  flow  needs.    Except  for  commitments  totaling  approximately  $12.4  million
associated  with  barge  affreightment  contracts,  storage  tank  terminal  arrangements  and  office
lease  space,  the  Company’s  future  commitments  and  planned  investments  can  be  readily
curtailed if operating cash flows contract.

A quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share or $928,000 was paid during each of the first
and second quarters of 2016 and 2015.  The most significant item affecting future increases or
decreases  in  liquidity  is  earnings  from  operations  and  such  earnings  are  dependent  on  the
success of future operations.  See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company’s Annual Report

and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company’s disclosure
controls  and  procedures  were  effective  at  a  reasonable  assurance  level  as  of  the  end  of  the
period covered by this report.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
AREC  is  named  as a  defendant  in  a  number  of  Louisiana  based  suits  involving  alleged
environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.  Such suits typically allege improper
disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging subsidence contributing to the
formation of a sink hole.  AREC is currently included in three such suits.  The suits are styled
LePetit  Chateau  Deluxe  v.  Adams  Resources  Exploration  Corporation  dated  March  2004,
Gustave J. LaBarre, Jr., et. al. v. Adams Resources Exploration Corporation et. al. dated October
2012  and  Henning  Management,  LLC  v.  Adams  Resources  Exploration  Corporation  dated
November  2013.    Each  suit  involves  multiple  industry  defendants  with  substantially  larger
proportional interests in the properties, except all the larger defendants have settled their claims
in  the  LePetit  Chateau  Deluxe  matter.    The  plaintiffs  in  each  of  these  matters  are  seeking
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  While management does not believe that a
material  adverse  effect  will  result  from  the  claims,  significant  attorney  fees  will  be  incurred  to
defend these matters.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal/or
settlement costs for these matters.
From  time  to  time  as  incident  to  its  operations,  the  Company  becomes  involved  in  various
lawsuits and/or disputes.  Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company
may be a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims or other items of general
liability as would be typical for the industry.  Management of the Company is presently unaware
of any claims against the Company that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or
that  may  exceed  the  level  of  insurance  coverage  and  could  potentially  represent  a  material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
