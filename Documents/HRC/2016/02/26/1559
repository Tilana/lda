<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Human rights and the environment 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
<i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 16/11 of 24 March 2011 and 19/10 
of 22 March 2012, and recalling that, in the latter, the Council decided to establish the 
mandate of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the 
enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> other relevant Human Rights Council resolutions on human rights and 
climate change, on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound 
management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, and on the right to food as well as relevant Commission on 
Human Rights resolutions on human rights and the environment as part of sustainable 
development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21, the 
Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, and its outcome document &#8220;The 
Future We Want&#8221;, and aiming to contribute to follow-up processes, including the 
identification and realization of the sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
development and environment needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
the human person is the central subject of development and should be the active participant 
and beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as endorsed by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can 
contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i>, conversely, that climate change, unsustainable management and 
use of natural resources and the unsound management of chemicals and wastes represent 
threats to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that 
environmental damage has negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective 
enjoyment of human rights, in particular of the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to an adequate standard 
of living and its components, such as the right to food, and the rights to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, and to adequate housing, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that, while the human rights implications of environmental 
damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt 
most acutely by those segments of the population who are already in vulnerable situations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including 
the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the reports of the Independent Expert on the issue of 
human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment submitted to the the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second1 and the 
twenty-fifth2 sessions ; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Welcomes</i> the work undertaken to date by the Independent Expert in studying 
and clarifying aspects of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, 
healthy and sustainable environment; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also welcomes </i>the work of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and of the United Nations Environment Programme on 
the issue of human rights and the environment; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
  A/HRC/25/53 and Add.1 and 2. </p>


<p>4. <i>Recognizes</i> that human rights law sets out certain procedural and substantive 
obligations on States in relation to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment, which include: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To respect and protect the right to seek, receive and impart information and 
to provide information on and for assessments concerning environmental impacts on human 
rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To respect and protect the rights of freedom of expression, association and 
peaceful assembly, including by facilitating and providing for meaningful opportunities to 
participate in decision-making processes; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure access to effective remedies where human rights and fundamental 
freedoms are violated; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To adopt and implement laws and other measures to ensure that human rights 
are respected and protected in the context of environmental policies; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To protect against non-State human rights abuses, including by enforcing 
environmental laws that directly or indirectly contribute to the protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of non-discrimination in the application of 
environmental laws, but also of paying due attention to the members of groups particularly 
vulnerable to environmental harm, bearing in mind that environmental damage is felt most 
acutely by those segments of the population already in vulnerable situations; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recognizes</i> the role of human rights obligations and commitments in 
informing and strengthening international, regional and national policymaking in the area 
of environmental protection, and the importance of identifying best practices in that regard; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States to comply with their human rights obligations when developing 
and implementing their environmental policies; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role played by human rights defenders working on 
environmental issues in trying to promote sustainable development and finding a balance 
between economic and social development and environmental protection, and urges States 
to create a safe and enabling environment in which these human rights defenders can 
operate free from hindrance and insecurity, in the whole country and in all sectors of 
society, including by extending support to local human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Also</i> <i>recognizes</i> the importance of giving due consideration to human rights 
obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment 
while shaping the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete 
goals, targets and indicators; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Stresses</i> the particular relevance of international cooperation in addressing 
the threats to the enjoyment of human rights that result from transboundary environmental 
harm; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to clarify further the human rights obligations of States 
related to transboundary environmental harm; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Welcomes</i> the cooperation extended to date to the Independent Expert by 
different actors, and calls upon all States to continue to cooperate with the Independent 
Expert in the discharge of his mandate and to respond favourably to requests for 
information and visits; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the Independent 
Expert receives the resources necessary to enable him to discharge his mandate fully; </p>


<p>14. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item and in accordance with its programme of work.
