<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Maldives was held at the 6th meeting, on 6 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Maldives was headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dunya Maumoon. 
</p>
<p>At its 10th meeting, held on 8 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on 
</p>
<p>Maldives. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Maldives: Argentina, France and India. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Maldives: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MDV/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MDV/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MDV/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, Germany, Mexico, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
</p>
<p>and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Maldives through 
</p>
<p>the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.</b> <b>Presentation by the State under review</b> 
</p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation noted that a sense of pride and responsibility defined the 
</p>
<p>Maldivian people, who were guided by that sentiment to craft their own story of progress, a 
</p>
<p>story of resilience that the Maldivians proudly referred to as &#8220;the Maldivian story&#8221;. A 
</p>
<p>significant part of the Maldivian story consisted of the country&#8217;s constructive partnerships 
</p>
<p>with international agencies and Governments that were serious in supporting positive 
</p>
<p>change in the country. 
</p>
<p>6. Maldives believed in the universality and equality of States under the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. In preparing for its review, Maldives followed a policy of inclusivity 
</p>
<p>through the standing committee on the review, which was led by the Ministry of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs, with the support of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>7. Democratization began in 1932, with the first written Constitution and the 
</p>
<p>introduction of universal adult suffrage. The Constitution was significantly revised with the 
</p>
<p>reform agenda of 2004. A new Constitution was adopted in 2008, bringing about a 
</p>
<p>significant paradigm shift in society. 
</p>
<p>8. Fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of the media, 
</p>
<p>freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
</p>
<p>freedom from forced labour, were guaranteed in the Constitution of 2008. They could not 
</p>
<p>be infringed, not even in a state of emergency. 
</p>
<p>9. Maldives had one of the most liberal interpretations of freedom of expression: it 
</p>
<p>placed no restrictions on freedom of the media, including online newspapers, ensuring the </p>


<p>safety of journalists. The Media Council and the Broadcasting Commission were tasked 
</p>
<p>with protecting freedom of expression. The challenge to the Government was to balance 
</p>
<p>that broad freedom with the guarantee of individual liberty. 
</p>
<p>10. In parallel to domestic reform, Maldives pursued an activist policy of promoting its 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations. Since 2005, it has joined seven of the nine core 
</p>
<p>human rights conventions and five optional protocols, ratified the Rome Statute, eight 
</p>
<p>fundamental International Labour Organization conventions, issued a standing invitation to 
</p>
<p>all United Nations special procedures mandate holders and hosted six visits of rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>11. Maldives had been a Muslim country for 800 years. Its social framework and 
</p>
<p>historic and traditional values, which had evolved over the decades, were intimately linked 
</p>
<p>to Islamic practices. Islamic values were part of the national identity and heritage, and 
</p>
<p>formed the basis of the Constitution and all Maldivian laws. Calls to introduce values and 
</p>
<p>practices that were contrary to the values of Islam, such as non-traditional forms of families 
</p>
<p>and those related to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, would not be entertained 
</p>
<p>by the people of Maldives. The basic belief in Islam as an integral part of the Maldivian 
</p>
<p>identity would not change, although the country continued to allow non-Maldivians to 
</p>
<p>practice their own faith in private. 
</p>
<p>12. The human rights policy of the President, Abdulla Yameen, was guided by the belief 
</p>
<p>that, although providing a basic framework, human rights were not just about international 
</p>
<p>instruments or pieces of law. Human rights was a matter of belief that needed to be 
</p>
<p>carefully cultivated and nurtured, and needed space and time to grow organically and 
</p>
<p>become valued and cherished traditions in the societies concerned. 
</p>
<p>13. The new school curriculum, which offered civic education in order to cultivate 
</p>
<p>values and belief in human rights, was an integral part of the successful story of the 
</p>
<p>education sector. Maldives offered free education up to the higher secondary level, free 
</p>
<p>textbooks and stationery, and free local and international exams. 
</p>
<p>14. Maldives had introduced universal health insurance for people of all socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>backgrounds. Its maternal and infant mortality rates were on par with those of developed 
</p>
<p>countries and well above the global average. Diseases that could be prevented through 
</p>
<p>vaccinations, such as neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, polio and diphtheria, were non-
</p>
<p>existent; malaria had been successfully controlled for decades; the prevalence of HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>continued to be low; and there was sustained investment in improving the quality of access 
</p>
<p>to and delivery of health services. 
</p>
<p>15. Successive governments had adopted social housing schemes as the best way to 
</p>
<p>provide affordable housing to all. Over the past few years, the Government had built over 
</p>
<p>2,600 housing units, meeting the housing needs of over 17,000 people. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government had prioritized skills development and job creation for the youth. 
</p>
<p>Over the past 17 months, more than 7,000 jobs had been created and several skills 
</p>
<p>development programmes have been launched. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government believed in addressing the growing problems of drug abuse and 
</p>
<p>gang violence by empowering the youth. The enactment of the Drugs Act and the Anti-
</p>
<p>Gang Violence Act provided the legal framework for dealing with those issues. A separate 
</p>
<p>court had been established under the Drugs Act, to hear drug related cases, and there was a 
</p>
<p>conscious shift in policy towards rehabilitation and the reintegration of addicts into society 
</p>
<p>through drug rehabilitation centres across the country. The Government had criminalized 
</p>
<p>gang violence and organized crime and moved rapidly to correct the infringement of human 
</p>
<p>rights through gang activities. 
</p>
<p>18. Maldives had always maintained a policy of moderation and openness, rejected all 
</p>
<p>forms of extremism and introversion, as well as radical interpretations of Islam, and </p>


<p>denounced and condemned terrorist activities in the name of Islam. The Government 
</p>
<p>announced that it had drafted an entirely new counter-terrorism and prevention bill that 
</p>
<p>would make it a serious criminal offence for Maldivians to take part in any kind of armed 
</p>
<p>activities overseas, except where the military or police officials operate under a formal 
</p>
<p>arrangement. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government was currently implementing a strategy aimed at increasing 
</p>
<p>awareness about the value of moderation, tolerance and the peaceful nature of Islam. It was 
</p>
<p>also targeting other practices associated with radicalism, including the limited instances of 
</p>
<p>underage marriage, forced marriage, non-vaccination of infants and lack of access to 
</p>
<p>schools for children, especially girls. 
</p>
<p>20. The Domestic Violence Prevention Act, the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and 
</p>
<p>Abuse Act and the Sexual Offences Act had strengthened the legal framework to protect 
</p>
<p>women, children and migrants from violence and sexual abuse. The gender equality bill, 
</p>
<p>which was currently in its final stages, once passed, would cement the national standards on 
</p>
<p>gender equality and confirm that the policies and the legal framework were consistent with 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The 
</p>
<p>Disability Act had boosted the protection and rights afforded to persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>giving them access to financial assistance, establishing regulations on minimum standards 
</p>
<p>and the identification of persons with disabilities and making room for affirmative action, 
</p>
<p>including in respect of access to gainful employment. 
</p>
<p>21. The Anti-Human Trafficking Act represented a milestone in combating trafficking, 
</p>
<p>especially by affording protection to the large number of migrant workers in the country 
</p>
<p>from exploitation. The National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons 2015&#8211;2019 
</p>
<p>had been finalized. The Government announced that on 27 April 2015 Parliament had 
</p>
<p>approved accession to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children,<b> </b>supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p>22. Maldivian women had had the constitutional right to vote since 1932. They also had 
</p>
<p>equal pay, paid maternity leave and the same access to education and employment 
</p>
<p>opportunities. The Government was concentrating on making women economically 
</p>
<p>empowered by introducing targeted microloans, single mother benefits, home-based 
</p>
<p>employment opportunities and day-care facilities. The Government aimed to empower 
</p>
<p>women to become more productive citizens, in whatever capacity they chose for 
</p>
<p>themselves, free from coercion or social pressure. 
</p>
<p>23. The progress that Maldives had made in the areas of governance and social and 
</p>
<p>economic development could be fully realized and sustained over time by creating the 
</p>
<p>necessary enabling institutions. Political tensions had arisen because the speed of 
</p>
<p>institutional development had been slow and the institutional shape and structure 
</p>
<p>envisioned in the Constitution was still not complete; the gap between socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>growth and the emergence of strong political institutions had not yet been entirely filled. 
</p>
<p>24. The President&#8217;s comprehensive strategy for democracy consolidation aimed at 
</p>
<p>transforming Maldivian society into a political community that was able to forge an 
</p>
<p>overwhelming consensus on the acceptability of the political system.  
</p>
<p>25. A significant component of the democracy consolidation strategy was the justice 
</p>
<p>sector strategic action plan, which recognized the judiciary&#8217;s continuous efforts to improve 
</p>
<p>access to and the effectiveness and functioning of the system. The new Penal Code would 
</p>
<p>play a pivotal role in achieving those targets. A legal profession bill was being drafted to 
</p>
<p>implement the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. Several key pieces of legislation, 
</p>
<p>such as the Anti-Torture Act, the Prison and Parole Act, the Anti-Money-Laundering and 
</p>
<p>Terrorism Financing Act and the Extradition, Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters </p>


<p>and Transfer of Prisoners Act, had been passed and were expected to enhance the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the delivery of services in the justice sector. Maldives was continuously 
</p>
<p>working with international human rights mechanisms with the aim of training and building 
</p>
<p>the capacity of judges so as to encourage the growth of the judiciary into an arm of the 
</p>
<p>State that was strong, robust and enjoyed strong public support. 
</p>
<p>26. The progress achieved, within only 10 years, was by any measure remarkable. 
</p>
<p>Among the many remaining challenges was the incredibly high economic cost of bringing 
</p>
<p>the systemic changes envisioned in the 2008 Constitution and the speed of the change, 
</p>
<p>which had not given adequate time for the country to develop a pool of human resources 
</p>
<p>capable of transforming the changes into social norms. Those challenges had been further 
</p>
<p>heightened by the fact that Maldivian democracy was &#8220;growing up&#8221; under the international 
</p>
<p>spotlight.  
</p>
<p>27. While the Government appreciated the well-meaning and well-intended 
</p>
<p>commentaries and the valuable advice, it called upon States to not only criticize but also to 
</p>
<p>invest in bringing about meaningful change. Meaningful democratic change could not be 
</p>
<p>imposed and could only be sustained if change was locally owned, locally driven and 
</p>
<p>locally shaped. It was also important to let democratic institutions have the space and the 
</p>
<p>independence to grow organically. 
</p>
<p> <b>B.</b> <b>Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the interactive dialogue, 102 delegations made statements.

<p>Ministry of Law and Gender and the law against domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>30. Mexico recognized the cooperation of Maldives with human rights mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>hoped for the strengthening of the independence of the Human Rights Commission and 
</p>
<p>actions addressing drug abuse.  
</p>

</p>
<p>trafficking, and asked about measures to combat corporal punishment.  
</p>
<p>32. Morocco appreciated improved access to education, housing and health care and 
</p>
<p>welcomed measures for the empowerment of women. 
</p>
<p>33. Namibia acknowledged challenges facing Maldives owing to the dispersal of the 
</p>
<p>population over a vast geographic area and admired the advancement to developing country 
</p>
<p>status. 
</p>
<p>34. Nepal noted remarkable progress in development, including in curbing infant and 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality, and the challenges of religious extremism and high drug abuse. 
</p>
<p>35. Netherlands appreciated positive amendments to key legislation but was concerned 
</p>
<p>that many recommendations from the first universal periodic review remained to be

</p>
<p>strengthened legislative framework on human rights.

</p>
<p>and affordable and safe housing. 
</p>

</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p>53. Senegal welcomed the ratification of the fundamental ILO conventions, visits of

</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>54. Seychelles commended the great steps taken towards a human rights-based approach 
</p>
<p>to protecting the environment and combating climate change. 
</p>
<p>55. Sierra Leone appreciated universal health care, free education and the Anti-Torture 
</p>
<p>Act, urged greater protection for migrant workers and human rights defenders and called 
</p>
<p>for climate change adaptation assistance. 
</p>
<p>56. Singapore welcomed the commitment to promote health services and to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence against women. 
</p>
<p>57. Slovenia welcomed criminalization of domestic violence and marital rape, hoped for 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a </p>


<p>communications procedure and was concerned at limitations on freedoms, improper 
</p>
<p>functioning of the judiciary and impunity. 
</p>
<p>58. Spain praised progress in the new Criminal Code but was concerned about the 
</p>
<p>application of the death penalty to minors. 
</p>
<p>59. Sri Lanka noted progress since the Constitution was enacted in 2008 and stressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of upholding the rule of law and observing due process at all times.  
</p>
<p>60. Maldives accepted 89 of some 126 recommendations from the first cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review and said that it was able to fully implement 58 of the accepted 
</p>
<p>recommendations and had partially implemented 32 recommendations.  
</p>
<p>61. Maldives stated that its susceptibility to climate change and adverse impacts was a 
</p>
<p>hindrance to the full enjoyment of human rights including the right to adequate housing and 
</p>
<p>to development gains achieved over decades. On climate change the Government took a 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach aiming at supporting livelihoods and communities struggling to 
</p>
<p>adapt to climate change. 
</p>
<p>62. Maldives clarified that under the Human Rights Commission Act 2006 and 
</p>
<p>subsequent amendments in 2014, Commission members and staff enjoyed immunity from 
</p>
<p>prosecution or complaint for acts carried out in good faith within the purview of their 
</p>
<p>functions. Pointing to issues relating to the <i>suo motu</i> application filed against the members 
</p>
<p>of the Commission in 2014, Maldives deemed it inappropriate to comment just yet since the 
</p>
<p>matter had yet to be decided. 
</p>
<p>63. Regarding challenges faced by local civil society organizations, the Government had 
</p>
<p>already identified many shortcomings in the 2003 Societies Act and proposed revising the 
</p>
<p>law, including by moving the political office of the Registrar of Societies to one of the 
</p>
<p>independent statutory standing offices appointed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>64. Maldives stated that migration was a key issue of concern and a continuous 
</p>
<p>challenge for the Government. The Constitution did not discriminate against migrants in 
</p>
<p>relation to their entitlement to just and safe conditions of work, fair wages and equal 
</p>
<p>remuneration, regardless of the person&#8217;s nationality, race or religion, nor did the 2008 
</p>
<p>Employment Act. However, a difference did exist where a migrant worker&#8217;s employment 
</p>
<p>was terminated, as the almost immediate revocation of the employment visa created a huge 
</p>
<p>barrier to recourse before the employment tribunal.  
</p>
<p>65. The State of Palestine welcomed the implementation of recommendations from the 
</p>
<p>first cycle, particularly on child rights, the right to education and the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. 
</p>
<p>66. Sudan commended the constructive engagement with international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, the standing invitation to special procedures and the hosting of visits. 
</p>
<p>67. Sweden noted reported steps to combat discrimination and violence against women 
</p>
<p>and warnings of deterioration in the independence of the justice system. 
</p>
<p>68. Switzerland expressed concern about shortcomings in the judicial system and about 
</p>
<p>the deteriorating situation with respect to freedom of expression and intimidation of the 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>69. Thailand encouraged continued engagement with the national Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission, civil society and the international community, and welcomed free education 
</p>
<p>and universal health care. 
</p>
<p>70. Timor-Leste welcomed the enactment of legislation against domestic violence and 
</p>
<p>the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination. </p>


<p>71. Trinidad and Tobago congratulated Maldives on its fiftieth anniversary of 
</p>
<p>independence, which offered an opportunity to reflect on the role of human rights in 
</p>
<p>consolidating democracy, and acknowledged the new ministry, climate change and 
</p>
<p>education policies. 
</p>
<p>72. Tunisia noted the progress achieved, highlighting the ratification of international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, including the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>73. Turkey welcomed improvements in education, housing and health care, as well as 
</p>
<p>steps taken to combat human trafficking, and encouraged strengthened efforts regarding 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>74. Turkmenistan welcomed the measures to strengthen the national institutional 
</p>
<p>infrastructure for promoting human rights. 
</p>
<p>75. Ukraine commended the adoption of anti-trafficking and domestic violence laws and 
</p>
<p>encouraged Maldives to continue its active stance in the Human Rights Council, including 
</p>
<p>in preventing human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>76. The United Arab Emirates commended progress in free education, respect of the 
</p>
<p>principle of equality before the law and equal judicial protection in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>obligations of Maldives. 
</p>
<p>77. The United Kingdom welcomed legislative progress, remained concerned about the 
</p>
<p>death penalty, corporal punishment, due process and the arrest of opposition leaders, and 
</p>
<p>urged restraint and dialogue by all parties and the Government. 
</p>
<p>78. The United States was concerned that recent developments called into question the 
</p>
<p>independence and impartiality of the judiciary, about the use of politically motivated 
</p>
<p>prosecutions against critics, that non-Muslims cannot become citizens and at the lack of 
</p>
<p>laws to implement labour rights.  
</p>
<p>79. Uruguay highlighted measures to implement recommendations accepted during the 
</p>
<p>first review, including ratification of the fundamental ILO conventions.  
</p>
<p>80. Uzbekistan welcomed the legislative and institutional improvements, accession to 
</p>
<p>treaties and cooperation with OHCHR, treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>81. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela appreciated the challenges related to 
</p>
<p>geography and climate change and commended free education and social housing. It 
</p>
<p>appealed for a resumption of political dialogue involving all stakeholders to bring about 
</p>
<p>peace, and efforts to achieve national reconciliation. 
</p>

</p>
<p>on the process and not on the merits of the case. The case had highlighted the profound 
</p>
<p>need to bring urgent reforms to the judiciary as identified in the 2004 reform agenda. While 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Code had been adopted, remaining legislation, such as the criminal procedure 
</p>
<p>code, was still with Parliament. In the spirit of showing maximum transparency, the 
</p>
<p>Government invited OHCHR, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the European Union to

</p>
<p>Police Service did not use excessive or deadly force. 
</p>
<p>139. In recognition of many concerns raised, the Government would make every effort to 
</p>
<p>further strengthen the judiciary. The Government was working closely with its partners, 
</p>
<p>such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, in examining some of the specific aspects of the 
</p>
<p>constitutional structure with a view to instituting a comprehensive review. Extensive work 
</p>
<p>was also being done with such partners as the United Nations Development Programme in 
</p>
<p>developing a curriculum for the judicial training institute to be established next year. To 
</p>
<p>complement those reforms, the Attorney-General&#8217;s office, through its strategic action plan 
</p>
<p>of 2014, has already identified the need for more legislation, such as a legal profession act, 
</p>
<p>to enable the establishment of an independent bar association.  
</p>
<p>140. Maldives thanked all delegations for their statements, comments and 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Full note had been taken of them and they would be given maximum 
</p>
<p>consideration.
