Thompson Creek Reports Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results
Denver, CO – Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. (TSX: TCM) (OTCQX: TCPTF) (the
"Company" or “Thompson Creek”), a North American mining company, announced today financial
results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). All dollar amounts are in United
States (“US”) dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Jacques Perron, President and Chief Executive Officer of Thompson Creek, said, “During the
second quarter of 2016, we continued to achieve solid performance with our company-wide safety
program. We reduced unit cash costs on a by-product basis by 23% compared to the second quarter
of 2015, generated net cash flows from our molybdenum business of approximately $3 million and
ended the quarter with working capital of approximately $130 million, including approximately $120
million of cash.”
“We had a challenging quarter at Mount Milligan Mine with decreased copper and gold payable
production quarter over quarter as a result of lower recoveries resulting mainly from lower ore
grades, together with operational inefficiencies in the mill from higher throughput. The performance
for the quarter was also impacted by lower mill availability due to a scheduled relining of the SAG
mill and the planned relocation of the reclaim barge. Additionally, the operation incurred some
unscheduled downtime associated with a tear to the main conveyor belt feeding the mill and
electrical issues with one ball mill.  Based on our forecast for the balance of the year, we expect
annual production to be in line with our 2016 guidance of 55 to 65 million pounds of copper and 240
to 270 thousand ounces of gold, with payable copper production near the high end of the range and
payable gold production at the low end of the range. For the remainder of 2016, our primary
operational focus is to continue to optimize the mine and mill with the expectation to gradually
increase recoveries,” said Mr. Perron. 
As previously announced, on July 5, 2016 Thompson Creek entered into an Arrangement
Agreement with Centerra Gold Inc. (“Centerra”), pursuant to which Centerra will acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Thompson Creek pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under
the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The closing of the Arrangement is subject to
satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, approval of the Arrangement by
Thompson Creek's shareholders, approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and receipt of
any regulatory or stock exchange approvals, including approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
and other customary closing conditions. We anticipate that the Arrangement will be consummated
in the second half of 2016.
Highlights for the Second Quarter of 2016
Total cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 were $119.7 million, compared to $176.8 million

Current Guidance
The following table presents our guidance for the full year 2016, which remains unchanged from the
guidance issued previously. We currently expect that our 2016 copper production will be on the
high end of our guidance range, and our 2016 gold production, by-product cash costs and capital
expenditures to be at the low end of our guidance. See footnotes below for changes in underlying
foreign exchange rate and gold price assumptions:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with
US GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the Company's
operating performance for the reasons described further below. These measures do not have
standard meanings prescribed by US GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures
presented by other companies. The presentation of these measures is not intended to be
considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared
and presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have
limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of operations as
determined in accordance with US GAAP.
Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Share—Basic and Diluted
Management of the Company uses adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per
share, basic and diluted, to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and for planning and
forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of these measures allows
investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company to similar
operating results of other mining companies, by excluding unusual or infrequent items that are
considered non-core to its business.
Adjusted net (loss) income represents the (loss) income prepared in accordance with US GAAP,
adjusted for significant non-cash items.
For the first three and six months of 2016 and 2015 and for the five quarters ended June 30, 2016,
the significant items were the net gains and losses related to the impact of foreign exchange due
primarily to intercompany notes and related tax effects. Additionally, for the fourth quarter of 2015, in
connection with a change in its legal structure the Company also had a significant non-cash release
of tax valuation allowances which were generated in prior years primarily as a result of asset
impairments.
6
In connection with management's strategy to manage cash balances, fund its operations and
provide future tax benefits, the Company may enter into intercompany loan arrangements. At times,
the loans are denominated in currencies other than the measurement currency of one of the parties.
US GAAP requires that notes that are intended to be repaid should not be considered a capital
contribution, and, therefore, the foreign exchange fluctuations related to these loans impact net
(loss) income each period. At each period end, management compares the exchange rate between
the Canadian and US dollars to the exchange rate at the end of the prior reporting period. The
difference between those rates is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income at each period end.
Settlement of these intercompany loans results in realized foreign exchange gains or losses
recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income
(Loss). The loans between the parent company and its subsidiaries are the primary driver of our
foreign exchange gains and losses, as discussed above, management does not consider gains or
losses on foreign exchange in its evaluation of our financial performance. Management believes
that presentation of our non-GAAP measures excluding these gains or losses provides useful
information to the Company's investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.
Adjusted net (loss) income per share (basic and diluted) is calculated using adjusted net (loss)
income, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average basic and weighted-average diluted
shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with US GAAP. If the
adjustments to net loss on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net income,
management calculates weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in accordance with US
GAAP and uses that to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share. If the adjustments to net
income on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net loss, management utilizes weighted-
average basic shares outstanding to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share in accordance
with US GAAP.
The following tables reconciles net (loss) income presented in accordance with US GAAP to the
non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per
share, basic and diluted, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the
previous four quarters. All figures within the tables are unaudited and are presented in US$ in
millions, except shares and per share amounts.

Copper-Gold Operations - Unit Cash Cost and Average Realized Price per Payable Pound or
Payable Ounce Sold
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis are considered key measures in evaluating
221.7 222.2 221.6 221.2 218.0
221.7 222.2 221.6 221.2 218.0
operating performance in the Company's Copper-Gold operations, as well as measures of
profitability and efficiency on a consolidated basis. Although, unit cash cost on a by-product and co-
product basis are not measures of financial performance, do not have standardized meaning
prescribed by US GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other
companies, management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental
information to investors.
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis represent the mining, milling, on-site general
and administration, truck and rail transportation, warehousing, refining and treatment, and ocean
freight and insurance costs; and exclude the effects of changes in inventory, other non-cash
employee benefits, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion, amortization and
accretion.
On a by-product basis, sales of by-product metals are deducted when computing cash costs in
accordance with the cash cost standard endorsed by the World Gold Council and, previously, the
Gold Institute.
On a co-product basis, cash costs are allocated between copper and gold based on production.
Copper production is stated in thousands of pounds. Gold production has been converted to
thousands of copper equivalent (Cu eq.) pounds using the gold production for the periods
presented, as well as the most recent quarterly average prices for copper and gold. The price used
for copper is the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published price for LME
settlement per tonne. The price used for gold is a weighted average of the most recent quarterly
average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published prices for daily average London price per ounce
adjusted for the fixed price established under the Gold Stream Arrangement ($435 per oz).

The following tables provide a reconciliation of cash costs, unit cash costs, and operating expenses
for Copper-Gold operations included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the determination of net (loss) income for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the five quarters ended June 30, 2016.
