<p>civil, democratic and pluralistic State, where all citizens are equal regardless of gender, 
religion and ethnicity, and demands in this regard that all Syrian parties work with the Joint 
Special Representative to implement rapidly the transition plan set forth in the final 
communiqu&#233; issued by the Action Group for Syria on 30 June 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights before the Human Rights Council and the Security Council and by the 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes against humanity are likely to 
have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and noting the repeated encouragement 
by the High Commissioner to the Security Council to refer the situation to the International 
Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the independent international commission of inquiry 
on the Syrian Arab Republic submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/24 
of 22 March 2013;1 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns</i> the lack of cooperation of the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic with the commission of inquiry, in particular the persistent denial of access to 
members of the commission to the Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Notes with concern</i> that the lack of access by the commission of inquiry to 
the Syrian Arab Republic continues to hamper the commission&#8217;s ability to fulfil its 
mandate, and stresses in this regard the need to collect evidence directly from all of the 
Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities cooperate fully with the commission of 
inquiry, including by granting it immediate, full and unfettered access throughout the 
Syrian Arab Republic and responding promptly to its communications and requests; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Acknowledges </i>the statement of the Syrian opposition coalition of 5 June 2013 
to cooperate with the commission of inquiry, including in opposition-controlled areas, and 
calls on the opposition to assist the commission of inquiry in the fulfilment of its mandate; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Condemns</i> all violence, especially against civilians, irrespective of where it 
comes from, including terrorist acts and acts of violence that may foment sectarian tensions, 
and demands that all parties put an immediate end to all forms of violence and comply 
strictly with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian 
law; 
</p>
<p>7.  <i>Urges</i> all parties to the conflict to refrain from any actions that may 
contribute to the escalation of violations of human rights or international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the continued widespread and systematic gross violations 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms and all violations of international humanitarian 
law by the Syrian authorities and the government-affiliated <i>Shabbiha</i> militias, as well as 
any human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by armed 
oppositions groups, while noting that the commission of inquiry stated in its report that 
abuses and violations committed by anti-Government armed groups did not reach the 
intensity and scale of the violations committed by government forces and its associated 
militia; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> all massacres taking place in the Syrian 
Arab Republic, and stresses the need to hold those responsible to account; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>10. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the intervention of all foreign combatants in the Syrian 
Arab Republic, including those fighting on behalf of the regime and most recently 
Hizbullah, and expresses deep concern that their involvement further exacerbates the 
deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation, which has a serious negative impact 
on the region; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Stresses</i> the imperative need to follow up on the report of the commission of 
inquiry and to conduct a prompt and transparent independent international investigation 
into all abuses and all violations of international law committed by all parties, with a view 
to hold to account those responsible for violations and abuses, including those that may 
amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes; 
</p>
<p>12.  <i>Calls upon</i> all parties to respect fully international law applicable to the rights 
and protection of women and girls, and to take special measures to protect women and girls 
from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and also 
calls for the involvement of women at decision-making levels in conflict resolution and 
peace processes; 
</p>
<p>13.  <i>Notes with grave concern</i> that violations of the rights of the child are being 
committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict to 
which the Syrian Arab Republic is a party, and urgently calls for refraining from recruiting 
and involving children in the conduct of hostilities; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Encourages</i> members of the international community to ensure that there is 
no impunity for such violations or abuses, and stresses that the Syrian authorities have 
failed to prosecute alleged perpetrators of serious violations or abuses that may amount to 
war crimes or crimes against humanity; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Syrian people, on the basis of broad, inclusive and credible 
consultations, should determine, within the framework provided by international law, the 
process and mechanisms to achieve justice, reconciliation, truth and accountability for gross 
violations, as well as reparations and effective remedies for victims, while underlining the 
relevance of referrals to the appropriate international criminal justice mechanism under 
appropriate circumstances; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities meet their responsibility to protect the 
Syrian population; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Deplores</i> the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and the 
failure to ensure the safe and timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas 
affected by the fighting; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the growing number of refugees and internally 
displaced persons fleeing the violence, and welcomes the efforts by neighbouring countries 
to host Syrian refugees, while acknowledging the socioeconomic consequences of the 
presence of large-scale refugee populations in these countries; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Notes</i> the request made by the General Assembly to the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of internally displaced persons to submit a written report on the very 
dire situation of internally displaced persons in the Syrian Arab Republic,<footnote name="2">General Assembly resolution 67/262, para. 21. </footnote> and invites the 
Special Rapporteur to present that report to the Council at its twenty-fourth session; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>20. <i>Urges</i> the international community to provide urgent financial support to the 
host countries to enable them to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of Syrian 
refugees, while emphasizing the principle of burden-sharing; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Urges</i> all relevant United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and other international organizations and 
donor States to provide urgent and more support to Syrian refugees and their host countries; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Urges</i> all donors to provide expeditiously financial support to the Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and international humanitarian organizations, as 
requested in the humanitarian appeal on the Syrian Arab Republic, so that they can 
implement more actively the humanitarian response plan inside the country; 
</p>
<p>23.  <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the international assistance offered since the 
Kuwait Donors Conference of 30 January 2013, notes the scale of the Syrian regional 
humanitarian appeal launched on 7 June 2013, and calls on all members of the international 
community to respond expeditiously to the appeal and to fulfil previous pledges; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities facilitate the access of humanitarian 
organizations to all people in need through the most efficient routes, including by providing 
authorization for cross-border humanitarian operations as an urgent priority, encourages all 
parties in the Syrian Arab Republic to facilitate the delivery of assistance in areas under 
their control, including across conflict lines, in order to implement fully the humanitarian 
response plan, and calls on all sides to respect the safety of humanitarian workers and 
United Nations personnel and to protect medical personnel, facilities and transport 
consistent with applicable international law, as well as to allow the provision of medical 
care on a non-discriminatory basis;
