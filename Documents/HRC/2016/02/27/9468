<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report summarizes the responses to two surveys conducted by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; A survey asking States to identify current practices of regulating, adjudicating, and 
otherwise influencing the role of corporations with respect to human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; A survey asking the Fortune Global 500 firms about their human rights policies and 
practices. 
</p>
<p> (a) State survey:  due to a very low response rate, no firm conclusions could be 
reached regarding State patterns of practice, nor could best practices be identified.  Nevertheless, 
the survey suggests the following findings for those States that did respond: 
</p>
<p>(i) Focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR):  rather than focusing on 
human rights specifically, most States focus on CSR, incorporating human 
rights considerations along with other social and environmental issues.  
States provide business with tools and guidance for addressing CSR as a 
whole, as evidenced by a variety of policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Methods of human rights promotion:  States draw on only a limited 
number of the potential methods available to address issues of business 
and human rights.  Those currently used include:  voluntary programmes; 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-National 
Contact Points (OECD NCPs) for dispute resolution and coordination; and 
some more novel market regulations such as government procurement 
policies, export credit agency requirements, stock exchange disclosure 
rules, and criminal laws, which are often limited by lack of extraterritorial 
jurisdiction.  Many States still do not allow criminal prosecution of legal 
persons or provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Trade and investment treaties:  States still rarely include specific human 
rights requirements in bilateral investment treaties and free trade 
agreements.  The European Union (EU) investment treaties provide an 
exception to this by including language regarding human rights; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs):  the use of human rights 
impact assessments as a screen on incoming and outgoing investment is 
very limited.  Even government export credit agencies very rarely make 
support conditional on these assessments; 
</p>
<p>(v) Intra-governmental coordination:  coordination between governmental 
ministries responsible for trade and human rights is lacking.  Few 
Governments give examples of formalized, consistent coordination 
between government departments responsible for human rights and trade 
and investment; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>(vi) Major challenges:  States cite the lack of international or agreed-upon 
standards as a major challenge in addressing corporations in the context of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p> (b) Fortune Global 500 survey:  firms were asked to identify:  (i) human rights policy 
uptake and incident experience; (ii) rights addressed by policies and practices; (iii) stakeholders 
covered by policies and practices; (iv) international instruments referenced; (v) stakeholder 
engagement; and (vi) accountability mechanisms such as reporting and compliance systems or 
human rights impact assessments.  The following summarizes the responses of the 102 firms 
who completed the survey: 
</p>
<p>(i) Human rights policy uptake and incident experience 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The majority of respondents report having human rights policies and 
practices; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; North American firms are slightly less likely than Europeans to have 
adopted such policies and practices, despite reporting slightly more 
exposure to allegations of a significant human rights incident; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; By sector, extractive companies report having experienced a human 
rights incident at a higher rate than other sectors. 
</p>
<p>(ii) Rights addressed by policies and practices 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The majority of companies recognize core labour rights in their 
policies, including non-discrimination, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining, and the prohibitions against forced and child 
labour; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; By region, United States firms are slightly more likely to recognize 
freedom of association and right to collective bargaining than 
European firms.  However, the reverse is true for the prohibitions 
against forced and child labour, with European firms recognizing the 
prohibitions slightly more than their United States counterparts; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; With regard to non-labour rights, European companies lead, with more 
than twice as many recognizing the right to life, liberty and security of 
person compared to United States companies.  In addition, European 
companies are more likely than United States companies to recognize 
the right to health. 
</p>
<p>(iii) Stakeholders covered by policies and practices 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Companies report that their policies and practices encompass the 
following groups, in descending order:  employees (99 per cent), 
suppliers and others in their value chain (92.5 per cent), communities</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>of operation (71 per cent), countries of operation (63 per cent), and 
others, including customers, shareholders, and investors 
(24.7 per cent); 
</p>
<p>&#8722; By region however, United States companies rank communities 
and countries of operation far lower than European companies.  
United States firms also rank communities lower than Japanese firms, 
while Japanese firms include countries of operation in their policies 
and practices far less frequently than companies from other regions. 
</p>
<p>(iv) International instruments referenced 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Notably, 25 per cent of respondents skipped the question asking 
whether or not they referred to international instruments for guidance.  
Of the 75 per cent that did respond, ILO declarations and conventions 
were referenced most, then the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.  All extractive companies cited the Declaration.  The 
United Nations Global Compact and OECD were also referenced, at 
57 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.  European companies referred 
to the latter two sources with much more frequency than North 
American firms. 
</p>
<p>(v) Stakeholder Engagement 
</p>
<p>&#8722; More than 80 per cent of respondents claimed to work with external 
stakeholders.  By region, European and Australian firms claimed to do 
so slightly more than United States firms, and Japanese firms 
significantly less than any other region. 
</p>
<p>(vi) Accountability Mechanisms 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The majority of respondents had internal reporting and compliance 
systems and almost 75 per cent engaged in external reporting.  
European companies are more likely to engage in external reporting 
than United States firms, while Japanese firms are far behind all 
regions on this score; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; One third of respondents said that they routinely conducted human 
rights impact assessments and under half reported that they did so 
occasionally.  United States firms are slightly more likely to conduct 
human rights impact assessments as a matter of routine than European 
firms.  The extractive, financial services, and retail and consumer 
products firms conduct impact assessments more than firms in other 
sectors. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Resolution 2005/69 of the Human Rights Commission establishes the mandate of the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Representative (SRSG) on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises.<b>1</b>  Subparagraph (b) asks him to 
elaborate on the role of States in effectively regulating and adjudicating the role of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights, including through 
international cooperation; and subparagraph (e) to compile a compendium of best practices of 
States and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>2. Doing so required the collection of new or additional information on the practices of 
governments and firms in relation to business and human rights.  Accordingly, the SRSG sent a 
questionnaire to all Member States inviting Governments to provide him with the background 
information required to respond fully to these provisions of the mandate.  Similarly, he 
conducted a survey of the Fortune Global 500 companies (FG500). 
</p>
<p>3. The present report summarizes the key laws, policies, and programmes described by 
responding States, as well as the key features of the human rights policies and management 
practices reported by companies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  STATE SURVEY 
</b></p>
<p><b>Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. The SRSG&#8217;s mandate to elaborate on the role of States addresses a fundamental aspect of 
the business and human rights nexus.  As the SRSG&#8217;s Interim report (A/HRC/4/035) highlights, 
States have a duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including corporations. 
</p>
<p>5. The questionnaire surveyed a range of policy options including:  the use of economic 
regulations and incentives to support human rights; the inclusion of human rights standards in 
treaties and international agreements; investigation of potential violations; capacity to adjudicate 
and punish extraterritorial violators; promotion of human rights tools and best practices; and 
coordination around the issue of corporations and human rights.  Finally, the report addresses 
what States believe their role should be regarding business and human rights, as well as the key 
obstacles to fulfilling those obligations. 
</p>
<p>6. It is possible that there are other means being used by States to address business and 
human rights about which the survey did not inquire.  Also, because of the very low response 
rate, the survey may not have uncovered policies and laws that non-responding States may 
utilize. 
</p>

</p>
<p>7. The responding States are:  Bahrain, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, 
Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Italy, 
Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p><b>Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>8. Of the 192 Member States of the United Nations, 29 answered the questionnaire, 
which represents a response rate of 15 per cent.  The corresponding response rate to the 
FG500 survey was 20 per cent.  The geographic distribution of the responding countries is 
as follows:  Western Europe and North America:  13 (45 per cent of total responses); 
Latin America:  6 (21 per cent); Asia:  4 (14 per cent); Eastern Europe:  4 (14 per cent); 
Africa:  2 (7 per cent). 
</p>
<p>9. The percentages in this study are based on the 29 responding States, independent of the 
number of States that answer each question.  Questions have been grouped according to whether 
they involve economic regulation, prosecution, or other governmental human rights promotion. 
</p>
<p>10. Care should be taken in interpreting the results.  Percentages given are rounded and thus 
approximate.  The low overall response rate, as well as the unequal geographic and regional 
distribution of the responding countries, makes the sample size very small and not necessarily 
representative of practices around the world.  Also, some countries only responded to a few 
questions, or answered in extremely vague terms to some questions.  For example, the response 
rate per question shows large differences between States:  three countries did not answer any 
question specifically, only providing general comments regarding their point of view on the 
theme of business and human rights and very basic information on their policies.  One country 
answered only three out of the thirteen questions and another State provided only four answers.<b>2</b>  
The remaining countries provided ten or more responses.  This lack of uniformity, when 
combined with the already low response rate, makes the results difficult to interpret.<b>3</b>

</b>  Question 14, in which Member States were asked to supply any additional information that 
</p>
<p>they believe to be relevant to the SRSG&#8217;s mandate that has not been taken into account for these 
purposes. 
<b>3
</b>  For instance, Question 3 (whether any of their agreements relating to or affecting the activities 
</p>
<p>of TNCs and other business enterprises include human rights provisions) and Question 6 
(whether the national legal system allows for the prosecution of legal persons) were answered by 
21 States.  By comparison only 14 answered Question 9 (what are the main obstacles to effective 
implementation of laws, policies, measures or practices with regard to TNCs and other business 
enterprises and human rights) and Question 13 (what should be the role of governments on the 
issue of human rights and TNCs and other business enterprises).  The remaining questions were 
answered quite uniformly with an average of 18 States responding. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Survey findings 
</b></p>
<p><b>Using the market to regulate, encourage, and adjudicate 
</b><i>Regulation and adjudication via investment requirements 
</i></p>
<p>Does your Government have specific programmes, projects, measures or policies aimed at 
effectively regulating and adjudicating the role of transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises with regard to human rights, either for investments into your territory, or 
investments by national companies into other countries?  If so, please indicate briefly what 
they are. 
</p>
<p>11. The first question asks whether Member States regulate and adjudicate the actions of 
corporations in the realm of human rights as an element of their investment policies.  The 
question takes into account both inflows and outflows of investment.  It considers legal 
requirements as well as incentive policies.  Twenty-seven States respond to this question, 
although replies were not always specific. 
</p>
<p>12. The analysis of the responses shows that very few States have programmes, projects, 
measures or policies that are <i>specifically</i> <i>and expressly</i> focused on human rights.  Instead, they 
focus on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).  Some also discuss criminal and civil liability. 
</p>
<p><i>Voluntary CSR Programmes 
</i></p>
<p>13. Approximately 40 per cent of respondents refer to their voluntary programmes or projects 
addressing human rights within the broad framework of CSR.  These include programmes at the 
international and national level.  Thirty per cent give responses indicating that they have only 
started to implement such measures.  Approximately twenty per cent of respondents have not 
implemented any kind of program, project or measures.  Ten per cent did not answer the 
question. 
</p>
<p>14. Some States discuss the instruments upon which their non-legal policies and programmes 
are based.  Most frequently cited are international soft law instruments such as the OECD 
Guidelines for Multilateral Enterprises (30 per cent) and the ILO instruments (10 per cent).<b>4</b>   
Other instruments are cited at lower rates, with the Global Compact at 10 per cent.  Additional 
standards such as the Social Accountability 8000 (SA8000) are rarely cited. </p>
<p><i>Regulatory measures 
</i></p>
<p>15. A few States mention innovative regulatory measures.  One example is social standards 
for public procurement.  Three countries require companies, including some pension funds, to 
report on social, environmental, or ethical considerations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Including the <i>ILO</i> <i>Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work</i> (June 18, 1998); 
</p>
<p>the <i>Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy 
</i>(1977); and the <i>Factory Improvement Programme</i>. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>16. Some States note that they have not instituted specific measures for transnational 
corporations because their constitutions or domestic laws have incorporated human rights norms 
and apply to all those investing in the country. 
</p>
<p>Do your export and foreign investment promotion policies include specific human rights 
provisions? 
</p>
<p>17. This question focuses more narrowly on out-going investment policies, including export 
promotion policies.  All but five States responded to the question.  Just 5 per cent have specific 
human rights conditions in their investment promotion policies that they apply all of the time.  
Almost 20 per cent did not answer the question.  More than 15 per cent state that they apply such 
provisions most of the time.  Thirty per cent have general provisions that refer to CSR, but not 
human rights specifically.  Another 30 per cent have no such policy at all.  These figures 
demonstrate that few States have specific and formal outgoing investment programmes, projects, 
measures or policies that are specifically devoted to human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Five States apply human rights or CSR standards to enterprises taking advantage of their 
export and foreign investment support.  For example, one country requires companies to declare 
that they are familiar with CSR instruments such as the OECD Guidelines and that they will 
strive to comply with them.  Financial support can be denied for projects that, for example, 
would violate basic labour standards, including ILO fundamental labour standards. 
</p>
<p>19. Another State requires projects receiving government export credits to respect the 
World Bank&#8217;s provisions on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, along with other 
World Bank safeguards. 
</p>
<p>20. Yet another State has developed a special law under which certain enterprises wishing to 
receive government credit to invest in developing countries must respect local health and safety 
regulations and certain ILO conventions. 
</p>
<p>21. Three countries discuss special export requirements that are related to human rights.  
These requirements are applied to the export of military material or goods of dual use, or projects 
expected to have a particularly high impact on human rights.  The governments consider the 
overall impact of the project on human rights, often including the human rights conditions in the 
receiving country. 
</p>
<p>Are human rights impact assessments required or encouraged [in export and foreign 
investment promotion policies]?  In the case of incoming investments, do your national 
policies (as a receiving country) require or encourage the undertaking of human rights impact 
assessments? 
</p>
<p>22. The first question above raises the specific question of whether human rights assessments 
are required or encouraged for outward investment, e.g. export and foreign investment promotion 
policies.  This question receives the lowest rate of responses:  nearly 75 per cent did not answer.  
Ten per cent require human rights assessments in very specific cases.  Almost 20 per cent do not 
require any assessment for export and foreign investment promotion polices. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>23. No responding country requires human rights impact assessments for incoming 
investments (the second question above).  However, one has a de facto requirement that it 
istransforming into a written policy.  Nearly 40 per cent encourage the undertaking of informal 
impact assessments that include human rights considerations.  Forty per cent have no policy.  
Twenty per cent did not answer the question. 
</p>
<p>24. Some countries note that all investors, including inward investors, are subject to national 
laws that incorporate human rights.  Their responses imply that, as a result, human rights impact 
assessments are less necessary.<b> </b></p>
<p>Do any of your policies or projects include specific incentives to encourage transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to respect and promote human rights in and 
through their activities domestically or abroad? 
</p>
<p><i>Promotion of human rights via financial and other incentives 
</i>25. The survey also questions whether States use incentives to promote corporate adherence 
to human rights.  States generally do not respond with details about specific incentive schemes.  
Instead, they respond with general answers, such as whether they think they play an active role 
in promoting human rights in the business context. 
</p>
<p>26. One quarter of the respondents did not answer the question.  Almost 30 per cent indicate 
that they do not play any role in this area.  Around 35 per cent promote human rights in the 
context of CSR, some more actively than others.  Fewer than 10 per cent indicate that their 
policies and practices include incentives designed specifically to promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>27. The following are among the incentives utilized: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Some countries have public procurement policies favouring companies that respect 
social and environmental norms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The human rights and CSR requirements of export credit agencies, discussed in the 
context of an earlier question, also help create incentives for companies to adhere to 
human rights when operating abroad. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; One State previously provided funding to businesses that qualified for inclusion in a 
corporate responsibility index.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Several countries give awards to managers who show commitment to CSR and 
human rights issues.  These rewards include indirect political incentives such as 
references in ministerial speeches, access to ministers, and invitations to accompany 
ministers on international visits and to government hosted events. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The policy has been discontinued since 2005. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p><b>Promoting human rights via economic treaties 
</b></p>
<p>Do any of your bilateral or other agreements relating to or affecting the activities of 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, such as free trade agreements or 
bilateral investment treaties, include specific human rights provisions? 
</p>
<p>28. The questionnaire seeks to identify whether States promote human rights via bilateral 
investment treaties and related agreements, in contrast to earlier questions that focused on 
domestic regulation. 
</p>
<p>29. Fewer than 10 per cent of States consistently include human rights provisions in both 
their bilateral and multilateral treaties or in trade or investment agreements.  The majority of the 
responding States (50 per cent) make references to human rights in some of the agreements they 
sign with third parties, but not systematically.  Nearly 30 per cent do not.  Almost 15 per cent did 
not answer the question. 
</p>
<p><i>Bilateral treaties 
</i></p>
<p>30. At the bilateral level, a few States include provisions that encompass human rights in 
investment and trade agreements.  However, the human rights provisions often are only in the 
preamble.  They are also formulated in very general terms.  In combination, this limits their 
legal weight.  In some cases, the provisions are limited to or focus on specific rights, usually 
labour rights.  Finally, some bilateral treaties mention international standards such as the 
OECD Guidelines or ILO Conventions. 
</p>
<p><i>EU treaties and agreements 
</i></p>
<p>31. More than 30 per cent of the respondents declare that the economic treaties formed 
by multilateral institutions on their behalf include a specific human rights provision.  This 
relatively high level of positive responses is due to the fact that a large proportion of 
respondents (45 per cent) are European Union (EU) members. 
</p>
<p>32. The EU framework demonstrates the potential for a multilateral institution to recognize 
and promote human rights in trade or investment agreements.  Human rights clauses have 
systematically been included in trade agreements between the EU and third countries since 
1995.<b>6  </b>As was the case for the bilateral treaties, these provisions are frequently included in the 
preamble section.  However, several States mention that even though the provisions are included 
in the preamble, in some cases they can be used as a basis for temporary suspensions of trade 
benefits and development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>33. Further, human rights clauses are included as a main provision of some EU treaties.  For 
example, clauses on the promotion and protection of human rights are included in the main text 
of the 2000 Cotonou Agreement (revised 2005), a trade and development treaty concluded 
</p>

</p>
<p>between the EU and 77 Asian, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States.  The main body of the 
treaty notes that human rights are an &#8220;essential element&#8221;.  When a country is in serious violation 
of human rights, Cotonou provides for a dialogue with that country.  If this does not result in 
improvement, the EU may engage in &#8220;appropriate measures&#8221; including sanctions, suspension of 
direct aid, suspension of development projects, and modification of existing trade preferences.<b>7</b>  
These are to be stopped as soon as the reasons for taking them have disappeared.<b>8</b>

<p>34. These human rights-related treaty clauses provide potential templates for the future 
development of trade and investment treaties.  However, States do not speak to the effectiveness 
of these special provisions in their responses, so further research is needed to determine their 
efficacy. 
</p>
<p><b>Investigating, adjudicating, and punishing alleged violations 
</b>Does your national legal system allow for the prosecution of legal persons accused of 
committing or participating in human rights violations committed domestically and/or abroad? 
</p>
<p>35. This question examined whether States can prosecute cases involving corporate abuse of 
human rights that occurs domestically or overseas.  Nearly 30 per cent of responding States have 
a national legal system permitting the prosecution of legal persons, and enable extraterritorial 
jurisdiction over human rights violations committed overseas.<b>9 </b>  Most of these countries allow for 
direct legal liability of legal entities.  This means that they can prosecute corporations for human 
rights violations committed extraterritorially. 
</p>
<p>36. Around 30 per cent of countries note that their criminal codes allow for direct liability of 
legal entities but do not provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction, so they can only prosecute 
domestic crimes.  Approximately 35 per cent do not have laws providing for liability for legal 
persons at all.  Ten per cent did not respond to the question. 
</p>
<p>37. States that apply the principle of extraterritoriality generally limit it to specific conditions 
that are in accordance with international law.  For example, they may require a link between the 
country of origin and the offence.  Others base extraterritorial jurisdiction on principles of

<p>universal jurisdiction found in their penal codes or statutes.  Under these laws, prosecution may 
proceed for international crimes regardless of where the acts took place, including terrorist acts, 
torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed by public officials. 
</p>
<p>38. Three countries explicitly underline that States have a duty to apply human rights norms 
to both foreign and domestic corporations.  They perceive this as part of the primary 
responsibility of States to respect, protect and promote human rights.  This includes ratifying and 
implementing international instruments.  To fulfil this responsibility, respondents mention legal 
measures they have taken at the national level to create a cause of action that ensures human 
rights such as the right to freedom of assembly and association or the right to freedom of 
thought. 
</p>
<p>39. In contrast, from the perspective some States that do not allow for prosecution of legal 
entities such as corporations, non-State actors cannot be held responsible for human rights 
violations, since human rights only regulate the relationship between the State and the individual.  
These States mention one exception.  In cases of terrorist acts or acts relating to the security of 
the state, which may encompass human rights violations, national companies can be prosecuted 
abroad. 
</p>
<p>Does your Government provide any national procedure(s) (e.g. administrative procedure, 
investigation procedure, OECD national focal point etc) to respond to alleged participation of a 
company in a human rights violation?  If so, please describe the provisions briefly. 
</p>
<p>40. This question explores State adherence to the duty to investigate alleged human rights 
violations.  Six countries did not respond.  Several responses mention legal measures.  Nearly 
one quarter of the respondents have established a formal, non-legal procedure to respond to 
alleged human rights violations by companies.  Thirty-five per cent implement an informal and 
non-systematic national procedure.  Roughly 20 per cent do not provide any such mechanism.  
And almost one quarter did not answer the question. 
</p>
<p>41. Several States answer with details regarding their national criminal and civil laws and 
related investigation procedures.  For example, in one State, official human rights defenders 
appointed by the government can investigate any accusation of a human rights violation by a 
natural or juridical person.  Another State notes that a wide variety of individuals and 
government figures have standing to raise a case regarding collective rights, such as the right to 
public safety and environmental health.  Such a case takes precedence over other cases pending 
in the court system.  Finally, some States provide special administrative procedures to protect 
labour rights. 
</p>
<p><i>Non-legal mechanisms, including National Contact Points (NCPs) 
</i></p>
<p>42. State responses emphasize the role of the OECD NCPs, both regarding NCP 
investigatory powers and their coordination capacities (discussed later).  The frequency of this 
response reflects the high percent of OECD respondents to the survey.  Some non-OECD </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>countries also implement the OECD Guidelines&#8217; NCP mechanism.<b>10</b>  The frequent references to 
NCPs suggest that in the eyes of governments signing onto the OECD Guidelines, the NCPs play 
an important quasi-legal role.  Of course, most non-OECD countries do not have NCPs, raising 
the question of what other mechanisms, legal and non-legal, could be used in their place. 
</p>
<p>43. NCP pronouncements regarding a specific instance have no legal force.  The survey 
results indicate that governments thus far have not linked NCP conclusions to export credits or 
other government benefits, which would give them more weight. 
</p>
<p><b>Providing tools to facilitate corporate respect for human rights 
</b></p>
<p>Does your Government provide guidelines, best practices, advice or other tools related to 
human rights to companies operating within your jurisdiction, or to companies domiciled 
within your jurisdiction? 
</p>
<p>44. This question considers whether States seek to improve corporate human rights 
performance by providing tools and delineating best practices.  No countries have created new 
tools that are solely related to human rights.  However, some countries (20 per cent) have 
elaborated new guidelines, best practices, and advice in the field of CSR but not human rights 
specifically.  Thirty per cent are only somewhat active in the field of CSR and human rights, 
engaging in information dissemination rather than developing new tools.  Twenty-five per cent 
have not yet implemented any tools, either in the field of business and human rights or in CSR.  
Another 25 per cent did not answer the question. 
</p>
<p>45. The following are examples of the types of tools and resources States provide, ranging 
from simple information dissemination to the development of new tools and standards:<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Information dissemination and advice 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Publication of information on NCPs, the OECD Guidelines, Global Compact, and 
other mechanisms and standards on official websites; translation of this information

community; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Dissemination of information by embassies, diplomatic missions or a special 
information service to national companies abroad about situations in which they run 
the risk of becoming involved in illegal or shady practices; 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>Coordinating nationally and internationally 
</b></p>
<p>Does your Government have procedures to ensure coordination between the units responsible 
for human rights and for investment and trade promotion, either for investments and trade into 
your territory, or investments and trade by national companies into other countries? 
</p>
<p>46. This question asked if States have a procedure to ensure coordination between the units 
responsible for human rights and those responsible for investment and trade promotion.  The 
results show that fewer than 10 per cent of States have a formal process.  The majority of 
respondents (50 per cent) acknowledge playing either a very limited role in this area or not 
playing any coordination role.  Just over 20 per cent mention informal and sporadic interactions 
among stakeholders active in this field.  Almost 25 per cent did not answer the question. 
</p>
<p>47. Apart from NCPs and export credit agencies, discussed below, some States note their 
mainstreaming approach to human rights, under which human rights are to be considered by all 
</p>

</p>
<p>departments.  In some cases, States indicate that this reduced the need for formal coordination.  
In a more proactive approach, another country has appointed an ambassador in charge of 
promoting the human rights aspects of CSR among national entrepreneurs.  This person serves as 
a focal point for national government policy towards civil society and the business community. </p>
<p><i>The coordinating role of NCPs 
</i>48. The countries that do provide a formalized procedure for coordination around business 
and human rights or CSR do so in a number of ways.  Most countries that have a coordination 
mechanism discuss the roles of their NCPs, although some also mention export credit agencies 
and special &#8220;ambassadors&#8221; assigned to the issue. 
</p>
<p>49. The composition and role of the NCP differs from one country to another.  In some cases, 
the NCP is an individual, while in other countries the NCP is an entity including diverse 
members.  One country uses a quadripartite organ, composed of government representatives 
(seven ministers, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance), business 
enterprises, trade organizations, and NGOs.  This organ has a clearly defined programme and 
objectives. 
50. In four countries the coordination role of the NCP is reinforced by additional measures, 
such as the systematic organization of periodic meetings between different governmental units in 
charge of human rights (often part of the Foreign Ministry), and economic and/or trade affairs.<b>13</b>  
NGOs are sometimes included. 
</p>
<p><i>Export credit agencies 
</i></p>
<p>51. Another governmental body mentioned as playing an important coordinating role is the 
export credit guarantee department or agency.  In some cases, the department has a statutory 
requirement to take wider political issues into consideration.  Three respondents note that this 
translates to an obligation to conduct a round of consultations with government departments 
before deciding whether or not to provide guarantees to domestic exporters to places where 
human rights enforcement is limited.  Also, two countries require governmental coordination 
before deciding to prohibit exports to specific countries recognised as being systemic and large-
scale violators of human rights.  In one instance, the export credit agency and foreign affairs 
ministries signed a memorandum of understanding to share human rights information. 
</p>
<p>Does your Government support or otherwise engage in national or international initiatives on 
the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises? Please 
describe briefly. 
</p>
<p>52. Approximately half of the responding countries engage in international and domestic 
initiatives related to businesses and human rights or CSR.  Domestic initiatives include 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  In one country, less formalized coordination between the human rights units of the

</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder policy roundtables, hearings on free trade agreements and their impact on 
human rights, official CSR forums and institutes, and government-sponsored partnerships to 
encourage national companies to act responsibly abroad.  Regarding international initiatives, 
many countries cite their participation in the OECD Guidelines and related machinery, the ILO 
system, the Global Compact, the United Nations, and the EU high-level working group on 
CSR.<b>14  </b>Three countries note their work in the drafting of the ISO 26000 standards for social 
responsibility.  Some also remark on their participation in initiatives such as the Voluntary 
Principles, EITI, and Kimberley Process. 
</p>
<p><b>Research on business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>Has your Government undertaken any studies of the impact of the activities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises on human rights?  If so, please provide a brief 
summary or link. 
</p>
<p>53. One quarter of the responding States have undertaken studies relevant to the impact of 
transnational corporations on human rights.  Research projects include studies on the link 
between the oil industry and human rights violations in conflict areas, and the impact of free 
trade agreements on human rights.  Other studies focus less directly on impacts and more on the 
standards by which to judge them.  For example, one government supported research into 
problems of impunity in zones of conflict and clarification of legal issues surrounding corporate 
complicity.  Another commissioned research on the role of temporary workers and issued a 
report on managing risks of instability and crisis.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Best role for Government and obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>If your Government has any such laws, policies, measures or practices with regard to 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises and human rights, what are the main 
obstacles to effective implementation, if any? 
</p>
<p>54. According to the States responses, the effective implementation of laws, policies, 
measures or practices in the field of business and human rights often is hindered by several types 
of obstacles, including: 
</p>
<p><i>At the multilateral level: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The non-existence or underdevelopment of an international and multilateral 
framework in the field of business and human rights; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  The OECD Guidelines were referenced most frequently, with approximately 40 per cent of 
</p>
<p>those involved with international initiatives citing their participation. 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  One government is also likely to fund a project assessing the Global Compact&#8217;s impact on 
improving business standards amongst member companies. </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; The absence of an internationally recognized body specialized in monitoring and 
reporting on human rights violations by TNCs and other business enterprises; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of mutual legal assistance or the exchange of information in cases of 
inquiries or extradition processes between States; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The uneven playing field in this area, resulting in very different national laws and 
regulations governing human rights violations by TNCs and other business 
enterprises. 
</p>
<p><i>At the national level</i>: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The non-application of the extraterritoriality principle by certain countries; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The difficulty in reaching small and medium enterprises because of time constraints 
and lack of resources, making it challenging for them to implement complex concepts 
such as CSR; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of useful information and best practices available to TNCs and other 
business enterprises to help them better respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>What should be the role of governments on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises (for example, regulator, provider of incentives, 
provider of remedies, and so on - give examples)? 
</p>
<p>55. This final question was aimed at identifying the role that governments see for themselves 
on the issue of business and human rights.  Respondents mention two principal roles that States 
should play in the context of human rights and TNCs and other business enterprises: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promotion of CSR:  11 countries cite the promotion of CSR as the primary role of 
States on the issue of human rights and business enterprises.  Among them, only four 
expressly mention that States can play a role specifically in the field of business and 
human rights, as opposed to CSR as a whole. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Implementation of international norms:  14 of the 19 States responding to this 
question expressly recognize the role of States as the enforcer of national and 
international laws in the general framework of human rights.  Among them, five 
expressly mention the duty for States to prosecute TNCs and other business 
enterprises where criminal law is violated.  Despite concerns expressed in response to 
other survey questions regarding the lack of international standards, only one country 
suggests that States should play a role in favour of the creation of an international 
legal framework in the field of business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>56. It appears that from the perspective of the respondents, States should provide and 
promote guidelines, best practices, and other tools in order to promote CSR.  States also should 
act as an enforcer of international and national laws in the field of human rights.  Furthermore, in </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>the quasi-legal framework, two countries argue that States should play a mediation role by 
solving disputes between stakeholders, notably between private companies, civil society, and/or 
government bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>57. This questionnaire sought to identify the practices, tools, and policies States have 
developed in the field of business and human rights.  The questionnaire focuses on economic 
regulations and policies that incorporate human rights requirements and incentives; bilateral and 
international agreements that include human rights provisions; investigation and adjudication of 
alleged violations by corporate actors; the provision of tools and best practices for companies; 
and the role of government in coordinating around the issue of business and human rights.  The 
low response rate means that the results of the survey may not be representative.  It also may 
mean that despite the importance that many States claim to place on the issue, very few have 
acted upon their political commitments.  Nonetheless, some patterns emerge. 
</p>
<p>58. Virtually all responding States play a role in the field of business and human rights.  
However, the programmes, policies, projects, and measures they have implemented typically are 
not focused on human rights specifically but part of the more general concept of CSR. 
</p>
<p>59. Of the international instruments States use to regulate the role of TNCs and other 
business enterprises with regard to human rights, the OECD Guidelines are the most frequently 
cited.  This is<b> </b>perhaps due to the large percentage of respondents that are OECD members.  
Many of these States note the role the NCP plays in coordinating government organs responsible 
for the promotion of human rights and those in charge of the promotion of trade and investments.  
The NCP also is a major means by which States respond to alleged corporate infringements on 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>60. The use of human rights provisions in bilateral trade and investment treaties is quite 
limited, although EU trade and investment treaties now systematically incorporate human rights.  
Even in the EU framework, human rights clauses are often included only in the preambles of 
agreements, making their legal enforceability questionable. 
</p>
<p>61. States rarely have human rights provisions in their export and foreign investment 
promotion policies, nor their policies for incoming investments.  However, the export of specific 
items such as military goods is subject to restrictive conditions based on human rights conditions 
in the receiving country. 
</p>
<p>62. States are only somewhat active in their capacity to provide tools and best practices to 
promote human rights in business activities.  Interestingly, while many States claim that one of 
their main roles in this area is to promote human rights by providing guidelines, best practices 
and related tools to TNCs and other business enterprises, few are highly active in doing so. 
</p>
<p>63. Only around 30 per cent of the responding countries have a national legal system that 
allows for the prosecution of legal persons accused of human violations committed domestically 
or extraterritorially.  In addition, extraterritorial jurisdiction is applicable in several countries </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>only under strict conditions.  Moreover, several respondents hold the view that non-State actors 
cannot be held responsible for human rights violations at all, since promotion and protection of 
human rights are strictly a State duty. 
</p>
<p>64. In sum, States are engaged in some regulation and enforcement of human rights in the 
context of business, most notably to address the most egregious violations.   However, they focus 
more on CSR instead of addressing human rights specifically.  They also have not come close to 
fully utilizing the palette of legal requirements, regulatory incentives, and voluntary promotional 
activities available to them.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II.  FORTUNE GLOBAL 500 SURVEY RESULTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>65. It is often said that human rights, unlike other areas of corporate responsibility, remain 
somewhat mysterious for business, that corporations don&#8217;t fully know what is expected of them.  
A number of related factors could account for this state of affairs.  Apart from workplace issues, 
human rights until recently were seen as the exclusive domain of States, and no universally 
agreed framework of international human rights standards yet exists that applies to companies, 
whether on a voluntary or mandatory basis.  Beyond compliance with national laws, therefore, 
business policies and practices in the area of human rights remain largely voluntary, inevitably 
leading to differential rates of uptake and levels of performance.  Lastly, the expansive claims 
made by some in the advocacy community for the status and direct reach of international human 
rights law vis-&#224;-vis business can create confusion and defensiveness on the part of companies, 
which may discourage them from experimenting with novel issues and approaches. 
</p>
<p>66. Nevertheless, the SRSG&#8217;s survey of the Global Fortune 500 firms indicates that the 
discourse of human rights is gaining recognition in the corporate arena.  The leading global 
companies report having core elements of human rights policies or management practices in 
place.  They encompass a spectrum of rights, are generally informed by international human 
rights instruments, exhibit relatively systematic patterns across countries and regions, and 
include several basic voluntary accountability mechanisms.  At the same time, however, aspects 
of these policies and practices also raise issues of concern that merit further discussion and 
improvement. 
</p>
<p><b>Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Fortune Global 500 are the world&#8217;s largest firms by revenue.<b>16  </b>In 2005, more 
than 450 of them were headquartered in the United States (176), Europe (195), and Japan (80).  
The survey instrument required the companies to visit a secure website and respond to the 
questionnaire (available in English only) online.  For approximately 300 companies, the SRSG 
sent e-mail requests to specific individuals within the companies who had been identified as the 
appropriate points of contact by a combination of the International Organization of Employers 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(IOE), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), International Business Leaders Forum 
(IBLF), and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), all of which cooperated with the SRSG 
in conducting the survey.<b>17</b>  For another 50 or so companies, IBLF and BSR, after additional 
research, were able to suggest possible contact points.  But for the remainder the SRSG had to 
send letters to the companies&#8217; chief executive officers requesting that an appropriate official 
be asked to respond.  This included a large fraction of the Asian companies, especially 
non-Japanese, as well as Latin American firms.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>68. A total of 102 companies completed the questionnaire, a relatively good response rate for 
an online survey.  It was even higher among firms for which specific contact information were 
obtained.  Nevertheless, just like the results of the State survey, care should be taken in 
interpreting the results.  The low overall response rate, as well as the unequal geographic and 
regional distribution of the responding companies, makes the sample size small and not 
necessarily representative of practices around the world.  Thus, the responses reflect possible 
sampling biases that should be borne in mind in interpreting the results. 
</p>
<p>69. Very few companies contacted by letter to the CEO responded to the survey.  Thus, we 
have no results from the 48 FG500 Asian firms beyond Japan and Australia, and none from the 
five Latin American firms.  In addition, the Japanese response rate was relatively low at 
11 per cent.  Therefore, we do not know the extent to which the overall findings can be 
generalized to these underrepresented firms.  To obtain better regional coverage, the SRSG&#8217;s 
Harvard research team collated information on nearly 300 companies, not limited to the FG500 
and based on sources in multiple languages.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>70. In addition, it may well be the case that companies with human rights policies and 
management practices responded to the survey at a higher rate than those that don&#8217;t.  If so, the 
results would be descriptive of the leading firms&#8217; activities rather than average performers.  
On prudential grounds, therefore, care should be taken in interpreting the results not to 
over-generalize from the absolute numeric value of any given response, and comparisons within 
the sample similarly should focus on relative orders of magnitude.

</b></p>
<p>72. Almost all respondents - nine out of ten - report having an explicit set of human rights 
principles or management practices in place.  At the same time, fewer than half overall say they 
have experienced &#8220;a significant human rights issue&#8221; themselves.  This substantial differential 
suggests that the majority of companies adopted their human rights policy or practices for 
reasons other than immediate necessity - in response to some embarrassing revelation, say - and 
that policy innovation and diffusion clearly also drive their uptake of human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>73. There are some regional and sectoral differences.  North-American firms are slightly less 
likely than Europeans to have adopted human rights policies or practices, even though 
proportionately they were somewhat more likely to have experienced a significant human rights 
issue.  And firms in the extractive industries report having experienced a human rights incident 
at a higher rate than the others - while every respondent in this sector also says it has human 
rights policies and practices in place, perhaps reflecting recent efforts by the International 
Council on Metals and Mining to promote these steps among their member companies in the 
mining industry. 
</p>
<p>74. Almost all companies that report having human rights policies include them in their 
overall corporate code of conduct; only four out of ten respondents indicate having a 
freestanding human rights protocol.  There is no significant regional or sectoral variation on this 
dimension. 
</p>
<p>75. Roughly two thirds of the respondents in the retail and consumer products sectors as well 
as in the extractive industries report that they also take human rights factors into account in 
project risk assessments - the former presumably concerning sourcing issues, and the latter in 
relation to the communities affected by their proposed operations. 
</p>
<p><b>Which Rights? 
</b></p>
<p>76. What areas of human rights do firms recognize in their policies and/or management 
practices?  All respondents, irrespective of region or sector, include non-discrimination, by 
which at minimum they mean recruitment and promotion based on merit, not on race, gender, 
religion or other such factors.  Workplace health and safety standards are cited almost as 
frequently and widely. 
</p>
<p>

</b> For the purposes of this discussion, companies headquartered in European countries were 
</p>
<p>grouped into a single category; this includes the sole Russian respondent.  The three Canadian 
respondents did not differ appreciably from United States-based firms and thus were combined 
with them.  Japanese and Australian firms were sufficiently different in some of their responses 
to keep them distinct rather than creating an Asia-Pacific cluster. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3

</p>
<p>77. Freedom of association and collective bargaining is included by 87 per cent of 
respondents overall.  They are cited by every respondent in the extractive industries, and by 
United States firms more frequently than European. 
</p>
<p>78. Forced, bonded or compulsory labour together with child labour is the next most-
frequently referenced area - by eight out of ten overall, somewhat more often by European than 
American firms.  But European firms are more than twice as likely as their American 
counterparts to recognize the right to life, liberty and security of the person - despite the growing 
number of Alien Torts Statute cases that have been brought against United States firms for 
alleged violations of these rights. 
</p>
<p>79. Three out of four respondents indicate that they recognize a right to privacy; there is little 
regional variation but some differences across sectors (highest in financial services, lowest 
among retailers and manufacturers of consumer products). 
</p>
<p>80. European companies are more likely to recognize a right to health than their 
United States counterparts, and the same is true for rights to an adequate standard of living.  In 
neither case, however, is the overall ranking as high as for the other rights already mentioned. 
</p>
<p><b>Rights for Whom? 
</b></p>
<p>81. We also asked companies which stakeholders their human rights policies and practices 
encompass.  Respondents could choose as many of the options as they thought relevant, and to 
add others not mentioned in the questionnaire.  This made it possible to establish a relative 
ranking of whose rights companies believe they should be concerned with in formulating their 
policies and practices. 
</p>
<p>82. The overall responses are clear and robust.  In descending order, company policies and 
practices encompass employees (referenced by 99 per cent); suppliers and others in their value 
chain (92.5 per cent); the communities in which they operate (71 per cent); the countries in 
which they operate (63 per cent); and others (23.7 per cent), a category that includes customers, 
shareholders, and investors.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>83. There are slight regional differences in this rank ordering.  United States companies rank 
employees and value chains equally high, but place human rights issues of communities and 
countries of operation far lower than European firms do.  They also rank communities lower than 
Japanese firms.  Of the three regional clusters, Japanese companies are least likely to include the 
countries of operation within the spectrum of their perceived human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  This ranking conforms closely to the conception of companies&#8217; differential responsibilities 
</p>
<p>within their &#8220;spheres of influence&#8221; as outlined by the Business Leaders Initiative on Human 
Rights, in <i>A Guide for Integrating Human Rights into Business Management</i>, at www.blihr.org.  
The publication was co-sponsored by the United Nations Global Compact and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.3

</p>
<p>84. The same overall pattern also holds up across sectors - except that companies in the 
extractive industries rank their obligations to surrounding communities higher than to their value 
chains, which is not altogether surprising given that community-related issues have been their 
major source of liability.<b>22</b> 
<b>International instruments 
</b></p>
<p>85. Companies were asked what if any international human rights instruments their policies 
and practices draw upon.  Again they were given the opportunity to cite more than one and to 
add any not mentioned in the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>86. Approximately one-fourth of the respondents skipped this question, presumably 
indicating that they reference no international instrument.  Among the other 75 per cent, 
ILO declarations and conventions top the list, referenced by seven out of ten.  The Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) is the next highest.  The only variations on this theme are 
in the extractive sector, where every single respondent cites the UDHR, and the fact that half of 
the Japanese respondents skipped this question compared to 25 per cent of all respondents. 
</p>
<p>87. The Global Compact is referenced by just over half of the companies that reference any 
international instrument, the OECD Guidelines by fewer than half.  As a source, they matter 
more to European than North American respondents. 
</p>
<p>88. In their optional responses, individual companies added a number of other instruments, 
such as the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and Social Accountability 8000, 
but none was widely referenced. 
</p>
<p>89. It should be noted that companies generally do not &#8220;adopt&#8221; any of these instruments 
verbatim.  Several indicated in their optional responses that while they were &#8220;influenced by&#8221; or 
&#8220;support&#8221; these instruments, their policies do &#8220;not explicitly adhere&#8221; to or &#8220;explicitly reference&#8221; 
them.  The follow-up study mentioned earlier examines actual company policies and 
management practices, and therefore should provide more detailed information about how close 
they get to the original sources that inspired them. 
</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder engagement 
</b></p>
<p>90. Most respondents - more than 80 per cent - indicate that they work with external 
stakeholders in developing and implementing their human rights policies and practices.  
United States firms are somewhat less likely to do so than European or Australian firms, and 
Japanese companies significantly less likely than any of the others.  No pronounced sectoral 
differences exist. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  The case of supply chains is tricky in this regard.  Clearly, many company policies 
</p>
<p>&#8220;encompass&#8221; their suppliers&#8217; human rights practices, but it does not necessarily follow that they 
assume responsibility for them.  Some do, through extensive monitoring and remediation 
programmes, but many others don&#8217;t. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3

</p>
<p>91. NGOs are the most frequently mentioned external partner except by Japanese companies.  
Industry associations also feature prominently.  International organizations are ranked a distant 
third except by United States firms, which place them fifth, behind labour unions and 
governments. 
</p>
<p>92. Only a few variations are found across sectors and they appear to be largely situational -
for example, the pharmaceutical and financial services industries, typically more heavily 
regulated than the others, indicate working more closely with governments in developing their 
policies, and the pharmaceuticals also with international organizations - presumably the 
World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the like. 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>93. A final set of questions asked the companies if their human rights policies are subject to 
internal reporting and compliance systems; if they engage in external reporting; and if they 
conduct human rights impact assessments - corresponding to three features of voluntary 
accountability mechanisms in other areas of corporate activity. 
</p>
<p>94. Nearly nine out of ten respondents say that they have internal reporting and compliance 
systems in place.  Nearly three fourths indicate that they also engage in some form of external 
reporting.  These responses hold across regions and sectors, although the financial services firms 
and companies in the infrastructure and utilities sectors fall below the others on both dimensions. 
</p>
<p>95. Most companies that do external reporting use a periodic publication or the company&#8217;s 
website as their preferred vehicle.  Fewer than half utilize a third party medium such as the 
Global Reporting Initiative or the Global Compact&#8217;s Communication on Progress.  European 
companies are more likely to engage in external reporting than United States firms; Japanese 
companies are a distant last.  Company-based platforms for reporting are preferred irrespective 
of industry sector, but three out of four extractives companies state that they also use a third 
party instruments. 
</p>
<p>96. Social impact assessments of planned or existing corporate activities are becoming a 
more common practice, and they are beginning to incorporate a human rights dimension into 
them.  The International Finance Corporations new performance standards and the Equator 
Principles governing commercial banks&#8217; project financing exemplify these developments.  But 
strictly speaking, very few dedicated human rights impact assessments have ever been conducted 
by any company, and standard tools for them are only gradually being developed.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>97. One third of all respondents say they do conduct human rights impact assessments as a 
routine matter, and just under half that they do occasionally - for the reasons mentioned, 
presumably as part of broader social and environmental impact assessments.  A combined total 
of one-fourth of the respondents either never conduct such assessments or they skipped the 
question.  United States firms are more likely to conduct human rights impact assessments 
routinely than European companies, but only one of the Japanese respondents does so. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>98. According to the survey, assessing the human rights impact of business operations is 
most widespread in the extractives sector, which can have a dramatic impact on host 
communities; in financial services, where due diligence is a standard business practice; and in 
retail and consumer products firms, which often have significant labour issues in their supply 
chains. 
</p>
<p><b>Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>99. Some clear patterns emerge from this survey.  Virtually all companies responding say 
they have human rights principles or management practices in place.  The majority adopted them 
for reasons unrelated to any specific human rights incident.  Work-place rights constitute their 
primary area of concern.  Companies recognize significant obligations toward other stakeholders, 
but they decrease as they move outward from employees into value chains, communities, 
countries of operation, and beyond.  The companies&#8217; human rights policies draw on international 
instruments, and they are developed in cooperation with external stakeholders.  An 
overwhelming number of respondents indicate that they have internal reporting and compliance 
system in place, and most that they also engage in some form of external reporting.  Finally, 
including human rights issues in impact assessments is becoming a more common practice. 
</p>
<p>100. For obvious reasons, a survey of this kind cannot assess the effectiveness of companies&#8217; 
policies and management practices.  But it is safe to conclude that no survey conducted a mere 
five years ago would have yielded comparable results, indicating that policy innovation and 
diffusion has occurred in this domain.  How far these patterns reach beyond the leading firms in 
the FG500 will become clearer with the completion of a follow-up study that examines the 
human rights policies of nearly 300 companies, including a larger number headquartered in 
emerging market countries. 
</p>
<p>101. We also found evidence of sectoral and regional variations around the overall patterns.  
Some sectoral differences are to be expected, reflecting the unique attributes of industries and 
their operating contexts.  But significant variations based on the political culture of companies&#8217; 
home countries are inherently more problematic.  Human rights are considered to be universal, 
interdependent and indivisible.  Yet in several instances we saw that European-based companies 
are more likely to embrace that conception of rights than the others, with United States-based 
firms tending to recognize a narrower spectrum of rights and rights holders.  Differences of this 
kind are bound to be even more pronounced for companies domiciled in emerging market 
countries, underscoring the need for clearer and commonly accepted human rights standards for 
firms. 
</p>
<p>102. Another issue of concern involves the elasticity of human rights standards in corporate 
policies.  We saw that most of the companies with such policies include human rights in an 
overall corporate code or set of business principles; only a minority has a separate human rights 
instrument; and few of those adopt what the human rights community considers a &#8220;rights-based 
approach.&#8221; Within such an approach companies would be expected to take the universe of human 
rights (as contained in the UDHR and related covenants and conventions) and work back from 
them to define corresponding policies and practices.  In contrast, beyond the realm of legal 
requirements, companies that currently have human rights policies typically approach the 
recognition of rights as they would other social expectations, risks and opportunities, 
determining which are most relevant to their business operations and devising their policies </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.3 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p>accordingly.  The latter model comes more naturally to business, but it also leads to variability in 
how rights are defined.  Some of this variation may matter little.  But there must be generally 
recognized boundaries around &#8220;what counts&#8221; as recognition of any particular right, again 
reinforcing the desirability of clear and commonly accepted standards. 
</p>
<p>103. A final issue involves accountability mechanisms.  We saw that companies report on 
their human rights policies using their own websites or periodic reports far more frequently than 
third-party mechanisms.  This may reflect limited third-party options available at this time, 
although the latest generation of the Global Reporting Initiative includes more detailed criteria 
for human rights performance and management systems.  But it may also reflect reluctance by 
companies to move toward fuller transparency.  For reporting to satisfy external stakeholders and 
maximize its utility to a company&#8217;s own strategic and management objectives, two core 
conditions must be met:  the information must be broadly comparable across companies, and 
there needs to be some external assurance as to its trustworthiness and materiality.  The survey 
did not probe this issue directly, but the overall findings and optional responses provide no 
reason to dispute assessments in professional circles that while comparability is slowly 
increasing, external assurance remains more limited.<b>24</b>
