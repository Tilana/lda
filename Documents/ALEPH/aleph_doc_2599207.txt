MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the year ended December 31, 2012
(April 1, 2013)
The  following  report  and  the  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  the  year  ended 
December  31,  2012  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  for  the  year 
ended  December  31,  2012  and  our  2012  annual  report  on  Form  20-F  filed  with  the  United  States  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission (the "SEC") and applicable Canadian securities regulators. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2012  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting Standards Board ("IFRS"), which may not be comparable to financial statements prepared in accordance with Untied 
States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  references  to  "$"  or  "dollar"  herein  are  to  United 
States dollars. As used in this document, the terms "we", "us" and "our" mean MFC Industrial Ltd. and our subsidiaries, unless 
otherwise indicated. All references to "C$" herein are to Canadian dollars. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this 
document may not add up precisely to the totals we provide and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. 
 
As  a  reporting  issuer  in  Canada,  we  are  required  by  Canadian  law  to  provide  disclosure  respecting  our  mineral  interests  in 
accordance  with  National  Instrument  43-101,  referred  to  as  "NI  43-101",  Accordingly,  investors  are  cautioned  that  the 
information  contained  in  this  quarterly  report  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  information  made  public  by  U.S.  companies 
under  the  United  States  federal  securities  laws  and  the  rules  and  regulations  thereunder.  In  particular,  the  terms  "measured 
resource", "indicated resource" and "inferred resource" as may be used herein are not defined in SEC Industry Guide 7 and are 
normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume 
that  any  part  or  all  of  mineral  deposits  in  these  categories  will  ever  be  converted  into  mineral  reserves  with  demonstrated 
economic  viability.  In  addition,  the  estimation  of  inferred  resources  involves  far  greater  uncertainty  as  to  their  existence  and 
economic  viability  than  the  estimation  of  other  categories  of  resources.  Under  Canadian  rules,  estimates  of  inferred  mineral 
resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. U.S. investors are cautioned not to 
assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally minable.

Certain statements in this document are forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations regarding our future growth, 
results  of  operations,  performance  and  business  prospects  and  opportunities.  Forward-looking  statements  consist  of  statements 
that  are  not  purely  historical,  including  any  statements  regarding  beliefs,  plans,  expectations  or  intentions  regarding  the  future. 
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our 
current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any

of  the  events  anticipated  by  the  forward-looking  statements  will  occur  or,  if  they  do  occur,  what  benefits  we  will  obtain  from 
them. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views and are based on certain assumptions and speak only as of the 
date  hereof.  These  assumptions,  which  include  our  current  expectations,  estimates  and  assumptions  about  our  business  and  the 
markets  we  operate  in,  the  global  economic  environment,  interest  rates,  commodities  prices,  exchange  rates,  our  ability  to 
identify, complete and finance additional acquisitions and sources of supply for our global commodity supply chain business and 
our ability to manage our assets and operating costs, may prove to be incorrect. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of 
future  results.  A  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties  could  cause  our  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  or 
implied by the forward-looking statements, including those described herein and in our 2012 annual report on Form 20-F. Such 
forward-looking  statements  should  therefore  be  construed  in  light  of  such  factors.  Investors  are  cautioned  not  to  place  undue 
reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with our legal or regulatory obligations, we are not under 
any obligation and we expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether

. at the time we completed the takeover, our acquisition cost per mcl equivalent lor CPC’s proved and probable natural gas,
NGL and oil reserves was approximately CDN$0.10 based on CPC‘s most recent reserves estimates priorto completion or the
acquisition, which were as oIJune 30, 2012 Please note that these reserves estimates are historic in nature, do not represent
our reserves as at December 31, 2012 and were prepared by CPC based upon Canadian securities requirements and are not
comparable to the updated reserves ligures that we have prepared in accordance with SEC requirements, which are in our
Annual Report on Fprm 20$.

The tollowing are selected highlights oI this acquisition

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TRANSACTION

Acquired CPC, a producer and processorol natural gas and other hydrocarbons in Western
Canada. for approximately CDN$33.1 million on September 6. 2012.

Expanded our global commodities piallorm to include energy

Malority oI operations located in Deep Basin tairway otWestern Canada

Signiticant undeveloped land bank

Future tax beneﬁts

Recognized a $244.6 million bargain purchase gain in connection with the acquisitipn.

In reviewing these assets, we will use our tinancial strength to arrange credit tacilities We have reduced CPC‘s selling, general

and administrative expenses and we also refinanced their bank debt. As a consequence, we can npw look to rationalize these

assets and better manage theirsupply, distribution risk and capital requirements The tollowing ls an overview otourcurrent plans

and intentions Ior CPC'S assets in 2013

Developing midstream operations

Our plan forour Mazeppa Gas Processing Facility (sweet and sourgas lacility), is to develop midslream laciiilies which will help to

reduce our exposure to the volatility ol natural gas prices and have the potential to create lungaterm stable processing income as

well as an valuesadded component to our natural gas. Sourgas ls gas containing signiticant amounts oI hydrogen sultide, whereas
sweet gas is a natural gas low in concentration or sulphur compounds. The Mazeppa racility was originally built by Canadian

Occidental Petrpleum and we are advised that the replacement cost of this lacility today would be in excess of $100 million.

Using the Mazeppa facility as the loundalion, our strategy involves pursuing boltson or valuesadded projects, which may involve

aggregate investments or over $300 milliun. including the following potential proiects:

DEVELOPING MIDSTREAM OPERATIONS (ADD-0N OPTIONS)
Cosgeneration plant (10 to 25 MW) providing electricity lor our own use and with the surplus for sale to
theAlberta electrical grid
Consolidate regional sourgas production by investing in sourgas gathering intrastructure to
complement ourtacility and connecting stranded sour gas suppliers
Design and build a deepscut straddle plant at our lacility lor the recovery of ethane. propane and
butane
A 10000 barrei per day natural gas liquid lraclionalion lacility and rail terminal

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TRANSACTION

MFC acquired 60% of the shares of Possehl and 70% ot the shares oIACCR for $20.9 million in cash.

with lhe balance or lhe shares owned by lhe exisiing managemeni.

The MFC group gained experienced operating managemeni.

The acquisition resulted in our expansion into new markets and new products.
History
ACCR. established in 1957. has a head office in New Jersey and a network of offices in Latin America, including Argentina and
Brazil, as well as a sourcing otfice in China. Possehl. which was established in 1986. has a network of ofﬁces. warehousing and
agencies in Mexico. They source internationally and sell primarily in Mexico and Central and South America.
Purchase price
The acquisition price tor 60% ot Possehl and 70% of ACCR was equal to the Net Tangible Asset Value (“NTAV”). which equals
approximately $20.9 million. subject to adjustments. An additional $2.3 million is payable by us in November 2013. at which time
we will acquire an additional 10% interest in ACCR. In addition we have created a series of options for additional ACCR shares to
retain key individuals with the same NTAV price tormula. MFC's notable financial strength and its already substantial global reach
will be resources ihai will enablegrowih and agiliiy iorihecombined companies.
It is ACCR, Possehl and MFC's belietthat China will be an excellent sourcing market tor us. As the Chinese slowdown continues,
their commodities prices should start to come down and lhey will appreciate relationships with reliable counierpariies irom
international supply chain organizations with ready linancing.
UPDATE ON THE ROYALTY INTEREST AT THE WABUSH MINE
On March 11,2013. Cliiis Naiural Resources Inc. (“Chris”) announced ihaidue to high produciion cosls and lower pellet premium
pricing. which is expected to persist in certain markets during lhe year. it would be taking measures to adiust iron ore pellet
produciion at ils Wabush operaiion. while coniinuing to meel ils cuslomercommilmenls. Cliiis's currenl produci mix in ils Eastern
Canadian iron ore business segment is comprised or iron ore pellets and concentrate.
Cliffs expects lo idle produclion at its Poime Noire iron ore pellet plahi Wiihih lhe city of Septelles. Quebec and transition to
producing an iron ore concentrate trom its Wabush Scully Mine in the Province of Newloundland and Labrador by the end ot the
second quarter in 2013.
We do not expect that this will attect the royalty payment that we receive trom Clitts. Our royalties are paid on all iron ore products
(i.e. pellets. concentrate and chips) shipped trom the Wabush Mine.
Cliffs also disclosed that. for 2013. it is maintaining its fulleyear sales and production volume expectations of 9 to 10 million tons
oui oi ils Eastern Canada business segmeni. This is comprised or approximately 3 million ions or boih iron ore pellets and/or
concenlraie producis irom ils Wabush operaiion. We believe it is a posiiive development ihai Cliiis maintained ils 2013 guidance
torthe same 3 million ton production levels as in 20‘l2. On another Clitts issue, we are again in arbitration overthe underpayment
o1 royaliies and lhe meihod to calculaie lhe royally prices going iorward. We expect lhe relaied hearings to be held in lhe rail
01 2013.
UPDATE ON OUR CAPTIVE SOURCES OF FERROUS METALS AT PEA RIDGE
MFC currently holds an indirect 50% interest in the Pea Ridge iron Ore proiecl (“Projecl”). a pasteproducirlg iron are mine located
in Sullivan, Missouri. The Projecl is a 50/50 joint venture between MFC and Alberici Group inc, whoioined lorces with lhe goal lo

To date our activities at the Proiect have included, among other things:
o a total investment or approximately $16.7 million in the Project: and
. completing a Canadian National Instrument 437101 compliant technical report dated August 13. 2012 by Behre Dolbear
and Company (USA), Inc. and titled “Technical Report on the PRR Mining Pea Ridge Property" (the “Technical Repon"),
to update previously disclosed historic resources estimate to current resource estimates. The Technical Repon estimated
the following resources at a cutroﬂ grade ot40% magnetic iron:
0 measured and indicated resources of 248.7 million shon tons at 57 82% total iron and 52.87% magnetic iron; and
o inferred resources of 15 8 million short tons at 57.64% total iron and 53.67% magnetic iron.
Please reter to the Technical Report, a copy ot Which is available under our protile on WWW.sedar.com, tor turther intormation
regarding the Proiect and the above estimates.
In addition to completion of the Technical Report. as part ot the work necessary to evaluate the Pea Ridge Mine for resopening.
We engaged the consulting tirm Geotechnology, Inc. to investigate the depth and shape ot the top and bottom ot the subsidence
cave zone which is present above the Pea Ridge Mine deposit This work included direct measurements of the size and extent
of the cave Zone within existing vertical drill holes above a portion of the Pea Ridge Mine deposit Having received the results of
such investigation, We are, togetherwith our consultants, considering additional steps ln the evaluation ofthe cave zane, including
resdrilling several existing holes above the mineralized zone, and conducting a threesdimensional detailed seismic survey over
the Pea Ridge Mine site. We believe that the results of this Work Will be usetul in determining the best Way to develop and mine
the iron deposit. Additionally, in 2012 We commenced contirmatory exploration and development Work in connection With the large
tonnage ottailings materials ot the Pea Ridge Minesite.
Together with our consultants, we are conducting additional analysis and investigation regarding the reopening ot the mine,
including commencing contirmatory Work in connection With the large tonnage ot tailings materials present at the Proiect site.
It We determine to move torWard With the Proiect, signiticant additional investment Would be required. We currently expect that
development activities Would take place in tWo main phases:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Nature of Business  
 
We are a global commodities supply chain company, which sources and delivers commodities and materials to clients, with 
an expertise on the financing and risk management aspects of their businesses.  
 
Until  the  first  quarter  of  2010,  we  were  also  active  in  our  former  industrial  plant  technology,  equipment  and  service 
business,  referred  to  as  the  "Industrial  Business",  through  our  interest  in  KHD  Humboldt  Wedag  International 
(Deutschland) AG, referred to as "KID". Our former Industrial Business supplied plant systems as well as machinery and 
equipment worldwide for the manufacture of cement, whether for new plants, redevelopments of existing plants or capacity 
increases for existing plants. It also designed and provided equipment that produced clinker and cement and offered basic 
engineering, detail engineering, plant and equipment for complete plants and plant sections. During the course of 2010, we 
distributed our shares of KID to our shareholders. Upon the distribution to our shareholders of our Industrial Business, we 
operated primarily in the royalty and resources business. 
 
In  connection  with  our  long-term  strategic  plans,  involving  internal  growth  initiatives,  acquisitions  or  business 
combinations, we seek out and evaluate strategic acquisition candidates.  After the distribution of our Industrial Business to 
our shareholders, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Mass Financial Corp., referred 
to  as  "Mass",  which  was  engaged  in  the  commodities,  merchant  banking  and  proprietary  investment  businesses,  and 
consolidated  its  operations  from  November  16,  2010.    In  December  2011,  we  acquired,  together  with  our  partner  in  the 
project,  Alberici  Group,  Inc.,  referred  to  as  "Alberici",  the  Pea  Ridge  Iron  Ore  Mine  project,  located  near  Sullivan, 
Missouri, U.S.A. 
 
In 2012, in order to further our long-term strategy to expand our global commodities business, we completed the following 
acquisitions, which increased our geographic range and added new products to our commodities platform:
•
•
•
in September 2012, we completed the take-over bid of Compton Petroleum Corporation, referred to as "Compton", 
which expanded our commodities business to include the energy sector;
in November 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in each of ACC Resources Co., L.P., referred to as "ACCR" 
and Possehl Mexico S.A. de C.V., referred to as "Possehl", which are global commodities supply chain businesses 
with  a  presence  in  the  North  American  and  Latin  American  markets  and  a  focus  on  refractory  and  ceramic 
materials and other products that are new to our commodities platform; and
in March 2012, we acquired a mineral refinery plant and power plant.
Our  business  is  divided  into  three  reportable  segments:  (i)  commodities  and  resources,  which  includes  our  commodities 
activities and mineral and energy resources; (ii) merchant banking, which includes structured solutions, financial services 
and proprietary investing activities; and (iii) other,  which  encompasses our corporate and other  investments and business 
interests, including our medical supplies and servicing business and corporate. 
 
Recent Developments 
 
The following is a summary of selected key recent developments in our business. 
 
Impairment of Indian Iron Ore Activities 
 
In the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment and write-down, net of income tax recovery, of $48.2 
million  in  relation  to  our  iron  ore  activities  in  India.  In  October  2012,  the  Supreme  Court  of  India  banned  all  mining 
activities in the State of Goa, India. As we believe the situation will take many years to resolve, we determined to exit the 
market and recognized the aforementioned impairment and write-down. These interests were sold in 2013. 
 
Acquisition of Compton Petroleum Corporation  
 
On  September  6,  2012,  we  completed  our  previously  announced  take-over  bid,  referred  to  as  the  "Offer",  for  all  of  the 
issued and outstanding common shares of Compton, referred to as the "Compton Shares". The Offer was made pursuant to 
a support agreement, referred to as the "Support Agreement", between Compton and us dated July 6, 2012. Pursuant to the
- 1 -
Offer,  on  September  6,  2012,  our  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  acquired  approximately  93.8%  of  the  outstanding 
Compton Shares. On September 11, 2012, we completed a compulsory acquisition under the Alberta Business Corporations 
Act,  whereby  our  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  acquired  all  the  remaining  outstanding  Compton  Shares  not  already 
owned by  us or our affiliates. As a result of such compulsory acquisition, our indirect  wholly-owned subsidiary acquired 
100% ownership of Compton. Total cash consideration paid to holders of Compton Shares under the Offer and compulsory 
acquisition was C$32.9 million.  
 
In  connection  with  the  Support  Agreement,  on  July  16,  2012,  our  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  acquired  6,548,498 
special warrants, referred to as the "Warrants", in the capital of Compton, at a price of C$1.25 per Warrant. On September 
6,  2012,  as  a  result  of  the  conversion  of  the  Warrants,  our  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  acquired  an  additional 
6,548,498 Compton Shares. No additional consideration was paid in connection with the conversion of the Warrants.  
 
The following diagram describes the ownership of Compton:
Compton Petroleum
(Austria) GmbH
(Austria)
MFC Industrial Ltd. 
(British Columbia)
As  a  result  of  the  completion  of  the  Offer  and  related  transactions,  we  have  consolidated  Compton's  operations  since 
September 7, 2012. 
 
Acquisition  Rationale  –  We  determined  to  pursue  and  complete  the  acquisition  of  Compton  for,  among  other  things,  the 
following key reasons:
MFC Acquisition Inc.
Corporation
(Alberta)
Compton Petroleum
(British Columbia)
100%

•
•
to significantly expand our global commodities platform into the energy sector; 
 
the  price  paid  under  the  Offer  was  attractive  and  below  Compton's  net  asset  value,  which  resulted  in  our 
recognition of a bargain purchase of $244.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 in connection with the 
acquisition of Compton;
•  Compton's  operations  include  significant  midstream  facilities,  which  present  an  opportunity  for  growth  through
•
•
value-added projects and the consolidation of regional gas production to such facilities;  
 
in  addition  to  its  producing  properties,  Compton  has  a  significant  undeveloped  land  package,  which,  as  at 
December 31, 2012, included 309,782 net undeveloped acres which can be further developed; and 
 
at  the  time  we  completed  the  Offer,  our  acquisition  cost  per  mcf  equivalent  for  Compton's  proved  and  probable 
natural gas, natural gas liquid and oil reserves was approximately $0.10 based on Compton's most recent reserves 
estimates  prior  to  completion  of  the  Offer,  which  were  as  of  June  30,  2012.  Please  note  that  these  reserves 
estimates  are  historic  in  nature,  do  not  represent  our  reserves  as  at  December  31,  2012  and  were  prepared  by 
Compton  based  upon  Canadian  securities  requirements  under  National  Instrument  51-101  –  Standards  of 
Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities and are not comparable to the updated reserves figures that we have prepared 
in accordance with SEC requirements, which are disclosed in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 
December 31, 2012.

Acquisition of ACCR and Possehl 
 
In November 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in each of ACCR and Possehl, which are based in New Jersey, U.S.A 
and  Mexico  City,  Mexico,  respectively.  ACCR  and  Possehl  are  fully  integrated  commodity  supply  chain  companies, 
specializing  in  industrial  raw  materials,  chemicals  and  various  other  products.  The  aggregate  purchase  price  for  a  80% 
interest in ACCR and a 60% interest in Possehl was approximately $23.2 million. We paid $14.7 million of the purchase 
price in 2012 and $6.2 million in January 2013 for a 70% interest in ACCR and 60% interest in Possehl. An additional $2.3 
million  is  payable  by  us  in  November  2013,  at  which  time  we  will  acquire  an  additional  10%  interest  in  ACCR.  The 
purchase price is subject to adjustment based on pending valuations of real property and occurrence of certain adjustment 
events. In addition, the underlying agreements provide for, among other things, the future acquisition of additional interests 
in ACCR and Possehl in certain circumstances.  
 
The acquisition of ACCR and Possehl expanded our existing global supply chain network, reaching further into North and 
Latin  American  markets.  Additionally,  as  ACCR's  and  Possehl's  product  base  included  various  products  that  were  not 
previously  in  our  commodities  platform,  the  acquisition  has  resulted  in  an  expansion  of  our  commodities  operations  into 
new products, including refractory and ceramic  materials,  such as bauxite, flint clay,  magnesium oxide, alumina cements 
and chrome ore, talcs and plastics, industrial chemicals and other products. 
 
Acquisition Rationale – We entered into the transaction to acquire controlling interests in  ACCR and Possehl for, among 
other things, the following key reasons:
the  transaction  price  was  based  on  the  net  tangible  asset  value  of  the  assets,  which  is  consistent  with  our 
acquisition strategy; 
 
there are significant synergies between our global commodity supply chain business and the businesses of ACCR 
and Possehl;  
 
the acquisition presented an attractive opportunity to expand the geographic reach of our global commodity supply 
chain business further into the North American and Latin American markets and increase our customer base with 
new customers and industries;
•  ACCR's and Possehl's existing management team and personnel complement and enhance our existing team; and
•
it  allowed  us  to  diversify  the  scope  of  our  global  commodity  supply  chain  business  into  new  and  unique 
commodities.
Acquisition of Kasese Cobalt Company Limited
Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with a vendor, in March 2012, we acquired a shareholder loan held by the vendor 
and a 75% controlling interest in Kasese Cobalt Company Limited, referred to as "KCCL", for cash consideration of $28.0 
million.  As  a  result  of  the  acquisition,  we  hold  a  mineral  refinery  plant  and  power  plant  in  Uganda.  KCCL's  operations 
comprised the recovery of cobalt metal from pyrite tailings located near its refinery. Supply  from the tailings pile for the 
refinery is expected to be depleted by the end of 2013. A bargain purchase of $2.4 million was recognized in connection 
with the acquisition.  
 
Acquisition Rationale – We completed the KCCL acquisition for, among other things, the following key reasons:
•
•
•
the  acquisition  of  KCCL  presented  an  opportunity  for  us  to  leverage  our  experience  to  complete  the  closure  of 
KCCL's mining operations and rationalize its assets;
the  acquisition  allowed  us  to  acquire  the  related  power  plant,  which  presented  a  potential  upside  opportunity  in 
connection with the sale of energy production; and
the opportunity to realize upon the benefits of reducing the general and administrative costs of KCCL.

Dividend Payments 
 
On January 10, 2011, we announced that our board of directors had adopted an annual dividend policy, providing for an 
annual dividend based on the annual dividend yield of the New York Stock Exchange, referred to as the “NYSE”, 
Composite Index for the preceding year plus 25 basis points. We declared and paid annual cash dividends of $0.20 and 
$0.22 per common share in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Such dividends were paid in four quarterly installments. On 
January 14, 2013, we announced that our board of directors had declared an annual cash dividend for 2013 of $0.24 per 
common share, payable in four quarterly installments. The 2013 dividend is approximately 9% higher than the dividend 
paid in 2012, and, based on the closing price on December 31, 2012 of $8.55 on the NYSE, represents a dividend yield of 
approximately 2.81%, compared to an annual dividend yield of approximately 2.5% for the NYSE Composite Index in 
2012. The first 2013 dividend payment of $0.06 per share was made on February 8, 2013 to shareholders of record on 
January 25, 2013. On April 1, 2013 we announced that the second dividend payment for 2013, of $0.06 per share, would be 
made on April 22, 2013 to shareholders of record on April 12, 2013. 
 
Business Segments 
 
Our  business  is  divided  into  three  reportable  segments:  (i)  commodities  and  resources,  which  includes  our  commodities 
activities and mineral and energy resources; (ii) merchant banking, which includes structured solutions, financial services 
and proprietary investing activities; and (iii) other,  which  encompasses our corporate and other  investments and business 
interests, including our medical supplies and servicing business and corporate. 
 
Commodities and Resources 
 
Our  commodity  supply  chain  business  is  globally  focused  and  includes  our  integrated  commodities  operations  and  our 
mineral interests. We conduct such operations primarily through our subsidiaries based in Vienna, Austria and our recently 
acquired subsidiaries in the United States, Latin America and Canada, and supply various commodities, including minerals 
and  metals,  chemicals,  plastics,  refractory  and  ceramic  materials  and  wood  products  to  our  customers.  As  a  result  of  our 
acquisition of  Compton  in the third quarter of 2012,  we are now active  in the energy sector of the commodities business 
through our natural gas and other hydrocarbon production and processing activities in Alberta, Canada. Our commodities 
originate either from our directly or indirectly held interests in resource projects or are secured by us from third parties. We 
also derive production royalty revenue from a mining sub-lease. 
 
Through  our  global  commodity  supply  chain  business,  we  also  provide  logistics,  supply  chain  management  and  other 
services  to  producers  and  consumers  of  commodities.  These  activities  are  supported  by  strategic  direct  or  indirect 
investments  in  natural  resource  assets  operating  in  our  core  commodities,  including  plastics,  non-ferrous  metals  and 
minerals. 
 
Our commodities operations include sourcing and supplying commodities. To a lesser extent,  we also act as an agent for 
our clients. Our commodities  operations often  utilize innovative trading strategies and structures. We currently engage in 
purchases and sales  with commodity  and other producers  who are  unable to effectively realize sales due to  their specific 
circumstances. 
 
We often purchase or produce the underlying commodity and sell it to an end buyer or transfer it for another commodity, 
which  will  subsequently  be  sold.  Further,  commodity  producers  and  end  customers  often  work  with  us  to  better  manage 
their internal supply chain, distribution risk and currency and capital requirements. In such commodities operations, we try 
to  capture  various  commodities,  financing  and  currency  spreads.  Through  our  operations,  we  have  been  able  to  develop 
ongoing  relationships  with  commodity  producers,  end  customers  and  financiers  and  integrate  them  into  our  financial 
activities.  
 
We  generally  source  commodities  from  Asia,  Africa,  Europe,  North  America  and  the  Middle  East.  Our  commodities  are 
sold in global markets. 
 
Our  commodities  operations  are  supported  by  our  logistics  and  finance  activities  in  order  to  provide  cost  effective  and 
efficient transportation, as  well as the granting of payment  terms  for  working capital requirements for our customers  and 
partners. 
 
Our  commodities  and  resources  business  employs  personnel  worldwide.  Our  main  marketing  office  is  located  in  Vienna, 
Austria.  In  addition,  we  establish  relationships  with  and  seek  to  further  market  our  products  through  agents  located
- 4 -
worldwide.  Our  marketing  and  investment  activities  in  the  commodities  and  resource  sector  are  supported  by  a  global 
network of agents and relationships. This network provides us with worldwide sourcing and distribution capabilities.  
 
We had indirectly entered into agreements  with third party leaseholders of iron ore  mines in India pursuant to  which our 
subsidiary  was  the  sole  contractor,  and  the  third  parties  agreed  to  sell  iron  ore  to  our  subsidiary  at  a  fixed  price  per  ton 
based on the extraction costs plus a royalty payment to the owner dependent upon the iron content. During the year ended 
December  31,  2012,  we  recognized  an  inventory  write-down  of  $19.4 million  as  well  as  an  impairment  loss  of 
$42.6 million on such interests after the Supreme Court of India banned all mining activities in the area. In aggregate, the 
total loss on the write-down and impairment was $48.2 million, net of an income tax recovery of $13.8 million.  We sold 
these interests in 2013 for nominal consideration and an interest in future cash flow if mineral extraction actually resumes.  
 
We  indirectly  derive  production  royalty  revenue  from  a  mining  sub-lease  of  the  lands  upon  which  the  Wabush  iron  ore 
mine  is  situated  in  Newfoundland  and  Labrador,  Canada.  This  sub-lease  commenced  in  1956  and  expires  in  2055.  The 
lessor  is  Knoll  Lake  Minerals  Ltd.,  referred  to  as  "Knoll  Lake  Minerals",  which  holds  a  direct  mining  lease  from  the 
Province. The mine is owned by Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., referred to as "Cliffs". In August 2011, we reorganized our 
royalty asset to hold an indirect 99.44% economic interest therein.  
 
In 2012, 2011 and 2010, 3.1 million, 3.3 million and 3.8 million tons of iron pellets, respectively, were shipped from Pointe 
Noire,  Québec,  Canada.  Subsequent  to  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  Cliffs  announced  that  it  expects  to  idle  the 
Wabush Pointe Noire pellet plant by the end of the second quarter 2013 and transition to producing an iron ore concentrate 
only product from the mine due to high production costs and lower pellet premium pricing.  
 
Iron  ore  shipments  from  the  Wabush  iron  ore  mine  are  subject  to  seasonal  and  cyclical  fluctuations.  The  royalty  is  paid 
quarterly and is based on the tonnage of iron ore products shipped. One of the major components in the calculation of the 
royalty rate payable is based on the most recently published price of a particular iron ore pellet. Pursuant to the terms of the 
mining sub-lease, the royalty payment is not to be less than C$3.25 million per annum until its expiry. In 1988, the royalty 
rate  was  amended  to  require  a  base  royalty  rate  of  C$1.685  per  ton  with  escalations  as  defined  in  the  sub-lease.  We  are 
obligated  to  make  royalty  payments  of  C$0.22  per  ton  on shipments  of  iron  ore  products  to  Knoll  Lake  Minerals,  which 
holds the direct lease over the mine property. Cliffs applies a portion of the royalty payments under the sub-lease to make 
such royalty payments to Knoll Lake Minerals.  
 
Historically,  iron  ore  benchmark  prices  were  determined  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  calendar  year  through  negotiations 
between the major producers and their most significant customers. These prices were then generally adopted by the other 
suppliers when published.  
 
A shift in the marketplace has, among other things, made obsolete certain of the world iron ore pellet pricing methodology 
for calculating the royalty rate due to us contained in our sub-lease for the Wabush iron mine. As a result of these market 
changes,  and  as  the  sub-lease  permits  us  to  renegotiate  an  increase  in  the  royalty  rates  when  the  mine  achieves  certain 
profitability  thresholds,  which  we  believe  have  been  obtained,  we  served  the  mine  operator  with  notice  of  arbitration 
respecting  our  entitlement  to  a  new  base  rate  for  the  royalty.  We  have  also  provided  the  mine  operator  with  a  notice  of 
arbitration  seeking  recovery  for  royalty  underpayments  in  2010  and  a  determination  for  the  calculation  of  future  royalty 
pricing. The outcome of such proceedings cannot be determined at this time.  
 
Iron ore is typically sold either as a concentrate, whereby the iron ore is in granular form, or as a pellet, whereby iron ore 
concentrate has been mixed with a binding agent, formed into a pellet and then fired in a furnace. Iron ore pellets can be 
charged  directly  into  blast  furnaces  without  further  processing  and  are  primarily  used  to  produce  pig  iron  which  is 
subsequently transformed into steel. The ore resources at the Wabush mine contain manganese in quantities that make the 
resulting iron ore concentrates unattractive to some steel plant customers. The operator of the mine has announced that it is 
addressing this by installing mill components that reduce manganese content, with the final plant reconfiguration requiring 
four to six independent  manganese reduction circuits, two  of  which  were installed in 2011. The operator of the  mine  has 
indicated that this manganese reduction program would extend the mine life by six years.

In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2011,  along  with  Alberici,  we  acquired  the  Pea  Ridge  Iron  Ore  Mine,  located  near  Sullivan, 
Missouri,  U.S.A.  We  previously  acquired  various  secured  debt  and  interests  respecting  the  properties  underlying  the  Pea 
Ridge Mine, with our investment being approximately $12.1 million in 2011 to acquire our indirect 50% interest in the Pea 
Ridge  Mine. Pursuant  to  the  transaction,  the  previous  owners  retained  a  2.6%  net  smelter  returns  royalty  on  ferrous 
minerals produced at the mine. Additionally, the previous owners hold 70% of another entity which has a mineral license 
respecting  non-ferrous  minerals  at  the  mine,  with  the  remaining  30%  of  such  entity  indirectly  held  jointly  by  us  and 
Alberici.  
 
The  Pea  Ridge  Mine  is  located  approximately  70  miles  southwest  of  St.  Louis,  Missouri  and  was  operated  as  an 
underground mine between 1963 and 2001, producing approximately 58.5 million short tons during such period. The mine 
was originally developed as a partnership between Bethlehem Steel  Corporation and St. Joe Minerals Corp., operating as 
the  Meramec  Mining  Company.  From  1981  to  1987  the  mine  was  operated  by  Fluor  Corporation  and  was  subsequently 
acquired  by  Woodridge  Resources  Corporation,  which  operated  the  mine  until  its  closure  in  2001.  From  2001  until  we 
acquired our interest in the Pea Ridge Mine, operations at the mine had been limited to reclamation of resource settlement 
ponds located below the historical production facilities.  
 
The  Pea  Ridge  Mine  project  includes  the  historic  mine  deposit  along  with  a  large  tonnage  of  tailings  material.  Prior 
infrastructure  remains  in  place,  including  access  to  underground  workings,  two  vertical  mine  shafts  with  hoists  and 
headframes,  a  plant  building  and  tailings  and  settling  ponds.  The  Pea  Ridge  Mine's  location  is  served  by  highways 
connecting to the U.S. interstate highway system and has a presently unused rail spur line connecting to the Union Pacific 
railway system.  
 
During 2012, we and our partner, Alberici, continued to study the re-opening of the Pea Ridge Mine.  During the second 
quarter of 2012,  we completed an updated NI 43-101 compliant technical report, referred to as the "Pea Ridge Technical 
Report",  upgrading  previously  disclosed  historic  resources  estimates  to  current  resource  estimates.  Behre  Dolbear  and 
Company  (USA),  Inc.,  referred  to  as  "Behre  Dolbear",  our  independent  technical  consultants,  authored  the  Pea  Ridge 
Technical Report.  The estimates include an in situ (originally present)  measured and indicated resource of 248.7 million 
short  tons  at  52.87%  magnetic  iron  and  57.82%  total  iron  and  an  inferred  resource  of  15.8  million  short  tons  at  53.67% 
magnetic iron and 57.64% total iron based on a cut-off grade of 40% magnetic iron. 
 
In completing the Pea Ridge Technical Report, Behre Dolbear conducted, among other things, an audit of historic drill hole 
data and a confirmatory re-sampling and analysis program on the extensive library of drill core maintained at the Pea Ridge 
Mine site. 
 
Readers should refer to the full text of the Pea Ridge Technical Report, titled "Technical Report on the PRR Mining Pea 
Ridge Property" dated August 13, 2012, for further information regarding the Pea Ridge Mine, a copy of which is available 
under our profile at www.sedar.com.

In addition to completion of the Pea Ridge Technical Report, as part of the work necessary to evaluate the Pea Ridge Mine 
for  re-opening,  we  engaged  the  consulting  firm  Geotechnology,  Inc.  to  investigate  the  depth  and  shape  of  the  top  and 
bottom  of  the  subsidence  cave  zone  which  is  present  above  the  Pea  Ridge  Mine  deposit.  This  work  included  direct 
measurements of the size and extent of the cave zone within existing vertical drill holes above a portion of the Pea Ridge 
Mine  deposit.  Having  received  the  results  of  such  investigation,  we  are,  together  with  our  consultants,  considering 
additional steps in the evaluation of the cave zone, including re-drilling several existing holes above the mineralized zone, 
and conducting a three-dimensional detailed seismic survey over the Pea Ridge Mine site. We believe that the results of this 
work will be useful in determining the best way to develop and mine the iron deposit. Additionally, in 2012 we commenced 
confirmatory exploration and development work in connection with the large tonnage of tailings materials of the Pea Ridge 
Mine site. 
 
A  necessary  step  in  completing  further  analysis,  including  feasibility  studies,  and  re-opening  the  Pea  Ridge  Mine  is 
dewatering the existing underground mine workings. De-watering activities have been delayed while we complete further 
preliminary  analysis  and  investigations  regarding  the  re-opening  of  the  mine.  In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  we 
invested an additional $5.0 million of capital to progress the project. 
 
As  a  result  of  our  acquisition  of  Compton,  our  commodities  activities  have  expanded  to  the  energy  sector  through  the 
development, production and processing of natural gas, natural gas liquids and, to a far lesser degree, crude oil in western 
Canada.  The  majority  of  such  operations  are  located  in  the  central  fairway  of  the  Western  Canada  Sedimentary  Basin, 
primarily situated in the Province of Alberta. As at December 31, 2012, these interests included 945 producing natural gas 
wells,  17  non-producing  natural  gas  wells,  116  producing  oil  wells,  7  non-producing  oil  wells  and  a  land  position  that 
includes 309,782 net undeveloped acres. Our assets are situated in the following areas of the Western Canada Sedimentary 
Basin:  (i)  the  Rock  Creek  sands  and  other  Cretaceous  sands  in  the  Niton  area  of  central  Alberta;  (ii)  the  Cretaceous  and 
Tertiary sands in Okotoks and Southern Alberta; (iii) the Mannville sands in the High River area of southern Alberta; and 
(iv) the deeper, Belly River sands in the Callum area of southern Alberta.  
 
Merchant Banking 
 
Our merchant banking operations include merchant banking and financial services, third-party financing and other services, 
proprietary investing and our real property. We seek to invest in many industries, emphasizing those business opportunities 
where the perceived intrinsic value is not properly recognized.  
 
We use our financial and management expertise to add or unlock value within a relatively short time period. Our merchant 
banking activity is generally not passive, and we seek investments where our financial expertise and management can add 
or unlock value. Proprietary investments are generated and made as part of our overall merchant banking activities and are 
realized upon over time, sometimes taking more than one year. In addition, we often seek to acquire interests or establish 
relationships  with  commodity  producers  to  realize  upon  potential  synergies.  Such  interests  can  be  acquired  through 
purchases of, or investments in, commodity producers, or through contractual arrangements with them, including off-take 
agreements. The investments we make in commodity producers are part of our merchant banking strategy. To a degree, our 
merchant  banking  and  commodities  and  resources  businesses  supplement  each  other,  which  results  in  synergies  in  our 
overall business activities. 
 
Our  activities  include  making  proprietary  investments  through  investing  our  own  capital  and  utilizing  our  expertise  to 
capture investment opportunities. We seek to invest in businesses or assets whose intrinsic value is not properly reflected in 
their  share  or  other  price.  Often  such  investments  are  in  companies  or  assets  that  are  under  financial,  legal  or  regulatory 
distress and our services include resolving such distress. Our investing takes many forms and can include acquiring entire 
businesses  or  portions  thereof,  investing  in  equity,  investing  in  the  existing  indebtedness  (secured  and  unsecured)  of  a 
business  or  in  new  equity  or  debt  issues.  Our  investing  is  generally  not  passive,  and  we  invest  where  we  believe  our 
expertise in financial restructuring and management and complementary trading and corporate finance capabilities can add 
or unlock value. Our investing in distressed businesses and/or assets can result in complex and intricate legal issues relating 
to priorities, claims and other rights of stakeholders. Such issues can result in our being involved in legal and other claims 
as  a  result  of  our  overall  proprietary  investment  strategy.  Our  proprietary  investments  are  often  made  as  a  part  of,  or 
complementary to, our commodities and resources activities. 
 
We consider investment opportunities where: (i) our existing participation in the marketing and production of commodities 
provides  expert  insight;  (ii)  we  can  obtain  a  satisfactory  return  of  future  capital  investment;  and  (iii)  such  investment 
integrates with our business. Our philosophy is to utilize our financial strength to realize the commercial potential of assets 
in markets where we have a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of value.
- 7 -
Our  merchant  banking  operations  provide  innovative  finance  services  for  corporate  and  trade  finance  transactions.  We 
focus on  meeting the  financial needs of small to  mid-sized companies and other business enterprises primarily in Europe 
and  Asia.  We  believe  that  many  of  these  clients  are  underserviced  by  the  large  global  investment  banks  and  financial 
service  providers.  We  specialize  in  advising  and  structuring  business  enterprises  involved  in  unstructured  and  novel 
situations where a strong financial partner is needed and traditional, off-the-shelf solutions are not workable.  
 
In addition, we utilize our established relationships with international financial institutions, credit insurance and factoring 
companies  to  provide  flexible,  customized  financial  tools,  extensive  credit  and  risk  management  and  structured  solutions 
for  our  customers.  Working  closely  with  our  customers,  our  professional  staff  arrange  support  of  hedging  and  trading  of 
materials, financing and risk management solutions. 
 
Our  merchant banking activities also include leveraging our trading and financial experience and relationships to provide 
trading services and trade finance services to our customers. 
 
Our  merchant  banking  business  generates  revenues  in  the  form  of  corporate  and  trade  finance  service  fees  and  interest 
income. We also realize gains from time to time on our proprietary investments, upon their sale, the execution of an equity 
or debt restructuring, or the completion of other forms of divestment. 
 
Other 
 
Our  other  segment  includes  our  corporate  and  other  operating  segments  and  investments,  which  include  financing  joint 
ventures through our Shanghai, China-based subsidiary which provides medical services, equipment and supplies. 
 
Company Strategy 
 
Our primary and overriding business objective is to enhance value and create wealth for our shareholders. The key elements 
of our strategy include the following:
•
Investing in Undervalued Opportunities. We seek to invest in businesses or assets whose intrinsic value is not 
properly  reflected  in  their  share  price  or  where  we  perceive  that  our  commodities  and  financial  expertise  and 
management  can  add  or  unlock  value.  These  include  investments  in  highly  unstructured  situations  and  in 
companies undergoing financial or operational stress. Such investments often involve severe time constraints, and, 
given our liquid resources, we are well positioned to capitalize on such opportunities. Unlike traditional companies 
in the financial services sector, our investing is generally not passive.
•  Geographic Scope of Operations. We operate globally, so we supply a diversified range of commodities to our 
customers,  develop  new  relationships  with  producers  and  consumers  of  commodities  and  selectively  target  new 
business and investment opportunities worldwide.
•  Strategic Investments. Strategic investments in resource assets are an important component of our commodities 
trading activities and value added services. We pursue selective strategic acquisitions and alliances to support and 
strengthen our commodities operations as and when opportunities arise. We will continue to apply our investment 
criteria to our acquisitions, pursuing investments in assets that are of strategic importance to our core businesses. 
At  the  same  time,  we  continue  to  evaluate  dispositions  of  investments  or  assets,  in  particular  when  they  are  no 
longer deemed to support our core business or when attractive selling opportunities arise.
•  Create Shareholder Value. The nature of our business is cyclical and affected by several factors that do not lend 
themselves to regular evaluation. Therefore, we do not evaluate our performance and do not believe we should be 
scrutinized in terms of our price-to-earnings multiple. We seek to grow our asset base and net worth and believe 
these are the best valuation measures for our business.
•  Financial  Profile.  We  seek  to  maintain  our  fiscal  profile,  so  we  can  access  necessary  financing  on  competitive 
terms. In addition, we believe our fiscal approach helps us to manage acquisition risks and maintain a high level of 
liquidity.
•  Risk  Approach.  We  have  adopted  policies  intended  to  mitigate  and  manage  commodity  price  and  counterparty 
risks  associated  with  our  commodities  trading  activities.  For  example,  a  substantial  portion  of  our  inventory  of 
commodities  is  at  any  time  under  contract  for  sale  at  a  pre-determined  price.  We  also  reduce  the  risk  of  non-
- 8 -
payment  by  customers  by  imposing  limits  on  open  accounts  extended  to  creditworthy  customers  and  imposing 
credit support requirements for other customers.
Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
•
International  Capabilities.  Unlike  other  similarly  sized  companies,  we  have  sought  to  develop  a  broad 
geographic  scope rather than  focusing on any one particular market. While  many of our larger competitors have 
greater  presences  in  more  international  markets,  including  merchant  and  investment  banks,  trading  firms, 
brokerage firms, commercial banks and hedge funds, we believe our smaller size and collegiality allow us to work 
as a team on cross-border transactions better than many of our competitors.
•  Liquidity.  Liquidity  is  of  critical  importance  to  companies  in  the  merchant  banking  industry  and  global 
commodity  supply  chain  business  and  is  key  to  strategic  acquisitions  to  further  expand  and  support  our  global 
commodity  supply  chain  business.  We  therefore  maintain  liquidity  in  order  to  be  able  to  capitalize  on  business 
opportunities in time sensitive transactions, fund our core businesses to continue to generate revenues, and fund a 
broad range of potential cash outflows in stressed environments, including financing obligations. Our approach to 
liquidity  allows  us  to  meet  immediate  obligations  without  needing  to  sell  other  assets  or  depend  on  additional 
funding from credit-sensitive markets, and affords us significant flexibility in structuring our affairs and managing 
through difficult funding environments. Historically, we have funded our businesses with cash generated from our 
operations.
•
Independence.  We  are  an  independent  company  managed  by  our  directors  and  officers,  rather  than  part  of  a 
larger, diversified financial services institution. Such financial services companies can develop conflicts with their 
clients due to the large number of customers they service, their own investment and trading position and the broad 
range  of  products  and  services  they  offer.  We  believe  that  awareness  of  these  potential  conflicts  has  heightened 
and that such awareness has resulted in increased opportunities for independent firms like us in respect of merger, 
acquisition, restructuring and similar transactions.
•  Management.  We  believe  that  our  management  has  expertise  in  the  global  commodity  supply  chain  business, 
including  critical  expertise  with  respect  to  our  specialized  financial  services  and  corporate  finance  services 
internationally, including on corporate restructurings and mergers and acquisitions.
•
Integrated Service Approach. We believe our logistics and financing activities allow us to provide a full-service 
solution to our commodities trading customers and suppliers. We are able to provide our customers and suppliers 
assistance with transportation and logistics as well as trading, hedging, financing and risk management services.
•  Operating  Structure  Allows  Prompt  Response  to  Investment  Opportunities.  We  have  a  lean  operating 
structure and are therefore able to quickly assess whether a business venture represents an appropriate investment 
for us, responding promptly to all desirable business opportunities. We carefully select the business opportunities 
we investigate and do not move forward unless we have a high level of confidence that the opportunities fit within 
our objectives and core competencies.
Competitive Conditions 
 
All segments of our business are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so.  
 
Our  operations  are  relatively  small  compared  to  our  competitors.  Many  of  our  competitors  have  far  greater  financial 
resources,  a  broader  range  of  products  and  services,  larger  customer  bases,  greater  name  recognition  and  marketing 
resources,  a  larger  number  of  senior  professionals  to  serve  their  clients'  needs,  greater  global  reach  and  more  established 
relationships with clients than we do. These competitors may be better able to respond to changes in business conditions, to 
compete  for  skilled  professionals,  to  finance  acquisitions,  to  fund  internal  growth  and  to  compete  for  market  share 
generally. Further  many companies are engaged in the acquisition of resource interests.  We may also be at a competitive 
disadvantage  in  acquiring  such  properties  and  interests  as  many  competitors  may  have  greater  financial  resources  and 
technical staff. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against other companies 
in acquiring additional interests and resource properties.  
 
The  scale  of  our  competitors  in  the  merchant  banking  business  has  increased  in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  substantial 
consolidation among companies, especially in the banking and financial industries. These firms have the ability to offer a 
wider range of products than  we do  which  may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to  support
- 9 -
their businesses with other services such as commercial lending in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted, and 
could further result, in pricing pressure in our businesses.  
 
We believe that our experience and operating structure permit us to respond more rapidly to our clients' needs than many of 
our larger competitors. These traits are important to small and mid-sized business enterprises, many of which do not have 
large  internal  corporate  finance  departments  to  handle  their  capital  requirements.  We  develop  a  partnership  approach  to 
assist  clients.  This  often  permits  us  to  develop  multiple  revenue  sources  from  the  same  client.  For  example,  we  may 
purchase and sell a client's products, or commit our own capital to make a proprietary investment in its business or capital 
structure.  
 
Discussion of Operations 
 
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  the  fiscal  years  ended 
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and 
related notes. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 were prepared in accordance with IFRS. We 
adopted IFRS as of January 1, 2010.  
 
General 
 
We are a global commodities supply chain company which sources and delivers commodities and materials to clients, with 
a  special  expertise  on  the  financing  and  risk  management  aspects  of  the  business.  We  also  commit  our  own  capital  to 
promising enterprises and invest and otherwise capture investment opportunities for our own account. We seek to invest in 
businesses or assets whose intrinsic value is not properly reflected in their share price or value. Our investing is generally 
not passive. We actively seek investments where our financial expertise and management can add or unlock value. 
 
Our results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by many factors of a global nature, including economic 
and market conditions, the availability of capital, the level and volatility of equity prices and interest rates, currency values, 
commodity prices and other  market  indices, technological  changes, the availability of credit, inflation and legislative  and 
regulatory developments. Our results of operations may also be materially affected by competitive factors. Our competitors 
include  firms  traditionally  engaged  in  merchant  banking  and  financial  services  such  as  merchant  and  investment  banks, 
along  with  other  capital  sources  such  as  hedge  funds,  private  equity  firms  and  insurance  companies,  and  other  trade 
companies engaged in commodities activities in Europe, Asia and globally.  
 
Our  results  of  operations  for  any  particular  period  may  also  be  materially  affected  by  our  realization  on  proprietary 
investments. These investments are made to maximize total return through long-term appreciation and recognized gains on 
divestment. We realize on our proprietary investments through a variety of methods including sales, capital restructuring or 
other forms of divestment. 
 
A  majority  of  our  revenues  is  derived  from  our  global  commodity  supply  chain  operations.  The  remaining  portions  are 
generally derived from financial services, sales of properties and net gains on securities.  
 
We  view  our  net  book  value  per  share  as  a  key  indicator  of  our  overall  financial  performance.  Our  net  book  value  as  at 
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below:

Business Environment 
 
Our  financial  performance  is,  and  our  consolidated  results  in  any  period  can  be,  materially  affected  by  global  economic 
conditions and financial markets generally.
- 10 -
Our favourable business environment is characterized by many factors, including a stable geopolitical climate, transparent 
financial  markets, low  inflation, low interest rates, availability of credit, low  unemployment, strong business profitability 
and high business and investor confidence. Unfavourable or uncertain economic and  market conditions can be caused by 
declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increase 
in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate volatility, outbreaks of hostilities or other 
geopolitical  instability,  corporate,  political  or  other  scandals  that  reduce  investor  confidence  in  the  capital  markets,  or  a 
combination of these or other factors.  
 
Commencing in mid-2008 and continuing through most of 2009, the macro business environment for many of our activities 
was  extremely  challenging.  During  such  period,  capital  and  securities  markets  generally  were  materially  and  adversely 
affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all investment classes and by a serious lack of liquidity. The global 
markets  were  characterized  by  substantially  increased  volatility  and  an  overall  loss  of  investor  confidence,  initially  in 
financial institutions, but later in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets. The decline in asset 
values  has  caused  increases  in  margin  calls  for  investors,  requirements  that  derivatives  counterparties  post  additional 
collateral and redemptions by mutual and hedge fund investors, all of which have increased the downward pressure on asset 
values and outflows of funds across the financial services industry. In addition, increased redemptions and unavailability of 
credit  caused  hedge  funds  and  other  investors  to  rapidly  reduce  leverage,  which  has  increased  volatility  and  further 
contributed to the decline in asset values.  
 
Ongoing global economic conditions, including fears of sovereign debt default and a European banking crisis continued to 
impact  the  liquidity  in  financial  and  capital  markets,  restricting  access  to  financing  and  causing  significant  volatility  in 
commodity  prices  in  2012.  There  can  be  no  assurance  as  to  the  stabilization  and  recovery  of  economic  conditions  in  the 
near term.  
 
Presentation of Financial Information/Accounting Treatment 
 
We completed our acquisition of Compton in  September  2012, and, as a result,  we commenced consolidating Compton's 
operation from September 7, 2012. 
 
We  completed  our  acquisition  of  Mass  in  November  2010  and  caused  the  amalgamation  of  Mass  and  our  wholly-owned 
subsidiary  in  December  2010.  As  a  result  of  the  successful  acquisition,  we  commenced  consolidating  Mass's  operations, 
including its commodities and merchant banking activities from November 16, 2010. 
 
Until March 30, 2010, we also operated in the Industrial Business through KID. As at March 30, 2010, we completed a plan 
of arrangement pursuant to which, among other things, we distributed approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of our 
Industrial Business (at such time) to our shareholders and ceased to consolidate it as at March 31, 2010. We distributed the 
Industrial Business to our shareholders over the course of 2010.  
 
The disposition of our former Industrial Business in 2010 resulted in it being accounted for as discontinued operations.

Based upon the yearly average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2012, the United States dollar increased by 
approximately  8.3%  and  1.1%  in  value  against  the  Euro  and  the  Canadian  dollar,  respectively,  compared  to  the  average 
exchange rates in 2011. As at December 31, 2012, the United States dollar had decreased by approximately 1.6% against 
the Euro and 2.2% against the Canadian dollar since December 31, 2011.
- 13 -
Gross  revenues  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012  decreased  to  $485.7  million  (consisting  of  net  sales  of  $479.5 
million  and  equity  income  from  medical  joint  ventures  of  $6.2  million)  from  $520.7  million  (consisting  of  net  sales  of 
$514.8 million and equity income from medical joint ventures of $5.9 million) in the same period of 2011, primarily as a 
result  of  decreased  sales  of  commodities  due  to  reductions  in  both  volumes  and  prices  on  some  commodities  in  2012, 
partially offset by  new products and the consolidation of  Compton since  September 7,  2012. A  weaker Euro also  had an 
adverse impact on our revenues when Euro-denominated revenues were translated to U.S. dollars.
Gross  revenues  for  our  commodities  and  resources  business  were  $455.9  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012, 
compared  to  $481.7  million  for  the  same  period  in  2011,  primarily  as  a  result  of  decreased  sales  of  commodities  due  to 
reductions in both volumes and prices of some commodities in 2012, partially offset by new products and the consolidation 
of Compton since September 7, 2012.
During  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  gross  revenues  generated  by  our  royalty  marginally  decreased  to 
approximately $29.1 million from approximately $30.8 million in the same period in 2011. This decrease in gross royalty 
revenues  was  mainly attributable to lower shipments in 2012. A total of 3.2 million tons and 3.5 million tons of iron ore 
products were shipped during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Gross revenues for our merchant banking business were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 
$22.5 million for the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of lower activities.
Gross revenues for our other segment were $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to $16.5 million 
for the same period in 2011.
Costs  of  sales  decreased  to  $407.6  million  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2012  from  $435.4  million  for  the 
same period in 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in commodities and resource activities, partially off-set by a write-
down  of  inventories  of  $15.7 million  (of  which  $19.4 million  related  to  our  former  Indian  iron  ore  activities,  which  we 
recognized after the Supreme Court of India banned all mining activities in the area). The following is a breakdown of our 
costs of sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation, increased to $47.7 million for the year 
ended  December  31,  2012  from  $40.4 million  for  the  same  period  of  2011.  The  increase  is  primarily  linked  to  expenses 
incurred in connection  with the acquisition of  Compton during  the period and its consolidation since September 7, 2012, 
partially offset by savings associated with streamlining our activities.
We  recognized  an  impairment  of  interests  in  resource  properties  of  $42.6  million  (before  income  tax  recovery  of  $13.8 
million)  for the  year ended December 31, 2012 in connection  with a  subsidiary that  had engaged in iron ore activities in 
India. We recognized the impairment after the  Supreme Court of India banned all  mining activities in the area. The total 
impairment  and  write-down,  net  of  income  tax  recovery,  was  $48.2 million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012  in 
relation to these interests. These interests were sold in 2013. 
 
Impairment of available-for-sale securities  was $4.3  million in 2012, compared to $12.4  million in 2011. It represents an 
other-than-temporary impairment charge on our investment portfolio. 
 
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  non-cash  and  discretionary  share-based  compensation  expense  decreased  to 
$9,000  from  $7.2  million  for  the  same  period  in  2011  as  a  result  of  granting  2,635,000  options  to  our  directors  and 
employees in January 2011.
- 14 -
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred finance costs of $12.4 million, primarily related to our commodities 
business,  compared  to  $7.2  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2011.  Such  finance  costs  increased  as  a  result  of 
increased interest payments on our long term debt and credit facilities.  
 
For the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred a net foreign currency transaction gain of $7.1 million, compared to a 
loss of $0.9 million for the same period in 2011, in the statement of operations. 
 
We  recognized  a  bargain  purchase  of  $247.0  million,  or  $3.95  per  share,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012, 
primarily  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  Compton.  The  bargain  purchase  arose  as  the  consideration  under  the 
transaction was less than the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
 
We recognized an income tax recovery (other than resource property revenue taxes) of $8.5 million during the year ended 
December 31, 2012, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. 
Our statutory tax rate was 25% during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 26.5% for the same period in 2011, 
and our effective tax rates are lower than our statutory tax rates in the current period. The income tax paid in cash during 
the year ended December 31, 2012 was $4.9 million compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2011.
We also recognized resource property revenue taxes of $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 
$4.6  million  during  the  same  period  of  2011.  The  resource  property  revenues  tax  rate  was  20%  on  the  gross  royalty 
revenue, deducted at source, which is reduced by 20% of deductible expenses. The increase in taxes was primarily a result 
of a claim in the year ended December 31, 2012.
Overall,  we  recognized  an  income  tax  recovery  of  $2.6  million  (recovery  of  income  taxes  of  $8.5  million  and  resource 
property revenue taxes of $5.9 million) during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to an expense of $6.0 million 
(income taxes of $1.3 million and resource property revenue taxes of $4.6 million) during the same period of 2011.
For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  our  income  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  shareholders  was 
$226.8 million, or $3.62 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.19 per share on a basic and 
diluted basis, for the same period in 2011.

Based upon the yearly average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2011, the United States dollar decreased by 
approximately  4.7%  and  4.0%  in  value  against  the  Euro  and  the  Canadian  dollar,  respectively,  compared  to  the  average 
exchange rates in 2010. As at December 31, 2011, the United States dollar had increased by approximately 3.2% against the 
Euro and 2.3% against the Canadian dollar since December 31, 2010.
Gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $520.7 million (consisting of net sales of $514.8 million 
and equity income from medical joint ventures of $5.9 million) from $85.4 million (consisting of net sales of $84.5 million 
and  equity  income  from  medical  joint  ventures  of  $1.0  million)  in  the  same  period  of  2010,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the 
inclusion of the results of the operations of Mass since November 16, 2010.
Gross  revenues  for  our  commodities  and  resources  business  were  $481.7  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2011, 
compared to $76.5 million for the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of the inclusion of the results of operations of 
Mass since November 16, 2010.
During  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2011,  gross  revenues  generated  by  our  royalty  marginally  decreased  to 
approximately $30.8 million from approximately $31.7 million (including royalty payments respecting prior years of $11.2 
million) in the same period in 2010. This decrease in gross royalty revenues was mainly attributable to lower shipments in 
2011 and the inclusion of $11.2 million of royalty payments respecting prior years including 2010. A total of 3.5 million 
tons  and  3.8  million  tons  of  iron  ore  products  were  shipped  during  the  fiscal  years  ended  December  31,  2011  and  2010, 
respectively.
Gross revenues for our merchant banking business were $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 
$4.8 million for the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of the inclusion of Mass since November 16, 2010.
Gross revenues for our other segment were $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $4.1 million 
for the same period in 2010, primarily as a result of the inclusion of Mass since November 16, 2010.

Costs of sales increased to $435.4 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 from $51.4 million for the same 
period in 2010, primarily as a result of the consolidation of Mass's operations from November 16, 2010. The following is a

Impairment of available-for-sale securities was $12.4 million in 2011, compared to $nil in 2010. It represents an other-than-
temporary impairment charge on our long-term investment portfolio. 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation, increased to $40.4 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2011 from $18.3 million for the same period of 2010. The increase is primarily linked to the inclusion 
of Mass's operations since November 16, 2010 and, in particular, employee compensation expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, non-cash and discretionary share-based compensation expense increased to $7.2 
million  from  $0.1  million  for  the  same  period  in  2010  as  a  result  of  granting  2,635,000  options  to  our  directors  and 
employees in January 2011. The options vested immediately, resulting in all share-based compensation expense being fully 
recognized in the first quarter of 2011. We did not grant additional options in 2011 and, accordingly, did not incur or report 
share-based compensation expense over the remaining life of these options. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred finance costs of $7.2 million, compared to $1.0 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2010. Such  finance costs increased as a result of increased interest payments on our long term  debt 
and credit facilities and factoring charges as a result of the inclusion of Mass since November 16, 2010.
For the  year ended December 31, 2011, we  incurred a net  foreign currency  transaction loss of $0.9  million, compared to 
$3.6 million for the same period in 2010, in the statement of operations.
We  recognized  a  bargain  purchase  of  $41.1  million  during  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2010  in  connection  with  the 
acquisition of Mass. The bargain purchase was included in our statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 
2010 and arose as the market price of our common  shares  on the acquisition dates  was less than the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets acquired from Mass. 
 
We recognized a provision for income taxes (other than resource property revenue taxes) of $1.3 million and $0.2 million 
during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our statutory tax rate was 26.5% during the year ended December 31, 
2011 compared to 28.5% for the same period in 2010, and our effective tax rates are lower than our statutory tax rates in the 
current period. The income tax paid in cash during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1.0 million compared to $3.0 
million for the same period in 2010.
We also recognized resource property revenue taxes of $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 
$6.7  million  during  the  same  period  of  2010.  The  resource  property  revenues  tax  rate  was  20%  on  the  gross  royalty 
revenue,  deducted  at  source,  which  is  reduced  by  20%  of  deductible  expenses.  The  lower  taxes  in  2011  are  primarily  a 
result of a tax refund claim.
Overall, we recognized an income tax expense of $6.0 million (income taxes of $1.3 million and resource property revenue 
taxes of $4.6 million) during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $7.0 million (income taxes of $0.2 million 
and resource property revenue taxes of $6.7 million) during the same period of 2010.
For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2011,  our  income  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  shareholders  was 
$12.2 million, or $0.19 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to $45.8 million, or $1.28 per share on a basic and 
diluted basis, for the same period in 2010.

Note: 
(1)  We consolidated the operations of Compton, from September 7, 2012. 
(2)  Net loss attributable to our shareholders. 
 
Based upon average exchange rates for the three months ended December 31, 2012, the United States dollar increased by 
approximately 3.8% and decreased 2.5% in value against the Euro and the Canadian dollar, respectively, compared to the 
three-month average exchange rates in the comparative quarter of 2011. As at December 31, 2012, the United States dollar 
had decreased by approximately 1.6% against the Euro and 2.2% against the Canadian dollar since December 31, 2011.
Gross  revenues  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012  decreased  to  $111.8  million  (consisting  of  net  sales  of 
$110.4 million and equity income from medical joint ventures of $1.3 million) from $129.5 million (consisting of net sales 
of $128.1 million and equity income from medical joint ventures of $1.4 million) in the same period of 2011, primarily as a 
result of decreased sales of commodities due to reductions in both volumes and prices on some commodities in the three 
months ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by new products and the consolidation of Compton since September 7, 
2012.
Gross revenues for our commodities and resources business were $110.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 
2012, compared to $122.8 million for the same period in 2011, primarily as a result of decreased sales of commodities due 
to  reductions  in  both  volumes  and  prices  on  some  commodities  in  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012,  partially 
offset by new products and the consolidation of Compton since September 7, 2012. 
 
During  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012,  gross  revenues  generated  by  our  royalty  increased  to  approximately 
$9.4  million  from  approximately  $5.7  million  in  the  same  period  in  2011.  This  increase  in  gross  royalty  revenues  was 
mainly  attributable  to  higher  shipments  during  the  comparative  period  in  2012  and  a  royalty  payment  adjustment  for  the 
earlier quarters in 2012. A total of 0.9 million tons and 0.6 million tons of iron ore pellets  were shipped during the three 
months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Gross revenues for our merchant banking business were $2.5 million (negative) for the three months ended December 31, 
2012, primarily as a result of losses on certain transactions, compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2011.
Gross revenues for our other segment were $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2012, compared to $3.6 
million for the same period in 2011.

Costs of sales decreased to $104.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2012 from $116.2 million for the 
same period in 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in commodities and resource activities, partially off-set by a write-
down of inventories of $19.4 million related to our Indian iron ore activities, which we recognized after the Supreme Court 
of India banned all mining activities in the State of Goa, India. The following is a breakdown of our costs of sales for each 
of the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

Three Months Ended December 31,
2012
2011
We  recognized  an  impairment  of  interests  in  resource  properties  of  $42.6  million  (before  income  tax  recovery  of  $13.8 
million)  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012  in  connection  with  a  subsidiary  that  had  engaged  in  iron  ore 
activities in India. We recognized the impairment after the Supreme Court of India banned all mining activities in the area. 
The total impairment and write-down, net of income tax recovery, was $48.2 million for the three months ended December 
31, 2012 in relation to these interests. These interests were sold in 2013. 
 
Impairment of available-for-sale securities was $4.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2012, compared 
to  $12.4  million  in  the  same  period  of  2011.  It  represents  an  other-than-temporary  impairment  charge  on  our  long-term 
investment portfolio. 
 
Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  to  $15.3 million  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012 
from  $8.9 million  for  the  same  period  of  2011.  The  increase  is  primarily  linked  to  the  consolidation  of  Compton  from 
September 7, 2012.
During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we incurred finance costs of $5.3 million, compared to $0.8 million for 
the three months ended December 31, 2011. Such finance costs increased as a result of increased interest payments on our 
long term debt and credit facilities.
For  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012,  we  recorded  a  net  foreign  currency  transaction  gain  of  $6.3  million, 
compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2011, in the statement of operations.
We recognized an income tax recovery (other than resource property revenue taxes) of $8.9 million during the three months 
ended  December  31,  2012  compared  a  provision  for  income  taxes  of  $0.2  million  during  the  same  period  in  2011.  Our 
statutory tax rate was 25% during the three months ended December 31, 2012 compared to 26.5% for the same period in 
2011, and our effective tax rates are lower than our statutory tax rates in the current period. The income tax paid in cash 
during the three months ended December 31, 2012 was $2.3 million.
We  also  recognized  resource  property  revenue  taxes  of  $1.9  million  during  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012, 
compared to $1.4 million during the same period of 2011. The resource property revenues tax rate was 20% on the gross 
royalty revenue, deducted at source, which is reduced by 20% of deductible expenses.
Overall,  we  recognized  an  income  tax  recovery  of  $7.1  million  (recovery  of  income  taxes  of  $8.9  million  and  resource 
property  revenue  taxes  of  $1.9  million)  during  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2012,  compared  to  income  tax 
expense of $1.7 million (income taxes of $0.2 million and resource property revenue taxes of $1.4 million) during the same 
period of 2011.
For  the  three  months  December  31,  2012,  our  loss  from  continuing  operations  attributable  to  shareholders  was 
$47.0 million, or $0.75 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to $9.4 million, or $0.15 per share on a basic and 
diluted basis, for the same period in 2011.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
General 
 
Liquidity is of importance to companies in our businesses. Insufficient liquidity often results in underperformance.  
 
Our  objectives  when  managing  capital  are:  (i) to  safeguard  our  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  so  that  we  can 
continue  to  provide  returns  for  shareholders  and  benefits  for  other  stakeholders,  (ii) to  provide  an  adequate  return  to  our 
shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk, and (iii) to maintain a flexible capital 
structure  which  optimizes  the  cost  of  capital  at  acceptable  risk.  We  set  the  amount  of  capital  in  proportion  to  risk.  We 
manage  our  capital  structure  and  make  adjustments  to  it  in  the  light  of  changes  in  economic  conditions  and  the  risk 
characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust this capital  structure,  we  may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
 
Consistent with others in our industry, we monitor capital on the basis of our debt-to-adjusted capital ratio and long-term 
debt-to-equity  ratio.  The  debt-to-adjusted  capital  ratio  is  calculated  as  net  debt  divided  by  adjusted  capital.  Net  debt  is 
calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted capital comprises all components of equity and some forms 
of  subordinated  debt,  if  any.  The  long-term  debt-to-equity  ratio  is  calculated  as  long-term  debt  divided  by  shareholders' 
equity. The computations are based on continuing operations.  The following table sets forth the calculation of our debt-to-
adjusted capital ratio as at each of the periods indicated:

During  2012, our  strategy,  which  was  unchanged  from  2011  and  2010,  was  to  maintain  the  debt-to-adjusted  capital  ratio 
and the long-term debt-to-equity ratio at a low level. We had a net cash and cash equivalent balance after deduction of the 
total  debt.  Our  long-term  debt-to-equity  ratio  was  0.16,  0.04  and  0.09  as  at  December 31,  2012,  2011  and  2010,

We  maintain an adequate level of liquidity,  with a portion of our assets  held in cash and cash equivalents and  securities. 
The  liquid  nature  of  these  assets  provides  us  with  flexibility  in  managing  and  financing  our  business  and  the  ability  to 
realize upon investment or business opportunities as they arise. We also use this liquidity in client-related services by acting 
as a financial intermediary for third parties (e.g. by acquiring a position or assets and reselling such position or assets) and 
for our own proprietary trading and investing activities. 
 
As at December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents were $273.8 million, compared to $387.1 million and $397.7 million 
as at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cash  was primarily a  result of cash utilized to fund the 
acquisition of Compton and related transactions and cash flows used in operating activities. We had assets held for sale of 
$128.7 million as at December 31, 2012, compared to $nil as at each of December 31, 2011 and 2010. As at December 31, 
2012,  short-term  securities  decreased  to  $6.7 million  from  $13.1  million  and  $27.9  million  as  at  December  31,  2011 and 
2010, respectively. The decrease in short-term securities in 2011 was a result of dispositions. Trade receivables and other 
receivables  were  $72.8  million  and  $18.3  million,  respectively  as  at  December  31,  2012,  compared  to  $21.2  million  and 
$9.1 million at December 31, 2011 and $13.1 and $12.1 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in trade receivables 
was primarily a result of the consolidation of new subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2012, we had a loan receivable of $nil, 
compared  to  $19.9  million  as  at  December  31,  2011  and  $5.8  million  as  at  December  31,  2010.  The  decrease  in  loan 
receivable  was  a  result  of  the  collection  of  a  credit  facility.  As  at  December  31,  2012,  we  had  bills  of  exchange  of  $nil, 
compared to $10.5 million in 2011 and $nil in 2010. The decrease in bills of exchange in 2012 was a result of collections in 
cash.  The  value  of  our  inventories  increased  to  $142.9  million  as  at  December  31,  2012,  from  $81.2  million  and  $67.1 
million as at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increased inventories were partially due to the acquisition of 
new subsidiaries in 2012. The value of real estate held for sale  was $12.2 million as at December 31, 2012, compared to 
$12.0 million and $12.5 million as at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The value of deposits, prepaid and other 
assets  was $27.8 million as at December 31, 2012, compared to $9.3 million and $20.8 million as at December 31, 2011 
and 2010, respectively. The increase in the value of deposits, prepaid and other assets was primarily a result of prepayments 
and deposits for inventories and the consolidation of new subsidiaries in 2012.  As described herein and in the notes to our 
audited  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  the  acquisitions  of  new  subsidiaries  had  a  material 
impact on our current assets. 
 
Short-Term Bank Loans and Facilities 
 
As  part  of  our  operations,  we  establish,  utilize  and  maintain  various  kinds  of  credit  lines  and  facilities  with  banks  and 
insurers. Most of these facilities are short-term. These  facilities are  used  for day-to-day  business and  structured solutions 
activities in commodities. The amounts drawn under such facilities fluctuate with the kind and level of transactions being 
undertaken.  
 
As at December 31, 2012, we had credit facilities aggregating $439.7 million as  follows: (i) we  had unsecured revolving 
credit  facilities  aggregating  $195.2  million  from  banks;  (ii)  we  had  revolving  credit  facilities  aggregating  $63.8  million 
from banks for structured solutions, a special trade financing. The margin is negotiable when the facility is used; (iii) we
- 21 -
had a non-recourse specially structured factoring arrangement with a bank for up to a credit limit of $122.6 million for our 
commodities  activities. We  may  factor  our  commodity  receivable  accounts  upon  invoicing  at  the  inter-bank  rate  plus  a 
margin; and (iv) we had a foreign exchange credit facility of $58.1 million with a bank. All of these facilities are renewable 
on a yearly basis.   
 
Long-Term Debt 
 
Other than lines of credit drawn and as  may be outstanding for trade financing and commodities and structured solutions 
activities, as of December 31, 2012, the maturities of long-term debt were as follows:

During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2012,  we  paid  off  $28.3  million  of  debt.  We  incurred  additional  long  term  debt  of 
$133.5 million consisting of €80.0 million in connection with our acquisition of Compton and $28.0 million in connection 
with KCCL. 
 
We expect our maturing debt to be satisfied primarily through the settlement of underlying commodities transactions, trade 
financing  transactions,  including  structured  solutions  transactions,  cash  on  hand  and  cash  flow  from  operations.  Much  of 
our  maturing  debt  may  either  subsequently  be  made  re-available  to  us  by  the  applicable  financial  institution  or  we  may 
replace such facilities with new facilities depending upon particular capital requirements.  
 
MPP Term Financing 
 
As  at  December  31,  2012,  we  had  liabilities  under  the  MPP  term  financing  totaling  $18.7  million  as  a  result  of  our 
consolidation of Compton in the third quarter of 2012, comprised of the present value of monthly base processing fees, the 
outstanding purchase option and unamortized financing fees. MPP is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the 
Province of Alberta and owns certain  midstream  facilities, including natural gas plants and pipelines in southern  Alberta, 
through which Compton processes a significant portion of its production from the surrounding area. The arrangements with 
MPP are governed by agreements which provide for:

Cash Flows 
 
Due to the type of businesses we engage in, our cash flows are not necessarily reflective of net earnings and net assets for 
any reporting period. As a result, instead of using a traditional cash flow analysis solely based on cash flows statements, our 
management  believes  it  is  more  useful  and  meaningful  to  analyze  our  cash  flows  by  the  overall  liquidity  and  credit 
availability. Please see the discussion on our financial position, short-term bank loans, facilities and long term debt earlier 
in this section.  
 
The global commodity supply chain business can be cyclical and our cash flows vary accordingly. Our principal operating 
cash expenditures are for financing trading of securities, commodities financing and general and administrative expenses.
- 22 -
Working  capital  levels  fluctuate  throughout  the  year  and  are  affected  by  the  level  of  our  commodities  operations,  the 
markets and prices for commodities and the timing of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses. Changes in 
the volume of commodities transactions can affect the level of receivables and influence overall working capital levels. We 
have  a  sufficient  level  of  cash  on  hand  and  credit  facility  amounts.  We  believe  that  we  have  sufficient  cash  flows  from 
operations, cash on hand and credit availability to meet our working capital and other requirements and to meet unexpected 
cash demands.  
 
Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
Operating activities used cash of $144.4 million in 2012, compared to providing cash of $44.7 million and $43.9 million in 
2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, a decrease in short-term bank borrowings for day-to-day business requirements used

Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $83.4 million  2012,  compared  to  using  cash  of  $17.4  million  in  2011  and 
providing  cash  of  $46.2  million  in  2010.  A  net  increase  in  debt  borrowing  provided  cash  of  $105.2  million  in  2012,

used cash of $13.8 million, $0.7 million, $7.4 million and $44,000, respectively.  
 
Our  odd-lot  share  repurchase  program  was  completed  on  July  2,  2012.  Pursuant  to  the  program,  we  offered  to  buy  back 
common  shares  from  registered  and  beneficial  shareholders  who  owned  99  or  fewer  common  shares. Pursuant  to  the
- 23 -
program,  we  repurchased  and  cancelled  a  total  of  6,028  of  our  common  shares  from  455  registered  and  beneficial 
shareholders, representing a 48.6% participation rate amongst registered eligible shareholders. Shareholders who elected to 
participate  in  the  repurchase  program  received  an  amount  equal  to  the  weighted  average  of  the  closing  prices  of  our 
common shares on the NYSE during each of the initial six-week period of the program and the six-week extension thereto 
for each common share tendered. 
 
Future Liquidity 
 
We had no material commitments to acquire assets or operating businesses as at December 31, 2012. We expect that there 
will be acquisitions of businesses or commitments  to projects in  the  future. To achieve the long-term  goals of expanding 
our  assets  and  earnings,  including  through  acquisitions,  capital  resources  will  be  required.  Depending  on  the  size  of  a 
transaction, the capital resources that  will be required can be substantial. The necessary  resources  will be generated from 
cash flows from operations, cash on hand, borrowings against our assets, sales of proprietary investments or the issuance of 
securities. 
 
Foreign Currency 
 
Substantially all of our operations are conducted in international markets and our consolidated financial results are subject 
to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  
 
Our reporting currency is the United States dollar. We translate subsidiaries' assets and liabilities, into United States dollars 
at the rate of exchange on the balance  sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at exchange rates approximating 
those  at  the  date  of  the  transactions.  As  a  substantial  amount  of  revenues  are  received  in  Euros,  Chinese  yuans  and 
Canadian dollars, the financial position for any  given period, when reported in United States dollars, can be significantly 
affected by the exchange rates for Euros, Chinese yuans and Canadian dollars prevailing during that period. 
 
In  the  year  ended  December 31,  2012,  we  reported  approximately  a  net  $7.9 million  currency  translation  adjustment  loss 
under other comprehensive income within equity, compared to losses of $1.4 million and $3.9 million in 2011 and 2010, 
respectively.

Risk Management 
 
Risk is an inherent part of our business and operating activities. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, 
assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness 
and  profitability.  We  seek  to  identify,  assess,  monitor  and  manage  the  following  principal  risks  involved  in  our  business 
activities:  market,  credit,  liquidity,  operational,  legal  and  compliance,  new  business,  reputational  and  other.  Risk 
management  is  a  multi-faceted  process  that  requires  communication,  judgment  and  knowledge  of  financial  products  and 
markets.  Our  management  takes  an  active  role  in  the  risk  management  process  and  requires  specific  administrative  and
- 24 -
business  functions  to  assist  in  the  identification,  assessment  and  control  of  various  risks.  Our  risk  management  policies, 
procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification.  
 
Inflation 
 
We  do  not  believe  that  inflation  has  had  a  material  impact  on  our  revenues  or  income  over  the  past  two  fiscal  years. 
However, increases in inflation could result in increases in our expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price 
of services provided to our clients. To the extent that inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on 
capital markets, it could adversely affect our financial position and profitability. 
 
Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  our  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 
Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the 
number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments 
become even more subjective and complex. We have identified certain accounting policies that are the most important to 
the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to Note 1 to our audited consolidated 
financial statements for a discussion of the significant accounting policies. 
 
The following accounting policies are the most important to our ongoing financial condition and results of operations:  
 
Inventories 
 
Our inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods.  
 
In  general,  inventories  are  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  value.  Commodities  acquired  in 
commodity  broker-trader  activities  with  the  purpose  of  selling  them  in  the  near  future  and  generating  a  profit  from 
fluctuations  in  price  or  margin  are  measured  at  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  Accordingly,  our  management  must  make 
estimates  about  their  pricing  when  establishing  the  appropriate  provisions  for  inventories.  For  the  finished  goods  and 
commodity inventories, the estimated net selling price is the most important determining factor. However, our management 
also considers whether there are any alternatives to enhance the value of the finished goods by various marketing strategies 
and channels. Actual selling price could differ from the estimated selling price, and such differences could be material.  
 
Receivables 
 
Receivables  are  financial  instruments  that  are  not  classified  as  held  for  trading  or  available  for  sale.  They  are  net  of  an 
allowance for credit losses, if any. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjust our allowance accounts 
for specific customer risks and credit factors. Receivables are considered past due on an individual basis based on the terms 
of the contracts. Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount considered adequate to absorb estimated credit-
related losses. Such allowance reflects our management's best estimate of the losses in our receivables and judgments about 
economic  conditions.  As  at  December  31,  2012,  we  had  recognized  receivables  (including  trade  and  other  receivables) 
aggregating $91.1 million. 
 
Valuation of Securities 
 
Securities held for trading are carried at current market value. Any unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading 
are included in our results of operations. 
 
Available-for-sale securities are also carried at current market value when current market value is available. Any unrealized 
gains or losses are included in other comprehensive income. When there is any objective evidence that an available-for-sale 
security  is other than a temporary decline, the security  will be written down to recognize the loss in the determination of 
income. In determining whether the decline in value is other than temporary, quoted market price is not the only deciding 
factor,  particularly  for  thinly  traded  securities,  large  block  holdings  and  restricted  shares.  We  consider,  but  such 
consideration is  not limited to, the  following  factors: (i) the trend of the quoted  market  price and trading volume; (ii) the 
investee's financial position and results for a period of years; (iii) any liquidity or going concern problems of the investee;
- 25 -
(iv) changes in or reorganization of the investee and/or its future business plan; (v) the outlook of the investee's industry; 
(vi) the  current  fair  value  of  the  investment  (based  upon  an  appraisal  thereof)  relative  to  its  carrying  value;  (vii) our 
business plan and strategy to divest the security or to restructure the investee; and (viii) the extent and/or duration of the 
decline in market value. 
 
Recent market volatility has made it extremely difficult to value certain securities. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors 
prevailing at such time,  may  result in significant changes in the  values of  these securities in  future periods. Any of these 
factors  could  require  us  to  recognize  further  impairments  in  the  value  of  our  securities  portfolio,  which  may  have  an 
adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. 
 
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
 
We assess at the end of each  reporting period  whether  there is any indication that an asset  may be impaired. If any  such 
indication exists, we shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. In assessing whether there is any indication that an 
asset may be impaired, we consider, as a minimum, the following indications: 
 
External sources of information 
 
(a)
during the period, an asset's market value has declined significantly more than would be expected as a result of the 
passage of time or normal use;
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the 
near  future,  in  the  technological,  market,  economic  or  legal  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  or  in  the 
market to which an asset is dedicated; 
 
market  interest  rates  or  other  market  rates  of  return  on  investments  have  increased  during  the  period,  and  those 
increases are likely to affect the discount rate  used in calculating an asset's  value in use  and decrease the asset's 
recoverable amount materially; 
 
the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalization;
(b)
(c)
(f)
(g)
(d) 
 
Internal sources of information 
 
(e)
evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset; 
 
significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or are expected to take 
place  in  the  near  future,  in  the  extent  to  which,  or  manner  in  which,  an  asset  is  used  or  is  expected  to  be  used. 
These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset 
belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset 
as finite rather than indefinite; and 
 
evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, 
worse than expected.
Provisions for Decommissioning Obligations 
 
Our  provisions  for  decommissioning  obligations  represent  management's  best  estimate  of  the  present  value  of  the  future 
cash  outflows  required  to  settle  the  liability  which  reflects  estimates  of  future  costs,  inflation,  movements  in  foreign 
exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows, and the applicable risk-free interest rates 
for discounting the future cash outflows. Changes in the above factors can result in a change to the provision recognized by 
us.
Changes  in  decommissioning  obligations  are  recorded  with  a  corresponding  change  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  related 
properties. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of related properties can result in a change to future depletion expense.

Income Taxes 
 
Management  believes  that  it  has  adequately  provided  for  income  taxes  based  on  all  of  the  information  that  is  currently 
available. The calculation of income taxes in many cases, however, requires significant judgment in interpreting tax rules 
and regulations, which are constantly changing. 
 
Our tax filings are also subject to audits, which could materially change the amount of current and future income tax assets 
and liabilities. Any change would be recorded as a charge or a credit to income tax expense. Any cash payment or receipt 
would be included in cash from operating activities. 
 
We currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carry-forwards and deductible temporary 
differences, both of which will reduce taxable income in the future. The amounts recorded for deferred tax are based upon 
various judgments, assumptions and estimates. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to 
determine  to  what  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary 
differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. We determine whether it is 
probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized, based on currently available information, including, 
but not limited to, the following:
•
•
•
•
the history of the tax loss carry-forwards and their expiry dates;
future reversals of temporary differences;
our projected earnings; and
tax planning opportunities.
On the reporting date, we also reassess unrecognized deferred tax assets. We recognize a previously unrecognized deferred 
tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  
 
We  provide  for  future  liabilities  in  respect  of  uncertain  tax  positions  where  additional  tax  may  become  payable  in  future 
periods  and  such  provisions  are  based  on  our  management's  assessment  of  exposures.  We  did  not  recognize  the  full 
deferred  tax  liability  on  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  joint  ventures  and 
associates  where  we are able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
temporary  differences  will  not  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future.  We  may  change  our  investment  decision  in  the  normal 
course of our business, thus resulting in additional tax liability. 
 
New Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted 
 
In  June  2011,  the  IASB  issued  an  amended  version  of  International  Accounting  Standard,  referred  to  as  "IAS",  19, 
Employee  Benefits,  which  brings  in  various  changes  relating  to  the  recognition  and  measurement  of  termination  benefits 
and  postemployment  defined  benefit  expense,  and  to  the  disclosures  for  all  employee  benefits.  The  amended  IAS  19  is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We early adopted this new standard with effect in the 
current year ending December 31, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of Compton. We did not have a defined benefit 
plan in 2011 or 2010. 
 
The  following  amendments  were  issued  by  the  IASB  and  are  mandatory  for  our  accounting  year  2012  and  do  not  have 
significant effects on our financial statements: 
 
Amendments, set out in Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, were issued to amend IAS 12, Income Taxes. IAS 12 
requires an entity to  measure  the deferred tax relating to an asset depending on  whether  the entity expects to recover the 
carrying  amount  of  the  asset  through  use  or  sale.  It  can  be  difficult  and  subjective  to  assess  whether  recovery  will  be 
through  use  or  through  sale  when  the  asset  is  measured  using  the  fair  value  model  in  IAS  40,  Investment  Property.  The 
amendments provide a practical solution to the problem by introducing a presumption that recovery of the carrying amount 
will, normally, be through sale.  
 
Amendments, set out in Disclosures — Transfers of Financial Assets, were issued to amend IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, 
so as to enhance the disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets that result in derecognition. These amendments 
respond, in part, to the recent financial crisis. Entities will be required to provide more extensive quantitative and qualita-
tive  disclosures  about:  (i)  risk  exposures  relating  to  transfers  of  financial  assets  that  are:  (a)  not  derecognized  in  their
- 27 -
entirety;  or  (b)  derecognized  in  their  entirety,  but  with  which  the  entity  continues  to  have  some  continuing  involvement; 
and (ii) the effect of those risks on an entity's financial position.
The  following  new  accounting  standards  and  amendments  are  expected  to  have  significant  effects  on  the  Group's 
accounting policies, financial position and/or financial statement presentation for periods after 2012: 
 
IFRS  9,  Financial  Instruments,  replaces  IAS,  39,  Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement.  IFRS  9  uses  a 
single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value. The approach in IFRS 9 
is  based  on  how  an  entity  manages  its  financial  instruments  (its  business  model)  and  the  contractual  cash  flow 
characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be used, replacing the 
many different impairment methods in IAS 39. Pursuant to IFRS 9, an entity choosing to measure a liability at fair value 
will present the portion of the change in its fair value due to changes in the entity's own credit risk in other comprehensive 
income, rather than in the profit or loss. New requirements for the derecognition of financial instruments, impairment and 
hedge  accounting  are  expected  to  be  added  to  IFRS  9.  In  December  2011,  the  IASB  issued  amendments  to  IFRS  9  that 
defer  the  mandatory  effective  date  from  January  1,  2013  to  January  1,  2015.  The  deferral  will  make  it  possible  for  all 
phases of the project to have the same mandatory effective date. The amendments also provide relief from the requirement 
to  restate  comparative  financial  statements  for  the  effect  of  applying  IFRS  9.  Additional  transition  disclosures  will  be 
required  to  help  investors  understand  the  effect  that  the  initial  application  of  IFRS  9  has  on  the  classification  and 
measurement  of  financial  instruments.  Early  application  of  IFRS  9  is  still  permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the 
impacts that IFRS 9 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
IFRS  10,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  establishes  principles  for  the  presentation  and  preparation  of  consolidated 
financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements, and Standard Interpretations Committee, referred to as "SIC", 12, and is effective for 
annual periods beginning on January 1, 2013.  
 
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements establishes principles for financial reporting by entities that have an interest in arrangements 
that  are  controlled  jointly  (i.e.  joint  arrangements).  IFRS  11  supersedes  IAS  31,  Interests  in  Joint  Ventures,  and  SIC-13, 
Jointly  Controlled  Entities  -  Non-Monetary  Contributions  by  Venturers,  and  is  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on 
January 1, 2013.  
 
IFRS  12,  Disclosure  of  Interests  in  Other  Entities,  applies  to  entities  that  have  an  interest  in  a  subsidiary,  a  joint 
arrangement,  an  associate  or  an  unconsolidated  structured  entity.  The  objective  of  this  IFRS  is  to  require  an  entity  to 
disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate: (a) the nature of, and risks associated with, its 
interests  in  other  entities;  and  (b)  the  effects  of  those  interests  on  its  financial  position,  financial  performance  and  cash 
flows. IFRS 12 is effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2013.  
 
IAS 27, Separate Financial Statements, has been amended for the issuance of IFRS 10 but retains the current guidance for 
separate  financial  statements.  IAS  28,  Investments  in  Associates  and  Joint  Ventures,  has  been  amended  for  conforming 
changes based on the issuance of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. The amendments to the IAS 27 and IAS 28 are effective for annual 
periods beginning on January 1, 2013.
We  do  not  expect  that  our  consolidated  entities  and  equity  method  investments,  associates  and  joint  ventures  will  be 
significantly  affected  when  IFRS  10,  11,  12  and  amendments  to  IFRS  27  and  28  become  effective,  though  the  new 
standards and amendments will have impact on our financial statement presentation.  
 
IFRS  13,  Fair  Value  Measurement,  (a)  defines  fair  value;  (b)  sets  out  in  a  single  IFRS  a  framework  for  measuring  fair 
value; and (c) requires disclosures about fair value measurements. IFRS 13 is to be applied for annual periods beginning on 
January 1, 2013. The new standard will have impact on our financial statement presentation. 
 
Amendments, set out in Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income¸ were issued to amend IAS 1, Presentation 
of  Financial  Statements.  The  amendments  require  the  grouping  of  items  of  other  comprehensive  income  into  items  that 
might  be  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in  subsequent  periods  and  items  that  will  not  be  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in 
subsequent periods. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2013 with full retrospective 
application. The amendments will have impact on our financial statement presentation.
- 28 -
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on 
our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity,  capital 
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
We have outstanding issued guarantees held by our trading and financial partners in connection with our commodities and 
resources activities.  As of December 31, 2012, we had issued guarantees of up to a maximum of $13.0 million, of which 
$5.2 million were outstanding and have not been recorded as liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
There has been no claim against the guarantees.  
 
Transactions with Related Parties 
 
Other  than  as  disclosed  herein,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  since  January  1,  2012,  there  have  been  no  material 
transactions  or  loans  between  our  company  and:  (a) enterprises  that  directly  or  indirectly  through  one  or  more 
intermediaries control or are controlled by, or are under common control with, our company; (b) associates; (c) individuals 
owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of our company that gives them significant influence over our 
company,  and  close  members  of  any  such  individual's  family;  (d) key  management  personnel  of  our  company,  including 
directors  and  senior  management  of  our  company  and  close  members  of  such  individuals'  families;  and  (e) enterprises  in 
which a substantial interest in the voting power is owned, directly or indirectly, by any person described in (c) or (d) or over 
which such a person is able to exercise significant influence. 
 
In the  normal course of operations,  we enter into transactions  with related parties  which  include, among others, affiliates 
whereby we have a significant equity interest (10% or more) in the affiliates or have the ability to influence the affiliates' or 
our  operating  and  financing  policies  through  significant  shareholding,  representation  on  the  board  of  directors,  corporate 
charter  and/or  bylaws.  The  affiliates  also  include  certain  of  our  directors,  our  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief 
Financial  Officer,  Chief  Operating  Officer  and  their  close  family  members.  These  related  party  transactions  are  made  in 
arm’s length transactions at normal market prices and on normal commercial terms. In addition to transactions disclosed in 
our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 and herein, we had the following transactions with affiliates 
during the year ended December 31, 2012:

In 2012, we entered into an agreement with a director of two of our subsidiaries, whereby the director agreed to purchase 
100% of the shares of our subsidiary for a nominal amount. Such subsidiary did not have significant assets or business at 
the time of disposition. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2012, such director acquired another subsidiary from 
us. Please refer to Notes 18 and 36 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 
for further information.  
 
Financial and Other Instruments  
 
We are exposed to various market risks from changes in interest rates, foreign currency  exchange rates and equity prices 
which  may  affect  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  and,  consequently,  our  fair  value.  Generally,  our 
management believes that our current  financial assets and financial liabilities, due to their short-term  nature, do  not pose 
significant  financial  risks.  We  use  various  financial  instruments  to  manage  our  exposure  to  various  financial  risks.  The 
policies for controlling the risks associated with financial instruments include, but are not limited to, standardized company 
procedures  and  policies  on  matters  such  as  hedging  of  risk  exposures,  avoidance  of  undue  concentration  of  risk  and 
requirements for collateral (including letters of credit) to mitigate credit risk. We have risk managers to perform audits and 
checking functions to ensure that company procedures and policies are complied with. 
 
We  use  derivative  instruments  to  manage  certain  exposures  to  currency  exchange  rate  risks.  The  use  of  derivative 
instruments  depends  on  our  management's  perception  of  future  economic  events  and  developments.  These  types  of
- 29 -
derivative instruments are generally  highly  speculative in nature. They are also very  volatile as they are highly leveraged 
given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts. 
 
Many of our strategies, including the use of derivative instruments and the types of derivative instruments selected by us, 
are  based  on  historical  trading  patterns  and  correlations  and  our  management's  expectations  of  future  events.  However, 
these  strategies  may  not  be  fully  effective  in  all  market  environments  or  against  all  types  of  risks.  Unexpected  market 
developments  may  affect  our  risk  management  strategies  during  this  time,  and  unanticipated  developments  could  impact 
our risk management strategies in the future. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective, 
we may incur losses. 
 
Please refer to Note 39 of our annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 
2010 for a qualitative and quantitative discussion of our exposure to market risks and the sensitivity analysis of interest rate, 
currency and other price risks at December 31, 2012. 
 
Outstanding Share Data 
 
Our  share  capital  consists  of  an  unlimited  number  of  common  shares,  class  A  common  shares,  and  class  A  preference 
shares, issuable in series. Our common shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "MIL". As of March 28, 2013, we 
had 62,552,126 common shares 2,635,000 stock options and no share purchase warrants issued and outstanding.  
 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required 
to  be  disclosed  in  our  company's  reports  filed  or  submitted  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is  recorded, 
processed,  summarized  and  reported,  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC's  rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls 
and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be 
disclosed in our company's reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including our company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely 
decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
As  required  by  Rule 13a-15  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  we  have  carried  out  an  evaluation  of  the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period 
covered  by  our  annual  report  on  Form  20-F,  being  December 31,  2012.  This  evaluation  was  carried  out  by  our  Chief 
Executive Officer (being our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (being our principal financial officer). 
Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  our  company's 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
 
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in 
Rule 13a-15(f)  or  13d-15(f)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  Our  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Our internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1.  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets and our consolidated entities;
2.  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  the 
consolidated financial  statements  in accordance  with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of our company 
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and
3.  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
As  described  herein,  in  2012,  we  acquired  100%  of  Compton  and  controlling  interests  in  each  of  ACCR,  Possehl  and 
KCCL.  The  businesses  acquired  pursuant  to  such  acquisitions  have  been  excluded  from  management's  report  on  internal 
control over financial reporting as there was not sufficient time to complete an assessment of the internal controls of such
- 30 -
businesses between the date of the acquisition and the date of management's assessment of internal controls. The combined 
financial statements of these entities represent 50% of our total assets, 42% of our net assets, 11% of our net revenues and 
3% of our net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. 
 
Management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the 
effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December 31,  2012.  In  conducting  this  evaluation, 
management  used  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission 
(COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.  
 
Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that,  as  of  December 31,  2012,  our  company's  internal  control  over 
financial reporting was effective. 
 
The effectiveness of our company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by 
our independent registered chartered accountants, Deloitte LLP, who also audited our consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended December 31, 2012. Deloitte LLP have expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Their report is included in our annual report on Form 20-F for the 
year ended December 31, 2012.  
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
We  maintain  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  which  have  been  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  of  the 
reliability of external financial reporting in accordance with IFRS as required by National Instrument 52-109 – Certification 
of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings. 
 
Other than as disclosed above in connection with the 2012 acquisitions, there were no changes in our internal control over 
financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that 
involves  human  diligence  and  compliance  and  is  subject  to  lapses  in  judgment  and  breakdowns  resulting  from  human 
failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. 
Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
by  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  However,  these  inherent  limitations  are  known  features  of  the  financial 
reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 
Legal Proceedings 
 
We are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business and are named from time to time as a defendant in  various 
legal  actions  arising  in  connection  with  our  activities,  certain  of  which  may  include  large  claims  for  punitive  damages. 
Further, due to the size, complexity and nature of our operations, various legal and tax matters are outstanding from time to 
time, including a currently ongoing audit by the Canadian taxation authority of our domestic and international transactions 
covering the 2006 to 2010 taxation  years.  Currently, based upon information available to us,  we do not believe any such 
matters  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  upon  our  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  However,  due  to  the 
inherent uncertainty of litigation, we cannot provide certainty as to their outcome. If our current assessments are materially 
incorrect  or  if  we  are  unable  to  resolve  any  of  these  matters  favorably,  there  may  be  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our 
financial performance, cash flows or results of operations.  
Risk Factors 
 
Statements  in  this  report  that  are  not  reported  financial  results  or  other  historical  information  are  "forward-looking 
statements" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995, as amended. These statements appear in a  number of different places in this report and can be identified by  words 
such  as  "anticipate",  "could",  "project",  "should",  "expect",  "seek",  "may",  "intend",  "likely",  "will",  "plan",  "estimate", 
"believe" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook or their negative or other 
comparable words. Also discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties Share this "forward-looking" character.  
 
Forward-looking statements include statements regarding:
- 31 -
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
future growth;
futures results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities;
our markets;
production,  demand  and  prices  for  products  and  services,  including  iron  ore,  hydrocarbons  and  other 
commodities;
capital expenditures;
the economy;
foreign exchange rates; and
derivatives.
You  are  cautioned  that  any  forward-looking  statements  are  not  guarantees  and  may  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Our 
actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements due to risks facing us or due to actual facts 
differing  from  the  assumptions  underlying  our  estimates.  Some  of  these  risks  and  assumptions  include  those  set  forth  in 
reports and other documents we have filed or furnished with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators including in our 
annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2012. We advise you that these cautionary remarks expressly 
qualify in their entirety all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. Unless required by 
law, we do not assume any obligations to update forward-looking statements based on unanticipated events or changes to 
expectations.  However,  you  should  carefully  review  the  reports  and  other  documents  we  file  from  time  to  time  with  the 
SEC and Canadian securities regulators. 
 
In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2012 
filed  with  the  SEC  and  Canadian  securities  regulators,  you  should  also  carefully  consider  the  following  risks  and 
uncertainties in evaluating our company and our business before making any investment decisions. Our business, operating 
and financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks. 
 
Risk Factors Relating to Our Business  
 
Our financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period.  
 
We expect our business to experience significant periodic variations in its revenues and results of operations in the future. 
These  variations  may  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  fact  that  our  merchant  banking  revenues  are  often  earned  upon  the 
successful  completion  of  a  transaction,  the  timing  of  which  is  uncertain  and  beyond  our  control.  In  many  cases,  we  may 
receive little or no payment for engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. Additionally, 
through  our  merchant  banking  business,  we  seek  to  acquire  undervalued  assets  where  we  can  use  our  experience  and 
management to realize upon the value. Often, we will hold or build upon these assets over time, and we cannot predict the 
timing of when these assets' values may be realized. As a result, we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings, 
which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  
 
Our earnings and, therefore, our profitability may be affected by commodities price volatility.  
 
The  majority  of  our  revenue  from  our  global  commodity  supply  chain  business  is  derived  from  the  sale  of  commodities, 
including  metals, hydrocarbons, plastics and other  materials. As a result, our earnings are directly related to the prices of 
these commodities. In addition, our revenues from our iron ore and natural gas interests are directly connected to the prices 
of such commodities. There are many factors influencing the price of metals, hydrocarbons, plastics and other commodities, 
including:  expectations  for  inflation;  global  and  regional  demand  and  production;  political  and  economic  conditions;  and 
production  costs  in  major  producing  regions.  These  factors  are  beyond  our  control  and  are  impossible  for  us  to  predict. 
Changes in the prices of iron ore, hydrocarbons, plastics, metals and other commodities may adversely affect our operating 
results.

A weak global economy can adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our 
liquidity and capital resources.  
 
Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings, and it  may be  materially affected by conditions in the 
global financial markets and economic conditions generally.  
 
Global  prices  for  our  commodities  are  influenced  strongly  by  international  demand  and  global  economic  conditions. 
Uncertainties  or  weaknesses  in  global  economic  conditions,  including  the  ongoing  sovereign  debt  crisis  in  Europe,  could 
adversely  affect  our  business  and  negatively  impact  our  financial  results.  In  addition,  the  current  level  of  international 
demand for certain of our commodities, including iron ore, used in steel production is driven largely by industrial growth in 
China. If the economic growth rate in China slows for an extended period of time, or if another global economic downturn 
were to occur,  we  would likely see decreased demand for such products and decreased prices, resulting in lower revenue 
levels and decreasing margins. We are not able to predict whether the global economic conditions will continue or worsen 
and the impact it may have on our operations and the industry in general going forward. 
 
Market  deterioration  and  weakness  can  result  in  a  material  decline  in  the  number  and  size  of  the  transactions  that  we 
execute for our own account and for our clients and to a corresponding decline in our revenues. Any market weakness can 
further result in losses to the extent that we own assets in such market. 
 
The global commodity supply chain and merchant banking businesses are highly competitive. 
 
All aspects of the global commodity supply chain and merchant banking businesses are highly competitive, and we expect 
them to remain so.  
 
Our competitors include  merchant and investment banks, brokerage firms, commercial banks, private equity  firms, hedge 
funds,  financial  advisory  firms  and  natural  resource  and  mineral  royalty  companies.  Many  of  our  competitors  have 
substantially  greater  capital  and  resources,  including  access  to  commodities  supply,  than  we  do.  We  believe  that  the 
principal  factors  affecting  competition  in  our  business  include  transaction  execution,  our  products  and  services,  client 
relationships, reputation, innovations, credit worthiness and price. We have experienced price competition in some of our 
trading business. 
 
The  scale  of  our  competitors  has  increased  in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  substantial  consolidation.  These  firms  have  the 
ability to offer a  wider range  of products than  we do,  which  may enhance their competitive position. They also  have the 
ability to support their business with other financial services such as commercial lending in an effort to gain market share, 
which has resulted, and could further result, in pricing pressure in our businesses. 
 
If  we  are  unable  to  compete  effectively  with  our  competitors,  our  business  and  results  of  operations  will  be  adversely 
affected.  
 
The operation of the iron ore mine underlying our royalty interest is generally determined by a third party operator, and 
we have no decision making power as to how the property is operated. In addition, we have no or very limited access to 
technical  or  geological  data  respecting  the  mine,  including  as  to  reserves.  The  operator's  failure  to  perform  or  other 
operating  decisions  made  by  the  operator,  including  scaling  back  or  ceasing  operations,  could  have  a  material  adverse 
effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
The  commodities  and  resources  segment  of  our  business  includes  our  indirect  royalty  interest  in  the  iron  ore  mine.  The 
revenue  derived  from  the  interest  is  based  on  production  generated  by  the  mine's  third  party  operator.  The  operator 
generally has the power to determine the manner in which the iron ore is exploited, including decisions to expand, continue 
or reduce production from the mine, and decisions about the marketing of products extracted from the mine. The interests 
of the third party operator and our interests may not always be aligned. As an example, it will, in almost all cases, be in our 
interest  to  advance  production  as  rapidly  as  possible  in  order  to  maximize  near-term  cash  flow,  while  the  third  party 
operator  may,  in  many  cases,  take  a  more  cautious  approach  to  development,  as  it  is  at  risk  with  respect  to  the  cost  of 
development and operations. Our inability to control the operations of the mine can adversely affect our profitability, results 
of operations and financial condition. Similar adverse effects may result from any other interests we may acquire that are 
primarily operated by a third party operator. 
 
To the extent that we retain our current indirect royalty interest, we will be dependent to a large extent upon the financial 
viability and operational effectiveness of owners and operators of our interests. Payments from production generally flow
- 33 -
through  the  operator  and  there  is  a  risk  of  delay  and  additional  expense  in  receiving  such  revenues.  Payments  may  be 
delayed by restrictions imposed by lenders, delays in the sale or delivery of products, accidents, the recovery by operators 
of expenses incurred in the operation of any royalty properties, the establishment by operators of reserves for such expenses 
or the insolvency of an operator. Our rights to payment under the royalties will likely have to be enforced by contract. This 
may inhibit our ability to collect outstanding royalties upon a default. Failure to receive any payments from the owners and 
operators of mines in  which we have or may acquire a royalty interest may result in a material and adverse effect on our 
profitability, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
To the extent grantors of royalties and other interests do not abide by their contractual obligations, we may be forced to take 
legal action to enforce our contractual rights. Such litigation may be time consuming and costly, and, as with all litigation, 
there  is  no  guarantee  of  success.  Should  any  such  decision  be  determined  adversely  to  us,  such  decision  may  have  a 
material and adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In  addition,  we  have  no  or  very  limited  access  to  technical,  geological  data  relating  to  the  mine,  including  data  as  to 
reserves,  nor  have  we  received  a  NI  43-101  compliant  technical  report  in  respect  of  the  mine.  As  such,  we  cannot 
independently  determine  reserve  amounts  or  the  estimated  life  of  the  mine  and  are  instead  wholly  dependent  on  the 
determination of the reserves by the operator of the mine. We can provide no assurances as to the level of reserves at the 
mine. If the operator of the mine determines there are insufficient reserves to economically operate the mine, it may scale 
back or cease operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and financial 
condition. 
 
The profitability of our global commodity supply chain operations depends, in part, on the availability of adequate sources 
of supply.  
 
Our  global  commodity  supply  chain  business  relies  on,  among  other  things,  numerous  outside  sources  of  supply  for  our 
operations.  These  suppliers  generally  are  not  bound  by  long-term  contracts  and  will  have  no  obligation  to  provide 
commodities  to  us  in  the  future.  In  periods  of  low  industry  prices,  suppliers  may  elect  to  hold  commodities  to  wait  for 
higher prices or intentionally slow their activities. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling commodities to us, we 
will  be  unable  to  source  and/or  execute  commodities  transactions  at  desired  levels  and  our  results  of  operations  and 
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  
 
We  may  face  a  lack  of  suitable  acquisition  or  merger  or  other  proprietary  investment  candidates,  which  may  limit  our 
growth. 
 
In order to grow our business, we may seek to acquire, merge with or invest in new companies or opportunities. Our failure 
to  make acquisitions or investments  may limit our  growth. In pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities,  we  face 
competition from other companies having similar growth and investment strategies, many of which may have substantially 
greater resources than us. Competition for these acquisitions or investment targets could result in increased acquisition or 
investment  prices,  higher  risks  and  a  diminished  pool  of  businesses,  services  or  products  available  for  acquisition  or 
investment. 
 
Strategic investments or acquisitions and joint ventures, or our entry into new business areas, may result in additional risks 
and uncertainties in our business.  
 
We  have  grown  and  intend  to  continue  to  grow  our  business  both  through  internal  expansion  and  through  strategic 
investments, acquisitions or joint ventures. When we make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, 
we  expect  to  face  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties  in  combining  or  integrating  the  relevant  businesses  and  systems, 
including  the  need  to  combine  accounting  and  data  processing  systems  and  management  controls  and  to  integrate 
relationships with customers and business partners. 
 
Acquisitions  also  frequently  result  in  recording  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets,  which  are  subject  to  potential 
impairments  in  the  future  that  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  operating  results.  Furthermore,  the  costs  of 
integrating  acquired  businesses  (including  restructuring  charges  associated  with  the  acquisitions,  as  well  as  other 
acquisition costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees and investment banking fees) could significantly impact our operating 
results. 
 
Although  we  perform  due  diligence  on  the  businesses  we  purchase,  in  light  of  the  circumstances  of  each  transaction,  an 
unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. We may not be able to ascertain the
- 34 -
value  or  understand  the  potential  liabilities  of  the  acquired  businesses  and  their  operations  until  we  assume  operating 
control of the assets and operations of these businesses. 
 
Furthermore,  any  acquisitions  of  businesses  or  facilities,  including  our  recent  acquisition  of  Compton,  could  entail  a 
number of risks, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
problems with the effective integration of operations;
inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;
increased operating costs;
exposure to substantial unanticipated liabilities;
difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings;
the risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and
the  possibility  that  we  may  be  unable  to  recruit  additional  managers  with  the  necessary  skills  to  supplement  the 
management of the acquired businesses.
In  addition,  geographic  and  other  expansions,  acquisitions  or  joint  ventures  may  require  significant  managerial  attention, 
which may be diverted from our other operations. If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, our business, financial 
condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  
 
The industries in which we operate may be affected by disruptions beyond our control. 
 
Our global commodity supply chain operations include direct or indirect investments in assets, such as smelting, refining, 
mining, processing and hydrocarbon operations. Transport disruption, weather and natural disasters such as hurricanes and 
flooding,  unexpected  maintenance  problems,  collapse  or  damage  to  mines  or  wells,  unexpected  geological  variations, 
labour disruptions and changes in laws and regulations relating to occupational safety, health and environmental matters are 
some of the factors that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These factors can affect costs 
at particular assets for varying periods. In addition, smelting, refining, mining, processing and hydrocarbon operations also 
rely  on  key  inputs,  such  as  labour,  spare parts,  fuel  and  electricity.  Disruption  to  the  supply  of  key  inputs,  or  changes  in 
their pricing, may have a significant adverse impact on our future results.  
 
Our  commodities  activities  are  subject  to  counterparty  risks  associated  with  performance  of  obligations  by  our 
counterparties and suppliers. 
 
Our  business  is  subject  to  commercial  risks,  which  include  counterparty  risk,  such  as  failure  of  performance  by 
commodities  suppliers  and  failure  of  payment  by  our  trading  customers.  We  seek  to  reduce  the  risk  of  supplier  non-
performance by requiring credit support from creditworthy financial institutions  where appropriate. We attempt to reduce 
the  risk  of  non-payment  by  purchasers  of  commodities  by  imposing  limits  on  open  accounts  extended  to  creditworthy 
customers  and  imposing  credit  support  requirements  for  other  customers.  Nevertheless,  we  are  exposed  to  the  risk  that 
parties owing us or our clients and other financial intermediaries may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, 
lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. These counterparty obligations may arise, for example, from placing 
deposits, the extension of credit in trading and investment activities and participation in payment, securities and commodity 
trading  transactions  on  our  behalf  and  as  an  agent  on  behalf  of  our  clients.  If  any  of  these  parties  default  on  their 
obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected. 
 
Larger and more frequent capital commitments in our global commodity supply chain business increase the potential for 
significant losses.  
 
We may enter into large transactions in  which  we commit  our own capital as part of our global commodity supply chain 
business  to  facilitate  client  trading  activities.  The  number  and  size  of  these  large  transactions  may  materially  affect  our 
results of operations in a given period. Market fluctuations may also cause us to incur significant losses from our trading 
activities.  To  the  extent  that  we  own  assets  (i.e.,  have  long  positions),  a  downturn  in  the  value  of  those  assets  or  in  the 
markets in which those assets are traded could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent that we have sold assets we do not 
own  (i.e.,  have  short  positions)  in  any  of  those  markets,  an  upturn  in  those  markets  could  expose  us  to  potentially  large 
losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market.
- 35 -
We are subject to transaction risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial 
condition and cash flow. 
 
We manage transaction risks through allocating and monitoring our capital investments in circumstances where the risk to 
our  capital  is  minimal,  carefully  screening  clients  and  transactions,  and  engaging  qualified  personnel  to  manage 
transactions.  Nevertheless,  transaction  risks  can  arise  from,  among  other  things,  our  trading  and  merchant  banking 
activities. These risks include market and credit risks associated with our merchant banking operations. We intend to make 
investments in highly unstructured situations and in companies undergoing severe financial distress. Such investments often 
involve  severe  time  constraints.  These  investments  may  expose  us  to  significant  transaction  risks.  An  unsuccessful 
investment may result in the total loss of such an investment and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results 
of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
 
Our  risk  management  strategies  leave  us  exposed  to  unidentified  or  unanticipated  risks  that  could  impact  our  risk 
management strategies in the future and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
We use a variety of instruments and strategies to manage exposure to various types of risks. For example, we use derivative 
foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure and our clients' exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. If any 
of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we 
may incur losses. Many of our strategies are based on historical trading patterns and correlations. However, these strategies 
may  not  be  fully  effective  in  mitigating  our  risk  exposure  in  all  market  environments  or  against  all  types  of  risk. 
Unexpected  market  developments  may  affect  our  risk  management  strategies  during  this  time,  and  unanticipated 
developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future.  
 
Derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses.  
 
We,  from  time  to  time,  enter  into  derivative  transactions  that  require  us  to  deliver  to  the  counterparty  the  underlying 
security,  loan  or  other  obligation  in  order  to  receive  payment.  In  a  number  of  cases,  we  may  not  hold  the  underlying 
security, loan or other obligation and may have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the underlying security, loan or 
other obligation through the physical settlement of other transactions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we may not 
be able to obtain the security, loan or other obligation within the required contractual time frame for delivery. This could 
cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and 
operational risk as well as increased costs to us.  
 
Fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  may  affect  our  results  of  operations  and  financial 
condition. 
 
Fluctuation in interest rates may affect the fair value of our financial instruments sensitive to interest rates. An increase or 
decrease  in  market  interest  rates  may  result  in  changes  to  the  fair  value  of  our  fixed  interest  rate  financial  instrument 
liabilities,  thereby  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  the  fair  value  of  our  equity.  Similarly,  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency 
exchange rates may affect the fair value of our financial instruments sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
Our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail.  
 
Our  business  is  highly  dependent  on  our  ability  to  process,  on  a  daily  basis,  a  number  of  transactions  across  diverse 
markets, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. The inability of our systems to accommodate 
an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. If any of these systems do 
not  operate  properly  or  are  disabled,  or  if  there  are  other  shortcomings  or  failures  in  our  internal  processes,  people  or 
systems,  we  could  suffer  impairments,  financial  loss,  a  disruption  of  our  businesses,  liability  to  clients,  regulatory 
intervention or reputational damage.  
 
The  exploration and development  of  mining and  resource  properties  is  inherently  dangerous  and  subject  to  risks  beyond 
our control. 
 
Companies engaged in resource activities are subject to all of the hazards and risks inherent in exploring for and developing 
natural  resource  projects.  These  risks  and  uncertainties  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  environmental  hazards,  industrial 
accidents, labour disputes, increases in the cost of labour, social unrest, fires, changes in the regulatory environment, impact 
of  non-compliance  with  laws  and  regulations,  explosions,  encountering  unusual  or  unexpected  geological  formations  or 
other  geological  or  grade  problems,  unanticipated  metallurgical  characteristics  or  less  than  expected  mineral  recovery,
- 36 -
encountering  unanticipated  ground  or  water  conditions,  cave-ins,  pit  wall  failures,  flooding,  rock  bursts,  periodic 
interruptions  due  to  inclement  or  hazardous  weather  conditions,  earthquakes,  seismic  activity,  other  natural  disasters  or 
unfavourable  operating  conditions  and  losses.  Should  any  of  these  risks  or  hazards  affect  a  company's  exploration  or 
development  activities,  it  may:  (i)  cause  the  cost  of  development  or  production  to  increase  to  a  point  where  it  would  no 
longer be economic to produce the metal or other resource from the company's resources or expected reserves; (ii) result in 
a  write  down  or  write-off  of  the  carrying  value  of  one  or  more  projects;  (iii)  cause  delays  or  stoppage  of  mining  or 
processing; (iv) result in the destruction of properties, processing facilities or third party facilities necessary for operations; 
(v) cause personal injury or death and related legal liability; or (vi) result in the loss of insurance coverage. The occurrence 
of any of above  mentioned risks or hazards could result in an interruption or suspension of operation of the properties in 
which  we  hold an interest or any other properties  we acquire in the future and have a  material and adverse effect on  our 
results of operations and financial condition.
Our natural gas and related operations are subject to inherent risks and hazards. 
 
There are many operating risks and hazards inherent in exploring for, producing, processing, and transporting natural gas 
and  oil.  Drilling  operations  may  encounter  unexpected  formations  or  pressures  that  could  cause  damage  to  equipment  or 
personal  injury  and  fires,  explosions,  blowouts,  spills,  or  other  accidents  may  occur.  Additionally,  we  could  experience 
interruptions  to,  or  the  termination  of,  drilling,  production,  processing,  and  transportation  activities  due  to  bad  weather, 
natural disasters, delays in obtaining governmental approvals or consents, insufficient storage or transportation capacity, or 
other geological and mechanical conditions. Any of these events that result in a shutdown or slowdown of operations will 
adversely  affect  our  business.  While  close  well  supervision  and  effective  maintenance  operations  can  contribute  to 
maximizing production rates  over time, production delays  and declines  from normal  field operating conditions cannot be 
eliminated and can be expected to adversely affect revenue and cash flow levels to varying degrees.
Drilling  activities,  including  completions,  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  no  commercially  productive  reservoirs  will  be 
encountered and we will not recover all or any portion of our investment. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating 
wells  is  often  uncertain  due  to  drilling  in  unknown  formations,  the  costs  associated  with  encountering  various  drilling 
conditions, such as over pressured zones, and changes in drilling plans and locations as a result of prior exploratory wells or 
additional seismic data and interpretations thereof.  
 
Mineral resource calculations are only estimates. 
 
Any figures presented for mineral resources in this document are only estimates. There are numerous uncertainties inherent 
in estimating mineral resources. Such estimates are subjective, and the accuracy of mineral resource estimation is a function 
of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological 
interpretation. These amounts are estimates only, and the actual level of recovery of  minerals from such deposits  may be 
different. Differences between our assumptions, including economic assumptions such as mineral prices, market conditions 
and  actual  events,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  mineral  reserve  and  mineral  resource  estimates,  financial 
position  and  results  of  operation.  No  assurance  can  be  given  that  any  mineral  resource  estimates  will  be  ultimately 
reclassified as reserves. 
 
Estimates of natural gas and oil reserves involve uncertainty. 
 
Estimates  of  natural  gas  and  oil  reserves  involve  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  because  they  depend  upon  the  reliability  of 
available  geologic  and  engineering  data,  which  is  inherently  imprecise.  Geologic  and  engineering  data  are  used  to 
determine  the  probability  that  an  oil  and  gas  reservoir  exists  at  a  particular  location  and  whether  hydrocarbons  are 
recoverable from the reservoir. The probability of the existence and recoverability of reserves is less than 100% and actual 
recoveries may be materially different from estimates.
Such estimates require numerous assumptions relating to operating conditions and economic factors, including the prices of 
such commodities, availability of investment capital, recovery costs, the availability of enhanced recovery techniques, the 
ability to market production, and governmental and other regulatory factors, such as taxes, royalty rates, and environmental 
laws. A change in one or more of these factors could result in known quantities of natural gas and oil previously estimated 
becoming unrecoverable. Each of these factors also impacts recovery costs and production rates. In addition, estimates of 
reserves  that  are  prepared  by  different  independent  engineers,  or  by  the  same  engineers  at  different  times,  may  vary 
substantially.
- 37 -
If  we  are  unsuccessful  in  acquiring  or  finding  additional  reserves,  our  future  natural  gas,  natural  gas  liquid  and  oil 
production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. 
 
The  rate  of  production  from  our  natural  gas  and  oil  properties  generally  declines  as  reserves  are  depleted.  Except  to  the 
extent  we  acquire  interests  in  additional  properties  containing  proved  reserves,  conduct  successful  exploration  and 
development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional reserves, our 
proved reserves will decline materially as natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil are produced. Accordingly, to the extent 
we are not successful in replacing such production, our future revenues may decline. 
 
Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including:
•
•
•
•
•
obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas;
drilling success;
the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget;
the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs; and
the ability to fund such activity.
Our  global  commodity  supply  chain  operations  are  subject  to  environmental  laws  and  regulations  that  may  increase the 
costs of doing business and may restrict such operations. 
 
All  phases  of  a  resource  business  present  environmental  risks  and  hazards  and  are  subject  to  environmental  regulation 
pursuant to a variety of government laws and regulations. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance 
of  air  and  water  quality  standards  and  land  reclamation.  They  also  set  forth  limitations  on  the  generation,  transportation, 
storage  and  disposal  of  solid  and  hazardous  waste.  Compliance  with  such  laws  and  regulations  can  require  significant 
expenditures,  and  a  breach  may  result  in  the  imposition  of  fines  and  penalties,  which  may  be  material.  Environmental 
legislation  is  evolving  in  a  manner  expected  to  result  in  stricter  standards  and  enforcement,  larger  fines  and  liability  and 
potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Any breach of environmental legislation by the operator of 
properties  underlying  our  interests  or  by  us,  as  an  owner  or  operator  of  a  property,  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the 
viability  of  the  relevant  property  and  impair  the  revenue  derived  from  the  owned  property  or  applicable  royalty  or  other 
interest,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Further, 
environmental hazards may exist on the properties on which we hold interests, which are unknown to us at present and have 
been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties.  
 
Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  permitting  requirements  may  result  in  enforcement  actions 
thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed and may 
include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Parties 
engaged  in  resource  operations  or  in  the  exploration  or  development  of  resource  properties  may  also  be  required  to 
compensate  those  suffering  loss  or  damage  by  reason  of  the  mining  activities  and  may  have  civil  or  criminal  fines  or 
penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. 
 
We are not fully  insured against certain environmental risks, either because  such insurance is not available or because of 
high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to 
sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, our properties may be 
subject  to  liability  due  to  hazards  that  cannot  be  insured  against  or  that  have  not  been  insured  against  due  to  prohibitive 
premium costs or for other reasons. 
 
Future environmental and reclamation obligations respecting our resource properties and interests may be material. 
 
We  have  not  established  a  separate  reclamation  fund  for  the  purpose  of  funding  estimated  future  environmental  and 
reclamation obligations. Any site reclamation or abandonment costs incurred in the ordinary course in a specific period will 
be funded out of cash flow from operations. It is not possible for us to predict our ability to fully fund the cost of all of our 
future environmental, abandonment and reclamation obligations. We expect to incur site restoration costs over a prolonged 
period  as  wells  reach  the  end  of  their  economic  life.    There  are  significant  uncertainties  related  to  decommissioning 
obligations, and the impact on the financial statements could be material. The eventual timing of and costs for these asset 
retirement obligations could differ from current estimates. The main factors that can cause expected cash flows to change 
are:
- 38 -
•
•
•
•
changes to laws and legislation;
construction of new facilities;
change  in  the  reserve  estimate  and  the  resulting  amendment  to  the  life  of  the  reserves  for  our  hydrocarbon 
operations; and
changes in technology.
We  or  the  operators  of  our  current  and  any  future  resource  interests  may  not  be  able  to  secure  required  permits  and 
licenses. 
 
Operations underlying our resource interests may require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There 
can be no assurance that we or the operator of any given project will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits 
that may be required to carry out exploration, development or other resource operations.  
 
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  obtain  adequate  financing  in  the  future  or  that  the  terms  of  such 
financing will be favourable, and, as a result, we may have to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional 
equity, which will result in dilution to our shareholders. 
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing 
will be favourable. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of  further 
business  activities.  We  may  require  new  capital  to  grow  our  business,  and  there  are  no  assurances  that  capital  will  be 
available when needed, if at all. It is likely such additional capital will be raised through the issuance of additional equity, 
which would result in dilution to our shareholders.  
 
Limitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses.  
 
Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to companies engaged in commodities trading and financing and merchant 
banking.  Failures  of  financial  firms  have  often  been  attributable  in  large  part  to  insufficient  liquidity.  Liquidity  is  of 
particular importance to our commodities and resources business, and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients' and 
counterparties' willingness to engage in transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we 
may  be  unable  to  control,  such  as  a  general  market  disruption  or  an  operational  problem  that  affects  our  clients, 
counterparties, our lenders or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking 
to sell similar assets at the same time.  
 
We may substantially increase our debt in the future. 
 
We  expect  that  it  may  be  necessary  for  us  to  obtain  financing  with  a  bank  or  financial  institution  to  provide  funds  for 
working  capital,  capital  purchases,  potential  acquisitions  and  business  development.  However,  because  of  our  cash  flow 
position,  we do not expect that  we  will  have any  immediate need to obtain additional financing. Interest costs associated 
with  any  debt  financing  may  adversely  affect  our  profitability.  Further,  the  terms  on  which  amounts  may  be  borrowed  – 
including  standard  financial  covenants  regarding  the  maintenance  of  financial  ratios,  the  prohibition  against  engaging  in 
major corporate transactions or reorganizations and the payment of dividends – may impose additional constraints on our 
business operations and our financial strength. 
 
As a result of our global operations, we are exposed to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could 
adversely affect our business, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
 
In conducting our business in major markets around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and 
other  risks  that  are  inherent  in  operating  in  other  countries.  These  risks  range  from  difficulties  in  settling  transactions  in 
emerging markets to possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions, and 
terrorism. We also face the risk that exchange controls or similar restrictions imposed by foreign governmental authorities 
may  restrict  our  ability  to  convert  local  currency  received  or  held  by  us  in  their  countries  into  Swiss  francs,  Canadian 
dollars, Euros or other hard currencies, or to take those other currencies out of those countries. If any of these risks become 
a reality, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be negatively impacted.

We are exposed to litigation risks in our business that are often difficult to assess or quantify. We anticipate that we will 
incur significant legal expenses every year in defending against litigation. 
 
We are exposed to legal risks in our business, and the volume and amount of damages claimed in litigation against financial 
intermediaries  are  increasing.  These  risks  include  potential  liability  under  securities  or  other  laws  for  materially  false  or 
misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions, potential liability for advice we provide to 
participants in corporate transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements. We also 
face the possibility that counterparties in complex or risky trading transactions will claim that we improperly failed to tell 
them of the risks involved or that they were not authorized or permitted to enter into such transactions with us and that their 
obligations to us are not enforceable. During a prolonged market downturn, we expect these types of claims to increase. We 
are also exposed to legal risks in our merchant banking activities.  
 
We  seek  to  invest  in  undervalued  businesses  or  assets  often  as  a  result  of  financial,  legal,  regulatory  or  other  distress 
affecting  them.  Investing  in  distressed  businesses  and  assets  can  involve  us  in  complex  legal  issues  relating  to  priorities, 
claims  and  other  rights  of  stakeholders.  These  risks  are  often  difficult  to  assess  or  quantify,  and  their  existence  and 
magnitude  often  remains  unknown  for  substantial  periods  of  time.  We  may  incur  significant  legal  and  other  expenses  in 
defending against litigation involved with any of these risks and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements 
and/or  adverse  judgments.  Substantial  legal  liability  or  significant  regulatory  action  against  us  could  have  a  material 
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
We rely significantly on the skills and experience of our executives, and the loss of any of these individuals may harm our 
business.  
 
Our future success depends to a significant degree on  the  skills, experience and efforts  of our executives, and the loss of 
their services may compromise our ability to effectively conduct our business. We do not maintain "key person" insurance 
in relation to any of our employees.  
 
We may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel to efficiently operate 
our  business,  and  the  failure  to  operate  our  business  effectively  could  have  a  material  and  adverse  effect  on  our 
profitability, financial condition and results of operations.  
 
We are dependent upon the continued availability and commitment of our management, whose contributions to immediate 
and future operations are of significant importance. The loss of any such management could negatively affect our business 
operations.  From  time  to  time,  we  will  also  need  to  identify  and  retain  additional  skilled  management  and  specialized 
technical  personnel  to  efficiently  operate  our  business.  The  number  of  persons  skilled  in  the  acquisition,  exploration  and 
development of royalties and interests in natural resource properties is limited, and competition for such persons is intense. 
Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success, and there can be no assurance of our ability to attract 
and retain such personnel. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, our ability to execute our 
business model and growth strategy could be affected, which could have a material and adverse impact on our profitability, 
results of operations and financial condition.  
 
Certain of our directors and officers may, from time to time, serve in similar positions with other public companies, which 
may put them in a conflict position with us from time to time. 
 
Certain of our directors and officers may, from time to time, serve as directors or officers of other companies involved in 
similar businesses to us, and, to the extent that such other companies may participate in the same ventures in which we may 
seek  to  participate,  such  directors  and  officers  may  have  a  conflict  of  interest  in  negotiating  and  concluding  terms 
respecting the extent of such participation. In all cases where our directors and officers have an interest in other companies, 
such  other  companies  may  also  compete  with  us  in  commodities  trading,  financing  and  merchant  banking  and  for  the 
acquisition of royalties, similar interests or resources properties or projects. Such conflicts of our directors and officers may 
result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
We  conduct  business  in  countries  with  a  history  of  corruption  and  transactions  with  foreign  governments,  and  doing  so 
increases the risks associated with our international activities.  
 
As  we  operate  internationally,  we  are  subject  to  the  United  States Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act,  and  other  laws  that 
prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by United 
States  and  other  business  entities  that  have  securities  registered  in  the  United  States  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  or
- 40 -
retaining  business.  We  have  operations  and  agreements  with  third  parties  in  countries  known  to  experience  corruption. 
Further  international  expansion  may  involve  more  exposure  to  such  practices.  Our  activities  in  these  countries  create  the 
risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants that could be in violation of 
various laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. It 
is  our  policy  to  implement  safeguards  to  discourage  these  practices  by  employees.  However,  our  existing  safeguards  and 
any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or consultants may engage in conduct for 
which  we  might  be  held  responsible.  Violations  of  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  may  result  in  criminal  or  civil 
sanctions,  and  we  may  be  subject  to  other  liabilities,  which  could  negatively  affect  our  business,  operating  results  and 
financial condition.  
 
Employee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter.  
 
It is not always possible to detect and deter employee misconduct. The precautions we take to detect and prevent employee 
misconduct  may  not  be  effective  in  all  cases,  and  we  could  suffer  significant  reputational  and  economic  harm  for  any 
misconduct  by  our  employees.  The  potential  harm  to  our  reputation  and  to  our  business  caused  by  such  misconduct  is 
impossible to quantify.  
 
We  may  incur  losses  as  a  result  of  unforeseen  or  catastrophic  events,  including  the  emergence  of  a  pandemic,  terrorist 
attacks or natural disasters. 
 
The  occurrence  of  unforeseen  or  catastrophic  events,  including  the  emergence  of  a  pandemic  or  other  widespread  health 
emergency  (or  concerns  over  the  possibility  of  such  an  emergency),  terrorist  attacks  or  natural  disasters,  could  create 
economic and financial disruptions, could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our 
ability to manage our business and could expose our insurance subsidiaries to significant losses. 
 
General Risks Faced by Us 
 
Investors' interests may be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue additional 
shares or raise funds through the sale of equity securities. 
 
Our constating documents authorize the issuance of our common shares, Class A common shares and Class A Preference 
Shares, issuable in series. In the event that we are required to issue any additional shares or enter into private placements to 
raise  financing  through  the  sale  of  equity  securities,  investors'  interests  in  us  will  be  diluted,  and  investors  may  suffer 
dilution  in  their  net  book  value  per  share  depending  on  the  price  at  which  such  securities  are  sold.  If  we  issue  any  such 
additional  shares,  such  issuances  will  also  cause  a  reduction  in  the  proportionate  ownership  of  all  other  shareholders. 
Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our company. 
 
Certain  factors  may  inhibit,  delay  or  prevent  a  takeover  of  our  company,  which  may  adversely  affect  the  price  of  our 
common shares. 
 
Certain provisions of our charter documents and the corporate legislation which govern us may discourage, delay or prevent 
a  change  of  control  or  changes  in  our  management  that  shareholders  may  consider  favourable.  Such  provisions  include 
authorizing the issuance by our board of directors of preferred stock in series, providing for a classified board of directors 
with staggered, three-year terms and limiting the persons  who  may call special  meetings of shareholders. In addition, the 
Investment Canada Act imposes certain limitations on the rights of non-Canadians to acquire our common shares, although 
it is highly unlikely that this will apply. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market 
price of our common shares could decline. 
 
Additional Information 
 
We  file  annual  and  other  reports,  proxy  statements  and  other  information  with  certain  Canadian  securities  regulatory 
authorities and with the SEC in the United States. The documents filed with the SEC are available to the public from the 
SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The documents filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities are available
