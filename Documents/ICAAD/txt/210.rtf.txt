IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

MISCELLANEOUS CASE NO: HAM0023 OF 2003S

Between:

HARRY ANDERSON
Applicant

And:

THE STATE
Respondent

Applicant in Person
Mr. A. Ravindra-Singh for State

RULING

This is an application to appeal out of time. The Applicant is now 2 years out of time and offers no good reason for the delay. Nor do I see any merit in the appeal. A 2 year term in total for a total of 14 counts of Larceny and Burglary is not excessive nor wrong in principle.

No good cause is shown to extend the appeal period. Leave is refused.

Nazhat Shameem
JUDGE
