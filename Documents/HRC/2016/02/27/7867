<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 29 September to 8 October 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, conducted an official visit to Italy. The visit was 
undertaken as part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s year-long study on the human rights of 
migrants at the borders of the European Union (EU). Accordingly, the focus of this 
report focuses on external border control, and does not provide a comprehensive overview 
of the broader human rights situation of all migrants in Italy. 
</p>
<p>2. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Rome, Florence, Palermo, 
Trapani, Bari and Castel Volturno. He met with representatives of the Ministry of 
Interior, Ministry of Justice, the Italian Coast Guard, the Civil Protection Agency, the 
Guarda di Finanza, FRONTEX, and members of the Senate Commission for Human 
Rights. He also met with regional and local authorities and visited a number of 
Identification and Expulsion Centres (CIEs), liaised with the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM), and met with many migrants, many of whom were in an irregular situation. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also consulted with numerous civil society organizations, 
lawyers, and academics working in the field of migration. He participated in a workshop 
organized by the Migration and Policy Centre at the European University Institute which 
brought together Italian and international experts in the field of Italian migration law and 
EU border management. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere appreciation to the Government of 
Italy, for the support provided throughout the visit. He further thanks IOM and UNHCR 
for their support and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background on Italy and migration: a brief overview 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the late 1800s, Italy was one of the leading emigration countries in Europe. 
Only in the early 1970s did Italy experienced net immigration. Since the 1980s, Italy 
transformed into of one Europe&#8217;s most important immigration countries. 
</p>
<p>6. At the outset of the Italian immigration experience, immigration to Italy was 
viewed as a temporary phenomenon, a stopgap for persons on their way to other European 
destinations. Yet the steady rise in numbers of migrants to Italy throughout the 1980s 
soon made it apparent that Italy was becoming a destination in its own right.  
</p>
<p>7. Indeed, since 2000, Italy increasingly became a key destination country for irregular 
migrants from North  and sub-Saharan Africa, embarking on perilous voyages across the 
Mediterranean, often from Libya, on unseaworthy vessels, and without proper crew or 
equipment. The Special Rapporteur notes that one reason for the arrivals of migrants, 
particularly from the Southern shore of the Mediterranean, has been Italy&#8217;s proximity to the 
</p>
<p>North African coastline and its extensive sea borders. Ongoing irregular sea arrivals have 
remained one of the key challenges of Italian border management. 
</p>
<p>8. Although data varies, estimates indicate that between 440,000 and 540,000 persons 
with an irregular migration status may currently b e  in Italy. The Special Rapporteur 
notes however, that these statistics reflect only those irregular migrants who come into 
contact with the Italian authorities and thus may not provide a comprehensive overview. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes that Italy experienced a sharp spike in the number of 
irregular sea arrivals in 2011, as a result of the Arab Spring. Approximately 60,000 irregular 
migrants arrived as part of the 2011 influx from North Africa.1 The Special Rapporteur notes 
that subsequent research has indicated that this was a <i>sui generis</i> event, and that irregular 
migration to Italy in the subsequent years has returned to the levels prior to the Arab Spring.2 
</p>
<p>10. Mixed migration flows also appear to be increasingly arriving on the eastern coast of 
Italy by boat across the Adriatic Sea. It appears that many migrants are crossing the Adriatic. 
Whilst these movements involve an internal EU border, in many cases the persons concerned 
are third country nationals, who may in fact be in need of international protection, including 
unaccompanied minors and potential asylum seekers. Migrants reportedly hide themselves 
in dangerous ways as stowaways on commercial ferries coming from Patras and 
Igoumenitsa in Greece to Ancona, Bari, Brindisi and Venice in Italy, including 
underneath cars, in hidden compartments in efforts to remain undetected. Others forms of 
irregular entry across the Adriatic include via smaller boats arriving along the coast in 
unofficial ports. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework on migration and 
border management 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Italy is party to seven of the nine core international human rights treaties and their 
protocols. In 2007 it signed the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, but has not ratified. It has not signed or ratified the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. On 9 December 2012, Italy ratified the Optional Protocol 
Convention against Torture, which will enter into force on May 2 1013. Italy has signed 
but not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>12. Italy has also ratified  the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children; the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants 
by Land, Sea and Air; the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol; 
and the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons. It ha s  s i g n ed  b u t  n o t  
r a t i f i ed  the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. It has also ratified t h e  
International Labour Organization (ILO) C-97 Migration for Employment Convention 
(Revised), 1949; the ILO Convention 143 Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) 
Convention, 1975; and the fundamental conventions of the International Labour 
Organization.3

 2 The Special Rapporteur takes note of Italy&#8217;s management of the increased numbers of mixed migration 
</p>
<p>flows to Italy in 2011: By implementing the rules provided for by the Civil Protection Law No. 225 of 
1992, a migration &#8220;emergency&#8221; was declared in February 2011, and extended until the end of 2012. Under 
this scheme, the Italian Civil Protection Department within the Council of Ministers was empowered to 
establish an emergency system to assist these migrants, through the issuing of humanitarian temporary 
residence permits and by hosting people in reception facilities. It is beyond the scope of this report to 
analyse the effectiveness of the scheme.

</p>
<p><b> B. Regional framework  
</b></p>
<p>13. The EU acquis on migration and asylum is applicable to Italy, as an EU member 
State, and Italy incorporated relevant EU directives into national legislation. Italy became 
a full member of the Schengen system on 1 April 1998. Furthermore, as an EU member 
State, Italy has an obligation to respect the EU Charter of fundamental rights when 
implementing EU law. 
</p>
<p>14. As a member state of the Council of Europe since 1949, Italy is a party to the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
has ratified its Additional Protocols, and the European Social Charter. It has also ratified 
the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers (1995) and the 
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2010). 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>15. Italy first introduced legislation specifically on immigration in 1986 with the 
Norms for the placement and treatment of migrants, migrant workers and against illegal 
immigration. In 1989, the country adopted the Martelli Law, which established 
provisions for the recognition of asylum seekers, legal procedures for the expulsion of 
irregular migrants, and time limits governing when non-citizens must depart Italy after 
being issued a deportation order. 
</p>
<p>16. In 1998, the first comprehensive legal framework on migration was put in place 
by the &#8220;Turco-Napolitano&#8221; Law 40/1998), which introduced mandatory detention for 
irregular migrants and provided for the establishment of migration detention centres 
(article 14). The overarching framework on migration was then entrenched in 1998 by 
the &#8220;Consolidated Act of measures governing immigration and norms on the condition 
of foreign citizens&#8221; (Legislative Decree No. 286 of July 25, 1998). This Act, and its 
subsequent modifications, guaranteed some basic rights for irregular migrants, including 
health care and education. A major amendment to the Consolidated Act came in 2002 by 
the so-called Bossi-Fini Law (Law 189/2002) which posited immigration principally as 
a problem of public order and led to the development of stronger measures to fight 
irregular migration, by giving more power to removals, longer periods of detention and 
increased penalties for migrants who failed to comply with the removal orders. 
</p>
<p>17. This approach was further consolidated by the so-called &#8220;Security Package&#8221; (Law 
92/2008, and Law 94/2009), which aimed to fight &#8220;widespread illegality linked to illegal 
migration and organized crime&#8221;. Key aspects of the Security Package included the 
transformation of irregular immigration into a crime, the criminalization of aiding and 
abetting irregular migration including the crimes of providing housing or employment to 
irregular migrants, crimes related to the violation of the prohibition of re-entry, 
facilitated expulsion, and an extension of the period of detention for irregular 
immigrants to six months. Furthermore, the status of irregular migrant became an 
</p>
<p>  
Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize; Convention No. 98 concerning the 
Application of the Principles of the Right to Organize and to Bargain Collectively; Convention No. 
100 concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value; 
Convention No. 111 concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation; 
Convention No. 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment; Convention No. 182 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>aggravating circumstance for other crimes. Law 129/2011 extended the maximum term 
of detention in a CIE from 6 to 18 months. It should be noted, however, that this 
provision was declared unconstitutional by the Italian Constitutional Court but still 
remains law. 
</p>
<p>18. This legal architecture provides the framework for Italian migration law. 
Importantly, the law differentiates between &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221; and &#8220;irregular 
migration&#8221;. So called &#8220;illegal migrants&#8221; are defined as those who entered into Italy 
without any authorization for entry, whereas irregular migrants are foreigners who 
entered Italy regularly but who subsequently lose the requisite conditions for stay.4 
</p>
<p>19. Overall, the legislative framework provides that those both illegal and irregular 
migrants are not authorized to stay in Italy, and must be removed. If migrants do not have 
the requisite travel documents, Italian immigration law provides for refusal of entry and 
return to the country of departure for individuals intercepted at border points. If an 
undocumented migrant travels to Italy on a commercial carrier, that carrier is obligated 
under Italian law to carry out the return (<i>respingimento</i>) to the country of departure or the 
country that provided travel documents to the individual concerned (Consolidated 
Immigration Act 1998, article 10(3)). The law does stipulate, however, that foreigners be 
provided &#8220;necessary assistance&#8221; at the border, and for all returns to be recorded (articles 
10(5) and (6)). 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also takes note of a number of periodic regularization 
programmes. During his mission, a law (Legislative Decree 109/2012) was in place which 
allowed for e mp l o y e r s  t o  regularize t h e  status of certain irregular migrant workers, 
within defined criteria. Whilst a full analysis of this scheme is beyond the scope of 
the present report, the Special Rapporteur notes key criticisms of the law included the 
fact that it  was geared towards employers,  and rendered individual irregular 
migrant workers u n a b l e  to access the scheme without the consent of their employer, 
and the associated high fees, which was a further obstacle to obtaining employer consent. 
</p>
<p>21. The Italian Constitution further guarantees a number of important rights for all 
persons in Italy. Firstly, the Constitution guarantees the inviolable rights of the person, both 
as an individual and in the social groups where human personality is expressed (article 2). 
The Constitution explicitly recognizes general principles of international law, and 
provides that the legal status of foreigners is regulated by law in conformity with 
international provisions and treaties. It also recognizes the right to asylum (article 10.3). 
</p>
<p>22. The Constitution further provides that personal liberty is inviolable and that no one 
may be detained without an order of the judiciary and in a manner provided for by the law. 
Only in exceptional circumstances, prescribed by law, can provisional detention be 
ordered, but such cases must be referred within 48 hours to the judiciary, and any act of 
physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty 
shall be punished (article 13). Moreover, anyone may bring a case before a court of law 
in order to protect their rights under civil and administrative law, and legal defence is 
considered an inviolable right at every stage and instance of legal proceedings (article 24). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National institutions and policies 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Ministry of Interior, through its Department for Civil Liberties and Immigration, 
has the key responsibility for the protection of civil rights, including in respect of 
immigration, asylum and citizenship. Within the Department, the Central Directorate for 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See 
</p>
<p>http://www.interno.gov.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/temi/immigrazione/sottotema002.html. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>immigration and asylum policies is generally responsible for developing migration 
policies adopted by the Government. B order management falls within the competence of 
the Central Directorate for Immigration and Border Police ( Law No. 189/2002) that is 
under the Public Security Department of the Ministry of Interior.  
</p>
<p>24. The Department for  Civil  Liber t ies and Immigrati on is also responsible 
for the establishment and oversight of the First Aid and Reception Centres, reception 
centres for asylum seekers (CARA) and the CIEs, both of which are run in collaboration 
with the relevant local Prefectures and also often in tripartite agreement with private 
companies (see below detention section).  
</p>
<p>25. The Central Directorate has the exclusive competence in the area of actions at sea, 
and gathers and examines information relating to surveillance, and other activities at sea, as 
well as coordinates interventions (Interministerial decree 14 July 2003). Since July 2004, a 
specific agreement specifies the key procedures and the different competences and 
responsibilities in coordinating resources regarding irregular migration at sea. Signatories to 
the agreement include the Navy, the General Command of the Tax and Customs Police 
(<i>Guardia di Finanza</i>), the General Command of the Carabinieri, the General Command of 
the Port Authorities (<i>Guardia Costiera</i>). 
</p>
<p>26. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Office for Migration and Asylum 
Policies, is responsible for the development of bilateral agreements in migration matters and 
for translating EU developments in the field of migration into Italian. The Visa Office of the 
Ministry is also responsible for determining the relevant visa entry regulations. The Ministry 
also hosted the Interministerial Committee of Human Rights, which was made up of 
representatives of relevant ministries and has been active in the field of migration policy. It 
should be noted, however, that Decree 95/2012 abolished all committees including the 
Human Rights Committee, which the Special Rapporteur regrets.  
</p>
<p>27. Other institutions that have been active in the field of migrants&#8217; rights include the 
Human Rights Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and the Human Rights Committee of 
the Senate. In 2006, the Senate Committee established the De Mistura Commission, which 
examined the situation of the centres for persons awaiting expulsion and concluded that the 
conditions of detention were unacceptable.5 In March 2012, the Human Rights Commission 
of the Senate published another report on the situation of Human Rights in detention, 
reception centres for migrants and expulsion centres.6 Furthermore, the Ministry of Labour 
and Social Policies &#8211; General Directorate of Immigration and Integration Policies works on 
the protection of unaccompanied minors and integration of third country nationals.  
</p>
<p>28. Another Committee, presided over by Undersecretary of State Prof. Ruperto, was also 
established to analyse the situation in the detention centres within Italy and make proposals 
for improvements. At the conclusion of the task, the Ruperto Committee report, which was 
approved by the Minister of Interior in 2013, contained a number of important proposals.  
</p>
<p>29. While there is a national ombudsman office, complaints to the ombudsman can 
only be made by citizens. However, certain regional and provincial ombudsmen may 
receive complaints from non-citizens. Local authorities, including the prefects&#8217; offices, 
also play an important role, particularly in locales where detention or reception centres 
are located. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes that Italy has yet to establish a national human rights 
  
</p>
<p> 5 See http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/view/964/  (accessed 25 April 2013).

<p>institution in compliance with the Paris Principles. While he was pleased to learn that the 
text of a draft law was approved in April 2007 by the Chamber of Deputies, it remains to 
be endorsed by the Senate. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the national human rights 
institution will be established quickly and properly, and will explicitly have the power to 
make unannounced spot checks in detention facilities. Moreover it is important that it 
have a mandate to deal with the human rights of migrants, and that all migrants, 
regardless of their status, be explicitly empowered to make complaints to the body. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur is also pleased to learn that Italy ratified the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) in November 2012. One important 
corollary of the ratification of OPCAT will be the establishment of a n a t i o n a l  
preventive mechanism, with the mandate to conduct unannounced spot checks on detention 
facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Italy and the EU: Influence on national laws, policies and institutions in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the sphere of migration management and border control 
</b></p>
<p>32. Since the implementation of the Schengen acquis by Italy in 1998, Italy has become 
a key point of entry into the EU Schengen area, and its coastline has thus become one of 
the major external sea borders of the EU. 
</p>
<p>33. During the 1980s, traditional European immigration countries insisted that the 
lack of control of Southern European countries, such as Italy, was creating &#8220;backdoors&#8221; for 
irregular migration to Europe. In this context, various regional initiatives were 
established to coordinate entry policies at a supranational level. This coordination 
provided the basis for the Schengen Agreement of June 1985 and the subsequent 
Implementation Convention of June 1990. (See A/HRC/23/46 for more details.) 
</p>
<p>34. In this context, the Special Rapporteur observes the impact of Schengen on 
irregular migration in Italy. Under the Schengen system, any irregular migrant who is 
registered in Italy will be returned to Italy even if they move to another country within 
the EU. In the context of undocumented and irregular migrants, this can create a de facto 
situation where irregular migrants become stuck in Italy. The Special Rapporteur met 
with many such migrants, who had established lives for a number of years in another 
European country, but who, upon being detected as irregular, were returned to Italy 
where they had no ties or viable prospects. Moreover, for those without documents, 
often become trapped in Italy, as they are unable to travel to other countries within the 
EU, or safely return home. 
</p>
<p>35. The Dublin II regulation creates a similar mechanism, whereby asylum seekers can 
only apply for asylum in their country of first entry to the EU. This also creates a situation 
where persons who may in fact have a valid asylum claim avoid lodging that claim in Italy 
as they believe they will not receive adequate protection or opportunities, as many asylum 
seekers in Italy do not receive social benefits, and become homeless. Moreover, they often 
lack family or community ties in Italy which they may have in other EU member States. 
This includes minors, and the Special Rapporteur met with a number of underage irregular 
migrants who expressed reluctance to file for asylum in Italy for these reasons. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that this demonstrates that the impact of the Dublin Rule 
exacerbates vulnerabilities by creating a situation in which persons with valid asylum 
claims choose not to lodge their claims but rather continue their journey as undocumented 
migrants, and are at a high risk of exploitation. </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV. Border management 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur observed a tendency towards a progressive &#8220;externalization&#8221; 
of border control through bilateral agreements, including on readmission but also on rescue 
at sea and technical cooperation. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur has observed the 
important influence of the EU, and its increasingly securitized approach to border 
management, on the development of Italy&#8217;s now more security-focused migration policies. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the safety of migrants travelling 
towards Italy remains the key priority of both the Italian Coast Guard and the <i>Guarda di 
Finanza</i> in migration-related operations at sea. The Special Rapporteur also learnt of the 
challenges in these Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, which are often carried out under 
very precarious and dangerous conditions for all involved, including the SAR teams. 
</p>
<p>38. Nevertheless, in 2011 alone, at least 1,500 persons are estimated to have died while 
attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Whilst the Special Rapporteur in no way wishes to 
imply Italian authorities are singlehandedly responsible for these tragedies, the data make 
apparent the need for ongoing attention to this issue. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur further notes that, while international law clearly delineates 
responsibilities for SAR at sea, there appears to be a blurring of these lines, effectively 
enabling operations that might otherwise be carried out by Italian authorities to be carried 
out by non-European counterparts, including through the provision of logistical and 
technical assistance. Whilst such operations appear to prioritize the saving of lives, in effect 
they may have the result of externalizing the control of the sea border. For example, in 
Tunisia, the Special Rapporteur met with some Somali women who had sought to reach 
Italy irregularly on a small boat. Whilst allegedly in Italian territorial waters, the boat began 
to leak and they issued a distress call. Yet despite being in Italian territorial waters, 
following negotiations between Italy, Malta and Tunisia, the Tunisian SAR team was called 
to carry out the SAR operation, and the migrants were returned to Tunisia, where they 
found themselves in the Choucha camp. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with FRONTEX 
</b></p>
<p>40. The management of Italy&#8217;s external borders has further been supported by the EU 
border agency FRONTEX. FRONTEX&#8217;s work in strengthening Italy&#8217;s search and rescue 
capacity through the provision of air assets and other vessels to be able to more easily carry 
out rescue operations safely at sea is crucial. In Italy, FRONTEX works with the 
<i>Guarda di Finanza</i> and the Border Police to combat irregular migration, migrant smuggling 
and migration related crimes. In addition, FRONTEX reportedly plays a key role by 
contributing experts who assist the Italian authorities in identifying migrants when they 
reach the reception facilities. 
</p>
<p>41. FRONTEX has two a c t i v e  operations in Italian territorial waters. Joint 
Operation Hermes (2011) was established at the request of the Italian Government, and 
provides surveillance by air to detect migrant flows from Tunisia towards the south of 
Italy. The Hermes mission is comprised of experts from EU member States, and also 
included Italian and Maltese aerial and naval support. The role of the estimated 30 
experts includes debriefing and interviewing migrants, in order to accumulate data 
regarding migration flows, and to enable early detection and prevention of possible 
criminal activities at the EU external borders. The mission also provides assistance in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>returning migrants who have been refused permission to remain in the EU to their home 
country.7 In the context of Hermes, FRONTEX has also deployed 20 expert personnel to 
immigrant detention centres in Crotone in Calabria, Caltanissetta and Catania in Sicily, 
and Bari in Puglia in order to interview migrants to gather data. A second operation, named 
<i>Aeneas </i>(2011), has similar goals, but focuses more on the Eastern shore, in Apulia and 
Calabria, and on crossings from Greece, Turkey and Egypt. 
</p>
<p>42. While increased capacity for saving lives is important, the Special Rapporteur 
remains concerned that FRONTEX prioritizes its security objectives over human rights 
considerations. Of particular concern is the fact that FRONTEX officers allegedly are 
conducting interviews with migrants in Italian detention facilities in order to gather 
information on their journeys. These interviews are conducted without any external 
supervision, and it is unclear if human rights concerns arise in these interviews, they are 
dealt with or reported upon. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>43. Other significant issues in the context of Italian border management are the bilateral 
cooperation and readmission agreements negotiated by Italy and its neighbours. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that these agreements, which are the result of private 
consultations, are used as a means of bilateral border control, however often without 
sufficient human rights safeguards. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes the lack 
of transparency surrounding such agreements: not only are negotiations seemingly 
conducted with very little external oversight or input, but often the final text is not 
publicly available, thus contributing to uncertainty regarding the content, interpretation 
and implementation of these agreements. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Italy and Libya 
</b></p>
<p>44.  A Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership, signed in August 2008 
formalized cooperation with Libya to strengthen its capacity to intercept irregular migrants 
on Libyan territory or territorial waters, despite Libya&#8217;s poor record at effectively 
protecting the human rights of migrants. This agreement, which came into force in 
February 2009, established a coordination unit for an Italian-Libyan joint patrol. Whilst 
the number of irregular boat landings in 2009&#8211;2010 did decline, the arrangement was 
harshly criticized, including by the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>Hirsi</i> case, 
which found Italy to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights for 
intercepting and forcibly returning to Libya a group of Somalis and Eritreans, without 
examining their protection needs (the &#8220;push-back&#8221; policy). 
</p>
<p>45. On 17 June 2011, Italy signed a M e m o r a n d u m  o f  U n d e r s t a n d i n g  
( MoU) with the then-rebel National Transitional Council, which referred to e a r l i e r  
commitments contained in the former agreements and provided for mutual assistance and 
co- operation in combating irregular immigration, &#8220;including the repatriation of 
immigrants in an irregular situation.&#8217;8 Furthermore, the rebels agreed to honour several 
accords signed between Italy and Gadhafi, including the deportation of irregular 
immigrants without proper status. In effect, this Memorandum created a joint coordination 
committee whose function was to prepare for the reactivation of Italy-Libya Friendship

</p>
<p>Agreement as soon as a new Libyan Government assumed office. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the original 2008 Treaty on Friendship 
has been suspended and that the <i>Hirsi</i>-defined push-backs have ceased. Yet, on 3 April 
2012, Italy entered into a new <i>Processo Verbale</i> with Libya to combat unauthorized 
departures of migrants from Libya.9 The current agreement establishes that Italy will 
assist Libyan police forces with training and technical tools to control the border, 
proposes mechanisms for information sharing on irregular migrants and illegal smuggling 
networks and proposes construction of a detention centre in Kufra for irregular migrants. 
Moreover, the agreement stated the urgency of obtaining necessary support from the 
European Commission for reopening the detention centre. There is also emphasis on 
bilateral cooperation between Italian and Libyan authorities regarding search and rescue 
operations, including the provision of logistical and technical support to Libyan coast 
guards. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that this new framework for Italian-
Libyan cooperation contains very few concrete human rights safeguards, and does not 
include specific protection safeguards for asylum seekers and refugees. Moreover, although 
the Italian Government insists it is an official treaty, it has not been entered into any 
official registry and the text is only available through unofficial means. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur observes that, whilst increased search and rescue capacity in the 
Mediterranean is undoubtedly of paramount importance, there appears to be a strong focus 
in the agreement on strengthening the capacity of the Libyan authorities to intercept 
migrants hoping to reach Europe, on their territory and in international and Libyan 
territorial waters. In particular, considering the ongoing difficulties of the Libyan 
authorities and the reports of human rights abuses against migrants on Libyan territory, 
t h e  S pecial Rapporteur notes that any cooperation in the sphere of migration with 
Libya should not lead to any migrant being returned to Libyan shores against their will, 
either by Italian coast guards or <i>Guardia di Finanza</i>, or by Libyan coast guards with the 
technical or logistical support of their Italian counterparts.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Italy and Tunisia and Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also remains concerned at recent bilateral readmission 
agreements negotiated between Italy and Egypt and Tunisia. Pursuant to these agreements, 
nationals from these countries who have entered Italy irregularly are taken immediately to 
specific locations for identification by their consulates, which are readily available to 
carry out identification procedures. Once identified, these migrants are provided with the 
necessary documentation and returned, often within 48 hours, to their respective countries 
by prescheduled charter flights. For Tunisians, this identification allegedly takes place at the 
Palermo airport. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes that the speedy processing of such migrants is indeed 
in the interest of everyone concerned to avoid lengthy identification or detention procedures. 
However, during this expedited identification and return, Egyptian and Tunisian nationals 
are often held in ad hoc or temporary facilities, that are not systematically accessible to 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), lawyers or international organizations. 
Moreover this expedited process does not ensure the proper identification of all potential 
protection needs, including age assessment, claims for asylum and other vulnerabilities. 
The Special Rapporteur urges bilateral arrangements fully integrate minimum human 
rights standards and be accompanied by transparent procedures which focus on the

<p>safety, dignity and human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Italy and Greece 
</b></p>
<p>50. As noted above, irregular arrivals of migrants via Greece are an increasing 
phenomenon. In this context, there is a 1999 Greece&#8211;Italy readmission agreement, 
which requires both parties to accept the return of undocumented migrants when 
authorities can demonstrate they have travelled irregularly from one country to the other. 
In fact, the numbers of returns to Greece under this procedure do not appear to be very 
high.10 
</p>
<p>51. However, the Special Rapporteur is very concerned by another practice &#8211; the 
unregistered return of irregular migrants who are detected as stowaways arriving by ferry to 
Italy&#8217;s Adriatic ports. These ferries, often originating from Patras and Igoumenitsa in 
Greece, disembark in the Italian ports of Ancona, Bari, Brindisi and Venice. According to 
testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur, migrants intercepted on ferries are placed 
in the custody of the ferry&#8217;s captain and are not allowed to disembark from the vessel. They 
are reportedly detained on board in precarious conditions, with reports indicating that they 
were tied up or locked in cabins, often for extensive periods including for up to 18 hours or 
more. They are then sent back to Greece on the same vessel, and subsequently handed over 
to the Greek authorities, at risk of ill-treatment and degrading conditions of detention. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes that these &#8220;push-backs&#8221; appear to be taking place 
without appropriate safeguards or procedures in order to properly identify any special 
protection needs, such as asylum claims, despite the existence of Italian law that provides 
for the right to claim asylum and to be provided with relevant information and assistance&#8221; 
(article 11, comma 6 of Legislative Decree 286/98). Moreover, although each port authority 
has reportedly signed agreements with specific NGOs to assist migrants, these 
organizations report inconsistent and limited access to affected individuals. In particular, 
the Special Rapporteur was told that the Border Police does not systematically inform these 
NGOs about detected irregular arrivals, and some NGOs have reported that they are 
restricted from access to the &#8220;sterile zone&#8221; &#8211; the area where these persons are held until 
they are sent back. Access to asylum procedures seems to be dependent on the decision of 
the Border Police at the ports, who often have limited knowledge of international 
framework of protection for asylum seekers. Moreover, members of the Praesidium project, 
which is an initiative of organizations &#8211; including IOM, UNHCR, the Red Cross and Save 
the Children &#8211; have also reported limited or no access to persons in the port. 
</p>
<p>53. Another grave concern appears to be the fact that, through these push-backs, 
unaccompanied minors are being sent back to Greece. The return of unaccompanied minors 
is in direct contravention of international11 and Italian law.12 The Special Rapporteur met 
with a number of Afghani unaccompanied minors who confirmed this practice, one of 
whom reported being pushed back twice on Greek ferries, without being asked about their 
age, without access to interpretation or NGO advice, or any information about access to 
asylum procedures. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur learned from the Italian Authorities that these returns are 
considered justified due to the 1999 bilateral readmission agreement between Italy and 
Greece. The application of the readmission agreement in this context, however, appears 
</p>

<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>dubious. The readmission agreement allows for readmission of a Greek national, and not a 
foreigner, to Greece, and furthermore makes no distinction between adults and minors. 
Furthermore, it appears that these individuals are returned without any procedure of 
readmission, or requesting permission from Greece, and thus should be considered beyond 
the scope of the Readmission Agreement. The EU Schengen framework was also 
mentioned as a key legal justification for such returns, as it was stated that such action is 
justified within the EU Schengen free movement area. Yet the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the Schengen Border Code clearly states that it will only operate in respect of 
fundamental rights and must be applied in accordance with the member States&#8217; obligations 
as regards international protection and non-refoulement (article 20). Moreover, the Code 
stipulates that border police at internal EU borders should not carry out checks unless 
there is a threat to public security or of cross-border crime.13 It is also important to state 
that, as the readmission agreement predates the Schengen Agreement, it must be 
interpreted in the context of Schengen, which does not envisage the possibility of 
such push-backs. 
</p>
<p>55. In light of the decision of <i>M.S.S. v Greece</i>, in which the European Court of 
Human Rights held that Greece was not a safe country of return for asylum seekers, and 
given the extreme xenophobic violence against migrants in Greece and a precarious 
detention system, Italy should formally prohibit the practice of informal automatic 
&#8220;push-backs&#8221; to Greece. Furthermore, formal screening procedures must be 
implemented, during which any migrant detected by a port authority should have the 
opportunity to raise protection issues, including claims for asylum. All port authorities 
should receive formal training about international human rights law, including the right 
to seek asylum and children&#8217;s rights, and be made aware of the need for lawyers, civil 
society organizations and international organizations, including UNHCR and IOM, to 
have full access to the port and other areas where migrants might be present. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of CIEs where migrants are held, 
including in Rome (CIE Ponte Galeria), Trapani (CIE Milo), and Bari (CIE Palese). 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Detention practices and legislation 
</b></p>
<p>57. Those migrants who arrive irregularly are often first sent to in First Assistance and 
Reception Centres (CSPA). These centres are intended to provide immediate first aid 
assistance to persons arriving irregularly in Italy. While the Government assured the Special 
Rapporteur that persons were usually only held for 48 hours in such centres, other reports 
received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that people are sometimes held for several days 
or weeks in these locations. Moreover, there is limited access to some of these centres by 
external monitors, and decisions being made about where persons are sent onto appear to be 
made with little oversight. The CSPA in Lampedusa, perhaps the most well-known of the 
CIE, opened in January 2009 with a maximum capacity of 800 persons, is not functioning 
since it was declared a non-safe area on 16 May 2009. However, Lampedusa now is 
being used in emergencies, as a temporary identification facility, with migrants 
reportedly being moved out fairly quickly to other centres in Sicily. 
</p>
<p>58. CIEs are centres where migrants are sent in order to be fully identified and removed 
from the territory. In order to be held in the CIEs, which are established by decree of the 
</p>
<p>  
 13 Schengen Border Code art. 21.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Minister of Interior, a detention order by a relevant authority is required. Initial detention 
orders are for a period of 30 days. These can be extended at the request of the Police 
Commissioner (<i>Questura</i>), with a maximum detention period of 18 months (Law 
89.2011). Both detention and removal orders must be confirmed within 48 hours, a task 
which in 2004 (Decree Law n.241/2004) was assigned to a  Justice of the Peace 
(<i>giudice di pace)</i>. Appeal against the removal or detention order may be presented within 
60 days before the Justice of the Peace where the authority ordered the expulsion or 
detention. Italian law provides that for the validation of the expulsion/detention orders, an 
appointed defence lawyer has to be present. 
</p>
<p>59. If, at the expiration of the detention period in a CIE, the expulsion order cannot be 
executed, the Police Commissioner must release the foreigner and order them to leave the 
country within seven days. In the event that the individual does not comply and is 
apprehended by the police, they may be ordered to pay a fine of between 10,000 and 20,000 
and can be detained in a new in a CIE and subject to another removal order. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the law, unaccompanied children cannot be detained and are to be 
issued with a residence permit (Decreto Legislativo 286/98, article 19.2.a). Other 
vulnerable categories of migrants, such as victims of trafficking or asylum applicants, 
cannot be removed.14 Other provisions further protect minors, and pregnant women and 
their spouses, or parents of new born babies up to six months old. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that certain practical obstacles, including lack of cooperation of countries 
of origin of irregular migrants, statelessness, and difficulties in the identification of persons 
subject to a removal, are other reasons for which these orders are not able to be carried out.  
</p>
<p>61.  CIEs are managed at the local level by the prefectures. Local prefectures have 
service contracts with a variety of private entities, including private management 
companies, and non-governmental groups, for the provision of basic needs and services 
within facilities. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur observes that whatever terminology is used by Italian 
authorities, as such centres are closed facilities and involve a deprivation of liberty, they 
therefore should be considered as detention centres under international law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>63. Italian law establishes minimum conditions for detention. Legislative Decree 
286/1998, article 14.2, provides that detainees in CIEs must be detained in a way that 
guarantees the necessary assistance and full respect of their own dignity. Presidential 
Decree 394/1999, article 21.2, further provides that detention centres should provide 
detainees essential health services, activities for their socialization and freedom of worship. 
Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior has developed guidelines which detail all servicers to 
be provided and items to be distributed in CIEs. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these overarching principles as they provide the 
necessary foundation for minimum conditions of detention in accordance with international 
law. Nevertheless, the lack of applicable nationwide standards appears to leave a large 
margin of discretion to centre managers. Indeed, from his visits to three different CIEs, he 
observed varying conditions, with two of the CIEs he visited exhibiting significantly 
substandard conditions.  
</p>
<p>65. In all the centres visited, the Special Rapporteur observed a lack of proper activities 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Legislative Decree 286/98, art. 19, para. 1.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>for detainees. Indeed, in <i>Ponte de Galeria</i>, detainees were denied access to books or pens 
and paper, lacked access to television and news, and were deprived of proper footwear, 
allegedly in an attempt to avoid self-harm. This lack of activity had a direct bearing on the 
mental state of detainees, who were often abject and desperate. While CIEs have 
arrangements with NGOs that come into the centre to provide services, including cultural 
and religious and educational programmes, these arrangements appear to be developed on an 
ad hoc basis and are not a permanent fixture of all centres. 
</p>
<p>66. Moreover, poor facilities, including lack of adequate facilities for exercise, 
intermittent hot water, poor hygiene, including limitations on soap and laundry, jail-like 
conditions in which detainees are locked in cells, and lack of privacy, coupled with a lack of 
a clear framework on how specific requests by detainees are handled by staff, a dded 
to detainees&#8217; and personnel&#8217;s frustrations. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes the highly militarized design of the recently 
constructed CIE Milo. The facility had an almost military feel, with high wired fences, 
and cell-like conditions. In particular, many detainees interviewed noted that living 
conditions in Italian jails were better than those in CIEs. 
</p>
<p>68. Another issue of concern for the Special Rapporteur was the medical care 
provided in the centres. While each of the centres visited had medical personnel, 
detainees commented that they did not always receive adequate treatment, with many 
reporting the same painkiller being handed out for a wide range of ailments. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the high levels of 
prescription of psychotropic medications, prescribed by doctors who are not necessarily 
experts in mental health. Other indicators of mental health concerns include repeated 
incidences of self-harm, and self&#8208;mutilation. 
</p>
<p>69. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the importance of the cultural 
mediators who work in the centres, it is important to mention that, in contrast with the 
Italian Penitentiary Police, who  receive specific training to work in closed environments, 
the staff of CIEs are not prepared and recruited for the purposes of working in such 
environments, and often have limited experience working with foreigners. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that there is no general investigative 
authority to monitor conditions of all places where migrants are held. The lack of a 
national ombudsman with investigative powers or a national human rights institution is 
particularly felt in this regard. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Praesidium project, 
mandated by Government to access and monitor centres where migrants are held. 
However, the Praesidium initiative is project-based, and participating organizations 
reportedly find it difficult to access all temporary or informal centres where migrants are 
detained. This is particularly true in respect of the temporary centres where the Tunisians 
and Egyptians are held for quick processing and removal or port zones. Furthermore, the 
monitoring and evaluation reports of Praesidium are not publicly disclosed, and allegedly 
the recommendations made have not been consistently implemented. The Special 
Rapporteur is also concerned at continued reports of journalists and NGOs indicating they 
experience difficulty accessing these centres, despite a judicial decision in May 2012 
repealing a decision which limited journalists&#8217; access to the centres, and despite the clear 
provision under EU law allowing NGOs to visit detention facilities (EU Directive 
115/2008, article 16, paragraph 4). Thus, the Special Rapporteur notes that it is necessary 
to establish a nationwide institutional framework in which NGOs, intergovernmental 
organizations, journalists and lawyers can freely access and monitor the facilities, and the 
implementation of recommendations is transparent. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that in June 2012 the Ministry of 
Interior set up a task force to analyse the regulatory, organizational situation in the CIEs </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>tasked with making proposals to improve their functioning and ensuring uniform standards. 
In February 2013, a Policy Paper for the Management of the CIEs was drawn up in this 
regard.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Length of detention 
</b></p>
<p>72. The maximum period of detention in Italy is 18 months, which conforms to the 
maximum allowed by the EU Return Directive. Particularly in cases where identification 
seems highly unlikely or impossible (for example when the authorities of the country of 
origin refuse to identify a detainee as their citizen), pursuing detention for the maximum 
period does not serve a useful purpose. However, the decision regarding the length of 
detention appears to be largely discretionary, depends on the attitude of the local 
authorities running the detention centre, with practices varying considerably between 
regions. 
</p>
<p>73. Thus, the Special Rapporteur learnt that in certain CIEs, such as in Bari-Palese, 
when identification has not been possible within six month, extension of detention orders 
is often not requested.  In other CIEs, such as in Milo or in Ponte Galleria, the policy 
seemed to be to keep all detainees up to the maximum time allowed, whatever their 
circumstances, unless they are deported, seemingly for deterrence purposes. In Milo, the 
Special Rapporteur met with a detainee who had been sent to their alleged consulate for 
identification 14 times in the past 15 months, always with a negative result: this practice 
seems to be uselessly repressive. 
</p>
<p>74. Importantly, the Ruperto Commission report recently endorsed by the Minister of 
Interior has proposed that the maximum period of detention be reduced to 12 months. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to justice in detention 
</b></p>
<p>75. As noted above, the appeal system for expulsion and detention orders is 
unnecessarily complex, requiring two parallel appeal procedures in the city where the 
order was made, which often requires the hiring of a local lawyer. This can be very 
difficult for migrants to navigate, as migrants may not speak the language, have limited 
access to information in detention facilities, and often have limited access to funds or 
legal advice. Furthermore, even if both orders were issued in the same city, the 
bifurcation of the process still requires two separate proceedings. Moreover, contrary to 
similar proceedings for EU citizens, the judge deciding whether expulsion and detention 
orders should be extended is a Justice of the Peace without any particular expertise on 
immigration issues. Moreover, there seem to be limited ability of these lay judges to 
review the detention orders on the merits: rather, the confirmation of the orders 
appears to be limited to formal checks, thus resulting in a lack of real judicial control over 
the order. 
</p>
<p>76. While the Italian legal system should be commended for the fact that it ensures the 
right of legal representation, including to irregular migrants, in practice, court-appointed 
lawyers for migrants appealing their expulsion or detention orders are often not specifically 
trained in migration and asylum matters. The Special Rapporteur further observes that 
the current Italian legal aid guarantees do not include extra support for special cases where 
experts, such as doctors or psychologists, are needed to visit detainees or to write 
reports. Furthermore, full interpretation is not always granted throughout the whole legal 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>77. Although some migrants are able to engage private lawyers, irregular migrants in 
detention are easy targets for dishonest lawyers who wish to make extra money. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur thus urges Italian authorities to work together with bar associations to 
ensure that migrants are able to access proper legal representation. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur believes that a general normative framework for all CIEs 
should be established, incorporating some of the better practices observed in the various 
CIEs, such as those observed in Bari-Palese. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>79. When a migrant who is already detained in a CIE makes an application for asylum, 
the expulsion order is suspended, pending the evaluation of the asylum claim. The 
assessment is made by the competent territorial commission, which is composed of two 
officials of the Ministry of the Interior, a representative of the local authorities and a 
representative of UNHCR. Despite this safeguard, the Special Rapporteur learned that 
some migrants detained in the CIEs were expelled to their countries of origin, despite 
having previously expressed their desire to make an asylum claim, however, prior to the 
formal registration of that claim. Another concern also relates to those migrants reportedly 
repatriated while still awaiting a judicial decision on their request to suspend the 
repatriation procedures following a negative decision on their international protection 
application made by the competent Territorial Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Special categories of detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about the high number of ex-prisoners 
who are transferred from prison to CIEs. For example, at the CIE Ponte Galeria in Rome, a 
majority of detainees were in fact former prisoners who had served their prison sentences. 
The ex-prisoners were often unaware that they would be transferred to a CIE at the 
completion of their sentence, and often had no clear indication of how long they would be 
held there, with some being held for numerous months. The Special Rapporteur notes that 
a process of identification should be initiated at the beginning of any prison term, to avoid 
unnecessary detention in CIEs of prisoners. Indeed, given the large proportion of ex-
prisoners being held in CIEs, if prisoners were identified whilst serving their sentences 
and deported upon completion of their prison term, the number of persons held in CIEs 
would diminish significantly. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur encountered numerous detainees in CIEs who in fact did not 
have citizenship of any country. These stateless persons have little possibility of being 
identified, yet nevertheless are detained, often for extended periods. Of particular concern 
to the Special Rapporteur were stateless persons with particular ties to Italy. These cases 
often involved Roma, who often were born in, or have longstanding ties to Italy, speak 
Italian, and have no other country of citizenship. Stateless Roma detainees, the Special 
Rapporteur was told, were often detained for a number of months, and eventually released 
with an order to leave the country. They of course do not leave, as Italy is the only home 
they know, but often find themselves detained again. This vicious cycle appears to serve no 
legitimate legal or policy aim and in practice simply serves to undermine the human rights 
of the affected persons. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Minors 
</b></p>
<p>82. Italy has a strong commitment to avoiding the detention of minors in CIEs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>However, individuals have been detained as adults based on an age assessment report 
(usually wrist X-rays) in spite of the fact that they had received copies of their birth 
certificate, according to which they are minors. In some cases, minors were released from 
detention, while, in other cases, they were kept in detention until the consular 
representation of the country of origin could have provided final confirmation on the age 
of the person concerned. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur received reports of minors 
being detained in the first aid and reception centres for extended periods of time. Italy still 
lacks an adequate nationwide multidisciplinary age determination procedure, a necessary 
precondition to ensure that children are treated as such and are granted forms of protection 
tailored to their specific vulnerabilities and needs. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Others 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur also observed that there appeared to be no standard 
procedures to deal with persons with specific vulnerabilities or special needs in CIEs, 
including persons with health or psychological problems, victims of torture, victims of 
trafficking, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>84. Apart from the case of minors, who are legally exempt from detention and 
generally placed in special care, the Special Rapporteur notes that Italy appears not to 
have developed any meaningful alternatives to detention for migrants. Detention should 
only be considered for migrants who present a danger to themselves or to others, or where 
there is an established risk that they may abscond from future judicial or administrative 
proceedings. Non-custodial measures should always be considered before detention.15 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur thus urges the Italian authorities to undertake an individual 
assessment of the necessity of detention in all cases. Such alternatives are particularly 
important for specific categories of migrants who cannot be properly identified, and 
stateless persons, especially when born or raised in Italy. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that other migrants who pose no risk to the community and have ties to 
the country should be exempt from long periods of detention. Detention is not a suitable 
solution for such persons, and Italy should seek to develop adequate alternatives, including 
establishing procedural paths to access residence permits. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>86. During the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with numerous irregular 
migrants working in informal sectors, many of whom were being exploited by 
unscrupulous employers, who appeared to enjoy total impunity. Employers appear to exploit 
the fact of the migrants&#8217; irregular status by requiring them to undertake strenuous physical 
labour for long hours, and often paid far below t h e  minimum wages, or not at all. 
</p>
<p>87. In Castel Volturno, the Special Rapporteur was shocked by the conditions of 
migrant workers he encountered. The migrants, for the most part men from sub-Saharan 
Africa with irregular migration status, lived in abhorrent conditions, in overcrowded 
</p>
<p>  
 15 A/HRC/20/24, which focuses on alternatives to detention.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>houses, without proper sanitation. The Special Rapporteur learned that the wages received 
were often not sufficient to maintain an adequate standard of living, with reports of being 
paid &#8364;20 or less for a full day of difficult manual work. Furthermore, many workers 
reported that they were often at the mercy of authorities, in particular the <i>Carabineri</i> that 
subjected them to cruel treatment including not only physical assault but also racial 
taunts. Complete impunity appears to surround the situation of these workers, who were 
being exploited by landlords and employers to benefit the Italian economy, especially in 
the agricultural sector. 
</p>
<p>88. In this context, the Special Rapporteur observes the importance of the EU 
Employers&#8217; Sanctions Directive. Although this has been transposed into national law 
through Legislative Decree 109/2012, Italy must strive to ensure its full implementation, 
including effectively sanctioning Italian employers who abuse the vulnerability of 
migrants by paying them low or exploitative wages and forcing them to work in dirty, 
difficult or dangerous conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Terminology 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur is concerned with the terminology and discourse around 
migration used by certain Government institutions and other counterparts. The term 
<i>clandestini</i> remains widespread, in particular by the media. Such language further 
legitimates a discourse of exclusion and criminalization of migration, which then 
entrenches attitudes of discrimination and xenophobia, and creates an environment where 
the exploitation of irregular migrants is legitimate. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>While Italy has developed a large apparatus of laws and policies directed 
towards managing irregular migration and border management, much remains to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>done in order to ensure the full respect for the human rights of migrants in Italy.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Develop a comprehensive national system of data collection, analysis and 
dissemination regarding immigration policies and practices, which should be used as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>foundation for rights-based policy-making on migration. The data collection should 
</b></p>
<p><b>include migrants in detention and deportations.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Guarantee the establishment of a  national human rights institution in line 
with the Paris Principles, ensuring that it is both functionally and financially 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent of the Government, and vested with the authority to investigate all issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to human rights, including those of migrants, regardless of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative status.</b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>Ensure the establishment of a fully independent national preventive 
mechanism, in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture, which is mandated to visit all places where migrants may be deprived of their

</p>
<p>94. <b>Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</b> </p>

of all readmission agreements entered into.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Ensure that readmission and cooperation agreements, aimed at, inter alia, 
combatting irregular migration, include safeguards to fully respect the human rights

<p><b>asylum seekers and refugees, in particular with regards to the principle of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>refoulement. </b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>Establish a comprehensive mechanism for the identification of unaccompanied 
minors that includes not only medical exams but also a psychosocial and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach, in order to best identify specific protection measures in the best interests of

<p><b>each child. </b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Revoke the declaration (Ordinance of 24/09/2011) of Lampedusa as not being a 
safe place for the disembarkation of migrants rescued at sea in order to maintain an 
</b></p>

<p><b>alternatives to detention. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Improve enforcement of the regulation with regard to the management of
