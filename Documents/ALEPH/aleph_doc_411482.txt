Consolidated Financial Results
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders for the three month period ended March 31, 2009 was $189,
or $0.40 per share. Results for the first three months of 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted by lower realized 
gold and copper prices and lower sales volume.
40
Sales — gold, net for the first quarter of 2009 decreased $120, or 8%, compared to the first quarter of 2008,
primarily due to lower realized prices and decreased sales volumes. For a complete discussion regarding variations 
in gold volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. The following analysis summarizes the change in 
consolidated gold sales revenue:

Costs applicable to sales increased $27 for gold and decreased $65 for copper for the first quarter of 2009
compared to the first quarter of 2008, as detailed in the table below. The increase in Costs applicable to sales — gold 
is primarily due to increased underground mining activity, a build in Nevada inventory in 2008 and lower copper by-
product credits at Phoenix, partially offset by 5% fewer ounces sold, lower diesel costs and favorable U.S. dollar 
exchange rates. The decrease in Costs applicable to sales — copper is primarily due to 10% fewer pounds sold, 
lower diesel and labor costs and a higher allocation of costs to gold at Batu Hijau as a result of lower copper prices. 
For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below.
Amortization increased for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008, as detailed in the table
below, and primarily relates to the Nevada power plant commissioned in the second quarter of 2008. We expect 
2009 Amortization to be approximately $775 to $825 (assuming 100% ownership of the Boddington project in 2009).

Exploration expense increased for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008 as a result of 
timing and additional expenditures at Hope Bay. We expect 2009 Exploration expense to be approximately $165 to 
$175.

The 2009 expense includes costs related to a global workforce reduction that impacted almost 3% of our world
wide workforce. Community development and regional administration expenses relate to our social responsibility, 
external and government relations, and regional office costs which are not a direct cost of mine production.

Canadian Oil Sands Trust income decreased $20 in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of
2008 due to reduced distributions related to a significant decrease in oil prices.
Interest expense, net increased by $4 for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008 mainly
due to interest on the convertible senior notes and corporate revolving credit facility. We expect 2009 Interest 
expense, net to increase to approximately $150 to $160 due to higher levels of debt related to the February 2009 
public offering of $518 convertible senior notes and the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 in the first quarter of 2009, which 
increases non-cash interest expense.
Income tax expense during the first quarter of 2009 was $105 compared to $232 during the first quarter of 2008.
Taxes were lower primarily as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax and a lower 
effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2009 was 27% compared to 
29% for the first quarter of 2008. The 2% decrease from the 2008 first quarter rate primarily relates to the effect of 
foreign earnings in subsidiaries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested. The effective tax rates in the first quarter 
of 2009 and 2008 are different from the United States statutory rate of 35% primarily due to (i) U.S. percentage 
depletion and (ii) the effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested. For a 
complete discussion of the factors that influence our effective tax rate, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Results of Operations and Financial Condition in Newmont’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2008, filed February 19, 2009. We expect the 2009 full year tax rate to be approximately 27% to 31%, 
assuming an average gold price of $875 per ounce.
Net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests decreased $104 in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the
first quarter of 2008, as a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha.

  Excludes Amortization and Accretion.
  Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes noncontrolling interests’ share for Yanacocha, Kori 
Kollo and Batu Hijau.
Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased 5% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008, primarily due to lower 
production from North America and Asia Pacific and an increase in finished goods inventory in South America, 
partially offset by higher production from Africa. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased 10% in the first quarter 
of 2009 from 2008, primarily due to a reduction in concentrate inventory in the first quarter of 2008.
Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 10% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008,
due to lower production, lower by-product credits, a higher allocation of costs to gold due to lower copper prices at 
Batu Hijau and higher contracted services costs, partially offset by lower diesel and workers participation costs. 
Consolidated Costs applicable to sales decreased by $14 per ounce, net of hedges, due to the weakening of the 
Australian dollar in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper 
pound decreased 38% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008, primarily due to lower diesel and labor costs and a 
lower allocation of costs to copper as a result of changes in realized metal prices.
Our 2009 annual gold guidance remains unchanged with consolidated gold sales of between 6.35 and
6.85 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $440 per ounce. Our Costs applicable to sales 
forecast for 2009 now assumes an oil price of $50 per barrel and an Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.70 for the 
remainder of the year. Our Costs applicable to sales for the year are expected to change by approximately $6 per 
ounce for every $10 change in the oil price and by approximately $3 per ounce for every $0.10 change in the 
Australian dollar exchange rate. We are actively hedging a portion of our Nevada diesel and Australian dollar cost 
exposure.
We continue to expect consolidated copper sales of approximately 460 to 510 million pounds of copper in 2009
at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.50 to $0.65, slightly lower than our prior estimate due to a lower 
allocation of costs to copper as a result of changes in realized metal prices.

Nevada, USA. Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased 2% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008 due to lower
leach tons placed and lower mill ore grade, partially offset by higher mill recovery rates.
Surface ore mined in the first quarter of 2009 decreased to 6.3 million tons, down from 8.4 million tons in the
previous year quarter primarily due to mine sequencing at Gold Quarry. Underground ore mined in the first quarter of 
2009 increased to 629,000 tons, up from 526,000 tons in the first quarter of 2008. This increase was due to 34% 
higher tons at Leeville, 9% higher tons at Chukar and the addition of Carlin East in 2009, partially offset by 9% lower 
tons at Midas due to ground failure which curtailed production in March but is expected to resume by the end of April 
2009. Underground ore grade decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower grade at 
Leeville.
First quarter ore milled was 6.1 million tons in 2009 compared to 6.2 million tons in 2008. Ore placed on leach 
pads in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 45% from the first quarter of 2008 to 2.6 million tons due mainly to mine 
sequencing at Gold Quarry.
Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased to $509 in the first quarter of 2009 from $409 per ounce in the 
first quarter of 2008 due to lower production, lower surface ore tons mined, higher underground contracted service 
costs, lower by-product credits and higher royalties, partially offset by lower diesel and power costs.
La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces sold increased 4% in first quarter of 2009 from 2008 due to increased tons
mined and placed on the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales increased 19% due to higher waste stripping and 
employee profit sharing.
We expect gold sales in North America of approximately 1.9 to 2.1 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of
approximately $530 to $570 per ounce in 2009.

Yanacocha, Peru. Gold sales at Yanacocha decreased 13% in the first quarter of 2009 from the first quarter of 
2008 due to finished goods inventory additions. Ore tons mined increased 8% in the first quarter of 2009 compared 
to the first quarter of 2008. During the same periods, the amount of waste material mined decreased to 15.4 million 
tons from 21.8 million tons. Ore placed on the leach pads increased to 30.6 million tons in the first quarter of 2009 
from 30.3 million tons in the first quarter of 2008 and leach ore grade increased 31% from 0.016 to 0.021 ounces per 
ton during the same period. Leach production was 144,000 ounces lower in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the 
first quarter of 2008 due to the timing of leach ore placement, but was offset by the production of 143,000 ounces 
from the mill. Commercial production from the mill started in the second quarter of 2008.
Costs applicable to sales increased in the first quarter of 2009 to $324 per ounce from $311 per ounce in the
first quarter of 2008 primarily due to higher labor, tires and maintenance costs and operation of the mill in 2009, 
partially offset by lower diesel and workers participation costs.
Kori Kollo, Bolivia. Gold ounces sold decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008 due to a 9%
reduction in ore tons mined and lower ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 74% in the first 
quarter of 2009 from 2008, primarily due to leach pad and materials and supply inventory write-downs of $4 in the 
first quarter of 2009.
We expect consolidated gold sales for South America of approximately 1.95 to 2.05 million ounces at Costs
applicable to sales of approximately $300 to $320 per ounce in 2009.

  Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes noncontrolling interests’ share.
Jundee, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased 3% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, due to
increased mill throughput and mill ore grade, partially offset by additions to finished goods inventory. Costs 
applicable to sales per ounce decreased 16%, primarily attributable to higher production and the weakening of the 
Australian dollar, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $44 per ounce, partially offset by 
higher royalty costs.
Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to
lower throughput and mill ore grade as a result of ore blending requirements. Costs applicable to sales per ounce 
increased 10%, primarily due to lower production and higher royalty and milling costs, partially offset by the 
weakening of the Australian dollar, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $58 per ounce.
Kalgoorlie, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased 7% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, primarily
due to higher mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 17%, primarily due to higher production 
and the weakening of the Australian dollar, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $102 per 
ounce, partially offset by higher waste removal costs.
Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold increased 29% in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008, primarily due to
higher mill ore grade from milling additional Favona underground ore. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were 19% 
lower due to higher production and the weakening of the New Zealand dollar, which decreased Costs applicable to 
sales by approximately $113 per ounce, partially offset by higher waste removal costs.
Boddington, Australia. Development of the project remains on schedule and was approximately 95% complete, 
as of March 31, 2009 with initial mill start-up expected in mid-2009. The Company continues to expect total project 
costs of between $2,600 and $2,900 on a 100% basis.
Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Consolidated copper and gold sales at Batu Hijau decreased 10% and 45% in the first 
quarter of 2009 from 2008, respectively, primarily due to fewer concentrate shipments in 2009 as sales during the 
first quarter of 2008 included a significant reduction in concentrate inventory. During the first quarter of 2009, copper 
production increased by 7% mainly due to higher recovery while gold production decreased due to lower grade. The 
higher recovery in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from processing less oxidized stockpiled ore.
Total Costs applicable to sales decreased by $75 in the first quarter of 2009 from 2008 due to lower sales and 
lower diesel, tire and labor costs and lower waste removal costs. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and 
per ounce of gold decreased 38% and increased 32%, respectively, as a result of the lower costs and a higher 
allocation of costs to gold due to the lower realized copper price.
47
We expect gold sales for the Asia Pacific operations of approximately 2.0 to 2.2 million ounces at Costs
applicable to sales of approximately $400 to $440 per ounce in 2009, with Boddington coming on-line in the second 
half of the year. We expect copper sales for the Asia Pacific operations to be approximately 460 to 510 million 
pounds of copper at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.50 to $0.65 per pound in 2009, slightly lower than 
our prior estimate due to a lower allocation of costs to copper as a result of lower realized copper prices. Unfavorable 
changes in the Australian dollar exchange rate could result in operating costs for the region outside of the expected 
range for the full year, as a significant portion of costs are Australian dollar denominated. Costs applicable to sales in 
Asia Pacific are expected to change by approximately $11 per ounce for every $0.10 move in the Australian dollar 
exchange rate.
We currently have a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine, held through the Nusa Tenggara
Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the 
Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), 
the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. We identified NTP as a VIE as a result of certain capital structures 
and contractual relationships and have fully consolidated NTP in the consolidated financial statements since 
January 1, 2004. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated 
Indonesian company.
Under the Contract of Work issued to PTNNT by the Indonesian government, beginning in 2006 and continuing
through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or its nominee, 
equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the 
Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by 
March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which 
such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, 
the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of 
such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. In March 2008, the Indonesian 
government and PTNNT each instituted an arbitration proceeding to resolve a dispute concerning the divestiture of 
PTNNT shares. On March 31, 2009, the international arbitration panel issued a final award resolving the claims 
asserted. For further information related to the dispute and the international arbitration proceeding, including a 
description of the factual basis for the claims, and a description of the arbitration decision, refer to Note 27, 
Commitments and Contingencies. Pursuant to the arbitration decision and the terms of the Contract of Work, it is 
possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49% or that subsequent disputes may 
arise concerning the divestiture of shares.
The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”), which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for entities over 
which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46(R) defines such entities as Variable Interest 
Entities (“VIEs”). Newmont identified NTP, the partnership that owns an 80% interest in PTNNT, as a VIE due to 
certain capital structures and contractual relationships. As a result of the Company’s 56.25% ownership in NTP, the 
Company continues to be the primary beneficiary of NTP and therefore consolidates Batu Hijau, and will continue to 
consolidate Batu Hijau, in its Consolidated Financial Statements as long as NTP controls PTNNT. The expected 
transfers of the 2006 interest (3%), 2007 interest (7%) and 2008 interest (7%) are not expected to impact the 
consolidation requirement.
In addition, we have, through PTNNT, been in discussions to extend our forest use permit (called a “Pinjam
Pakai”) for over three years. In 2005, Indonesian governmental authorities reviewed the contractual requirements for 
extension of the Pinjam Pakai and determined that PTNNT met those requirements. This permit is a key requirement 
to continue to operate Batu Hijau efficiently, in addition to the ultimate life of the mine and recoverability of reserves. 
However, the permit extension has not been received as of the date of this report. The resulting delay has adversely 
impacted Batu Hijau, and may adversely impact future operating and financial results, including deferment or 
cancellation of future mine development and operations.

Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased 37% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher mill ore
grade and a reduction of in-process inventory, partially offset by lower mill throughput. Waste material mined 
increased to 11.1 million tons in the first quarter of 2009 from 9.7 million tons in the first quarter of 2008.
48
Costs applicable to sales per ounce in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008 decreased 14% due to higher
production, partially offset by higher contract services, consumables and royalty costs.
We continue to expect gold sales of approximately 500,000 to 525,000 ounces. We have reduced our estimate 
of Costs applicable to sales to approximately $425 to $450 per ounce in 2009 due to lower oil prices and improved 
power availability from the grid.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Our foreign operations sell their gold and copper production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Approximately
22% and 31%, of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies during the first quarter of 2009 and 
2008, respectively. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining 
operations decreased consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce by approximately $19 during the first quarter 
of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Provided from Operating Activities
Net cash provided from continuing operations decreased to $387 for the first quarter of 2009 from $594 for the 
first quarter of 2008 due to lower realized gold and copper prices and decreased sales volume, as discussed above 
in Consolidated Financial Results.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $354 during the first quarter of 2009 compared 
to $767 during the same period of 2008, driven largely by the acquisition of Miramar Mining Corporation (“Miramar”).
Additions to property, plant and mine development were as follows:

Capital expenditures in North America primarily related to sustaining mine development at Nevada. Capital
expenditures in South America primarily related to the Conga project and dewatering activity and leach pad 
development at Yanacocha. The vast majority of capital expenditures in Asia Pacific were for the Boddington project, 
with other sustaining capital expenditures for tailings facilities and mine development at Australia and equipment 
purchases at Batu Hijau. As of March 31, 2009, we have hedged 72% of our expected remaining Australian dollar 
denominated capital expenditures for 2009 at an average rate of 0.75. Capital expenditures in Africa primarily related 
to sustaining mine development at Ahafo. We expect to spend $1,400 to $1,600 on consolidated capital expenditures 
in 2009.
49
Capital expenditures in North America during the first quarter of 2008 were primarily related to the construction 
of the power plant and sustaining mine development in Nevada. South America capital expenditures were primarily 
related to construction of the gold mill, surface equipment replacement and leach pad expansions in Yanacocha. 
Capital expenditures in Asia Pacific largely resulted from the construction of the Boddington project in Australia and 
sustaining mine development at Batu Hijau. Capital expenditures in Africa were mainly as a result of mine equipment 
purchases and sustaining development at Ahafo.
Investments in marketable debt and equity securities, net. During the first quarter of 2008, we purchased
marketable equity securities for $3.
Acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2009, we paid $11 for a mining property near the La Herradura, Mexico
operation. During the first quarter of 2008, we paid $318 for certain acquisition costs and to acquire the remaining 
outstanding common shares of Miramar, resulting in Miramar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. The total 
Miramar purchase price was $1,353. As a result of the completed acquisition of Miramar, we control the Hope Bay 
Project, a large undeveloped gold project in Nunavut, Canada.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided from financing activities was $982 and $71 during the first quarter of 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
Proceeds from debt, net. During the first quarter of 2009, we received net proceeds of $506 on 2012 convertible
senior notes, $54 on Batu Hijau short-term borrowings and $10 at Ahafo.
Proceeds from and repayment of debt, net. During the first quarter of 2009, we received proceeds from debt, net 
of $1,369 and repaid $1,590 of debt. We received net proceeds of $504 from the issuance of convertible senior notes 
due in 2012, $54 from short-term borrowings in Batu Hijau, $10 under the Ahafo project facility and $801 under our 
$2,000 revolving credit facility. In addition, we made scheduled debt repayments of $24 related to the sale-leaseback 
of the refractory ore treatment plant (classified as a capital lease), $1,558 under our $2,000 revolving credit facility 
and $8 on other credit facilities and capital leases. The revolving credit facility is also used to secure the issuance of 
letters of credit totaling $532, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” 
below).
Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $192 for the remainder of 2009, $157 in 2010, $332 in 2011, $591 in 
2012, $116 in 2013 and $1,584 thereafter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from Net cash provided by 
operating activities, short-term investments, existing cash balances and available credit facilities.
At March 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all required debt covenants and other restrictions related to debt
agreements.
Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $98 to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
during the first quarter of 2008.
Dividends paid to common stockholders. We declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share.
Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, declared regular 
quarterly dividends on its exchangeable shares totaling C$0.1260 per share. We paid dividends of $49 and $45 to 
common stockholders in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Proceeds from stock issuance. We received proceeds of $1,239 and $17 during the first quarter of 2009 and
2008, respectively, from the issuance of common stock. In February 2009 we completed a public offering of 
34,500,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1,236.
Discontinued Operations
Net operating cash used in discontinued operations was $nil and $100 in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, 
respectively. During the first quarter of 2008, we made tax payments of $127 related to the royalty portfolio sale.
Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $nil and $3 in the first quarter of 2009 and 
2008, respectively. Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2008 included accrued expense 
payments on the royalty portfolio sale of $8, partially offset by $5 in proceeds from the sale of assets at Pajingo.
50
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as discussed in Note 30 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, filed 
on February 19, 2009) and $807 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. We also provide 
a contingent support line of credit to PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara of which our pro-rata share is $11. We have sales 
agreements to sell copper concentrates at market prices as follows, in thousands of tons:

Environmental
Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming 
more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our 
operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and 
expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full 
amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory 
requirements. At March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, $620 and $617, respectively, were accrued for 
reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties.
In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former
mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various 
sites involved. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature 
with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general 
environmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $157 and $163 were 
accrued for such obligations at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate 
resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as 
much as 131% greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued at March 31, 2009. The amounts accrued for these 
matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates 
are charged to Other expense, net in the period estimates are revised.
For more information on the Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Notes 22 and 26 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, capital expenditures were approximately $46 and $16, respectively, to
comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a 
significant component of operating costs.
Newmont spent $6 and $2, respectively, during the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 for environmental obligations
related to the former, primarily historic, mining activities discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Post-Retirement Benefit Plan
In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Post-Retirement
Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP FAS 132(R)-1”), which amends FASB Statement No. 132 “Employers’ Disclosures about 
Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” (“FAS 132”), to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about 
plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The objective of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to 
require more detailed disclosures about employers’ plan assets, including employers’ investment strategies, major 
categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the 
fair value of plan assets. We adopted the provisions of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 on January 1, 2009. The provisions of this 
FSP are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes.
51
Equity Method Investment
In November 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached consensus on Issue No. 08-6, “Equity
Method Investment Accounting Considerations” (“EITF 08-6”), which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions 
and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The intent of EITF 08-6 is to provide guidance 
on (i) determining the initial measurement of an equity method investment, (ii) recognizing other-than-temporary 
impairments of an equity method investment and (iii) accounting for an equity method investee’s issuance of shares. 
EITF 08-6 was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and has been applied prospectively. The 
adoption of EITF 08-6 had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Equity-Linked Financial Instruments
In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or
Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (“EITF 07-5”). EITF 07-5 clarifies the determination of 
whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock, which would qualify as a scope 
exception under FASB Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 
133”). EITF 07-5 was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of EITF 07-5 had no 
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments
In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be 
Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (“FSP APB 14-1”). FSP APB 14-1 applies to 
convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, 
including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for 
as a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 
133”). FSP APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the 
scope of FSP APB 14-1 be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt 
borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the 
embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt 
and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component is reported as a debt discount and subsequently 
amortized to earnings over the instrument’s expected life using the effective interest method.
During July 2007, we completed an offering of $1,150 convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the
amount of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per 
annum, and the 2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum. 
The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.21 per share of common 
stock (24,887,956 shares of common stock). In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, we entered into 
convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions (“Call Spread Transactions”). These transactions 
included the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the 
conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27. As of March 31, 2009, the if-converted value did not 
exceed its principal amounts.
During February 2009, we completed an offering of $518 convertible senior notes due on February 15, 2012. 
The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s 
option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock (11,189,189 shares of common stock). 
As of March 31, 2009, the if-converted value did not exceed its principal amounts.
We have recorded the following in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the convertible senior notes:

FSP APB 14-1 required retrospective application to all periods presented. As a result of adopting FSP APB 14-
1, the effective interest rates increased by approximately 5 percentage points to 8.5%, 6.0% and 6.25% for the 2012, 
2014 and 2017 notes, respectively, for the non-cash amortization of the debt discount over the lives of the notes. 
Interest expense was increased by $8 which decreased our Income from continuing operations and Net income by 
$5 ($0.01 per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2008. Had FSP APB 14-1 been effective in 2008, we 
would have paid our fourth quarter 2008 dividends out of Additional paid-in capital rather than Retained earnings; 
therefore, we made the reclassification in 2009. Cash flows from operations were not impacted by the adoption of 
FSP APB 14-1. The impact on our 2009 opening balance in Retained earnings was as follows:

Following adoption and the issuance of the 2012 convertible senior notes in February 2009, we will amortize
$375 ($244 net of tax) of debt discount over the remaining lives of our convertible senior notes. For the three months 
ended March 31, 2009, we recorded $6 and $11 of interest expense for the contractual interest coupon and 
amortization of the debt discount, respectively, related to the convertible senior notes. The remaining unamortized 
debt discount will be amortized over the remaining 3, 5 and 8 year periods of the 2012, 2014 and 2017 convertible 
senior notes, respectively.
Accounting for the Useful Life of Intangible Assets
In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets” (“FSP 142-3”) which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension 
assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, 
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the 
useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure 
the fair value of the asset under FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”). 
FSP 142-3 was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and has been applied prospectively to 
intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The adoption of FSP 142-3 had no impact on our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Derivative Instruments
In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”) which provides revised guidance for 
enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the 
related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged 
items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. We adopted the provisions of FAS 
161 on January 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 161 had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of 
operation or cash flows. See Note 16 for our derivative instruments disclosure.
Business Combinations
In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 141(R) which replaces FAS 141, and provides new guidance for 
recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling 
interest in the acquiree. FAS 141(R) also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial 
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We adopted the provisions of 
FAS 141(R) on January 1, 2009 to be applied to all future business combinations. We expect to complete the 
acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington project in the second quarter. See Note 14 for our 
disclosure regarding the pending Boddington acquisition.
In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1, “Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies” (“FSP FAS 141(R)-1”), which amends and clarifies FAS 
141(R). The intent of FSP FAS 141(R)-1 is to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement, 
subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a 
business combination. This FSP is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business 
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We will apply the provisions of FSP FAS 
141(R)-1 to all future business combinations. See Note 14 for our disclosure regarding the pending Boddington 
acquisition.

Noncontrolling Interests
In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“FAS 160”) which establishes accounting and reporting 
standards pertaining to (i) ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent (”noncontrolling 
interest”), (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, (iii) changes in a 
parent’s ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary 
is deconsolidated. If a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former 
subsidiary is measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net income based on such fair value. For 
presentation and disclosure purposes, FAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a separate 
component of stockholders’ equity. We adopted the provisions of FAS 160 on January 1, 2009. Except for 
presentation changes, the adoption of FAS 160 had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of 
operation or cash flows.
Fair Value Accounting
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”). FAS 
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, 
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted the provisions of FAS 157 for assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued 
Staff Position No. 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP FAS 157-2”). FSP FAS 157-2 delayed 
the effective date of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at 
fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We adopted the provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 for our 
nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on January 1, 2009. Refer to Note 
15 for further details regarding our assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and 
Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not 
Orderly” (“FSP FAS 157-4”), which provides additional guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level 
of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances 
that indicate when a transaction is not orderly. In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 
124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” (“FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2”), 
which: 1) clarifies the interaction of the factors that should be considered when determining whether a debt security is
other than temporarily impaired, 2) provides guidance on the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment 
recognized in earnings and other comprehensive income and 3) expands the disclosures required for other-than-
temporary impairments for debt and equity securities. Also in April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 107-1 
and APB 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1”), 
which requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded 
companies as well as in annual financial statements. Adoption of these Staff Positions is required for our interim 
reporting period beginning April 1, 2009 with early adoption permitted. We adopted the provisions of FSP FAS 157-4, 
FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, and FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 for the interim period ended March 31, 2009. 
Refer to Note 15 for further details regarding our assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
