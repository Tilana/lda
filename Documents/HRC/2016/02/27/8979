</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its seventh session, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/36, called upon all 
States to cooperate fully with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his tasks, 
and to provide all necessary information requested by him; to react promptly to his/her urgent 
appeals and other communications and to consider favourably his/her requests for visits and for 
implementing his/her recommendations so that he/she may carry out his/her mandate more 
effectively. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with the above-mentioned provisions, the present report contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of general and individual allegations, as well as urgent 
appeals transmitted to Governments between 1 January and 31 December 2008, as well as replies 
received from Governments until 15 May 2009. Replies to communications received after 
15 May 2009 will be included in the next communications report of the Special Rapporteur, as 
well as replies not yet translated by that date.  
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur transmitted 420 communications 
on behalf of 1,116 persons to the Governments of 80 countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, 
Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, 
Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Chile, China (People&#8217;s Republic of), Colombia, Congo 
(Republic of the), Congo (Democratic Republic of the), Croatia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, 
El Salvador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Honduras, 
India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, 
Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, 
Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, 
Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uganda, 
United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, 
Yemen, and Zimbabwe.  
</p>
<p>4. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has reduced 
details of communications sent and received. The full text of all communications is available 
within the files of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. In reporting on the communications, the Special Rapporteur has used initials for those 
victims who, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, could be in a potentially sensitive situation, in 
order to respect their privacy and to prevent the possibility of further victimization. With a view 
to preserve the presumption of innocence, the Special Rapporteur omitted to include the names 
of alleged perpetrators, and of other individuals involved in the cases included in this report. 
Conversely, Governments&#8217; communications may contain names of persons and/or disclose 
specific situations linked to the violation.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate that violations and concerns regarding the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression are, to different extents, a common phenomenon in the 
whole world. Consequently, the exclusion or the inclusion of a particular country or territory 
should not be interpreted as the indication of any specific choice done by the Special Rapporteur 
regarding the analysis of trends and patterns of the implementation of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. </p>

</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Mr. Sayed Perwiz Kambaksh, a student and journalist at a local 
newspaper in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, Perwiz Kambakhsh was arrested 
on 27 October 2007, and on 22 January was sentenced to death by a primary court in the 
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif for &#8220;blasphemy&#8221;. He was convicted of downloading material 
from the internet that examined the role of women in Islam, adding some commentary and 
distributing it at Balkh University. He denies all this, saying that he had been coerced into 
making a &#8220;confession&#8221;. There are no legal grounds for either his conviction or his sentence. He 
was convicted under Article 347 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of five 
years&#8217; imprisonment, not the death penalty, for a person who disturbs or stops the conduct of 
religious ritual or damages religious places of worship. 
</p>
<p>9. According to the information received, on 31 October 2008 a three-judge panel commuted 
the death sentence given to Kambakhsh in January, but upheld the original conviction so that he 
was sentenced to 20 years in prison for &#8220;blasphemy&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 April 2007 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning Ms. Khadija Ahadi, deputy 
editor-in-chief of Radio Faryad and producer of a talk-show about political and social issues in 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>12. According to the information received, on 11 April 2008 unidentified gunmen carried out a 
grenade attack against Ms. Ahadi&#8217;s home in the Herat province. Over the past two months, she 
had been receiving anonymous calls in which she was warned to leave her job. On 6 April, in a 
similar grenade attack, part of her home was destroyed. According to sources, this attack could 
be part of efforts by hard-line groups to constrain the media, particularly in relation to the role of 
women as journalists and their right to work in the media.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the situation of Ms. Niloufar 
Habibi, presenter on the local public television station, Herat TV. 
</p>
<p>15. According to the information received, on 14 May 2008, Ms. Niloufar Habibi was injured 
on her way to the TV station by two men and a woman armed with a knife. They put her in a taxi 
and accompanied her to her office, warning her that &#8220;if [she does] not resign, the next time will 
be the end&#8221;. This incident was preceded by several threatening phone calls. 
</p>
<p>16. On 15 May, Ms. Niloufar Habibi was stabbed in her home in Herat by an unidentified 
woman. She was taken to a hospital and discharged on the same day. Since then, she has 
continued receiving death threats, and has repeatedly changed residence. Despite her appeals for 
help, Ms. Habibi did not receive any police protection. 
</p>
<p>17. In early May 2008, following threats from unidentified individuals to all public radio and 
TV employees, 13 male and female journalists resigned. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 17 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Ms. Jameela Rishteen Qadiry, a reporter for Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty (RFERL), an 
international news and broadcast organisation, and Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani, BBC World 
Service correspondent in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>20. According to information received, on 12 June 2008, Ms. Jameela Rishteen Qadiry, 
received two anonymous phone calls, during which the caller allegedly threatened her with the 
same fate as that of murdered BBC correspondent, Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani. The caller 
purportedly claimed that the threats issued against Ms. Jameela Rishteen Qadiry, were linked to 
her reporting, in particular, her coverage of issues related to the sensitive border region between 
Afghanistan and Iran. It is understood that the Afghan Independent Journalists&#8217; Association 
(AIJA) are in possession of a recording of the threats. 
</p>
<p>21. According to reports, on 8 June 2008, Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani, was found dead with 
gunshot wounds to the head, in a cemetery near Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand province. He 
had been abducted the previous day by armed men whilst driving to the provincial capital. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>Reports claim that prior to his death, Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani had received several threatening 
phone calls from a local chief who accused him of supporting the Kabul government and of 
boycotting news distributed by the Taliban. In 2006, Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani&#8217;s home was 
reportedly the target of an attack in his absence. 
</p>
<p>22. Concern was expressed that the threats issued against Ms. Jameela Rishteen Quadiry and 
the killing of Mr. Abdul Samad Rohani, may represent a direct attempt to stifle independent 
reporting and, thus restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case.

<p><b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations envoy&#233;e le 11 avril 2008 
</b></p>
<p>24. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du S&#233;cretaire-G&#233;n&#233;ral 
sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance 
des juges et des avocats, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant la situation de 
Me Abderrahman Amine Sidhoum, avocat et d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme, membre de 
l&#8217;organisation non-gouvernementale des droits de l&#8217;homme SOS Disparu(e)s. 
</p>
<p>25. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, le 30 mars 2008 le proc&#232;s pour diffamation de 
Me Sidhoum aurait eu lieu devant la premi&#232;re section p&#233;nale du Tribunal de Sidi M&#8217;hamed, &#224; 
Alger. Le 23 ao&#251;t 2006, Me Sidhoum aurait re&#231;u une convocation du juge d&#8217;instruction du 
tribunal de Sidi M&#8217;Hammed &#224; Alger qui le notifiait d&#8217;une plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e &#224; son encontre par le 
Ministre de la Justice pour &#171; diffamation &#187; &#224; la suite de ses d&#233;clarations publi&#233;es dans l&#8217;article 
&#171; Aoufi passe son trenti&#232;me mois en d&#233;tention &#187; paru dans le quotidien arabophone El Chourouk 
le 30 mai 2004. Me Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; accus&#233; de jeter le discr&#233;dit sur une d&#233;cision de Justice et 
de porter outrage &#224; un corps constitu&#233; de l&#8217;Etat. Lors de son entretien avec la journaliste auteure 
de l&#8217;article susmentionn&#233;, Me Sidhoum aurait d&#233;nonc&#233; la d&#233;tention arbitraire de son client dans 
la prison de Seradji qui durait depuis 30 mois. Cependant, la journaliste, alors journaliste 
stagiaire au quotidien, n&#8217;aurait pas rapport&#233; de mani&#232;re fid&#232;le les propos de Me Sidhoum, 
&#233;crivant que le client de ce dernier &#171; passe son trenti&#232;me mois &#224; Serkadji suite &#224; une d&#233;cision 
arbitraire rendue par la Cour Supr&#234;me &#187;. En effet, au moment o&#249; Me Sidhoum avait tenu ces 
propos, aucune d&#233;cision n&#8217;aurait encore &#233;t&#233; rendue par la Cour Supr&#234;me, qui ne se serait 
prononc&#233;e que le 28 avril 2005, soit un an apr&#232;s la parution de l&#8217;article. 
</p>
<p>26. Le 27 mai 2007, Me Sidhoum aurait re&#231;u un t&#233;l&#233;gramme lui notifiant sa convocation 
devant la 6&#232;me chambre d&#8217;accusation de Sidi M&#8217;Hamed, &#224; Alger, le 12 juin 2007, suite &#224; une 
demande de compl&#233;ment d&#8217;information effectu&#233;e par le procureur dans le cadre de ces 
poursuites. L&#8217;audience du 12 juin devait permettre une confrontation entre Me Sidhoum et une 
journaliste du quotidien El Chourouk, mais cette derni&#232;re ne s&#8217;&#233;tant pas pr&#233;sent&#233;e, l&#8217;audience 
aurait &#233;t&#233; repouss&#233;e &#224; une date ult&#233;rieure. Par la suite, l&#8217;audience aurait &#233;t&#233; repouss&#233;e &#224; de 
nombreuses reprises.  </p>

</p>
<p>27. A la fin de l&#8217;audition des parties le 30 mars 2008, le Procureur aurait requis deux ans de 
prison ferme contre Me Sidhoum. Le verdict est attendu le 13 avril. 
</p>
<p>28. De vives craintes sont r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;es quant au fait que les charges retenues contre Me Amine 
Sidhoum viseraient &#224; emp&#234;cher ce dernier de poursuivre ses actions en faveur de la d&#233;fense des 
droits des familles de disparus au sein de SOS Disparu(e)s.  
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>29. Le 27 avril 2008, le Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 11 avril 2008, 
indiquant que, s&#8217;agissant des deux affaires ant&#233;rieures reprises dans l&#8217;appel urgent cit&#233; ci-dessus, 
la Mission Permanente voudrait rappeler au Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de 
l&#8217;homme que le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien avait d&#233;j&#224; fourni des r&#233;ponses qui ont fait l&#8217;objet des 
deux envois suivants : note verbale KH/NO 554/06 du 20 juillet 2006 et note verbale 
MPAG/MedB/SS/AA/N&#176; 458/07 du 26 juin 2007. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien consid&#232;re, en 
cons&#233;quence, que ces deux affaires sont closes. Il estime que la r&#233;p&#233;tition dans l&#8217;&#233;vocation des 
ces deux cas dans l&#8217;appel urgent susmentionn&#233;, constitue une tentative de cr&#233;dibiliser le pr&#233;sum&#233; 
d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien souligne, &#224; cet &#233;gard, que la nouelle 
affaire dont est justiciable M. Abderrahmane Amine Sidhoum est sans rapport avec les activit&#233;s 
priv&#233;es de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme comme tente de le faire accr&#233;diter la source de 
l&#8217;all&#233;gation et remonte &#224; l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2004. Enfin, on affirme que la r&#233;ponse de fond du 
Gouvernement alg&#233;rien sera communiqu&#233;e en temps utile, au Haut Commissariat des

peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire

l&#8217;Intersyndicale autonome de la fonction publique. 
</p>
<p>32. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 13 avril 2008, des membres de l&#8217;Intersyndicale autonome 
de la fonction publique se seraient mis en gr&#232;ve afin de protester contre le projet de 
revalorisation des salaires, &#233;labor&#233; par le gouvernement qui n&#8217;aurait consult&#233; aucun syndicat.  
</p>
<p>33. Le 15 avril, ces m&#234;mes membres auraient demand&#233; &#224; rencontrer le Premier Ministre 
Abdelaziz Belkhadem afin de lui faire part de leur d&#233;saccord sur ce projet, en vain du fait de </p>

</p>
<p>l&#8217;intervention des hommes des Unit&#233;s r&#233;publicaines de s&#233;curit&#233;. Les syndicalistes seraient alors 
pass&#233;s outre l&#8217;interdiction de manifester, en vigueur depuis 2001, et auraient organis&#233; un 
rassemblement sur la place de la Grande Poste, o&#249; ils auraient exhib&#233; des banderoles critiquant le 
gouvernement. Les policiers auraient alors eu recours &#224; la force pour s&#8217;emparer des banderoles, 
bousculant, insultant et prenant &#224; partie les manifestants. Les forces anti-&#233;meutes, appel&#233;es en 
renfort, auraient charg&#233; les manifestants et fait usage de leurs matraques, arr&#234;tant sept 
enseignants en fin de matin&#233;e, qui auraient finalement &#233;t&#233; rel&#226;ch&#233;s dans l&#8217;apr&#232;s-midi. Une 
militante du Conseil des lyc&#233;es d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie aurait &#233;t&#233; violemment prise &#224; partie et un membre du 
Conseil national autonome des professeurs de l&#8217;enseignement secondaire et technique aurait &#233;t&#233; 
tra&#238;n&#233; par la veste dans la rue, arr&#234;t&#233;, puis imm&#233;diatement rel&#226;ch&#233; sous la pression de ses 
coll&#232;gues. 
</p>
<p>34. Au total, 10 personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es, auditionn&#233;es puis rel&#226;ch&#233;es quelques heures 
plus tard et des proc&#232;s-verbaux auraient &#233;t&#233; dress&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>35. Des craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les arrestations des syndicalistes par les

<p>39. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, le 16 juin 2008 aura lieu le proc&#232;s en appel de 
Me Amine Sidhoum Abderramane devant la Cour d&#8217;Alger. Me Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e 
en premi&#232;re instance par le Tribunal de Sidi M&#8217;hamed &#224; 6 mois de prison avec sursis et 
20,000 dinars d&#8217;amende pour diffamation &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard d&#8217;une d&#233;cision de justice &#224; la suite de ses 
d&#233;clarations publi&#233;es dans l&#8217;article &#171; Aoufi passe son trenti&#232;me mois en d&#233;tention &#187; paru dans le 
quotidien arabophone El Chourouk le 30 mai 2004. Me Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; accus&#233; de jeter le 
discr&#233;dit sur une d&#233;cision de Justice et de porter outrage &#224; un corps constitu&#233; de l&#8217;Etat. Lors de 
son entretien avec la journaliste auteure de l&#8217;article susmentionn&#233;, Me Sidhoum aurait d&#233;nonc&#233; la 
d&#233;tention arbitraire de son client dans la prison de Seradji qui durait depuis 30 mois. Cependant, 
la journaliste, alors journaliste stagiaire au quotidien, n&#8217;aurait pas rapport&#233; de mani&#232;re fid&#232;le les

suite &#224; une d&#233;cision arbitraire rendue par la Cour Supr&#234;me &#187;. En effet, au moment o&#249; 
Me Sidhoum avait tenu ces propos, aucune d&#233;cision n&#8217;aurait encore &#233;t&#233; rendue par la Cour 
Supr&#234;me, qui ne se serait prononc&#233;e que le 28 avril 2005, soit un an apr&#232;s la parution de l&#8217;article. 
</p>
<p>40. De vives craintes sont r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;es quant au fait que les charges retenues contre Me Sidhoum 
viseraient &#224; emp&#234;cher ce dernier de poursuivre ses actions en faveur de la d&#233;fense des droits des 
familles de disparus au sein de SOS Disparu(e)s.

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement

<p>41. Le 11 juillet 2008, le Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 13 juin 2008, 
indiquant que Monsieur Abderhamane Amine Sihoum a fait l&#8217;objet de poursuites engag&#233;es &#224; son

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>48. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial regrette de devoir constater qu&#8217;il n&#8217;a re&#231;u &#224; ce jour aucune r&#233;ponse

<p><b>Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 9 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression sent a letter of allegation concerning radio broadcasting regulations in Angola 
and the temporary suspension of the private radio station Radio Despertar.  
</p>
<p>50. According to the information received, on 8 July 2008 the Ministry of 
Telecommunications ordered the suspension for 180 days of Radio Despertar. The radio station 
had allegedly breached its license by broadcasting beyond the geographical boundaries of the 
city of Luanda. Private radios are reportedly not allowed to broadcast beyond a 50 km radius 
from the location where they are based. The suspension of Radio Despertar kept it from 
operating until after the Parliamentary elections. 
</p>
<p>51. Concern is expressed that the regulation preventing private radios from broadcasting 
beyond a 50 km radius from their base constitutes an undue limitation on the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the related right to impart information. Further concern is expressed 
that the suspension of Radio Despertar during the electoral process impeded its capacity to report 
during the electoral process, thereby also limiting the freedom of opinion and expression during 
such an important time. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case.  
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 10 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegation to 
the Government concerning the closure of Mpalabanda (Associa&#231;&#227;o C&#237;vica de Cabinda) 
and the attempt to close the Association for Justice Peace and Democracy (AJPD), two 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to the defense of human rights. Mpalanda 
has reported on alleged human rights violations perpetrated in the name of both Government and 
opposition parties. It has also spoken out against shortcomings in the peace process in Angola. 
The AJPD works to monitor and report on human rights violations, particularly regarding prison 
conditions, and provide human rights training to police in Angola. It has worked to defend the 
right to democracy by providing impartial information to the public in the run-up to the elections 
of 5 and 6 September 2008, and by speaking out about shortcomings in the elections process. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>54. On 14 August 2007, the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General sent a letter 
of allegation to your Government regarding public statements made by the Director General of 
the Government&#8217;s Technical Unit of Humanitarian Aid (UTCAH) about SOS - Habitat, M&#227;os 
Livres, the Angolan branch of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, and Justice, Peace 
and Democracy. The Director General reportedly made false accusations that these organizations 
carried out illegal acts, and expressed the intention to have them closed down. We have not yet 
received a response from your Government. 
</p>
<p>55. According to the information received, on 31 August 2000 the year when the AJPD was 
founded, its legal statute was deposited and published in the Government Gazette. In 2003, a 
case was reportedly lodged in the Supreme Court against the AJPD for failing to alter its legal 
statute. Despite several attempts by the AJPD to verify the status of its case, it has received no 
response. On 3 September 2008, the Director of the AJPD was requested to appear before the 
Constitutional Court the following day. At the Constitutional Court he was informed that a case 
to close his organization down had been presented by the Procurator General. According to the 
Procurator General, the AJPD&#8217;s legal statute contravenes articles 2 and 7 of the Angolan Law of 
Associations by allowing collective bodies to be part of the AJPD. The Procurator General 
claims that article 6 of the AJPD&#8217;s legal statute also contravenes the Law of Associations by 
allowing the AJPD to take part in political activities. In addition, it is claimed that articles 2 
and 7 of the Angolan Law of Associations do not state specifically that collective bodies cannot 
form part of an association. 
</p>
<p>56. Previously, attempts have been made to close down various other human rights NGOs in 
Angola. On 20 July 2006, the Provincial Court of Cabinda closed down Mpalabanda, accusing 
the NGO of inciting violence and hatred, and of carrying out political activities rather than being 
a civil society organization. When the court&#8217;s decision was made to close Mpalanda, the 
allegations of promotion of violence and hatred were not mentioned and no witnesses were 
called to give evidence in relation to these allegations.  
</p>
<p>57. Concern was expressed that the closure of Mpalanda, and the threats to close the AJPB, 
SOS - Habitat, M&#227;os Livres and the Angolan branch of the Open Society Initiative for Southern 
Africa could be related to their activities in the defense of human rights. Further concern was 
expressed that this could contribute to an environment of hostility against organizations which 
work to defend human rights in Angola, particularly in light of the recent closure of the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the country following the 
decision taken by the authorities not to sign an agreement which would have formally 
established the Office. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>58. On 21 October 2008, the Government acknowledged receipt of joint communications 
AL/GSO 214 (67 14) G/SO 214 (107 6) from the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression of the Human Rights Council and 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>59. The Angolan Government noted that it had carefully examined the matters referred to in 
the communications and wished to submit the following response. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>60. &#8220;First of all, it should be born in mind that Angola is a sovereign Nation and a multi-party 
democracy with legitimate State institutions able to deal with all cases pertaining to the rights of 
the citizens. Its Government as well as its Parliament are elected and reflect the will of the people 
whose overwhelming majority gave a mandate to act on his behalf. The policies and the 
programme of political parties, including the ruling party, were all submitted recently to scrutiny 
in free and fair elections monitored by the international community. The turn-out went 
beyond 75 per cent of the 8 million registered voters.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>61. The powers of the executive and legislative branches are not unchecked. Our judiciary is 
independent, and despite its weaknesses due to the lack of adequate human and financial 
resources, by and large, serves in a balanced way the right to justice that every citizen is entitled 
to. In order to make it more efficient and up to date the judiciary is undergoing a thorough 
overhaul. Accordingly, a Constitutional Court was set up. The criminal and the civilian codes 
dating both from the colonial rule are being revised. New legislation is being introduced to deal 
with the new challenges in terns of new forms of crimes and to consolidate the democratic 
system.  
</p>
<p>62. Even before this process of reform was set in motion, Angola was known for possessing 
one of the most open domestic legislation governing the right to association. That&#8217;s no wonder 
that so far more than 400 (four hundred) associations have registered in the Ministry of Justice. 
Most of them working on human rights issues, but also on education, children care, community 
organization, women empowerment, etc. 
</p>
<p>63. Since their inception, all of them, but one, have never bee subjected to any sort of banning 
related to their operations. The decision to ban the organization referred to in your letter 
(Mpalabanda) was not issued by an administrative authority. It was issued by a competent court, 
following due process. The merit of the complaint was the nonconformity of the recent practices 
of the leaders of said organization with the law. 
</p>
<p>64. Mpalabanda had been given, as a defendant, the right to be represented by a lawyer and to 
present arguments in its defence. It also did exhaust all domestic remedies at the national level, 
appealing to higher Court. 
</p>
<p>65. The Court of first instance found Mpalabanda most recent leadership practices contrary to 
the purpose set fourth in its registration process. I must add for your reflection that the leader of 
that organization is currently a member of parliament after running as a member of a political 
party. If this doesn&#8217;t tell all, other Mpalabanda leaders also run in the ticket of political parties. It 
goes without saying that in fact there was a very thin line between Mpalabanda latest practices 
and political activity. To do political activity you must register as a political party not as human 
rights NGO which was the case of that organization. 
</p>
<p>66. As for the AJPD, a legal procedure was initiated by the office of the attorney general for 
that organization to alter some of the articles of its statute as recommended by the Ministry of 
Justice when it submitted its papers to be granted legal status. It must be pointed out that this 
organization was given a provisional authorization to operate pending the conclusion or suppress 
its existence; otherwise it would have taken place at the same time when the application was 
submitted. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>67. The concerned organization is not prevented to make its case before the pertinent 
instances. What is taking place now is a legal procedure, a legal battle and, as you may know, it 
is not appropriate to jump to hasty conclusions or make considerations on a case that is still 
subjudice. Besides, this a court case not a government procedure.  
</p><p>68. It is assumed that the rule of the law implies that every citizen, individually or organized, 
play by the rules, unless the distinguished special Rapporteurs want to make exceptions when it 
comes to Angola. The merit of both parties&#8217; arguments will be decided upon only at the end of 
the legal procedure by the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>69. Further clear indications that our laws are intended to facilitate the realization of the right 
to association as protected by the constitution, rather than making it more difficult, can be 
drawn from the law on political association. Under this bill, which governs the creation and 
operation of political parties, more than 98 (ninety eight political parties) for a population of 
roughly 15 million inhabitants were formed and registered in the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>70. As far as freedom of expression is concerned, a dozen of independent newspapers and half 
dozens radio stations run by private entrepreneurs without any interference by the state in their 
editorial lines. They criticize, some times very harshly, the Government and the Head of the 
State, however there are no reports whatsoever that any of them have been closed down or 
prevented from carry on their normal business. International press, printed, broadcasted and 
televised is allowed freely. We challenge anyone to say the contrary. 
</p>
<p>71. Angola has a strong and well known record of abiding by its international obligations 
particularly when it comes to human rights. In thirty three years as independent State and 
member of the United Nations and the former OAU, today&#8217;s African Union, not a single 
resolution of condemnation was issued against the government of Angola as regards to human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>72. Despite all the odds, including a brutal war fuelled and supported by many of those who 
today repeat over and over again the same baseless and unfounded accusations, hoping to label 
and discredit our government as failing to protect human rights, we painstakingly come a long 
way surmounting all obstacles, in a human and peaceful manner, and eventually successfully 
managed to establish a reunited, reconciled and democratic country that Africa is proud of. 
</p>
<p>73. Were not for our firm commitment to democracy, rule of law human rights and freedom, 
the impressive performance Angola is currently achieving in all domains would be impossible. 
</p>
<p>74. Our tremendous success is a god sent opportunity not only for Angolan citizens but as well 
as for thousands of immigrants from African sister nations who drifted from countries as far as in 
west Africa into Angola looking for a better future. That wouldn&#8217;t happen have Angola had a 
record and practice of harassment of people rights.

<p>76. El Relator Especial junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de 
los derechos humanos enviaron un llamamiento urgente, se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del

Trabajadores Argentinos (CTA) y testigo en causas judiciales por violaciones de derechos 
humanos cometidas durante los a&#241;os de la dictadura en Argentina. 
</p>
<p>77. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 14 de agosto de 2008 el Sr. Nahuel Pino 
habr&#237;a sido secuestrado por cuatro desconocidos en la Ciudad de la Plata en camino a la sede de 
la CTA. Los desconocidos le habr&#237;an obligado a subir en una combi blanca. All&#237; le habr&#237;an atado 
las manos con precintos, cubierto la cabeza con una bolsa de pl&#225;stico y as&#237; le habr&#237;an asfixiado. 
Fue golpeado y los secuestradores habr&#237;an apagado cigarrillos en su cuerpo, diciendo &#8220;que se 
deje de joder&#8221;, que &#8220;cierre la boca&#8221; y que abandone su militancia por los derechos de los pueblos 
originarios. 
</p>
<p>78. Despu&#233;s de una hora le habr&#237;an liberado. El Sr. Nahuel Pino fue al hospital para atenci&#243;n 
m&#233;dica. Luego habr&#237;a denunciado el secuestro en la Comisar&#237;a 9&#186; y la fiscal&#237;a correspondiente. 
Adem&#225;s, habr&#237;a notificado a los Ministros de Seguridad, Trabajo y Justicia, y al Jefe del 
Gabinete de lo que le habr&#237;a pasado.  
</p>
<p>79. Se ha expresado gran preocupaci&#243;n que el secuestro del Sr. Nahuel Pino pudiese estar

expresa preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Sr. Nahuel Pino. Dado que han 
ocurrido otros secuestros recientes de defensores de los derechos humanos en Argentina - entre 
ellos sindicalistas y testigos en causas judiciales por violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas 
durante los a&#241;os de la dictadura - este incidente se enmarca en un contexto de gran 
vulnerabilidad de los defensores de los derechos humanos.

<p>89. Por carta enviada el 16 de enero de 2009 el Gobierno de Argentina puso a disposici&#243;n la 
siguiente informaci&#243;n: 
</p>
<p>90. &#8220;Funcionarios de la mencionada Secretaria de Estado mantuvieron una reuni&#243;n con 
integrantes de la fundaci&#243;n &#8220;Pelota de Trapo&#8221; el 1 de octubre de 2008. La misma brind&#243; la

Presidency of Mr. Ter-Petrossian, and Mr. Ararat Zurabian, Chairman of the Board of the ANM. 
</p>
<p>111. According to information received, on 25 and 26 March, at least 60 opposition supporters 
in Yerevan were arrested and detained by police. The protesters were reportedly peacefully 
demonstrating against restrictions imposed on public assemblies and gatherings, through new 
legislation passed on 17 March following the presidential elections and the subsequent 
imposition of a state of emergency declared by the incumbent President Kocharian on 1 March, 
which lasted for 20 days.  
</p>
<p>112. The protesters arrested on 25 and 26 March were all reportedly released after several hours 
in detention, but reports indicated that, on 27 March, another 21 opposition supporters were 
arrested and detained. These individuals were believed to remain in detention but it was not 
known whether any charges had been brought against them. Members of another opposition 
party, the Republic Party, and officials who refused to provide false testimony against opposition 
activists, had also been arrested. 
</p>
<p>113. It is believed that a total of 102 persons had been subjected to two months of pre-trial 
detention and charged with crimes related to the incidents of 1 March pursuant to one or more of 
the following articles of the Armenian Criminal Code: 225 (mass disorder), 235 (illegal 
possession of weapons), 300 (usurping state power), 301 (public calls of changing the 
constitutional order by force), or 316 (violence against a representative of authorities).  </p>

</p>
<p>114. In a number of cases detainees were held incommunicado for days. Relatives of the 
detainees were not informed about the place of detention or even the fact of their detention. It is 
further reported that protocols of detention were falsified to give the wrong impression that the 
applicable 72 hours rule, according to which an arrested person must be presented before a judge 
or released, had been formally observed. A number of detainees had been detained 
incommunicado for up 10-12 days. Numerous obstacles were put up to prevent the detainees 
from exercising their right to access to counsel, including requirements for the investigator&#8217;s 
signature before being able to visit clients in pre-trial detention facilities or intimidating 
detainees in order to make them sign a document voluntarily refusing access to counsel. Some of 
the detainees showed visible signs of abuse when eventually permitted to receive visits. 
</p>
<p>115. Mr. Ter-Petrossian was taken from Liberty Square in the capital of Yerevan 
on 2 March 2008 by members of the presidential security squad after police and security forces 
had dispersed demonstrations by supporters of the opposition, which, according to official 
records, resulted in the death of 8 persons and approximately 260 injured. Mr. Ter-Petrossian 
was taken to his house, which was surrounded by police. Authorities have denied that 
Mr. Ter-Petrossian is under house arrest and alleged that the measure was taken for his 
own protection. A freedom of movement petition filed on behalf of Mr. Ter-Petrossian was 
rejected. However, the court decided to assign the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office to 
investigate into the reasons for the restrictions of movement imposed upon Mr. Ter-Petrossian. 
Mr. Aleksandr Arzoumanian and Mr. Ararat Zurabian were arrested on 10 March in Yerevan, 
taken to the headquarters of the National Security Service and charged with &#8220;plotting the violent 
overthrow of Government&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>116. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned individuals may 
be related to their activities in defense of human rights, particularly their peaceful exercise of the 
right to freedom of assembly and to take part in the conduct of public affairs. In view of reports 
of incommunicado detention further concerns were expressed for their physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention. Concern was also expressed as regards any legislation 
which seeks to curb the right to freedom of assembly.

Letter of allegations sent on 24 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent a letter of allegations to the Government in relation to Mr. Emin Huseynov, Chairperson of 
the Institute for Reporters&#8217; Freedom and Safety (IRFS), and Messrs. Rasim Aliyev and 
Mirrehim Hasanov, researchers for the organization. The IRFS is a non-governmental 
journalists&#8217; organization promoting freedom of expression. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>119. According to information received, at midday on 12 June 2008, Emin Huseynov was 
observing and filming a protest outside the Presidential Administration Building in Baku. He 
was approached by a number of men in civilian clothes who detained him and brought him into 
the building. He was then interrogated for two hours by men in military uniforms as to the 
reasons for filming, and regarding the work carried out by the IRFS and the origin of the 
organization&#8217;s funding. Upon his release, Mr. Huseynov&#8217;s confiscated documents and camera 
were returned to him. However, all of his photographs had been removed and he was threatened 
with arrest if he returned to that area. No explanation was given for his detention.  
</p>
<p>120. On 14 June 2008, Mr. Huseynov was again detained, along with Mr. Rasim Aliyev and 
Mr. Mirrehim Hasanov, following a raid by police of an event to mark the 80th birthday of 
Che Guevara, which the three men were monitoring. These three men, together with others 
detained at the event, were taken to Nasimi District Police Department 22, where Mr. Huseynov 
protested against the photographing and fingerprinting of all those detained.  
</p>
<p>121. Mr. Huseynov was then separated from all of the detainees and brought to another room 
with four police officers present. One of them told him, &#8220;I&#8217;ll arrest you, I&#8217;ll kill, and I&#8217;ll bury 
you&#8221;. He was hit on the back of the neck several times with the handle of a gun, and asked that 
an ambulance be called, as he was having difficulty walking. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Huseynov 
was taken out of the room and the police department. Mr. Huseynov subsequently lost 
consciousness and was hospitalized at the Centralized Emergency Medical Assistance Hospital 
where he was diagnosed with head and brain trauma, but has since regained consciousness. 
Messrs Aliyev and Hasamov were released approximately seven hours later. 
</p>
<p>122. Concern was expressed that the detention of the three men and the ill-treatment of 
Mr. Huseynov while in detention may have been directly related to their activities in the defense 
of human rights.

<p>124. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Mr. Nusrat Aliyev, husband of human rights defender Akifa Aliyeva. 
</p>
<p>125. According to the information received, in July 2008, a criminal case was filed against 
Mr. Nusrat Aliyev under article 128 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan, for the alleged assault 
of Ms. Akifa Aliyeva&#8217;s brother. On 24 July 2008, Mr. Nusrat Aliyev was ordered to pay criminal 
damages and may face trial. Ms. Akifa Aliyeva, the wife of Mr. Nusrat Aliyev is the Coordinator 
of the Ganja branch of the Helsinki Citizens&#8217; Assembly of Azerbaijan. She was involved in the 
defence of a member of the Ukrainian minority in Azerbaijan, and was threatened that if she 
continued involvement in the case, her husband would be arrested. </p>

further concern was also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Nusrat Aliyev and Ms. Akifa Aliyeva, as well as that of their son, Mr. Javid Aliyev.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 26 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the detention and 
sentencing of Mr. Novruzali Mammadov, Head of the Talysh Cultural Centre, and the detention 
of his son, Mr. Emil Mammadov. Mr. Novruzali Mammadov is a defender of the cultural rights 
of the Talysh people in the south of Azerbaijan. 
</p><p>129. According to information received, on 2 February 2007, Mr. Novruzali Mammadov was 
called to the Ministry of Internal Affairs where he was interrogated about his participation at a 
science conference in Iran in 2004 and beaten. He was released but later detained again the 
following day when he was sentenced to 15 days&#8217; imprisonment for failing to cooperate with 
police officers. This sentence was passed despite the fact that Mr. Novrulazi Mammadov was 
already over 65 and, according to a provision of Article 30 of the Administrative Code, citizens 
of that age cannot be sentenced to punishment such as custodial placement.  
</p>
<p>130. Mr. Novrulazi spent 15 days in the Investigation Isolation Centre of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and was physically and psychologically pressurized to confess to espionage. He 
did not have access to legal support and his whereabouts were unknown to his relatives. 
On 17 February 2007, he was accused under Article 274 of the Criminal Code of high treason 
and espionage. He has been in detention since then. 
</p>
<p>131. On 24 June 2008, Mr. Novruzali Mammadov was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment 
following a closed trial. His lawyer was reportedly not present when the verdict was announced 
in an empty room. Mr. Novruzali Mammadov was charged with high treason and espionage. The 
charges were related to the gathering of information necessary to establish an administrative 
autonomy in Azerbaijani territories with a dense Talysh population and the damaging of 
Azerbaijan&#8217;s image abroad through sending appeals to international organizations about human 
rights violations against Talysh people.  
</p>
<p>132. During his trial Mr. Novruzali Mammadov pleaded not guilty and testified that he had been 
subjected to physical and psychological torture while in detention. The forms of torture to which 
he was allegedly subjected include beating, deprivation of food and water, interrogation at night, 
and threats against his family. He is currently awaiting the hearing of his appeal in detention at a 
pretrial prison. Following the sentencing of Mr. Novruzali Mammadov, a number of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>clarifications were made with respect to the sentence. However, these clarifications were 
reportedly based on confessions of a journalist which may have been obtained through torture 
and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>133. Furthermore, on 16 July 2008, Mr. Emil Mammadov, the son of 
Mr. Navrulazi Mammadov, was detained for illegal possession of drugs. On 19 July 2008, 
he was sentenced to three months&#8217; pretrial detention before investigations were scheduled to 
start. However, because of a medical condition, Mr. Emil Mammadov always carried 
prescription drugs and no information was given by police in relation to the drugs found on his 
person. He is currently detained in the investigatory jail of the Ministry of Justice without access 
to his family or legal representation, and potentially without access to the necessary medical 
care. Both Mr. Emil Mammadov and his now deceased brother have reportedly been abducted 
and subjected to physical and psychological ill-treatment in the past. 
</p><p>134. Concern was expressed that the ill-treatment and sentencing of Mr. Novrulazi Mammadov, 
as well as the detention of Mr. Emil Mammadov, may be related to his legitimate activities in the 
defense of the cultural rights of the Talysh people. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Novrulazi Mammadov and that of his family 
members. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>135. In a letter dated 13 March 2009, the Government replied to the communication above. In 
its response, the Government informed that during the examination the information about the 
physical and psychological pressure on Novruzali Mammadov did not prove to be accurate. The 
forensic medical examination revealed no injuries on his body. The Government also provided 
the following information: 
</p>
<p>136. &#8220;It was found that since 1992 Novruzali Mammadov carried out hostile activities against 
the Republic of Azerbaijan by helping Special Services of foreign country, providing them with 
special information, finding and contacting persons having required information, providing that 
country with information about those persons. It was also proved that by cooperating 
confidentially with these organizations aimed at carrying out separatist propaganda in the area of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan where Tallishs live, he accepted money from the organizations for 
implementing these activities and was involved with these activities since then till his 
imprisonment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>137. Novruzali Mammadov Khanmammad oglu was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, 
alongside the confiscation of property according to the judgement dated 27.06.2008 of the Courts 
of Serious Crimes of the Republic of Azerbaijan, being charged by Article 274 of the Criminal 
Code&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>139. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government regarding the situation of Mr. Sakit Zahidov, poet and journalist at the 
daily newspaper, Azadlig. Staff of the Azadlig newspaper have been the subject of three previous 
communications sent to your Government by mandate holders, the most recent of which was sent 
on the 10 March 2006, on behalf of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>140. According to information received, on 19 August 2008, Mr. Sakit Zahidov was visited by 
his lawyer at Prison N14, located 75 km from Baku, and informed his lawyer that his life is in 
grave danger. One of his fellow inmates was allegedly provided with scissors and ordered to kill 
him. Reports claim that prison authorities may have instigated the order. Mr. Sakit Zahidov 
immediately reported the incident to the penitentiary and requested a transfer to a different 
prison. A representative of the prison service met with Mr. Zahidov and told him that his request 
will be positively resolved. 
</p>
<p>141. According to reports, the prison authorities have consistently refused to move 
Mr. Sakit Zahidov to the prison&#8217;s medical department, despite his heart and stomach ailments, 
except when he was on hunger strike in July and again in October 2007. There are reports that 
detainees who have contact with Mr. Sakit Zahidov face problems within the prison, such as 
having their appeals for alternative punishments or early release disregarded. On 
20 August 2008, representatives from the office of the Ombudsman for the 
Republic of Azerbaijan visited Mr. Zahidov in prison.  
</p><p>142. Mr. Sakit Zahidov was arrested on 23 June 2006, on allegedly fabricated charges of 
possession of illegal narcotics with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to three years in prison 
on 4 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>143. While the visit by representatives from the Ombudsman&#8217;s office is welcomed, concern was 
expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Sakit Zahidov. Further concern is 
expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zahidov may represent a direct attempt to prevent 
independent reporting in Azerbaijan, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>144. By letter dated 4 March 2009, the Government replied to the communication above. The 
Government informed that according to the verdict of the Serious Offenses Court of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan of 4 October 2006, Salcit Salim Zahidov was imprisoned for three years 
being charged under Article 234.1 of the Criminal Code, i.e. illegal purchase or storage without a 
purpose of selling of narcotics or psychotropic substances in a quantity exceeding necessary for 
personal consumption. The Government informed that in accordance with relevant international 
instruments, all necessary procedures for the protection of S. Zahidov&#8217;s rights had been carried 
out. The Government further noted that the application submitted by S. Zahidov&#8217;s lawyer to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office regarding the threat to his life was taken as a serious warning, 
relevant instructions were given by the administration of the ministry and comprehensive 
investigation was carried out. However issues indicated in the application as well as illegal 
treatment of convicts by the prison administration and hunger strike because of that had not been 
proved during the investigation. 
</p>
<p>145. The Government also noted that during his detention, S. Zahidov met with the 
representatives of different international and non-governmental organizations, as well as 
representatives of the OSCE Baku Office, co-rapporteurs of the Council of Europe on 
Azerbaijan, representatives of the Social Committee, Azerbaijan Committee against Torture for 
several times and stated that he had no complaints against administration of the establishment. 
</p>
<p>146. The Government stated that &#8220;concerns of special-mandate holders about imprisonment and 
custody of S. Zahidov as a possible intervention aiming at creating obstacles to freedom of 
speech and thought are groundless. S. Zahidov was held criminally liable for perpetrating the 
crime of illicit circulation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances provided for only in the 
Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan and sentenced to imprisonment according to the 
verdict of the court&#8221;. The Government also provided extensive information concerning the 
domestic legislation on freedom of opinion and expression.

<p>148. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations to the Government regarding the 
situation of Ms. Malahet Nasibova and Mr. Ilgar Nasibov, correspondents with Radio Liberty 
and Mr. Elman Abbasov, a reporter with the Institute for Reporters&#8217; Freedom and Safety (IRFS) 
in Baku. 
</p>
<p>149. According to information received, on the morning of 27 August 2008, a confrontation 
ensued between the police and residents of the village of Nahrem, in Azerbaijan&#8217;s Autonomous 
Republic of Nakhchivan. Ms. Malahet Nasibova, Mr. Ilgar Nasibov and Mr. Elman Abbasov 
were in the village to report on the incident. During the altercation, approximately 8 members of 
the village, including the chairman of the municipality, reportedly assaulted the three journalists. 
Some members of the crowd, who were allegedly intoxicated at the time, grabbed the video 
camera and dictaphone belonging to Mr. Abbasov, as well as Ms. Nasibova&#8217;s mobile phone, and 
smashed them on the ground. The three journalists sustained injuries during the attack and the 
IRFS video recording of the confrontation was destroyed.  
</p>
<p>150. Reports claim that police officers present when the attack took place did not intervene to 
protect the journalists. An attempt by the journalists to file a complaint at the Nahrem police 
station was reportedly rejected. </p>

<p>153. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the government concerning Mr. Ali Jassim Meki, a human rights defender with 
close links to the HAQ Movement of Liberties and Democracy, and the arrest and detention of 
the following eleven human rights defenders: Mr. Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein 
Abdul-Aal, Mr. Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh, Mr. Maytham Bader Jassim Al-Sheikh, 
Mr. Majid Salman Ibrahim Al-Haddad, Mr. Ahmad Jaffar Mohammed Ali, Mr. Hassan 
Abdulnabi, Mr. Nader Ali Ahmad Al-Salatna, Mr. Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan, members of the 
Unemployment Committee, as well as Mr. Naji Ali Fateel, member of the Bahrain Youth Society 
for Human Rights, Mr. Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais, head of the Committee to Combat 
High Prices, and Mr. Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab, founding member of the Martyrs and 
Victims of Torture Committee. They were reportedly all being detained at the Criminal 
Investigations Department, (CID) in Adliya. Mr. Hassan Abdulnabi was the subject of a joint 
urgent appeal sent by mandate-holders on 14 December 2005.  
</p>
<p>154. According to information received, on 17 December 2007 a demonstration was held in the 
Sanabis area, organized to commemorate victims of torture in the past. The demonstration was 
violently dispersed by members of the riot police and of the special security force. Tear gas and 
rubber bullets were employed by security forces and some participants were beaten.  
</p>
<p>155. After the demonstration, Mr. Ali Jassim Meki returned to his home, where his condition 
rapidly deteriorated. He died some hours later on his way to hospital. The autopsy subsequently 
conducted by government-assigned doctors stated that he had died of natural causes. 
Mr. Ali Jassim Meki&#8217;s family requested a second opinion of an independent specialist, but was 
reportedly informed that there was none available in the country. 
</p>
<p>156. Following this, and other similar demonstrations, a number of people, including at least the 
aforementioned eleven human rights defenders, were arrested between 21 and 
28 December 2007. All of them have been accused of having taken part in an &#8220;illegal gathering 
and rioting&#8221; and of &#8220;theft of a weapon and ammunition and possession of a weapon and 
ammunition without permission&#8221;. For the first ten days of their detention they were denied 
access to their lawyers, and interrogations carried out inside the detention chambers and at the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office were conducted without the presence of a lawyer. The Public </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor is refusing to pass a copy of the case files, detailing the charges, to a group of lawyers 
defending the activists. Some of the human rights defenders have been ill-treated and possibly 
tortured while in detention. Visitors from human rights organizations have been refused access.  
</p>
<p>157. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the 
above-mentioned eleven human rights defenders while in detention. Further concern was 
expressed that the death of Mr. Ali Jassim Meki and the arrest, detention and alleged 
ill-treatment of the eleven human rights defenders may be directly related to their work in 
defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>158. On 26 February 2008, the Government responded to the joint communication sent 
on 10 January 2008, affirming its desire to guarantee the right of all persons to hold opinions 
without interference and the right to freedom of expression by peaceful means in accordance 
with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Constitution and the law. The 
Government reported that the authorization of demonstrations and gatherings is governed by 
Act No. 32 of 2006, amending Legislative Decree No. 18 of 1973 on public meetings, 
demonstrations and gatherings. In 2007, a total of 324 demonstrations and gatherings were held; 
prior notice was given for 104 of these events and no notice was given for 220; most of the 
unauthorized demonstrations and gatherings were not halted or prevented. The Government of 
the Kingdom affirmed its ongoing commitment to allowing peaceful demonstrations, provided 
they are held in accordance with the law and participants do not engage in mob unrest or rioting 
punishable by law. The rioting that occurred on 17 December 2007 during illegal gatherings and 
demonstrations coincided with the Kingdom&#8217;s celebrations of the national holiday, which is 
observed on 16 and 17 December every year, and endangered the lives and property of people 
celebrating the holiday. Some civil society associations and members of the Chamber of 
Deputies alleged that the police used excessive force in dealing with these events, and some 
claimed that the persons detained were tortured. The Minister for Internal Affairs explained the 
position to the Chamber of Deputies on 15 January 2008 in reply to a member&#8217;s question about 
the necessary guarantees to safeguard human rights. He confirmed that the police had not 
infringed the applicable legislation and regulations. In addition, Ministry officials confirmed that 
the police had not used excessive force against the rioters and that the detainees had been taken 
to a forensic medical examiner, who had confirmed that none of them had been tortured and that 
all the measures taken with respect to them were in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>159. The Government stated that the assertions in the urgent appeal regarding the death of 
Mr. Ali Jasim Mohamed Maki, and the events that preceded and followed it are not accurate: the 
demonstrators not only gathered illegally but were also carrying iron spits and Molotov 
cocktails. They set a police car on fire and stole guns from it, and they also attempted to kill 
police officers, as some of the accused persons admitted when questioned by the Department of 
Public Prosecutions. No complaints have been lodged with the Department of Public 
Prosecutions concerning the persons named in the urgent appeal. When questioned by the 
Department of Public Prosecutions, the persons who had been arrested and placed in preventive 
detention said nothing about having been attacked. Nevertheless, the Department ordered that 
they be examined by the forensic medical examiner to determine whether they had any injuries, 
and the forensic report confirmed the absence of any injuries. Regarding the death of 
Mr. Ali Jasim Mohamed Maki, on 17 December 2007 the competent security department was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>informed by the International Hospital of Bahrain that an individual had died there and that his 
body had been transferred to the morgue of Salmaniya hospital. Upon receipt of the report, the 
Department of Public Prosecutions, which is an independent judicial body, was notified and took 
the following steps. The head of the Department of Public Prosecutions went straight to 
Salmaniya hospital, examined the body and found no signs of injury. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions formed a tripartite commission chaired by the Department&#8217;s senior forensic 
pathologist, with two doctors from Salmaniya hospital as members, in order to ascertain the 
cause of death. After confirming that the body bore no injuries, the commission conducted an 
autopsy and found that the cause of death was sudden circulatory arrest. None of the relatives of 
the deceased asked the Department of Public Prosecutions for a second opinion from an 
independent specialist. The autopsy was conducted in the presence of relatives of the deceased. 
The medical commission carried out the necessary medical tests in order to prepare the final 
medical report on the cause of death. The Government noted that the allegation that legal 
representatives were denied access to the accused is untrue, as all but one of the accused decided 
during questioning to forfeit the right to have a lawyer present; the lawyer of the one person who 
did decide to ask for a lawyer was allowed to attend the examination proceeding, pursuant to 
article 134 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The accused did not do this. The Department of 
Public Prosecutions, on the other hand, ordered that all the necessary facilities be provided to 
allow any of the family members or lawyers of the accused persons to visit them in their places 
of detention if they so wished.

on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, sent an urgent appeal to the government 
concerning Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal, Majid Salman Ibrahim Al-Haddad, 
and Nader Ali Ahmad Al-Salatna, members of the Unemployment Committee and human rights 
defenders who were released on 16 January 2008. Also in relation to the eight remaining 
detainees; Messrs Naji Ali Fateel, member of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights 
(BYSHR); Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais, head of the Committee to Combat High Prices; 
Maytham Bader Jassim Al-Sheikh, Ahmad Jaffar Mohammed Ali, Hassan Abdulnabi, Hassan 
Abdelnabi Hassan, and Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh, all members of the Unemployment 
Committee; and Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab, founding member of the Martyrs and 
Victims of Torture. All of the remaining detainees were being held at the Criminal Investigations 
Department, (CID) in Adliya. All of the aforementioned were detained after a series of arrests 
from 21-28 December 2007 following unrest and protests. All were the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by mandate-holders on 10 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>162. According to new information received, they did not have access to their lawyers until 
approximately ten days after they were detained. Some of the detainees were continually 
handcuffed for one to two weeks, including while they ate and slept. They were refused access to </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>washing facilities and were forced to lie on a cold floor and beaten and kicked as soon as they 
fell asleep. Some were forced to stand for three days. They were not permitted to speak to the 
other detainees and remained blindfolded for most of the time. The detainees were also not 
allowed to pray.  
</p>
<p>163. Witnesses had seen bruising and marks apparently stemming from beatings received by the 
men during their detention. One detainee was buried up to his neck and had a gun pointed at him. 
Threats were also made regarding the detainees&#8217; families. Furthermore, one of the detainees, 
Maytham Bader Al-sheikh had a stick put in his anus, resulting in rectal perforation.  
</p>
<p>164. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of the aforementioned human 
rights defenders. Further concern was expressed that their arrests and detention may have been 
linked to their activities in defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>165. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 21 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>166. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the government 
concerning Misses Sadika Haron, Afrah Haron, Mariam Gasem, Amina Shokr, Sharifa Sayyid 
Gaafar, Fakhria Singace, Somayyia Singace, Zainab el Kaffas, Haifa Mohamed Taha, Sanaa 
Mohamed Taha, Zahra Khalil, Ms. Fatimah Salman Gassem, Afaf Abdulhadi, Rabab Marhoon, 
Abdullah Mohsen, and Zainab Al Khawaja; all female family members of political prisoners 
currently in detention following recent unrest in Bahrain, and Mr. Abdulhadi el Khawaja, 
Director of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, who was monitoring the demonstration. 
</p>
<p>167. According to information received, on 25 December 2007 the families of detained political 
prisoners, including some minors, were reportedly demonstrating at the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
premises to protest the absence of visitation rights. The demonstration was allegedly violently 
dispersed by agents of the Special Security Forces and the Women&#8217;s Police, when the 
demonstrators stated that they would not leave the premises until such time as they had received 
information regarding those detained. Several of the demonstrators, including the 
aforementioned, reportedly sustained injuries as a result of the treatment they allegedly received, 
and some required hospitalization. Furthermore, it was reported that members of the Special 
Security Forces later came to the demonstrators&#8217; houses, while it is also alleged that plainclothes 
&#8220;armed militias&#8221; took part in suppressing the demonstration and violent house intrusions. 
</p>
<p>168. Concern was expressed that the alleged violent dispersal of the aforementioned 
demonstration and the reported incidents at the homes of demonstrators may be directly linked to 
their human rights activities, particularly their demands for visitation access to detained family 
members. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>169. In a letter dated 3 March 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 21 January 2008. The Government objected to the description of the individuals in questions 
as &#8220;political prisoners currently in detention following recent unrest in Bahrain&#8221;. The 
Government noted that there are no political prisoners in Bahrain and no person s arrested or 
detained because of their political views or activities. The individuals in custody are being held 
in connection with criminal inquiries pursuant to specific articles of Bahrain&#8217;s criminal law. The 
allegations set out in the communication are inaccurate. On 24 December 2007 the family 
members of those in custody applied to the Public Prosecution to visit their relatives. The request 
was accepted immediately and a visit was peacefully carried out on the same day. On the 
following day, 25 December 2007, a number of female relatives of those in custody gathered at 
the premises of Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, with the apparent intention of disrupting and 
intimidating staff and other visitors. A number of visitors, including foreign nationals, were 
driven away by the commotion caused by the demonstrators. The Government reported that 
following rumors that one of the women demonstrators had been mistreated by police officers, 
the Public Prosecution immediately initiated investigations. These investigations clearly 
established that the demonstrators, a number of whom began shouting and screaming without 
reason, were observed from a distance by five uniformed police officers, four of them female. 
Allegations of the involvement of &#8220;plainclothes armed militias&#8221; or &#8220;special security forces&#8221; were 
found to be completely unfounded. The Government stressed that no force had been used against 
the demonstrators at any time and that no official claims or complaints to this effect were made 
by any of the demonstrators. During the demonstrations one of the protesters collapsed and was 
given medical attention, and was later transferred to the hospital. While media reports allege that 
a number of those involved were taken to hospital as a result of injuries sustained at the 
demonstration, the Government understands that no medical reports were issued as none of the 
demonstrators had been injured or mistreated in any way. The Government also stressed that the 
police officers in question exercised a restrained and understanding approach to the 
demonstration in recognition of the distressed state of those involved. The Government 
categorically denied that &#8220;violent house intrusions&#8221; took place at the homes of those involved in 
the demonstration. The Government also confirmed that regular weekly family visits continue to 
those in custody in connection with the incidents of 20 December 2007.  
</p>

<p>170. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 April 2008

<p>171. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the 
cases of the arrest of 47 persons over four weeks and the detention of 26, notably of Ammar 
Hassan Ali Hassan Al-Basri, 17; Sayyed Hadi Hameed Adnan Alawi, 28; Mohammed Abbas

</p>
<p>172. According to information received, 47 people from the villages of Karzakkan, Demistan, 
Sadad and Malekkya were arrested between 27 March and 15 April 2008, mostly during house 
raids by Special Security Forces, allegedly with the support of the secret intelligence and armed 
militia. In one case, the person wanted by the security forces was absent, and his brother 
Jassim Mohammed Habeeb was arrested in his place and taken to Hamad Town police station. 
He was still in detention although his brother presented himself to the police station. Others were 
arrested after they presented themselves to the Hamad Town police station in response to official 
summons. Of the 47 arrested people, 26 were still being detained, including one minor, Ammar 
Hassan Ali Hassan Al-Basri. The detainees are being held in the premises of the Criminal 
Investigations Bureau (CIB) in Adleyya, Manama. Since their arrests, they have not had access 
to lawyers and no visits were allowed. Some of the detainees were taken before the Public 
Prosecutor to have their detention extended. In addition, Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein 
Abdul-Aal, aged 26, from Hamala, was summoned on 15 April 2008 to Hamad-Town police 
station, from where he was transferred to an unknown place. Since then, his whereabouts have 
been unknown. Mr. Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal had briefly been detained on 2 February 2007 for 
delivering a speech criticizing the government, arrested again on 21 December 2007, along with 
other members of the Committee for the Unemployed, in relation to the December protests, and 
released a month later. His arrest in December was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 
10 January 2008 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders. Allegations were received that he was subjected to 
torture including being blindfolded and handcuffed for several days, hanged by the arms for two 
days and exposed to electric shocks during his detention. The arrests were triggered by two 
violent incidents: the burning on 6 March 2008 of a farm belonging to a former high 
Government official and the killing on 9 April 2008 of a member of the Special Security Forces. 
However, accusations regarding the killing of the Special Security officer were reportedly not 
supported by evidence.  
</p>
<p>173. Concern was expressed that these men were arrested and detained for their alleged 
involvement in social movements, such as the Committee for the Unemployed and the 
Underpaid, the Committee for the Defence of Detainees, the Committee against High Prices, etc., 
as well as their community activism. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>174. On 14 August 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 24 April 2008, stating 
that first, the Department of Public Prosecutions undertook an investigation into the persons 
named in the attached note who had been accused of offences that are punishable by law under 
the Criminal Code. Two investigations were carried out into these incidents, as described below. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>In the first case, the Department of Public Prosecutions laid charges against a total of 19 persons 
on the counts described below. They participated in a public demonstration involving more than 
five persons for the purpose of carrying out criminal attacks against property and persons. The 
accused committed the following offences, knowing the purpose behind the demonstration: The 
intentional and premeditated murder and ambushing of Majid Ashgar Ali; they had planned and 
conspired to set fire to any police vehicle that passed by the scene of the crime and to kill the 
occupants. They had prepared Molotov cocktails and stones in advance and hid in a place where 
they were certain that a police car would pass. As soon as the victims&#8217; car appeared, they 
showered it with a hail of these materials with the intent of killing the occupants. They caused 
the fatal injuries described in the forensic report on the victim. They attempted deliberately to 
murder and ambush Salih Ali Salih and Ammar Mas`ad Hamud; they had planned and conspired 
to set fire to any police vehicle that passed by the scene of the crime and to kill the occupants. 
They had prepared Molotov cocktails and stones in advance and hid in a place where they were 
certain that a police car would pass. As soon as the victims&#8217; car appeared, they showered it with 
a hail of these materials with the intent of killing the occupants. The crime failed to achieve the 
desired effect for reasons beyond their control, namely, the victims&#8217; decision to get out of the 
vehicle, and the fight which the second victim put up. They set fire to a police car belonging to 
the Ministry of the Interior and endangered lives and property, after surrounding the vehicle and 
bombarding it with Molotov cocktails, which exploded and set fire to parts of the vehicle. In the 
second case, the Department of Public Prosecutions brought charges against 15 persons on the 
counts described below. They participated in a public demonstration involving more than five 
persons for the purpose of carrying out criminal attacks against property and persons. The 
accused committed the following offences, knowing the purpose behind the demonstration: 
Setting fire to the movable and immovable property described and listed in the case documents 
as belonging to Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Atiyah Allah Al Khalifah, thus endangering lives and 
property; throwing Molotov cocktails; dousing them with flammable material (gasoline) and 
setting light to them, as described in the documents. Second, the Department of Public 
Prosecutions referred all the accused persons in the two cases to the Criminal High Court on the 
charges described above. In referring the accused to the Criminal Court, the Department of 
Public Prosecutions submitted a great deal of evidence, including confessions by a number of the 
accused; confessions in which some of the accused implicated others in the same investigation; 
the testimony of police officers who had witnessed the incidents and others who had been 
present at the scene; and forensic evidence, reports and photographs of the accused committing 
the offence. Third, none of the persons who were arrested and detained made any statement 
when questioned by the Department of Public Prosecutions about having been assaulted. The 
Department of Public Prosecutions nevertheless ordered a medical examination of the accused in 
order to clarify whether or not they had sustained any injuries. The medical reports found no 
evidence of any injuries. Four, Shakir Mohammed Abd al-Hussayn Abd al-Al was charged in the 
second case and was detained pending trial. Five, the second case was sent before the Criminal 
High Court and is still being heard by the Court. Six, the Department of Public Prosecutions, at 
the very outset of the investigation, gave orders that the accused and their defence counsel should 
be provided with every assistance to facilitate the presentation of a defence in the framework of 
the law. Nothing was done which vitiates the legal procedures followed by the Department of 
Public Prosecutions. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>175. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 30 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Bahrain regarding the following human rights defenders, Messrs Shaker Mohammed 
Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal, aged 26, Sadeq Jawad Ahmed Al-Fardan, aged 27, and 
Hasan Kathom Ebrahim Ahmed, aged 30, members of the Unemployment Committee; 
Ali Mohamed Habib Ashoor, aged 31, and Habib Mohamed Habib Ashoor, aged 20, of the 
Committee for Detainees; Fadhel Abbas Mohamed Ashoor, aged 25, of the Committee Against 
High Prices; and Sayed Omran Hameed Adnan, aged 24, of the Committee Against One Percent. 
</p>
<p>177. According to the new information received, since their arrest in early April 2008, they have 
reportedly been tortured, beaten, held in solitary confinement and deprived of food and sleep. A 
form of torture known as Falaqah has been applied on them, whereby a hard stick is inserted 
between the detainee&#8217;s cuffed hands and tied legs, and then used to suspend the detainee in the 
air for hours with his legs facing upwards and his blind-folded head facing downwards. The 
detainee&#8217;s feet are then beaten until he makes a confession or loses consciousness. The men are 
reportedly held without charge or access to lawyers and access to families have been restricted. 
</p>
<p>178. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of the aforementioned 
human rights defenders in view of the reported ill-treatment. Further concern was expressed that 
their arrest, detention and treatment amounting to torture may be related to their non-violent 
activities in defense of labour rights in the country. The above mentioned allegations added to 
other serious allegations raised by mandate holders regarding cases of torture of detained human 
rights defenders in Bahrain, and serious concern is expressed over this apparent emerging trend 
of repression against human rights defenders in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>179. In a letter dated 14 August 2008 the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 30 May 2008. The Government informed that in accordance with the Criminal Code of 
Bahrain, the Department of Public Prosecutions launched an investigation into the unlawful acts 
with which the persons named in the urgent appeal were charged. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions charged the 19 persons named in the urgent appeal with participating in a public 
gathering without prior permission from the competent authority, in violation of the Public 
Gatherings and Processions Act. Regarding the deliberate and premeditated murder by ambush 
of police officer Majid Asghar Ali, the Government reported that the accused had resolved to set 
fire to any police vehicle passing by the crime scene and to murder the occupants, to which end 
they had prepared Molotov cocktails and stones and set an ambush at a point where they were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>certain a police vehicle would pass. When the vehicle occupied by the victim approached, they 
attacked it with the said implements with the intention of murdering the occupants, and thus 
caused the fatal injuries described in the forensic report on the victim. The deliberate and 
premeditated attempted murder of Salih Ali Salih and Ammar Mus&#8217;id Hammud by ambush. The 
accused had resolved to set fire to any police vehicle passing the crime scene and to murder its 
occupants, to which end they had prepared a Molotov cocktail and stones and set an ambush at a 
point where they were certain a police vehicle would pass. When the vehicle occupied by the 
victims approached, they attacked it with the said implements with the intention of murdering the 
occupants. However, their attempt was thwarted, for reasons beyond their control, namely, the 
decision of the victims to get out of the vehicle and the resistance put up by the second victim. 
An arson attack against Ministry of the Interior vehicle No. 93604, endangering lives and 
property. The accused surrounded the vehicle and attacked it with Molotov cocktails, setting 
parts of it on fire. 
</p>
<p>180. The Department of Public Prosecutions charged 15 persons named in the urgent appeal 
with the following. Gathering in a public place, without prior permission from the competent 
authority, in violation of the Public Gatherings and Processions Act, and setting fire to the 
immovable and movable property of Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Atiyah Allah Al Khalifah by 
throwing Molotov cocktails after dousing them with flammable material (gasoline) and setting 
fire to them, thus endangering lives and property. The Department of Public Prosecutions 
referred the persons named in the aforesaid cases to the High Criminal Court on the charges 
against them and submitted a range of evidence, the most important being: confessions by a 
number of the accused; confessions implicating some of the other defendants; witness statements 
from policemen and others; forensic evidence and reports; and photographs showing the accused 
committing the offences. Although the persons who were arrested and detained did not complain 
to the Department of Public Prosecutions when interviewed about any assault, the Department 
ordered that they should be examined by a police doctor to ascertain whether they had sustained 
any injuries as a result of any assault. The medical reports found no sign of injuries. 
Shakir Muhammad Abd al-Hussayn Abd al-Al was charged with involvement in the second 
incident described above and was detained by order of the Court. All the cases have been 
referred to and are being considered by the High Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>181. From the outset of the investigation into these incidents, the Department of Public 
Prosecutions ordered that the detainees should be provided with full legal guarantees, in order to 
enable the accused to present their legal defence in the presence of their defence counsel and in 
the framework established by law and to ensure that nothing would mar the integrity of the legal 
procedures followed by the Department of Public Prosecutions. The acts perpetrated by the 
accused are beyond the scope of freedom of opinion and freedom of expression and constitute 
offences punishable by law under the Criminal Code.

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 28 July 2008

on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers, sent a letter of allegations to the Government in relation to Messrs. Hassan 
Abdelnabi Hassan, Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh and Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh of 
the Unemployment Committee; Mr. Naji Ali Fateel of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human 
Rights (BYSHR); Mr. Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais, head of the Committee to Combat High 
Prices; Mr. Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali, former member of the Unemployment Committee; 
and Mr. Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab, founding member of the Martyrs and Victims of 
Torture.  
</p>
<p>184. All of the aforementioned were detained between 21 and 28 December 2007 following 
unrest and protests. All were the subject of urgent appeals sent by various mandate-holders on 
10 January 2008 and 18 January 2008. We thank you for the response from your Government 
dated 26 February 2008.  
</p>
<p>185. According to new information received, on 13 July 2008, Mr. Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan 
was sentenced to seven years&#8217; imprisonment and fined around 9,980 Bahrain Dinars. 
Messrs. Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh, Naji Ali Fateel and Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais 
were sentenced to five years&#8217; imprisonment. Mr. Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali was sentenced 
to one year&#8217;s imprisonment for taking part in the demonstration, violence against the police 
officers and setting fire to a government vehicle. The High Criminal Court found them guilty of 
offences such as burning a police jeep, illegal gathering and use of force against security 
officials. In addition, Mr. Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh was found guilty of theft of a 
government fire arm and possession of a fire arm without permission while Mr. Naji Ali Fateel 
and Mr. Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais were found guilty of theft of government ammunition 
and possession of part of a fire arm without permission. 
</p>
<p>186. The judge of the High Criminal Court failed to consider medical evidence indicating that 
some of the human rights defenders may have been beaten while in detention. The medical 
evidence was not fully conclusive because the examination by independent forensic experts had 
been delayed. 
</p>
<p>187. Messrs. Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh and Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab were 
acquitted.  
</p>
<p>188. On 18 July 2008, peaceful demonstrations, organized by family members of the detained in 
protest against the sentences, were violently dispersed by riot police. Tear gas and rubber bullets 
were used against the protesters. As a result, the four-year-old son of Mr. Maytham Bader Jassim 
Al Sheikh was rushed to hospital in an ambulance.  
</p>
<p>189. The acquittals of Messrs. Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh and Ebrahim Mohamed 
Amin-Al-Arab were welcomed. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of the other 
above-mentioned human rights defenders may not result from a fair trial and may be related to 
their work in the defense of human rights. Concern was also expressed that confessions obtained 
under torture may be the basis of the verdicts of those found guilty.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>190. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash, coordinator of 
the Task Force against Torture in Rajshahi, and regional coordinator of the Bangladesh Institute 
of Human Rights (BIHR) and a journalist working as the bureau chief of a private news 
television channel CSB News and Daily Sangbad, a Dhaka based national newspaper.  
</p>
<p>192. Mr. Alam Akash was the subject of urgent appeals sent by mandate-holders 
on 7 November 2007 and on 22 May 2007. While the government&#8217;s reply, dated 
26 November 2007 was appreciated, the mandate-holders wished to address new information 
received regarding Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash. 
</p>
<p>193. According to new information received, Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash currently faced at least 
three extortion charges which he denied. Although he was granted bail in relation to one of these 
charges on 16 October 2007, Mr. Alam Akash was again arrested by members of Rapid Action 
Batallion (RAB) - 5, reportedly without a legal basis. He was tortured and later detained at the 
Rajshahi Central Jail for 28 days. On 8 November 2007, a magistrate ordered that the first case 
against Mr. Alam Akash be dismissed; however, following the intervention of the Ministry of 
Home Affairs, another case was scheduled for hearing on 25 November 2007. On 
2 January 2008, the High Court ruled that it stayed the case in which the Ministry of Home 
Affairs had intervened for three months, as the legality of that action was thought to be in 
question. However, a warrant for the re-arrest of Mr. Alam Akash was issued on 7 January. 
</p>
<p>194. In the course of his work, Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash has, on numerous occasions, disclosed 
alleged atrocities of the RAB in cases involving human rights violations. He has also received 
numerous death threats as a result of his journalistic work and has suffered physical assaults in 
the past following the publication of critical articles regarding local politicians.  
</p>
<p>195. Concern was expressed that the charges brought against Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash 
and the warrant for his re-arrest may be directly related to his work in defence of human 
rights. Furthermore, there were fears for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Jahingir Alam Akash. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>196. In a letter dated 29 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 8 February 2008. The Government reported that Mr. Mafuzul Alam Loton lodged a FIR (First 
Information Report) with the Boalia Police Station stating that Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash 
demanded money by criminal intimidation. The investigation officer examined the witnesses. On 
the basis of sufficient evidence, the investigating officer submitted charge sheet No 398, dated 
30 October 2007 in the court. Mr. Akash was arrested on 24 October 2007 and he was 
subsequently handed over to the Boalia Model Police Station.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>197. The Government noted that the facts alleged in the communication were not accurate. The 
Government informed that Mr. Akash was a yellow journalist and was engaged in illegal 
activities by using his profession as a shield. No complaint has been lodged by either Mr. Akash 
or on his behalf with the police or the court. He has however submitted a writ petition to the 
Honorable High Court requesting bail, which he was later granted. The Government gave 
detailed information about the legal basis of the charges against Mr. Akash.

<p>198. He was granted bail from the Honourable High Court for which he should have 
surrendered to the lower court, but he failed to do so. For the violation of the bail conditions he 
was warranted for re-arrest by the court. The Government stressed that is was apparent from the 
investigation that no physical and mental torture was made against former CSB news reporter 
Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>200. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Dr. M A Hasan, a civil society leader and member of the War Crimes 
Fact Finding Committee, an organization which investigates and compiles information on past 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>201. According to information received, Dr. Hasan received threats following the publication by 
the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee, on 3 April 2008, of a list of people alleged to have 
committed war crimes during the war of independence in 1971. On 4 April 2008, three young 
men tried to forcibly enter Dr. Hasan&#8217;s residence, but were stopped by his family and their home 
security guard, after which the three left the area. On 5 April, a man twice telephoned the 
hospital where Dr. Hasan works to ask about his whereabouts, and later two men reportedly 
came to the hospital making similar inquiries. On 8 April, Dr. Hasan reportedly received a call 
from a man who said, &#8220;We are coming for you&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>202. Concern was expressed that the series of threats directed against Dr. M A Hasan may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his efforts, in his capacity 
as a member of the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee, to end impunity for perpetrators of past 
violations of human rights. In view of these threats, serious concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of Dr. Hasan and his family.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination 
in this context, sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Rabindra Ghosh. Mr. Ghosh is the 
President of the Dhaka Chapter of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities 
(HRCBM), a non-governmental human rights organization working in the defense of minority 
rights. 
</p>
<p>206. According to information received, Mr. Ghosh has been subject to intimidation and threats 
following his investigation of a case of alleged land-grabbing concerning a piece of land in 
Jaintapur. This land was reportedly granted to four individuals belonging to a minority group but 
was then claimed by officials of the Jainta Press Club, who subsequently took possession of the 
property. Reports indicate that officers at Jainta Station refused to file a complaint on behalf of 
the four individuals who claim the land is their property. 
</p>
<p>207. On 29 April 2008, Mr. Ghosh was contacted by a police officer, whose name is known to 
the Special Rapporteur, who warned him not to investigate the matter any further. This officer 
told Mr. Ghosh that if he proceeded with the investigation he would have criminal charges filed 
against him. He also threatened Mr. Ghosh that he would break his leg. Mr. Ghosh reported this 
incident to the Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet, who reportedly did not pursue the complaint. 
Mr. Ghosh subsequently filed a complaint regarding the incident at the Jaintapur Police Station. 
</p>
<p>208. Concern was expressed that the threats and intimidation of Mr. Rabindra Ghosh may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular land rights and rights of 
minority groups in Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>209. In a letter dated 4 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication above. 
The Government reported that Mr. Rabindra Gosh is the President of the Dhaka chapter of the 
Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM). He visited the Jaintapur Upazilla 
on 16 April 2008 to conduct an enquiry into a police case lodged in Jaintapur police station. He 
wanted to have a discussion with the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer (head of the Sub-District 
administration). Since he couldn&#8217;t manage to communicate with him, they talked later over the 
phone. It has been alleged that during the phone conversation each side intimidated the other. 
They both filed a general diary with the Jaintapur police station to this effect. The matter relating 
to the land grabbing is pending before the court. 
</p>
<p>210. Neither Mr. Rabindra Gosh nor the Upazila Nirbahi Officer did proceed any further with 
their complaints made against each other. </p>

<p>212. In a letter dated 4 February 2009, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 10 August 2007. The Government responded that &#8220;Mr. Rabindra Ghosh is the President of the 
Dhaka chapter of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM). He visited 
Jaintapur Upazilla on the 16th of April 2008 to conduct an enquiry into a police case lodged in 
Jaintapur Police station. He wanted to have a discussion with the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer (Head 
of Sub-District administration) but could not manage to communicate with him. Later on 
Mr. Rabindra Ghosh returned to Dhaka and talked to the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer over 
telephone. It has been alleged that during the telephonic conversation each side intimidated the 
others side. Mr. Robindra Ghosh filed a general diary with Jaintapur Police Station on 1.5.2008 
alleging that the Upazuila Nirbahi Officer had threatened him. Similarly, the Upazilla Nirbahi 
Officer too filed general diary with the Jaintapur Police Station stating Mr. Rabindra Ghosh&#8217;s 
indecent attitude and intimidating behaviour. Mr. Rabindra Ghosh had been to Jaintapur 
concerning Police case No. 19 dated 19.6.2008. The case was lodged by Mr. A. K. M. Kudrat 
Ullah, Secretary of Jaintapur Press Club and the accused persons were Ajoy Dev, Apu Dev, 
Pappa Dev and Suckla Rani Dev. According to facts and circumstances of the case, the accused 
Suckla Rani Dev had been enjoying a 17 decimal of land since 1980, which is owned by the 
Government. She was alleged to have illegally encroached Government land. The Government 
took initiative to evacuate illegal occupants of Government lands. As a part of this process, the 
portion of land illegally occupied by Suckla Rani was also recovered and it was subsequently 
awarded to Jaintapur Press Club by the Government. The accused persons protested while the 
press club authorities started erecting their office premises. This issue ended up in violence and 
several persons of press club sustained physical injuries from the other group. The case was 
investigated and charges were proved against the accused. The matter is now pending before the 
court. Neither Mr. Rabindra Ghosh nor the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer did proceed any further with 
their complaints made against each other. Both the complaints were recorded as General Diary in 
the Police Station Bangladesh Government is always aware to uphold, protect, promote and 
implement the human rights and fundamental freedom of minorities in accordance with the law 
of the land.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>213. In a letter dated 29 May 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 22 May 2007. The Government responded that &#8220;Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash is a yellow 
journalist and he was engaged in so many illegal activities by using his journalist&#8217;s profession as 
a shield. No complaint has been lodged either by Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash or on his behalf to 
police. He was granted bail from the Honorable High Court for which he should have 
surrendered to the lower court, but he failed to do so. For the violation of the bail conditions he 
was warranted for re-arrest by the court of law. It would be apparent from the investigation that 
no physical and mental torture was made against former CSB news reporter Mr. Jahangir Alam 
Akash who is known for his yellow journalism and extortion charges. He was sent to the court 
on the basis of specific legal complaint. What has been done is clearly in conformity with law. 
No human rights violation has occurred in connection with the arrest of Mr. Akash.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>217. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on arbitrary detention, sent a joint urgent appeal 
regarding Mr. Aleksandr Sdvizhkov, editor at the weekly newspaper Zhoda, which has been shut 
down by the government. 
</p>
<p>218. According to the information received, on 18 January 2008 Mr. Sdvizhkov was found 
guilty by the Minsk City Court of &#8220;incitement to religious hatred&#8221; for reprinting the cartoons of 
Prophet Mohammed that originally appeared on September 2005 in the Danish newspaper 
Jylland Posten. He was sentenced to three years in a high-security prison following a trial 
conducted in camera. 
</p>
<p>219. The cartoons were published in the Zhoda newspaper in February 2006. A month later, the 
newspaper was shut down by the Government. Fearing prosecution, Mr. Sdvizhkov fled the 
country. He was arrested by the Security Service in November 2007 when he returned to Belarus 
to attend his father&#8217;s funeral. 
</p>
<p>220. Mr. Sdvizhkov and the Zhoda newspaper were one of the few independent voices in the 
Byelorussian press, in particular during the presidential election of 2006, when the Zhoda 
newspaper decided to also give coverage to the opposition candidate who took part in the 
elections. 
</p>
<p>221. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Sdvizhkov may be directly linked to his 
reportedly legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>222. In a letter dated 10 June 2008, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Belarus in 
Geneva responded to the above communication. The response stated that the Criminal 
proceedings against Mr. A.M. Sdvizhkov were instituted on 22 February 2006 by the 
investigative department of the Committee for State Security following the publication in the 
17 February 2006 issue of the newspaper Zhoda of caricatures offending the sensibilities of 
believers in the religion of Islam. The investigation was conducted by the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Belarus. Mr. Sdvizhkov was indicted on 31 March 2006 and, as a 
preventive measure, he was required to sign an undertaking not to leave the area. However, he 
violated this undertaking and went into hiding, and on 21 April 2006 the preventive measure was 
changed to remand in custody and a search was declared. On 18 November 2007, Mr. Sdvizhkov 
was arrested by militia officers involved in the search. 
</p>
<p>223. During the investigation it was established that, in February 2006, Mr. Sdvizhkov, an 
official (publishing editor of the newspaper Zhoda), personally searched the Internet for 
caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that defiled the symbols of the Islamic faith, and 
published them in the issue of the newspaper that came out on 17 February 2006 as material 
illustrating an article on the subject of the &#8220;caricature scandal&#8221;. 
</p><p>224. For the aforementioned acts, on 29 November 2007 Mr. Sdvizhkov was indicted for the 
offence covered under article 130, paragraph 2, of the Belarusian Criminal Code, namely the 
commission by an official, using his or her official powers, of deliberate acts intended to incite 
religious enmity and discord. 
</p>
<p>225. On 10 December 2007, the case was referred to the court for consideration. The 
circumstances mentioned in the indictment were fully confirmed in the course of the proceedings 
and were not denied by the defendant. 
</p>
<p>226. Having considered the evidence, including the testimony of the mufti of the Muslim 
Religious Association and the mufti of the Clerical Department of Muslims in Belarus, and the 
conclusions of an expert theological study, the court came to the well-founded conclusion that 
the publication in the media of caricatures defiling the religious symbols of Islam damaged the 
foundations of the religious outlook of persons of the Muslim faith, and incites religious 
animosity among representatives of diverse religious denominations, creating conditions for the 
stirring up of religious intolerance and discord - which was acknowledged by the defendant. 
</p>
<p>227. On 18 January 2008, pursuant to article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code, the Minsk 
city court sentenced Mr. Sdvizhkov to three years&#8217; deprivation of liberty in a high-security 
correctional colony. This punishment is the minimum punishment for an offence that is classified 
in Belarusian law as a serious offence. 
</p>
<p>228. The sentence was appealed by the defendant and did not enter into force. 
On 22 February 2008, the cassation division of the Supreme Court of Belarus amended the 
sentence that the criminal division of the Minsk city court issued on 18 January 2008 with 
respect to Mr. Sdvizhkov. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>229. Bearing in mind that Mr. Sdvizhkov suffers from a number of chronic illnesses, that he has 
an elderly mother and that his actions did not have serious consequences, the cassation division 
came to the conclusion that the sum total of the aforementioned circumstances substantially 
reduce the degree of social danger of the act, recognized them as exceptional and applied 
article 70 of the Belarusian Criminal Code, in accordance with which it substituted the 
punishment imposed on Mr. Sdvizhkov pursuant to article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal 
Code (deprivation of liberty for three years) with arrest for a period of three months. Since 
Mr. Sdvizhkov has served this sentence, he was released from custody. 
</p>
<p>230. The conviction relating to Mr. Sdvizhkov&#8217;s admission that he was guilty of deliberate acts 
intended to incite religious enmity and discord, committed by an official with the use of official 
powers, and also relating to his conviction under article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code, 
was upheld. 
</p>
<p>231. Mr. Sdvizhkov was prosecuted and sentenced for committing an offence, in strict 
accordance with the criminal and criminal procedural legislation currently in force in Belarus; 
such legislation is in no way contrary to international norms and standards for the protection of 
the rights and freedoms of citizens, including the right to freedom of opinion and its expression, 
as contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>232. In its sentence, the court noted that the publication of caricatures has nothing in common 
with freedom of speech but constitutes the dissemination of insults and provokes retaliatory acts 
on the part of the Muslim community, including the need to defend religious symbols.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 13 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>234. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations regarding reports that the newspaper 
&#8220;Novy Chas&#8221; has been condemned to pay a prohibitive fine for allegedly defaming a senator in 
an article. 
</p>
<p>235. According to information received, Senator Nikolai Cherginets filed a defamation lawsuit 
against &#8220;Novy Chas&#8221; publisher, Vremya Novostei, and its reporter Aleksandr Tamkovich, 
following a 24 September 2007 article in which Mr. Cherginets was criticised, claiming the 
article damaged his &#8220;honor, dignity, and business reputation as a writer, politician, and 
general-senator.&#8221; In compensation, Mr. Cherginets demanded 500 million Belarusian rubles 
(US$ 231,000) from Vremya Novostei and 100 million Belarusian rubles (US$ 46,000) from 
Aleksandr Tamkovich, demanding that the property and financial assets of both the paper and the 
author be seized as a guarantee that the damages would be covered. Reports indicate that on 
20 December 2007, Pervomaiski Court in Minsk ruled that Vremya Novostei should pay 
50 million Belarusian rubles and Tamkovich 1 million rubles, at the same time rejecting 
Vremya Novostei&#8217;s request to have Aleksandr Tamkovich&#8217;s article analyzed to determine 
whether it actually contained defamatory language. It is further reported that an appeals court 
upheld the verdict on 11 February 2008, ruling that if the paper fails to pay the damages </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>by 7 March, &#8220;Novy Chas&#8221; bank account and all assets would be seized. It is alleged that in order 
for the paper not to close down, money had to be borrowed from friends and supporters to pay 
for the requested fine, which the newspaper was not able to do otherwise. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>236. On 21 May 2008 the Government issued a reply in relation to the case of &#8220;Novy Chas&#8221; 
publisher, Vremya Novostei, and its reporter Aleksandr Tamkovich. At the time this report was 
finalized, the reply of the Government had not been translated. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>237. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the 
Government concerning Messrs Vadim Borshchevskiy and Pavel Levinov. Mr. Vadim 
Borshchevskiy is a journalist and member of Female Centre &#8220;Adliga&#8221; and the Youth Centre 
&#8220;Seventh Side&#8221;. Mr. Pavel Levinov is a human rights lawyer and a member of the Helsinki 
Committee in Belarus, Female Centre &#8220;Adliga&#8221; and the Youth Centre &#8220;Seventh Side&#8221;. Also in 
relation to searches of the offices of the women&#8217;s rights organization Female Centre &#8220;Adliga&#8221;, 
under the direction of Ms. Olga Karatch and of the home of Ms. Yelena Borshchevskaya, board 
member of the same organisation. 
</p>
<p>238. According to information received, between 25 and 27 March 2008, raids were carried out 
on the offices of the women&#8217;s centre Adliga, during which items were removed without being 
recorded in accordance with regulations governing confiscation. These raids were reportedly 
carried out by members of the State Security Agency of the Republic of Belarus (KGB) and 
members of the Belarusian militia. On the morning of 25 March 2008, Vadim Borshchevskiy 
was reportedly arrested on Lenin Street, in Vitebsk, and subsequently detained for two hours at 
Zheleznodorozhnyy district militia station before being released. Reports indicated that there was 
no official record of the arbitrary arrest and detention.  
</p>
<p>239. On 26 March at 10.00, Yelena Borshchevskaya was approached by three plainclothes KGB 
agents at Vitebsk School No. 39 where she teaches. The men produced a search warrant and then 
ordered Yelena Borshchevskaya to bring them to her home. En route she was prevented from 
using her mobile phone and her request to have a lawyer present was rejected. The men 
reportedly remarked that she could file a complaint regarding their actions afterwards. When 
they arrived at her apartment Yelena Borshchevskaya was unable to open the door, as ordered by 
the men, because she did not have her keys.  
</p>
<p>240. When Yelena Borshchevskaya requested that there be witnesses present, the agents 
reportedly summoned two soldiers, after which they called a Local Housing Services worker and 
ordered him to open the door. When he refused, an employee of the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations came and forced the door.  
</p>
<p>241. Shortly thereafter, human rights lawyer Pavel Levinov arrived in order to observe the 
search. The most senior of the KGB agents, Major Skorionovich, accused him of &#8220;using foul 
language&#8221; and ordered his arrest. Pavel Levinov was subsequently taken to Pervomayskiy district </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p>militia station but while there, his blood-pressure rose sharply and he was taken to hospital. 
Upon his release, Mr. Pavel Levinov reportedly initiated a dry hunger strike in protest at his 
treatment, during which he has reportedly lost 12 kgs. 
</p>
<p>242. The six-hour search of Ms. Borshchevskaya&#8217;s residence reportedly resulted in the 
confiscation of equipment including computers, dictaphones, scanners and a large photocopier, 
as well as information saved in documents and on cassettes and discs. The agents conducting the 
search reportedly stated that it formed part of a criminal investigation. The search was alleged to 
be in contravention of Belarusian law which stipulates that witnesses must first be called for 
interrogation before their property is searched and prohibits forced entry of private residences. 
</p>
<p>243. Concern was expressed that the intimidation and harassment of Vadim Borshchevskiy, 
Pavel Levinov, Olga Karatch and Yelena Borshchevskaya may be directly related to their 
activities in defense of human rights activities. In light of reports concerning Mr. Pavel Levinov, 
serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity, as well as that of the 
other aforementioned and all members of their organization. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>244. In a letter dated 18 August 2008, the Government of Belarus responded to the letter of 
allegations of 8 April 2008. The Government response was based on information received from 
the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Belarus. The Government informed that on 
the basis of a judgment by a judge of the Pervomaisky district court in Vitebsk, of 26 May 2008, 
Mr. Pavel Levinov was sentenced to 10 days&#8217; administrative detention and a fine of 
700,000 roubles for offences under articles 17.1 and 23.4 of the Code of Administrative Offences 
of the Republic of Belarus, namely petty hooliganism and refusing to follow lawful instructions 
from an official.  
</p>
<p>245. On 27 March 2008 at 3.55 p.m., on the 4th floor landing of 28-3 Chkalov Street in Vitebsk, 
Mr. Levinov committed petty hooliganism: in the presence of militia officers. He provoked a 
conflict, insulted a militia officer on duty and ignored the resulting requests and admonitions 
addressed to him, thereby breaching public order and disturbing the peace. In response to militia 
officers&#8217; lawful demand that he accompany them in their official car, Mr. Levinov grabbed hold 
of the banister on the landing and refused to go to the militia station voluntarily, which 
constituted refusal to follow lawful instructions or demands from an official on duty.  
</p>
<p>246. Having been convicted of administrative offences, Mr. Levinov lodged a complaint with 
the prosecutor&#8217;s office for Vitebsk province regarding the actions and rulings of the judge and 
violations of procedural legislation, which, he claimed, had prevented him from appealing the 
judgment of conviction. Since Mr. Levinov filed the complaint with the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
instead of the president of the court, and since no stamp duty was paid, the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
for the province legitimately refused to examine the substance of Mr. Levinov&#8217;s complaint, 
clarifying to the complainant the legally established procedure for submitting to the prosecuting 
authorities complaints in respect of judgements by judges in administrative offence cases. </p>

</b></p>
<p>248. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Mr. Pavel Levinov, 
human rights lawyer and member of the Belarus Helsinki Committee, a human rights 
non-governmental organization (NGO). A letter of allegation was sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 8 April 2008, regarding the 
arrest and subsequent hunger protest of Pavel Levinov.  
</p>
<p>249. According to new information received, since he was arrested on 26 March 2008 after 
providing legal aid for journalist Vadim Borschevskiy, Mr. Pavel Levinov made efforts, which 
included a 15-day hunger strike, to have his case investigated fairly. Nevertheless, on 
26 May 2008, a court ruling was passed, in Mr. Pavel Levinov&#8217;s absence, condemning him to ten 
days of detention and a fine of 700,000 rubles. According to Mr. Pavel Levinov, accusations 
against him were made by a senior militia officer and supported by subordinate officers acting 
under orders. 
</p>
<p>250. On 15 July 2008, Mr. Pavel Levinov visited the Public Prosecutor of Vitebsk who 
promised to inquire into the matter. However, before any inquiries could be made 
Mr. Pavel Levinov was approached outside the office of the Public Prosecutor by militiamen 
from a special militia troop who presented him with evidence of the court decision for him to be 
arrested for ten days. They brought him to Pershamayski District Militia Station. There, 
Mr. Pavel Levinov fell ill and was taken to hospital. After a telephone conversation the 
cardiologist on duty at the hospital refused to admit Mr. Pavel Levinov for treatment. On leaving 
the hospital he lost consciousness. He recovered in the hospital&#8217;s resuscitation ward hours later. 
He was transferred directly from there to Pershamayski District Militia Station. Officials at the 
hospital where Mr. Pavel Levinov had been refused treatment would not answer questions about 
whether or not he was in a fit condition to be held in detention.  
</p>
<p>251. Mr. Pavel Levinov was subsequently held in a temporal isolation centre in Vitebsk. He was 
visited by a doctor but had no access to legal aid. On 16 July 2008, Mr. Pavel Levinov began 
another hunger strike. 
</p>
<p>252. Concern was expressed that Mr. Pavel Levinov may have been detained as a result of his 
activities in defense of human rights. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Pavel Levinov. In light of reports that members of the 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee and other human rights activists in Belarus have been insulted on 
national Belarusian television over the last month, concern was also expressed about the 
situation of human rights defenders in the country. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>253. In a letter dated 18 August 2008, the Government of Belarus responded to the letter of 
allegations sent on 8 April 2008. The Government reported that with regard to the investigation 
carried out in relation to Mr. V.P. Borshchevsky, the prosecutor&#8217;s office for the city of Minsk is 
examining a criminal case brought against a group of individuals for committing offences under 
article 367, section 1, of the Criminal Code (Defamation against the President of the 
Republic of Belarus). During the investigation into this case, the need arose to conduct a search 
of Mr. Borshchevsky&#8217;s apartment in Vitebsk. On 27 March 2008 a search was carried out at 
Mr. Borshchevsky&#8217;s residence, on the basis of a decision approved by the deputy prosecutor for 
the city of Minsk that a search should be undertaken by officials of the Vitebsk provincial 
department of the Committee for State Security in compliance with the requirements of criminal 
procedure legislation. During the search, office equipment - a computer, printer, scanner, 
cassettes, discs and printing materials - was seized. 
</p>
<p>254. Following examination by the prosecutor&#8217;s office for Vitebsk province of the complaint 
submitted on 31 March 2008 by Mr. V.P. Borshchevsky and Ms. E.N. Borshchevskaya regarding 
possible violations of criminal procedure legislation by officials of the Vitebsk provincial 
department of the Committee for State Security during the search, the complainants&#8217; allegations 
were not upheld. The items seized during the search were examined in the established manner, 
after which the prosecutor&#8217;s office for the city of Minsk ruled that they should be returned to 
their owners. In the course of the investigation into this case, Mr. Borshchevsky was not 
detained. The Government also noted that the preliminary investigation in this case has been 
suspended. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>255. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations 
</b></p>
<p>256. On 31 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the 
Government regarding Ms. Zhanna Popova, executive director of the Vitebsk Kurier Publishing 
House where the Vitebsk Courier M newspaper is published; and Mr. Vyacheslav Andreev and 
Ms. Olga Karatch, both of whom are involved in the Our House Campaign for the promotion of 
human rights. Ms. Olga Karatch is the leader of the campaign and head of the Female Centre 
&#8220;Adliga&#8221;, a women&#8217;s human rights organization. 
</p>
<p>257. Mr. Vyacheslav Andreev was the subject of a letter of allegations sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
23 November 2006. We acknowledge receipt of your Government&#8217;s response 
on 23 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>258. According to information received, on 23 July 2008 at approximately 7:50 a.m., officers 
from the Vitebsk Regional Department of Organized Crime (BUOP) carried out a search of the 
home of Ms. Zhanna Popova. 11 diskettes, seven compact discs and other information-storage 
devices were confiscated. The officers also attempted to take a computer. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p>259. The officers claimed that the search was carried out in relation to a bombing in Minsk 
on 4 July 2008, and that Ms. Zhanna Popova&#8217;s property was confiscated on the suspicion that it 
might contain instructions on how to build a bomb. However, reports suggest that the search may 
have been related to a letter written by Ms. Zhanna Popova to the Chief of Vitebsk Police 
regarding confiscation of copies of the Vitebsk Courier M newspaper by Belarusian authorities 
on 24 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>260. After the search, Ms. Zhanna Popova was brought to the office of the UBOP for 
questioning. Mr. Vyacheslav Andreev and Ms. Olga Karatch followed in a taxi. Their taxi was 
then blocked by officers; they were pulled out of the taxi and brought to Zheleznodorozhny 
Police Precinct where attempts were made to take their fingerprints and photographs for a civic 
database. The three individuals were released after three hours.  
</p>
<p>261. Concern was expressed that the search on the home and the confiscation of the property of 
Ms. Zhanna Popova, as well as the detention of all three human rights defenders, may be directly 
related to their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>262. In a letter dated 03 September 2008, the Government of Belarus responded to the 
communication above. 
</p>
<p>263. The Government reported that in September 2005, unidentified individuals set off 
explosions of home-made devices in Vitebsk; as a result, 54 persons received wounds of various 
degrees. In this regard, the investigative department of the Vitebsk province procurator&#8217;s office 
instituted criminal proceedings (case No. 05023280078); the case is still under investigation. On 
4 July 2008, a home-made explosive device was detonated in Minsk near Pobeditelei Avenue, 
injuring over 50 persons. Earlier, on 3 July 2008, a home-made explosive device was found in 
the same area and deactivated. 
</p>
<p>264. One possibility being considered by the investigative bodies is that the same individuals 
were responsible for detonating or planning the explosions in Vitebsk and Minsk. The 
investigation established that, on 23 and 24 July 2005, Mr. I.V. Solovyev, who lives in Vitebsk, 
independently made an explosive substance; Mr. Solovyev&#8217;s careless handling of the substance 
resulted in an explosion in which he was seriously injured. The home-made explosive device 
discovered in Minsk on 3 July 2008 contained an explosive the chemical composition of which is 
identical to the substance synthesized by Mr. Solovyev. This fact led to the consideration of the 
possibility that Mr. Solovyev might have been involved in the production of the explosive 
devices and in the explosions in Vitebsk and Minsk. 
</p>
<p>265. Mr. Solovyev is an acquaintance of Ms. Z.V. Popova. They live in the same building. 
Ms. Popova is on friendly terms with Mr. Solovyev&#8217;s mother. A few minutes after the explosion 
that took place on 24 July 2005, Ms. Popova was in Mr. Solovyev&#8217;s apartment, having opened 
the door with her own key. Ms. Popova has a criminal record. She was diagnosed as suffering 
from involutional paranoia and was for a long time under psychiatric treatment. The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p>investigators considered the possible involvement of Ms. Popova or individuals linked to her in 
the organization of the explosions in Vitebsk and Minsk. It is assumed that such individuals 
could have taken advantage of Mr. Solovyev&#8217;s knowledge of chemistry and his ability to make 
explosives. 
</p>
<p>266. In order to verify this hypothesis, Mr. D.I. Yanush, the investigator for serious cases of the 
investigative department of the Vitebsk province procurator&#8217;s office and who is dealing with the 
criminal case involving the explosions in Vitebsk, took decisions to search the homes of 
Ms. Popova and Mr. Solovyev. The decisions were approved by the deputy procurator for 
Vitebsk province. In both cases, the search was assigned to officers of the Department for 
Combating Organized Crime attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus. The officers 
also took comprehensive measures with a view to ascertaining whether or not Ms. Popova and 
Mr. Solovyev could have been involved in the explosions in Vitebsk and Minsk. Ms. Popova&#8217;s 
and Mr. Solovyev&#8217;s homes were searched on 23 July 2008. The searches were conducted 
correctly. Neither Ms. Popova nor Mr. Solovyev submitted any complaints about the militia 
officers involved in the search. On the other hand, for almost three hours prior to the start of the 
search, Ms. Popova refused to allow the militia officers to enter her apartment, in spite of the fact 
that they presented the requisite documents. The militia officers entered the apartment only after 
the arrival of V.A. Shchukin, O.E. Karach and others, who were present during the search. No 
conflict situations arose in the course of the search. Neither Ms. Popova nor those present during 
the search submitted any complaints about the actions of the militia officers. They proposed that 
Ms. Popova go to the Department for Combating Organized Crime for Vitebsk province for 
questioning as a witness in the bombing case. At Ms. Popova&#8217;s request, Mr. V. Andreev and 
Mr. O. Karach, who had been present during the search, were allowed to accompany her; they 
agreed of their own accord to ride in the militia vehicle to Zheleznodorozhny district internal 
affairs office. 
</p>
<p>267. At the district internal affairs office, Mr. Andreev and Mr. Karach were requested to allow 
themselves to be fingerprinted and photographed. It was explained to them that, under Belarusian 
law, they had the right to refuse. Mr. Andreev and Mr. Karach made use of their right and 
refused to be fingerprinted and photographed, after which they left the militia office. No 
documents concerning the presence of the aforementioned persons in the militia office were 
drawn up. Mr. Andreev and Mr. Karach did not make any complaints and expressed their 
satisfaction with the correct and tactful conduct of the proceedings. They were at the district 
internal affairs office for no longer than 10 minutes. Mr. Andreev and Mr. Karach then 
proceeded to the Department for Combating Organized Crime for Vitebsk province, where they 
waited for the release of Ms. Popova, who was being questioned by an officer from the Central 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. No 
one detained, searched or questioned the aforementioned persons, and no one confiscated any of 
their property. No questions were raised about the human rights activities of these persons. The 
Vitebsk province procurator&#8217;s office does not have any documents concerning the confiscation 
from Ms. Popova of copies of the 24 April 2008 edition of the newspaper Vitebsky kuryer M. 
The conduct of the search of Ms. Popova&#8217;s home was not in any way related to these incidents. 
The conduct of the search of Ms. Popova&#8217;s home was in no way related to her human rights 
activities. During the search of Ms. Popova&#8217;s apartment on 23 July 2008, diskettes, compact 
discs and flashcards were confiscated. On 8 August 2008, all confiscated property was returned 
to Ms. Popova. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>268. In general, the investigation into Ms. Popova&#8217;s involvement in the explosions in Vitebsk 
and Minsk, including the search of her home, was conducted in strict compliance with legislation 
currently in force, with due respect for all international norms and standards relating to the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, and all the relevant provisions of the Constitution of 
Belarus. In connection with the aforementioned events, the citizens in question did not appeal to 
the Supreme Court of Belarus or to any other judicial authority. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>269. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 18 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>270. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. Yana Paliakova, a 
human rights defender, lawyer and member of the Human Rights Alliance of Belarus. 
</p>
<p>271. According to the information received, on 9 October 2008, Ms. Yana Paliakova was 
attacked by an unidentified man as she entered her house in Salihorsk. She was hit on the head 
and back. The attacker also told her that &#8220;if she didn&#8217;t shut up, this would be her last warning&#8221;. 
As a result of the attack, she was diagnosed in hospital with concussion. Following the medical 
check-up Ms. Paliakova went to the Salihorsk police station to file a complaint. When she felt ill 
at the station and tried to go outside, a policeman grabbed her by her sweater and pushed her to 
the floor, causing a bruise on her hip. 
</p>
<p>272. Ms. Paliakova previously lodged a complaint against the Salihorsk police station 
on 1 September 2008, concerning physical assault by the police that took place the previous day. 
Ms. Paliakova was stopped by the district policeman Mr. Pugachev and two other men, and 
taken to the regional office of Internal Affairs where she was hit on her arms and legs. Although 
Ms. Paliakova lodged repeated complaints regarding this incident with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
office and the District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, no inquiry has yet been launched. Ms. Paliakova 
defended several victims of excessive violence of the police, and one of the cases resulted in the 
dismissal of a policeman.  
</p>
<p>273. Concern was expressed that the attacks on, and harassment of, Ms. Paliakova was related 
to her activities as a human rights lawyer, acting on cases of excessive violence of the police. 
Further concern was expressed at the apparent lack of investigation and criminal proceedings in 
the cases of physical assault by members of the police forces.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>274. In a letter dated 9 January 2009, the Government responded to the above communication 
and reported that on instructions from the Office of the Procurator General of the Republic of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 53 
 
</p>
<p>Belarus, the procurator&#8217;s office for Minsk province has considered the letter from the Special 
Rapporteurs of the United Nations Human Rights Council concerning the illegal acts allegedly 
committed by law enforcement officers of Salihorsk district against Ms. Yana Vitalevna 
Polyakova. 
</p>
<p>275. No harassment of Ms. Polyakova for her human rights activities has been established. 
Since 2000, Ms. Polyakova has been officially unemployed. She has never held, nor does she 
currently hold, a licence to practise law. Ms. Polyakova is not well regarded at her place of 
residence. Her neighbours have filed numerous complaints of disorderly conduct with 
residential board No. 4 and with the internal affairs agencies. For example, on 20 August 2008 
Ms. Polyakova attacked her neighbour, Ms. A.D. Medvedeva, for having filed a complaint 
against her with the internal affairs agencies for walking her dog without a muzzle, as a result of 
which the dog had bitten Ms. Medvedeva. In this connection, a court heard the case concerning 
the administrative offence committed by Ms. Polyakova. The case was settled through 
conciliation between Ms. Polyakova and Ms. Medvedeva and is now closed. Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s 
claim that she was arrested by a neighbourhood police officer and two unidentified men and then 
assaulted by police officers has been investigated by the procurator&#8217;s office for Salihorsk district.  
</p>
<p>276. On 1 September 2008, the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office received a statement from 
Ms. Polyakova in which she indicated that she had begun receiving threatening calls on her 
home phone from unidentified persons demanding that she meet with officers of the State 
Security Committee (KGB) and internal affairs agencies. In her statement, she also reported that 
she had been arrested on 31 August 2008 in town by Mr. V.A. Pugachev, a neighbourhood 
police officer, who was accompanied by two unidentified men, and driven to the Salihorsk 
district internal affairs office (police station). There, in his office, Mr. Pugachev proposed that 
she sign some documents. When she tried to read them, lie hit her on the arm with an elongated 
cylindrical object, and subsequently another person hit her on the legs. The forensic medical 
report concluded that when Ms. Polyakova was examined by experts on 2 September 2008 she 
had bruises on her right palm, her left calf and the outside of her right shin; they were minor 
injuries and had no short-term health effects. It was impossible to confirm or disprove 
Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s statements about the calls to her home phone. For technical reasons, 
information about incoming calls is not registered at the automatic telephone exchange. 
According to information from the head of the Salihorsk municipal KGB unit, KGB officers 
issued no summons, including by telephone, for Ms. Polyakova. Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s claims that she 
was arrested on 31 August 2008 by Mr. Pugachev; the internal affairs officer, taken to the 
Salihorsk district police station and assaulted there were not substantiated. 
</p>
<p>277. It was established that on 31 August 2008 there were holiday celebrations in the town of 
Salihorsk, and that internal affairs officers were stationed there between the hours of 9 a.m. and 
10 p.m. to maintain order. Mr. Pugachev was at that time on duty in the town&#8217;s central square. 
He did not absent himself for any extended periods, as attested by the deployment plan of the 
Salihorsk district internal affairs office and by explanations given by internal affairs officers. On 
that day, Mr. Pugachev did not arrest Ms. Polyakova or summon her to the district police station. 
Ms. Polyakova was summoned to appear before neighbourhood police officer Pugachev 
on 1 September 2008 in connection with Ms. Medvedeva&#8217;s complaint that she had been attacked 
by Ms. Polyakova. Instead, Ms. Polyakova appeared at the Salihorsk district police station on 
31 August 2008 at 11.18 a.m., informing the officer on duty that she had been summoned by 
Mr. Pugachev. The duty officer duly recorded her visit in the log and informed her that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 54 
 
</p>
<p>officer in question was absent. Ms. Polyakova then stated that she had &#8220;no intention of chasing 
him down&#8221;, and after a short time, she left the building. On examination, the Salihorsk district 
police station log was found to contain an entry indicating that Ms. Polyakova addressed the duty 
officer at 11.22 a.m. on 31 August 2008. The police station&#8217;s video surveillance system shows 
Ms. Polyakova entering the building unaccompanied at 11.18 a.m. on 31 August 2008. She 
immediately approached the desk of the duty officer and sat down on a bench next to the officer, 
who recorded her data in the log. While in the building, Ms. Polyakova did not go to the second 
floor, where Mr. Pugachev&#8217;s office is located, nor did she speak with anyone other than the duty 
officer. At 11.34 a.m., she left the building and did not return. The Salihorsk ambulance station 
received a call from Ms. Polyakova on 31 August 2008 at 11.41 a.m. An ambulance paramedic, 
Mr. V.I. Sereda, explained that on 31 August 2008 at around 11.30 a.m. he arrived at the 
Salihorsk district police station behind an internal affairs officer who was supposed to assist 
medical workers in transporting a mentally disturbed individual. Near the building, he was 
approached by a young woman, who turned out to be Ms. Polyakova, and who stated that it was 
she who had called for an ambulance, as her right arm was hurting. She had swelling and bruises 
on the back of the hand. Mr. Sereda replied that he had not come in response to her call. 
Ms. Polyakova said nothing about having been beaten by internal affairs officers. At the 
instruction of the ambulance dispatcher, Mr. Sereda returned to the district police station at 
around 12 noon to assist Ms. Polyakova. She began to cry and claimed that she had been beaten 
by internal affairs officers. She also complained of pain in her legs. 
</p>
<p>278. The investigation by the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office concluded that on 
31 August 2008 internal affairs officers did not arrest Ms. Polyakova, bring her to the Salihorsk 
district police station or subject her to violent treatment. Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s injuries were sustained 
not in the police station, but in other circumstances, which she is intentionally concealing. 
</p>
<p>279. On 11 September 2008, the criminal case against Ms. Polyakova was dropped, and she was 
informed of this in writing. The Minsk provincial procurator&#8217;s office on 11 December 2008 
overturned the decision of the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office not to bring a criminal case 
against Ms. Polyakova for intentionally filing a false report. The case file was referred back to 
the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office so that criminal proceedings could be instituted against 
Ms. Polyakova under article 400, part 2, of the Criminal Code (Intentionally filing a false report, 
with an accusation of a serious crime). An investigation into the injuries sustained by 
Ms. Polyakova on 9 October 2008 was carried out by the Salihorsk district internal affairs office. 
It concluded that at around 5 p.m. near the door of the corridor in the apartment building where 
Ms. Polyakova resided, an unidentified man struck Ms. Polyakova inflicting injuries on her; 
these were not serious and had no short-term health effects. According to the forensic medical 
report, a bruise was detected on Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s right forehead. It was not possible to identify 
the man. 
</p>
<p>280. The investigation by the Salihorsk district internal affairs office resulted in a decision not 
to open a criminal case, as the actions of the unidentified individual did not constitute a crime. 
Once the perpetrator is identified, he will be charged with an administrative offence under 
article 9.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (Disorderly conduct). There has been no 
indication that this act is connected with Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s human rights activities. On 
27 October 2008, the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office received a statement from 
Ms. Polyakova, copies of which were also sent by her to the embassies of the United States of 
America, Germany, Poland and France. In the statement, she claimed that on 9 October 2008, at </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p>the entry to her place of residence, an unidentified man struck her twice on the head. According 
to Ms. Polyakova, at the Salihorsk district police station, where she was taken to be interviewed, 
an internal affairs officer threw her to the floor, as a result of which she was badly hurt in the 
region of her spine and right leg. 
</p>
<p>281. An investigation conducted regarding this statement established that on 9 October 2008 
at 5.01 p.m. a call had been received from Ms. Polyakova according to which an unidentified 
person had beaten her in the entry to her apartment house. The ambulance crew brought her to 
the central district hospital, and once medical assistance had been provided, to the police station 
for interview. However, during the interview, Ms. Polyakova said that she felt unwell, and so at 
7.49 p.m. another ambulance was called for her. Ms. Polyakova did not wait for the ambulance 
to arrive. She left the building. As a result, she had to be tracked down on the street. When the 
doctors remarked that she had already received qualified medical assistance, Ms. Polyakova 
reacted inappropriately; she began swearing at the medical staff and screaming. She did not 
address the doctors&#8217; remarks. She refused medical assistance and attempted to leave the building. 
A neighbourhood police officer, Mr. A.V. Sindikevich, asked her to return, calm down and take 
a seat on a bench. He took her by the hand to escort her to the bench. In response, Ms. Polyakova 
abruptly threw herself to the floor. Sitting on the floor, she began to make calls on her mobile 
phone, saying that internal affairs officers were beating her, that they had &#8220;broken [her] spine&#8221; 
and that her &#8220;back huit&#8221;. According to the video recordings taken in the entrance hall of the 
district police station, Ms. Polyakova sat on the floor for at least 35 minutes. During this time, 
she was on numerous occasions invited to stand up, but she continued to sit there until the arrival 
of a new ambulance crew, which had been called by the internal affairs officers because of the 
conflict between Ms. Polyakova and the previous crew. The forensic medical report concluded 
that apart from the bruise on her forehead referred to above, there were no signs of injury on 
Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s body, including in the region of her spine. Because Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s complaint 
of the use of violence against her by internal affairs officers on 9 October 2008 was also not 
borne out, the Salihorsk district procurator&#8217;s office on 27 November 2008 decided not to institute 
criminal proceedings against the officers, for Jack, of evidence that a crime had been committed. 
Ms. Polyakova failed to appear at procurators&#8217; offices when, on numerous occasions, she was 
summoned by them. The Office of the Procurator General of the Republic of Belarus agreed with 
the decisions not to open a criminal case in respect of Ms. Polyakova&#8217;s complaints.

<p>283. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Mr. Branko Todorovic, Executive Director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, a 
branch of the International Helsinki Federation in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
On 7 February 2004, Mr. Branko Todorovic reportedly received death threats accusing him 
of being a NATO agent and threatening his family. This followed an article in which 
Mr. Branko Todorovic criticised the lack of investigation into an attack against the President of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>the Milici Citizens&#8217; Association and a lack of will on the part of the Minister of the Interior 
to arrest suspected war criminals. For the last year Mr. Branko Todorovic and his family 
were allegedly under the surveillance of an individual who used his car to attack 
Mr. Branko Todorovic in late May 2008. 
</p>
<p>284. The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights was the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
on 18 October 2004 by the then Special Representative for the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders. No response has yet been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p>285. According to information received, on 22 July 2008, at approximately 2 p.m., an unknown 
man called the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights to tell them &#8220;huge amounts of money have 
been given for the assassination of Mr. Branko Todorovic and his family as he has permanently 
heavily criticized powerful persons from the police and the prosecutor&#8217;s office&#8221;. The caller 
provided details which proved that he had been following Mr. Branko Todorovic and his family 
for the last two months. On 27 July 2008, Mr. Branko Todorovic was again threatened. 
</p>
<p>286. Concern was expressed that the threats made against Mr. Branko Todorovic may have been 
directly related to his legitimate work in the defense of human rights. In light of the events 
described above concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Branko Todorovic, as well as that of his family. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>287. In a letter dated 10 October 2008, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina responded 
to the urgent appeal sent on 30 July 2008. The Government reported that the competent law 
enforcement agencies were requested to investigate the allegations contained in the 
communication and to inform about their findings. According to information received from the 
Republika Srpska Ministry of the Interior and the State Investigations and Protection Agency, 
the events are investigated by the Public Security Center in Bijeljina under supervision of the 
District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The Government also noted that the police have increased security 
measures around the home of Mr. Branko Todorovic and the premises of the Helsinki Committee 
in Bijeljina.

on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations concerning participants of 
the &#8220;Sarajevo Queer Festival&#8221;, a festival of art and culture, organized to promote awareness of 
the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. According to the 
information received, permission for the first &#8220;Sarajevo Queer Festival&#8221; was granted to the 
organizing NGO called &#8216;Udruzenje Q&#8217; for 24-28 September 2008 in Sarajevo. This festival of art 
and culture included a series if exhibitions, performances, film showings and public discussions 
to promote the universality of human rights and an end to discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity. In the month preceding the festival, several newspapers, including </p>

  page 57 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;SAFF&#8221; and &#8220;Dnevni Avaz&#8221; used derogatory language in reaction to gay and lesbian people and 
called for the participants of the festival to be lynched, stoned, doused with petrol or expelled 
from the country.  
</p>
<p>290. Death threats were issued on the internet against several individual gay rights activists, 
including members of the NGO &#8220;Udruzenje Q&#8221;; media, venues and organizers received threats 
on a daily basis, and appeals were made to the public to disrupt the festival. Organization Q&#8217;s 
forum at queer.ba website was hacked into twice. Tram stops in Sarajevo were covered with 
posters quoting the Qur&#8217;an and inciting hatred against homosexuals. Participants of the opening 
ceremony were physically attacked at the end of the first day of the festival. Eight persons were 
injured, including QSF international quests, several journalists and at least one policeman, when 
dozens of young people described as &#8220;Wahhabis&#8221;, &#8220;football fans&#8221; and &#8220;skinheads&#8221; attacked 
participants of the festival. Six persons sought medical assistance, but media and eyewitness 
claim many more attacks went unreported.  
</p>
<p>291. Although the festival was granted permission to be held until 28 September 2008, as the 
security situation deteriorated, the organizers decided to close the event to the public. When the 
death threats continued, they decided to terminate the festival. The decision was based on their 
assessment of the situation due to the lack of protection by the police. Death threats against the 
organizers continue.  
</p>
<p>292. Grave concern was expressed that the hate campaigns in the lead up to the event directly 
contributed to the climate of fear, hatred and intolerance which culminated in physical attacks 
and the harassment of the participants. It was recommended that the use of homophobic language 
by the media must be strongly condemned. Concern was expressed that these activities appeared 
to constitute a deliberate attempt to prevent participants and defenders from carrying out their 
peaceful activities in raising awareness of the universality of human rights. Further concerns 
were expressed by the absence of appropriate policing which contributed to the disruption of the 
event and failure to provide adequate protection to participants of the festival.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>293. The Special Rapporteurs thank the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the 
substantive response provided to the urgent appeal of 30 July 2008. The Special Rapporteurs 
appreciate that the events are investigated by the Public Security Center in Bijeljina under 
supervision of the District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and would welcome further details about the 
outcome of those investigations. The Special Rapporteurs welcome the decision of the 
Government also to provide increased security measures around the home of Mr. Branko 
Todorovic and the premises of the Helsinki Committee in Bijeljina.  
</p><p>294. At the same time, The Special Rapporteur regrets that no response had been transmitted yet 
to the communication of 27 November 2008, regarding participants of the Sarajevo Queer 
Festival. In this connection, the Special Rapporteurs wished to remind the Government of the 
provisions of the Declaration on human rights defenders, in particular article 7 which states that 
&#8220;Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to develop and discuss new 
human rights ideas and principles and to advocates their acceptance&#8221;, as well as article 12, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that &#8220;the State shall take all necessary 
measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, (&#8230;) against any 
violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
Declaration&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>295. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 18 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>296. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Walter Lessa Oliveira, 
cameraman at the local public network TV Assembl&#233;ia in Macei&#243;, AL. 
</p>
<p>297. According to the information received, on 5 January 2008 Mr. Oliveira was murdered by 
four gunshots on the outskirts of Macei&#243; while waiting on a bus stop. According to witnesses, 
the perpetrator of the crime was a local drug trafficker whom Mr. Oliveira had recently filmed 
and whose footage had appeared on television. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>298. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>299. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Ms. Maria de 
Lourdes Didier Leite, a human rights defender in the State of Pernambuco. 
</p>
<p>300. According to information received, Ms. Didier Leite had been the subject of harassment 
due to her public criticism of the police investigation of her brother&#8217;s killing. Jos&#233; Arnaldo 
Didier Leite, a farmer, assassinated on August 15th, 2003, allegedly at the hands of members of 
the police force and the city administration. Since that time, Ms. Didier Leite had reportedly 
faced death threats as a result of her denunciation of inefficiency and delays in the investigation. 
Reports indicated that she had also been warned that a member of the Military Police, identified 
in the information received, would make an attempt on her life if he lost his job as a consequence 
of investigations regarding Jos&#233; Arnaldo Didier&#8217;s killing.  
</p>
<p>301. Concern was expressed that the intimidation and threats made against Ms. Didier Leite 
may be directly related to her activities in defence of human rights, particularly her peaceful 
exercise of the right to freedom of expression. In view of the threats made against 
Ms. Didier Leite, serious concern was also expressed for her physical and psychological 
integrity. </p>

<p>302. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 27 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>303. On 27 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning over 900 women, who are affiliated to the movement V&#237;a Campesina 
(International Peasant Movement). V&#237;a Campesina seeks to promote agrarian reform and 
land-workers&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>304. According to information received, on 4 March 2008, the aforementioned group of 
over 900 women staged a reportedly peaceful occupation of the Fazenda Tarum&#225; in the district of 
Rosario do Sul, situated approximately 400 km from Porto Alegre. It was claimed by the 
protestors that the land in question, covering 2,100 hectares, was illegally acquired by the 
transnational company Stora Enso, and those staging the occupation demanded its restitution 
under the agrarian reform process. 
</p>
<p>305. Reports indicated that, on 4 March 2008, the Military Police harassed and intimidated the 
women and that excessive and violent use of police force was exercised by the officers. These 
incidents are said to have resulted in 15 women sustaining injuries and one miscarrying as a 
result of alleged police actions. Water, food and medication are said to be in short supply in the 
area occupied by the women. It had been alleged that the efforts of the legal team defending the 
women and access on the part of the media have been impeded. A representative of the 
presidential Special Secretary for Human Rights had also reportedly been refused access to the 
area. 
</p>
<p>306. Concern was expressed that the harassment of the aforementioned women and the alleged 
use of violence against them may be directly related to their work in defense of human rights, 
particularly their activities to promote the rights of peasants and land-workers. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>307. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 3 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>308. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning the reported attack against the human rights defender 
Mr. Welinton da Silva, member of the Movimento Sem Terra (MST) (Movement of Landless 
Peasants) which forms part of the V&#237;a Campesina network currently supporting the rights of the 
communities being affected by the construction of a dam in Estreito, Maranh&#227;o. The 
hydroelectric project requires the flooding of 400 square kilometres, affecting the lands and 
homes of 21,000 people, including the African-Brazilian communities of Bico do Papagayo. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>309. According to the information received, on 11 March 2008, at 11.30 p.m., Mr. da Silva was 
attacked while participating in an on-site demonstration in a quarry in Estreito, Maranh&#227;o, to 
protest against the building of a dam. He was sleeping in the camp of Movimento dos Antingidos 
por Barragens [MAB] (Movement of Dam-affected People), in the workers&#8217; area of the quarry, 
when he was shot in the leg by an individual who reportedly fired gunshots from a passing car. 
Mr. da Silva was taken to the Municipal Hospital in Estreito where he received treatment for his 
injuries. The demonstration at the quarry formed part of protests to mark the International Day of 
Action against Dams and for Rivers, Water and Life, on 14 March. Participants were calling for 
further studies to be undertaken to investigate the impact the project is to have on the 
River Tocantins, as well as for compensation to be given to the communities that are to be 
displaced as a result of the construction of the dam. 
</p>
<p>310. It was feared that Mr. da Silva was targeted as a result of his human rights activities, in 
particular his work to defend the land rights of communities in Brazil. The mandate-holders 
expressed their concern about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. da Silva and other 
members of the MST. 
</p>
<p>311. Attacks against defenders working on the protection of the environment and land rights in 
several reports form part of a trend which had been detected by the then Special Representative 
on human rights defenders, both in her report on the visit to Brazil (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2) and in 
some of her thematic reports. &#8220;According to the statistics of communications sent by the Special 
Representative, the second most vulnerable group when it comes to the danger of being killed 
because of their activities in the defence of human rights, are defenders working on land rights 
and natural resources.&#8221; (A/HRC/4/37, para. 45). In this context, the mandate-holders underlined 
the recommendations of the Special Representative contained in her report on the visit to Brazil, 
in particular paragraph 102, which states that &#8220;the State must play a more proactive role in 
mediation of social conflict and in giving legitimacy to interventions by human rights defenders 
to promote and protect economic, social and cultural rights. In particular defenders must not be 
left isolated in their struggle for or support of social justice against powerful or influential social 
entities and economic interests [&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>312. On 10 October 2008, the Brazilian Government responded to the communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteurs. In its response, the Government confirmed the accuracy of the facts 
described in the allegation letter. On 11 March 2008 at 11.30 p.m., Mr. Silva was shot in the leg 
when he participated in the occupation of the Hydroelectric Plant of Estreito by MAB and Via 
Campesina militants. He was subsequently taken to the Municipal Hospital of Estreito and was 
subject to a surgical procedure to remove the projectile.  
</p><p>313. The Government also informed that the Police Department of Estreito (State of Maranh&#227;o) 
opened an investigation on the case (n. 18/2008), under article 15 of Law 10826/263 and article 
129 of the Penal Code. Mr. Luis Carlos Pereira Lima was arrested and indicted. The victim did 
not resort to the National Program of Protection of Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>314. The Government further provided information on the measures taken by the Government 
to implement the recommendations of the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on human rights defenders in her country report on Brazil. In response to the recommendation </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 61 
 
</p>
<p>contained in para. 101, the Government noted the creation of a Special Commission aimed at 
investigating attempts to criminalize social movements, proposing solutions that guarantee 
respects for civil rights and public liberties around the country. The Commission is already 
functioning and will shortly present a report on its work.  
</p>
<p>315. In what concerns the strengthening and expansion of the National Program of Protection of 
Human Rights Defenders, the Government, though its Special Secretariat for Human Rights, has 
been trying to institutionalize an Inter-Ministerial Commission to discuss, analyze and prevent 
the causes that lead to violations and threats to human rights defenders. This action is consistent 
with the recommendations contained in pares. 102 and 103 of the then Special Representative&#8217;s 
report. The Government further underlined the creation of the National Program of Protection of 
Human Rights Defenders and the extension of the Program through partnerships with local 
administrations and civil society.  
</p>
<p>316. The Coordination of the National Program of Protection of Human Rights Defenders has 
been defending the adoption of a law establishing rules for the protection of Human Rights 
Defenders. The adoption of such a law would give more legal certainty to actions protecting 
human rights defenders and ensure adequate budgetary support and institutional commitment of 
state institutions such as the police forces. This proposal would meet the then Special 
Representative&#8217;s recommendation contained in para. 108 of her report. A national mapping 
exercise of the situation of human rights defenders has also been planned by the Coordination of 
the Program. A number of actions to foster consultation with civil society around the country are 
also being developed. These actions are in line with the recommendations contained in 
pares. 104 and 107 of the then Special Representative&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>317. In what concerns the then Special Representative&#8217;s recommendation in para. 105 of her 
Report, the Government informed of a partnership established between the Special Secretariat of 
Human Rights and the Ministry of Justice for human rights training of members of the police 
forces, particularly at the National Force of Public Security. Finally, regarding the Special 
Representative&#8217;s recommendation in para. 106 of her report, the Government noted that since 
2001 a National Ombudsman for Human Rights exists to respond to criticisms, allegations of 
violations, complaints and recommendations from the public. This is a fast and direct mechanism 
to identify how human rights are being threatened, violated or being neglected and the adequate 
means to protect them. The Government also noted the Program for Institutional Support to 
Police Ombudspersons, financed with European Union support, to improve external control 
mechanisms to check police violence. The Government concluded by stating its commitment to 
implement the recommendations of the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>318. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 7 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>319. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, 
sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning legal constraints imposed upon the 
freedom of expression of teachers and professors of the state of S&#227;o Paulo which could be </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 62 
 
</p>
<p>interfering on the full realization of the right to education itself. Allegedly, this is a consequence 
of the Statute of the Civil Servants of the State of S&#227;o Paulo, 1968 (Estatuto dos Servidores Civis 
do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo, 1968), Decree n.&#176; 7.510 of 29 January 1976 (Decreto n.&#176; 7.510, 
de 29 de janeiro de 1976), and Resolution SE n.&#176; 170 of 25 July 1990 (Resolu&#231;&#227;o SE n.&#176; 170, 
de 25 de julho de 1990).  
</p><p>320. According to the information received, some parts of the mentioned legislation would be 
contrary to international obligations that arise from international treaties that Brazil has 
subscribed. Regarding the Statute of the Civil Servants of the State of S&#227;o Paulo, which dates 
from 1968, there are two articles that have reportedly prevented civil servants working in the 
education sector from freely articulating their opinion on matters related to the education system.  
</p>
<p>321. Article 241 of the referred Statute provides for strict confidentiality of all subjects 
and decisions of the public division, a provision that would contradict the principle of 
transparency and publicity that guides the Public Administration. Moreover, Article 242 of the 
Statute prohibits civil servants from publically referring in a disparaging manner to the 
authorities and acts of the Administration. It was also reported in the information received that 
journalists in Brazil have been denouncing the fact that teachers constantly refuse to provide 
information on educational policies to the media for the fear of repressive measures. In addition, 
Article 131, II, 1) of the Decree n.&#176; 7.510 and Article 1 of the Resolution SE n.&#176; 170 proclaim 
that civil servants need special authorization from the Secretary of Education in order to give 
interviews to the media regarding subjects of the division they are allocated to. These provisions 
could discourage education professionals from taking initiatives towards the improvement and 
adjustment of certain sectors of the educational system to the changing needs of society and 
students. Such discouragement could negatively affect the right to good quality education.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>322. On 11 September 2008, the Brazilian Government responded to the communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteurs. The Government made the following remarks: 
</p>
<p>323. &#8220;The Special Rapporteurs question whether there is any legal constraints imposed upon the 
freedom of expression of teachers and professors of the State of S&#227;o Paulo as a consequence of 
the Statute of the Civil Servants of the State of Sao Paulo, 1968 (Estatuto dos Servidores Civis 
do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo, 1968), Decree n. &#176; 7.510 of 29 January 1976 (Decreto n. &#176; 7.510, de 
29 de janeiro de 1976), and Resolution SE n. &#176; 170 of 25 July 1990 (Resolu&#231;&#227;o SE n. &#176; 170, de 
25 de julho de 1990). With regard to the Statute of the Civil Servants of the State of Sao Paulo, it 
is worth clarifying that its finality has not been interpreted as to prevent civil servants from 
freely articulating their opinion when they are not doing so in their capacity as civil servants, but 
only when they express their opinion in the performance of their function or under the 
justification of carrying out their functions, thus implicating the State itself. Therefore, this 
legislation is not aimed at hampering the freedom of expression of civil servants, who are free to 
express their personal opinions. Its objective is to ensure uniformity of the public authority when 
it is requested in the name of a public agency and with the aim of avoiding irreparable damages 
to the public interest. It is worth stressing in this context that the State, as legal entity, does not </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 63 
 
</p>
<p>possess a will or opinion; its will and action are expressed through its agents, to the extent that 
they hold such authority. In this way, what the agent expresses in his functional quality is 
intended to be the expression of the State, on the basis of a relationship of direct imputation of 
the acts of State agents. 
</p>
<p>324. With regard to the Resolution SE n.&#176; 170 of 25 July 1990, it should be noted that it was 
revoked on 21 August 2008, by means of Resolution SE n.&#176; 63 of 20 August 2008, due to &#8220;the 
need to revoke expressly or tacitly any act either in disuse or already revoked expressly or 
tacitly, though never nominated&#8221;, among other reasons, in accordance to the exposition of 
motives. According to the Secretary of Education, surveys are being carried out on the 
reorganization of its structure, attributions and competencies, which indicate the revocation of 
the Decree n.&#176; 7.510 of 29 January 1976. 
</p>
<p>325. We hope we answered the questions posed by the Rapporteurs. In addition, it is worth 
communicating that the Secretary of Education informed that it did not deny any request of 
interviews to teachers or directors since it considers this to be their decision, thus showing that 
the above mentioned legislation is in disuse. In this sense, it informed that the current 
management of the Secretary did not punish any teacher for having been interviewed and that it 
is fully favorable to the freedom of expression of professors and of any other person. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>326. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 29 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>327. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government 
concerning the shooting attack against Mr. Edson Ferraz, aged 25, journalist of the TV Di&#225;rio, 
affiliated to the Rede Globo network. 
</p>
<p>328. According to the information received, at around 10 p.m. of 15 May 2008, Mr. Ferraz was 
driving home in Mogi das Cruzes, a suburb of S&#227;o Paulo, in a car with TV Di&#225;rio&#8217;s logo, when 
two masked men in a black car blocked his way and the driver opened fire twice without hitting 
Mr. Ferraz. They did not try to rob the journalist, who had received an anonymous call on his 
mobile the previous day advising him to &#8220;take care&#8221;. Mr. Ferraz reported the attack to his 
TV station and the local military police. He left the town the next day with his family. It is 
reported that the car used in the attack was found on the outskirts of Mogi das Cruzes 
on 17 May. 
</p>
<p>329. Mr. Ferraz had been working and reporting on cases involving police corruption. It is 
feared that the shooting attack against Mr. Ferraz was a form of reprisal for his activities as an 
investigative journalist in defense of transparency and a threat to dissuade him from continuing 
this work. The risks faced by journalists reporting on human rights, in particular those 
investigating corruption cases, were among the concerns raised in the report of the then </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
her visit to the country (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2, para. 31). The killing of Mr. Luiz Carlos 
Barbon Filho occurred on 5 May 2007 in the State of S&#227;o Paulo dramatically confirmed these 
concerns. The case was brought to the attention of the Government in an allegations letter of the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression dated 23 May 2007 to which the Government has not replied (A/HRC/7/11/Add.1, 
para. 55). In this context, the mandate-holders were particularly concerned for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Ferraz.

</b></p>
<p>331. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning the safety 
of staff members of the Di&#225;rio de Amazonas newspaper, based in the city of Manaus.  
</p>
<p>332. According to information received, on 21 June 2008 at approximately 4:30 a.m., two 
armed individuals on a motorcycle fired eleven shots at the headquarter offices of the Di&#225;rio de 
Amazonas newspaper, in central Manaus. Six bullets reportedly caused damage to the main 
entrance of the building and shattered windows on the first storey, where the president and 
vice-president of the newspaper have their offices. No-one was injured in the attack.  
</p><p>333. According to reports, prior to the incident the newspaper had been involved in reporting on 
several cases of alleged corruption, implicating the government of Coari, a city 360 kilometres 
west of Manaus. Less than 24 hours before the attack, several alleged associates of the mayor of 
Coari were arrested, some of whom had been linked by the newspaper to serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>334. It is claimed that police reports have suggested that the attack was carried out by 
disgruntled former employees. However results from footage recorded by surveillance cameras 
installed outside the building, have yet to be revealed. 
</p>
<p>335. Concern was expressed that the afore-mentioned incident may be a direct attempt to stifle 
freedom of expression in Brazil.

</b></p>
<p>337. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Roberto 
de Oliveira Monte, founder of the National Movement for Human Rights, former  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 65 
 
</p>
<p>General Coordinator of the State Program for Education in Human Rights, long-term employee 
of the Commission of Pontifical Justice and Peace in the arch-diocese of Natal, and member of 
the National Committee of Human Rights, the Centre of Human Rights and Popular Memory, 
and the State Council of Human Rights. He was also central to the creation of DHNet, a website 
which provides information on the issue of human rights. 
</p>
<p>338. According to information received, in late October 2005, an accusation was made to the 
Military Court by the Military Public Prosecutor against Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte. The 
accusation came after Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte gave a lecture entitled &#8220;Human Rights - 
Thing of the Police&#8221; at an event organized by the Association of Soldiers of the Brazilian Army. 
In his lecture Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte promoted respect for the rule of law within the 
armed forces, defended the creation of human rights commissions for the armed forces, and 
objected to the ban on unionization for soldiers. He also raised registered cases of internal human 
rights abuses in the army whereby members of the military were allegedly deprived of sleep, 
forced to drink chicken&#8217;s blood, and made remain on their knees in ant colonies. 
</p>
<p>339. On 24 January 2008, the Military Public Prosecutor, who had objected to what he 
considered inappropriate comparisons between current and former army officials by Mr. Roberto 
de Oliveira in the lecture, filed a complaint against Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte for incitement 
to disobedience and offense to the Armed Forces under Articles 155 and 219 of the Military 
Penal Code. These charges carry possible prison sentences of four years and one year 
respectively. On 23 July 2008, Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte was scheduled for interrogation at 
the Special Council of the Army&#8217;s Court. This interrogation did not take place, reportedly 
because there were not enough colonels available to represent the Council. No new date for the 
interrogation was given when the cancellation was made. 
</p>
<p>340. Mr. Roberto de Monte Oliveira was the only civilian out of a total of 14 defendants in the 
process Number 20/08-0, in the 7th Division of the Military Court, established in relation with 
the declarations realized during the Congress of Military Law. In addition to Mr. Roberto de 
Monte Oliveira, the colonel of the Military Police of Alagoas Joilson Gouveia was charged as 
well as the Army Sergeants Anderson Rog&#233;rio dos Santos, Lindomar de Oliveira, Dalton Sim&#227;o, 
S&#237;lvio Pekanoski, Francisco Ribeiro, Francisco Lima, Ant&#244;nio Lima, Lasser Saleh, Alberto dos 
Santos, Francisco Bezerra, Marcos Fran&#231;a and Edvaldo da Silva. 
</p>
<p>341. Concern was expressed that the charges brought against Mr. Roberto de Oliveira Monte 
may have been related to his legitimate activities in the defense of human rights, in particular his 
activities to promote human rights within the armed forces.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 28 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>343. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 66 
 
</p>
<p>criminalization of the Movimento dos Tarabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST - Landless 
Workers Social Movement), a non-governmental organization dedicated to the defense of land 
rights for peasant workers in Brazil, as well as concerning the killing of another MST leader, 
Eli Dallemole. Mandate holders have sent nine communications to the Government regarding 
members of the MST since 2005. The response from the Government on 9 January 2007 
regarding a communication sent on 11 October 2006 was welcomed, but concern was expressed 
that no other responses were received, especially given that five of the nine communications sent 
were in relation to killings of MST members in the last two years.  
</p>
<p>344. According to information received, on 25 June 2007, the Superior Council of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the State Rio Grande do Sul opened administrative procedures into the 
activities of the MST. On 3 December 2007, the Superior Council of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office unanimously approved a report which expressed the intention to dissolve the MST and to 
declare it illegal; to suspend marches and other mass demonstrations of the MST; to investigate 
organized crime, as well as the use of public funds and official aid in criminal and administrative 
spheres, among MST leaders and members; to work towards the closure of MST settlements near 
Coqueiros Farm and settlements being used as bases to invade private properties; to conduct 
electoral investigations in areas of MST settlements and cancel electoral cards in cases of any 
irregularity being observed.  
</p>
<p>345. A complaint was also filed against MST leaders of settlements near Coqueiros Farm in the 
municipality of Coqueiros do Sul by the Federal General Attorney&#8217;s Office. The complaint was 
based on the arguments of a landowner in Coqueiros do Sul regarding the Homeland Security 
Law. It accused the MST of wanting to change the Rule of Law and undo public order, and of 
having ties with guerrilla groups such as the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia 
(FARC). However, in 2007, a Federal Police investigation found that there were no ties between 
the MST and FARC or any other guerrilla groups. Moreover the Homeland Security Law was 
passed during the military dictatorship in Brazil, met subsequent amendments and criminalizes 
prodemocracy behavior such as forming anti-dictatorship associations and advertising change of 
the existing political order. 
</p>
<p>346. This year, hundreds of people have been ill-treated in police searches and forcefully 
evicted from MST settlements. The most recent eviction took place on 29 July 2008 
when 43 families were relocated to a potentially dangerous area.  
</p>
<p>347. The legal actions against the MST continued to be paralleled by killings of MST leaders 
perpetrated by gunmen suspected to be linked to associations of landowners. On 30 March 2008, 
around 7.30 p.m., masked men entered the home of Eli Dallemole, a leader of the MST in 
Paran&#225;, at the Assentamento Liberta&#231;ao Camponesa) in Ortigueira in Paran&#225; State, and killed 
him in front of his wife and children. This murder was preceded by repeated threats during the 
last two years and a previous assassination attempt. A man known as &#8220;Zezinho&#8221;, the leader of an 
armed group financed by landowners, was arrested on suspicion of being one of the gunmen. 
</p>
<p>348. On 21 October 2007, an armed militia had killed another MST leader, Valmir Mota de 
Oliveira, in Santa Tereza do Oeste, Paran&#225; State (see our communication to your Government 
of 26 October 2007 which regrettably remains without a reply as of today). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 67 
 
</p>
<p>349. Concern was expressed that the legal action taken against the MST may have been related 
to its activities in the defense of the rights of the landless rural workers. Concern was also 
expressed that such legal action against MST increases the vulnerability of its leaders and 
members to armed violence, including assassinations by hired gunmen.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>351. On 24 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding an attack on the home of Mr. Joinville Frota and harassment against the Transport 
Workers&#8217; Union in the state of Amap&#225; (TWU - Sindicato dos Condutores de Ve&#237;culos e 
Trabalhadores em Empresas Transportes Rodovi&#225;rios de Passageiros do Amap&#225;). 
Mr. Joinville Frota is president of the TWU.  
</p>
<p>352. According to the information received, in 2003, the headquarters of the TWU were 
ransacked. In 2004, the wife of Mr. Joinville Frota, a director of the TWU, was threatened at 
gunpoint. In April 2008, there was an arson attack against the TWU headquarters. In May 2008, 
Mr. Joinville Frota received death threats when leading a strike against a bus company.  
</p>
<p>353. More recently, on 23 August 2008, at approximately 2.45 a.m., a petrol bomb was thrown 
at Mr. Joinville Frota&#8217;s wooden house. The attack took place in the midst of an ongoing dispute 
between the TWU and two local bus companies over payment and health benefits. Although the 
fire was put out, Mr. Joinville Frota and his family have gone into hiding out of fear for their 
safety.  
</p>
<p>354. Following a complaint from Mr. Joinville Frota, two judges from the Tribunal Regional 
Eleitoral (Regional Electoral Tribunal) went to the house and requested a forensic examination 
by federal police. However, no arrests have been made in relation to this case or in the case of 
any of the other human rights violations hereby mentioned. Despite Mr. Joinville&#8217;s requests, he 
has not been granted protection by federal police. 
</p>
<p>355. Concern was expressed that the attack on the home of Mr. Joinville Frota and the various 
human rights violations against members of the TWU since 2003 may be related to the activities 
of the TWU in the defense of the rights of transport workers in Amap&#225;. Further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Joinville Frota, as well as that of 
his family and of other members of the TWU.

membres de l&#8217;opposition au parti au pouvoir. 
</p>
<p>358. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 8 mars 2008 quatre attaques &#224; la grenade 
quasi-simultan&#233;es contre les domiciles de Pasteur Mpawenayo, Mathias Basabose, 
Zaituni Radjabu et Alice Nzomukunda ont eu lieu. Ces quatre personnes sont toutes d&#8217;anciens

</p><p>359. Ces attaques se seraient produites alors que les tensions grandissent entre le parti au 
pouvoir et les partis d&#8217;opposition. En ao&#251;t 2007 d&#233;j&#224;, une s&#233;rie d&#8217;attaques &#224; la grenade contre des 
membres de l&#8217;opposition aurait eu lieu, &#224; la suite d&#8217;une crise politique lorsque des membres de 
l&#8217;opposition parlementaire avait demand&#233; que soit accord&#233; aux partis d&#8217;opposition un certain 
nombre de minist&#232;res en conformit&#233; avec les dispositions constitutionnelles. Les attaques du 
8 mars 2008 feraient suite &#224; une crise parlementaire due &#224; l&#8217;exclusion d&#8217;Alice Nzomukunda du 
CNDD-FDD et &#224; la d&#233;cision de ce parti de lui retirer le si&#232;ge de premi&#232;re vice-pr&#233;sidente de

enqu&#234;ter sur ces derni&#232;res attaques. Toutefois, il semblerait qu&#8217;une commission d&#8217;enqu&#234;te avait 
&#233;t&#233; nomm&#233;e pour enqu&#234;ter sur les attaques du mois d&#8217;ao&#251;t 2007, mais aucun rapport n&#8217;aurait &#224; ce

aurait avou&#233; avant de quitter le pays en d&#233;cembre 2007 avoir &#233;t&#233; impliqu&#233; dans les attaques du

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 26 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>379. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Mr. Dam Sith, 
editor-in-chief of the newspaper Moneaksekar Khmer in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>380. According to the information received, on 8 June 2008 at approximately 11:00 a.m., 
Mr. Dam Sith, a prominent member of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, who is running for the 
upcoming Parliamentary Elections scheduled for 27 July, was arrested by military police in 
Phnom Penh. Following interrogation at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, Mr. Dam Sith was 
placed in pre-trial detention at Prey Sar prison (Correctional Centre I) outside Phnom Penh, 
having been charged with Defamation and Disinformation under Articles 62 and 63 of the 
1992 Provisions Relating to the Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in 
Cambodia during the Transitional Period.  
</p>
<p>381. It would appear that any charges against Mr. Sith relating to his work with Moneaksekar 
Khmer newspaper should have been brought under the 1995 Law on Press Regulation (the 
&#8220;Press Law&#8221;), which contains a range of non-custodial provisions to regulate alleged defamatory 
and inflammatory content in newspapers. The Press Law specifically states that &#8220;All previous 
provisions related to the press shall be hereby abrogated&#8221; (Article 21), and also notes that &#8220;no 
person shall be arrested or subject to criminal charges as result of expression of opinion&#8221; 
(Article 20). Mr. Dam Sith&#8217;s arrest reportedly followed a complaint against him by your 
Excellency regarding the coverage in Moneaksekar Khmer newspaper of a speech made by SRP 
president Sam Rainsy. In the speech, at a Khmer Rouge victims&#8217; commemoration on 
17 April 2008, Mr. Rainsy reportedly made comments about several government ministers. 
Criminal complaints were subsequently filed by your Excellency against both Sam Rainsy and 
Dam Sith. 
</p>
<p>382. Mr. Dam Sith, in his capacity as a journalist and newspaper editor, was merely reporting 
the words of Sam Rainsy in relation to the event on 17 April. Furthermore, Article 62 of the 
UNTAC law criminalizes the publication, distribution or reproduction of false information that 
&#8220;has disturbed or is likely to disturb the public peace&#8221;. To date no disturbance has been 
witnessed as a result of the statements made by Sam Rainsy. Since the arrest of Mr. Dam Sith, a 
number of concerned parties have reportedly written to the court requesting his release on bail, 
including a group of Sam Rainsy Party law-makers; representatives of the Cambodian Club of 
Journalists; and the Minister of Information. These petitions were denied by investigating judge 
Chhay Kong on the basis that the parties concerned not authorized to file such requests on 
Dam Sith&#8217;s behalf. However, on 15 June Dam Sith was eventually released on bail, following a 
request sent to the Municipal Court on 14 June by Prime Minister Hun Sen. Although 
Mr. Dam Sith has been released on bail, the charges against him have not been dropped. While </p>

</p>
<p>to date no hearing has been scheduled, the current situation of fear and uncertainty has seriously 
impacted on the ability of Mr. Dam Sith to carry out his legitimate work as a journalist and to 
participate in political life as a parliamentary candidate. 
</p>
<p>383. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and charges brought against Mr. Dam Sith 
are linked to his legitimate work in promoting the right to freedom of expression in Cambodia. 
Further concern is expressed with respect to the reported executive interference in the judicial 
process. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>384. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>385. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations on the killing of 
Mr. Khim Sambor, a veteran reporter with Moneaksekar Khmer a Khmer-language daily 
newspaper affiliated to the Sam Rainsy Party, and also the killing of his son 
Mr. Khat Sarinpheata. According to information received: 
</p>
<p>386. &#8220;On 11 July 2008, shortly after 6.30 p.m., Mr. Khim Sambor left Phnom Penh&#8217;s Olympic 
Stadium on a motorcycle driven by his son Mr. Khat Sarinpheata. The two men were reportedly 
followed by two unknown individuals, who were also travelling by motorcycle. One of the 
assailants fired a number of shots killing Mr. Khim Sambor. His son was also hit and died later 
in hospital.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>387. According to reports, prior to the attack, Mr. Khim Sambor had written numerous articles 
critical of the ruling Cambodian People&#8217;s Party, as well as articles concerning cases of corruption 
allegedly implicating leading Government officials. In 2003, Moneaksekar Khmer, was closed 
down by the authorities for one month for publishing articles critical of the Government, and in 
2006 the newspaper was fined $4,500 for reportedly linking a Government minister to 
corruption. Furthermore, in June 2008, Mr. Dam Sith, Editor of the aforementioned newspaper, 
was detained for a week and charged in relation to the reporting of a controversial speech by 
Sam Rainsy and the subsequent legal action that was brought against him by a Government 
Minister.  
</p>
<p>388. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
stifle independent reporting in Cambodia, particularly in the run up to the country&#8217;s National 
Assembly elections scheduled to take place on 27 July 2008, thus impacting on freedom of 
expression in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>389. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at, the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communications. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>390. In a letter dated 30 January 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
of 30 November 2007. The Government reported that The Abbot Tim Sakhorn stayed at 
Baukhanaram Pagoda (North Phnom Den Pagoda) at Phsar Village, Phnom Den Commune, 
Kirivong District, Takeo Province, Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>391. Monk Tim Sakhorn is a Khmer Kampuchea Krom native and was born at Kla Krahim 
village, Ba Chuk Commune, Tri Ton District (or so called Srok Svay Torng), An Giang 
Province, Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Monk Tim Sakhorn had used the location of the 
Pagoda to distribute bulletins of the Khmer Kampuchea Krom union. Each bulletin contained the 
content of inspiration propaganda aimed to create conflicts between Cambodia and Vietnam. 
Monk Tim Sakhorn has a hard-line personality with no respects to the rules of the Buddhism and 
did not participate in religious activities as required. He carried out activities such as raising 
illegal flag in the pagoda which contains insignia same like the flag as printed in the bulletins of 
the Khmer Kampuchea Krom Federation. 
</p>
<p>392. Furthermore, he constructed building in the Pagoda and ordained monks of Khmer 
Kampuchea Krom origin without permission. He propagated monks and followers to support 
activities of the foreign-base Khmer Kampuchea Krom Federation movement. These activities 
made monks in the Pagoda unhappy and moved out to other Pagodas. The Pagoda currently 
remains only 70 monks who have proper identity cards. 
</p>
<p>393. After a consideration over monk Tim Sakhorn&#8217;s abnormal activities, the Supreme Patriarch 
Buddhism Monk of Cambodia, Ven. Tep Vong, organized a special meeting participated by 
10 high ranking Monks official to review monk Tim Sakhorn&#8217;s case. As result, the cases on his 
violation against disciplines, monk Tim Sakhorn&#8217;s status was removed. After a while, it was 
found that Mr. Tim Sakhorn was detained by Vietnamese authority. Mr. Tim Sakhorn is under 
the legal prosecution of the present laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

<p><b>China (People&#8217;s Republic of) 
Letter of allegations sent on 22 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p>421. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations in 
relation to the situation of Mr. Lu Gengsong, a prominent freelance-writer who has published 
several pro-democracy internet articles and books on political reform. Mr. Lu Gengsong was the 
subject of an urgent appeal, sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, on 30 August 2007.  
</p>
<p>422. According to information received, on 5 February 2008 Mr. Lu Gengsong was sentenced 
to four years in prison and one year of deprivation of his political rights after being convicted on 
charges of &#8216;incitement of subversion of state power&#8217; by the Hangzhou City Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court, following a closed trial on 22 January 2008 which lasted 15 minutes. A number of 
supporters and friends of Mr. Lu Gengsong were reportedly prohibited by the Hangzhou Public 
Security Bureau (PSB) from attending the sentencing by being placed under house arrest or from 
entering the court building.  
</p>
<p>423. Mr. Lu Gengsong has been detained since his arrest at his home on 24 August 2007. 
Reports at the time of his arrest stated that the police had informed Mr. Lu&#8217;s family that the main 
reason for his detention had been articles he had written which were critical of the Chinese 
Communist Party. Mr. Lu Gengsong is currently detained at the Xihu (West Lake) Detention 
Center in Hangzhou City pending appeal of his case. 
</p>
<p>424. Concern was expressed that the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Lu Gengsong may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his exercising of the right 
to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 22 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>426. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations in 
relation to the situation of Mr. Yang Chunlin, a farmers&#8217; representative and land-rights activist in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 79 
 
</p>
<p>Heilongjiang province. Mr. Yang Chunlin was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
on 5 September 2007, following his detention on 6 July and formal arrest on 13 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>427. According to new information received, on 19 February 2008 Mr. Yang Chunlin was tried 
by the Jiamusi City Intermediate People&#8217;s Court in Heilongjiang Province on charges of &#8216;inciting 
subversion of state power&#8217;. Mr. Yang Chunlin reportedly entered the court in handcuffs and 
leg-irons. In a meeting with his lawyers, Mr. Yang Chunlin stated that he had been allowed out 
of his prison cell only seven or eight times since his detention in July 2007. He was also not 
notified about the trial until the day before its commencement and as a result, had no time to 
write a defense letter. Mr. Yang Chunlin is currently detained at the Heitong Detention Center, 
Heilongjiang Province; the verdict on his case being expected at a later date.  
</p><p>428. It is believed that the charges against Mr. Yang Chunlin were brought as a result of an 
open letter he collected more than 10,000 signatures for, entitled &#8220;We Want Human Rights, not 
the Olympics&#8221;. During the trial, defense lawyers demanded that the state provide evidence 
linking the letter to &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221;. The prosecutors reportedly only 
stressed that the letter had drawn the attention of international media and left a negative impact 
internationally. 
</p>
<p>429. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Yang Chunlin may be directly 
related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his exercising of the right to 
freedom of expression. Further concern is expressed for his physical and psychological integrity 
while in detention.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 6 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>431. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Ms. Wang Guilan, a 
human rights activist and one of the organizers of an open letter calling for an improvement in 
the human rights situation in China. According to information received, on 28 February 2008 
following the publication of the above open letter with the signatures of over 12,000 petitioners, 
Ms. Wang Guilan was arrested in Beijing by police from the Public Security Bureau of her home 
province, Hubei. Her current whereabouts are unknown. A number of other petitioners involved 
in the public letter were also detained by police.  
</p>
<p>432. In view of the alleged detention of Ms. Wang Guilan at an undisclosed or unconfirmed 
location, concern was expressed that she may have been at risk of torture or other forms of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>ill-treatment. Further concern was expressed that Ms. Wang Guilan&#8217;s arrest and detention may 
have been directly related to her activities in defense of human rights, particularly her peaceful 
exercise of the right of freedom of expression.

<p>434. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Teng Biao 
and Mr. Li Heping. Both of the aforementioned are human rights lawyers. Mr. Teng Biao was 
the subject of an urgent appeal sent by Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, on 21 December 2006. 
Mr. Li Heping was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders on 5 October 2007.  
</p>
<p>435. According to information received, on the night of 6 March 2008 Mr. Teng Biao was 
reportedly abducted from outside his home. Neighbours reported seeing Mr. Teng Biao being put 
into an unmarked black car. No information on Mr. Teng Biao&#8217;s whereabouts is available. 
</p>
<p>436. Reports received also indicate that, on 7 March 2008, an unmarked car crashed into 
Mr. Li Heping while he was driving his son to school. It is reported that there were three people 
in the unmarked car, who may belong to a group reportedly following Mr. Li Heping since 
January 2008.  
</p>
<p>437. Serious concern was expressed that the abduction of Mr. Teng Biao and the incident 
involving Mr. Li Heping may have be directed to their activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular their legal representation of human rights and pro-democracy activists in China. Grave 
concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity.

<p>439. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning reports of violence during demonstrations in the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
surrounding areas in China, killings of an unconfirmed number of people and arrests of hundreds 
of demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>440. According to allegations received, on 10 March 2008 demonstrations led by monks were 
organised demanding greater freedom of religion and the release of monks detained since 
October 2007. It is reported that 300 monks from Drepung Monastery, near Lhasa, proceeded 
with a peaceful march towards the Potala Palace when they were stopped by the police. It is 
believed that around 60 monks suspected to be the leaders of the protest were arrested by the 
Public Security Bureau (PSB). 
</p>
<p>441. Sixteen people, including 15 visiting students monks in Sera Monastery, identified as 
Lobsang, aged 15, Lobsang Thukjey, aged 19, Tsultrim Palden, aged 20, Lobsher, aged 20, 
Phurdan, aged 22, Thubdron, aged 24, Lodroe, aged 30, and Lobsang Ngodrub, aged 29, from 
Onpo Monastery, Sichuan Province; Zoepa, aged 30, from Mangye Monastery; Trulku Tenpa 
Rigsang, aged 26, Gelek Pel, aged 32, and Samten, aged 17 from Lungkar Monastery, Qinghai 
Province; Pema Karwang, aged 30 and Thubwang, aged 30, from Darthang Monastery; and 
Tsegyam, aged 22, from Kashi Monastery led a march on Barkhor Street in Lhasa, distributing 
pamphlets and raising Tibetan flags. It is reported that they were arrested by the People&#8217;s Armed 
Police. Additional contingents of armed forces were then stationed in the area, and the police 
blocked roads and encircled Drepung and Sera monasteries around Lhasa to prevent further 
protests from taking place.  
</p>
<p>442. On the same day, about 350 people, including 137 monks from Lhutsang Monastery in the 
Tibetan area of Amdo in Mangra County, organised a protest in front of the Mangra County 
Assembly Hall where a government-sponsored show was taking place. The protest was stopped 
by the People&#8217;s Armed Police. A number of arrests took place during the disruption of the 
protest, but no information on the whereabouts of the arrested monks has been received.  
</p>
<p>443. Reports indicate that on 11 March, 500 to 600 monks from the Sera Monastery called for 
the release of the monks arrested the day before and began a march towards Lhasa, but were met 
on the way by approximately 2,000 armed police. The crowd was reportedly dispersed with 
tear-gas. A number of monks were detained and then released.  
</p>
<p>444. On 11 March, the police surrounded and sealed off Ditsa Monastery in Hualong County in 
Qinghai Province after the monks held a protest. 
</p>
<p>445. On 14 March, violent incidents were reported in Lhasa as tension escalated between 
hundreds of demonstrators and police forces. Gunfire was heard in the streets, and shops and cars 
were set on fire. Allegations that a significant number of Tibetans and Han and Hui Chinese have 
been killed during the demonstrations have been received. Monks from Ganden and Reting 
monasteries joined the demonstrations, and the two monasteries were later sealed off by police. 
A number of monks from Sera Monastery started a hunger strike to protest against the sealing off 
of monasteries and the detention of monks.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 82 
 
</p>
<p>446. Reports indicate that, in particular since 14 March, the wave of demonstrations by monks 
and lay people has spread in the whole Tibet Autonomous Region and in neighbouring 
provinces. These demonstrations have reportedly sometimes been violently repressed, in many 
cases leading to arrests of demonstrators. Allegations were received that since 14 March, the 
People&#8217;s Liberation Army has been patrolling the streets of Lhasa. 
</p>
<p>447. On 15 March, shooting was reported inside the compound of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in 
Shigatse, and at least 40 lay people demonstrating around the monastery were arrested. The next 
day, monks trying to escape the Kirti Monastery in Amdo in the Sichuan Province, which had 
been sealed off by the military, have allegedly been shot at; tear-gas was reportedly used on the 
demonstrators supporting the monks outside the monastery, and many demonstrators were 
severely beaten by the police. The police is then alleged to have shot into the crowd, killing and 
injuring a considerable but unconfirmed number of people. 
</p><p>448. On 17 March, students of Marthang Nationality Middle School in Hongyuan Xian County, 
Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, aged between 14 and 20, started a protest inside the school. 
PSB officials blocked the entrance and beat the students while they were trying to come out of 
the school. Approximately 40 students are said to have been arrested. Around 700 students then 
staged a demonstration outside the Hongyuan xian County PSB office to protest against the 
detention of fellow students. 
</p>
<p>449. Since 10 March, it is reported that raids in the homes of people formerly imprisoned for 
their political opinions have taken place. Since 15 March, house-to-house searches are allegedly 
being carried out in Lhasa, with CDs and printed material being confiscated, and people being 
taken in custody. It is reported that on 15 March, at least 600 people had been arrested in Lhasa, 
either as a result of a house search or during demonstrations. Three hundred additional people 
were reportedly arrested on 16 March. Reports indicate that on 13 March, the Lhasa Foreign 
Bureau Office has issued a warning to non-governmental organisations that any information 
given to foreigners regarding the protests could result in strict legal action against the concerned 
individuals and organisations, including the closing down of the latter. 
</p>
<p>450. On 17 March the authorities deported approximately 15 journalists from at least six 
Hong Kong television, radio and print organisations, accusing them of &#8220;illegal reporting&#8221; and of 
illegally shooting films of People&#8217;s Liberation Army soldiers. The journalists were escorted to 
the airport and put on a plane to Chengdu in Sichuan Province, and the police is alleged to have 
looked into the journalists&#8217; computers and video footages. The authorities allegedly refused to 
grant permits to allow foreign journalists to travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region as from 
12 March, and are reported to have ordered them out of the Tibetan parts of Gansu and 
Qinghai provinces on 16 March, the police reportedly saying that it was for their safety. Further 
reports indicate that within the country, video-sharing websites as well as news websites are 
inaccessible and that international news broadcasts are being cut when showing reports of the 
events in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding areas in China.  
</p>
<p>451. On 15 March, the Tibet Autonomous Region High People&#8217;s Court, Tibet Autonomous 
Region High People&#8217;s Procuratorate, and Tibet Autonomous Region Public Security Department 
issued a notice, asking that. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 83 
 
</p>
<p>452. &#8220;1. Those who on their own volition submit themselves to police or judicial offices prior to 
midnight on 17 March shall be punished lightly or dealt mitigated punishment; those who 
surrender themselves and report on other criminal elements will be performing meritorious acts 
and may escape punishment. Criminal elements who do not submit themselves in time shall be 
punished severely according to law. 2. Those who harbour or hide criminal elements shall be 
punished severely according to law upon completion of investigations. 3. Those citizens who 
actively report and expose the criminal behaviour of criminal elements shall receive personal 
protection, and granted commendations and awards.&#8221; It was noted that according to the 
information received, demonstrations continued to take place, both in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region and neighbouring provinces, despite the official notice. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>453. In a letter dated 21 May 2009, the Government responded to the communications 
of 20 March 2008 and 9 April 2008. The Government stated the events that occurred in 
March 2008 in Lhasa and other place, were incorrectly termed as &#8220;peaceful demonstrations&#8221; but 
were actually serious acts of criminal violence involving beating, the destruction of property, 
looting and arson. Faced with such violent acts, which seriously disrupted public order and did 
serious damage to human life, property and security, no responsible Government could simply sit 
back and not act. At present, the situation in the aforementioned areas has calmed down, and 
stability and public order have been restored. The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous 
Region and the other areas in question are dealing with the criminal suspects severely, in 
accordance with judicial procedures. Those whose offences are lesser and who displayed a 
positive attitude, acknowledging their guilt, have been released. Those whose situations are more 
serious shall have their criminal responsibility investigated in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>454. The aforementioned serious violent criminal events were carefully plotted in advance and 
instigated by the Dalai clique. In their handling of the entire incident, the competent authorities 
of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other areas showed great restraint; they enforced the law in 
a civilized manner, and they enjoyed broad popular support. At the international level, however, 
some people have distorted the facts, creating untrue stories and providing the United Nations 
special procedures with inaccurate information. Tibetan affairs are part of China&#8217; s internal 
affairs; nevertheless, in an effort to help the special procedures learn the truth about these events 
and to prevent the Dalai clique and anti-China elements from exploiting them, the competent 
authorities of the Chinese Government have thoroughly investigated the incidents described in 
the aforementioned letter. 
</p>
<p>455. In mid-March 2008, a series of serious violent criminal acts took place in the city of Lhasa, 
in China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region. Starting on 10 March, a group of lawbreakers acting 
without authorization, gathered illegally to create a disturbance; when police officers arrived to 
dissuade them, in accordance with the law, they clashed with them, cursing them and violently 
attacking the officers with clubs, rocks and knives. At approximately 11 a.m. on 14 March 2008, 
some monks at the Ramoche Temple threw stones at the police officers on duty. Subsequently, a 
group of rioters began to gather in Barkhor Street, shouting separatist slogans and wantonly 
beating, smashing and looting. The situation quickly spread. The lawbreakers smashed and 
burned shops, primary and secondary schools, hospitals, banks, electrical and communications 
installations and news agencies along the main streets of Lhasa and set fire to cars, chased and 
beat pedestrians, and attacked stores, telecommunications and Internet outlets and Government </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 84 
 
</p>
<p>offices. The rioters&#8217; savage behaviour during these incidents resulted in the slashing or burning 
to death of 18 innocent persons, including an infant less than 1 year old; 382 innocent persons 
were also injured, 58 of them seriously. The rioters set fire to over 300 sites, burning down 
7 schools, 5 hospitals, more than 1,300 and 120 homes, causing extensive loss of human life and 
property, and occasioning a direct economic loss of 280 billion yuan renminbi. Public order in 
the affected area was severely disrupted. 
</p>
<p>456. All ethnic minorities in Tibet expressed their great indignation at and severe criticism of 
the violent criminal acts that took place in Lhasa. The Tibet Autonomous Region quickly 
organized the police and other relevant agencies to put out the fire, provide aid to the injured and 
reinforce the security provided to schools, hospitals, banks and Government offices. The Chinese 
Government and the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region took these measures to 
protect law and order and social stability, and to safeguard the human rights of all ethnic groups 
in Tibet. In dealing with these violent criminal incidents and restoring law and public order in 
accordance with the law, the competent Chinese and Tibetan Government authorities exercised 
the utmost restraint. While enforcing the law they consistently acted in a lawful and civilized 
manner; they did not carry or use any lethal or injurious weapons. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army 
was not involved in the efforts to quell these violent criminal incidents.  
</p>
<p>457. At 11 a.m. on 16 March 2008, more than 300 monks in Aba, Sichuan Province, assaulted 
and beat police officers, handing out inflammatory flyers and shouting separatist slogans; they 
threw rocks and homemade Molotov cocktails at the police and went on a rampage of smashing 
and burning. At 3 p.m., a group of monks joined with other rioters to once again strike 
Government facilities, schools and police stations, engaging in smashing, looting and burning. 
That day rioters burned down 24 stores and 2 police stations and set fire to 81 police and civilian 
vehicles. Some 200 innocent bystanders, Government workers and police officers were injured.  
</p><p>458. Seeking to restore law and order, the local Government immediately took steps to bring the 
situation under control and protect life, property and fundamental human rights. During these 
incidents, law enforcement was carried out in a civilized manner by the local police, who 
consistently displayed a high degree of restraint; even though they had shields to protect 
themselves during the rioters&#8217; brutal attacks, scores of police officers were injured from blows 
and burns, one critically. The Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army did not take part in the response 
to these incidents.  
</p>
<p>459. In their efforts to deal with the violent criminal acts in the Tibet Autonomous Region in 
accordance with the law and to restore law and order, the local Government authorities exercised 
maximum restraint; law enforcement was consistently carried out in a lawful and civilized 
manner and no lethal or injurious weapons were carried or used. For this very reason, there were 
only 242 casualties among law enforcement personnel, including 23 seriously injured and one 
dead. 
</p>
<p>460. On 16 March 2008, in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Aba, Sichuan Province, 
rioters broke into the Aba Township police station and stabbed the police officers. When the 
rioters stole police firearms from a safe, the police fired warning shots, in accordance with the 
law, to no effect. They were thus compelled to open fire in self-defence, striking and injuring 
four rioters, who managed to escape with their co-conspirators in the confusion. Immediately 
afterwards, the officers involved in the incident, acting pursuant to regulations, submitted a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 85 
 
</p>
<p>report to their superiors, which the national police promptly published. The firing of weapons in 
self-defence by the Aba police was fully consistent with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted at the 8th United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. 
</p>
<p>461. During the violent criminal acts in Lhasa, when public order was severely disrupted and 
rioters were wilfully beating, burning and killing innocent persons, it was not safe for foreign 
reporters in Lhasa to cover the events. Reporters for the British publication The Economist and 
other foreign publications who were at the scene did provide coverage of the events. After the 
situation calmed down, the Chinese Government immediately organized a series of inspection 
tours to Tibet for representatives of 19 foreign media and delegations of foreign diplomats based 
in China. The Chinese media, including the Tibetan regional media, all reported on the events.  
</p>
<p>462. In the wake of the destructive events in Lhasa, the competent authorities of China and the 
Tibet Autonomous Region arrested a number of criminal suspects, who had participated in the 
events and had been involved in their organization and plotting. Among these were a number of 
monks and nuns. During the aforementioned incidents the rioters showed absolutely no respect 
for the rights and freedoms of innocent persons but wilfully disrupted public order and harmed 
the welfare of others. The Chinese and Tibetan Regional Governments consider that the lawful 
measures taken were fully consistent with the relevant provisions of international human rights 
instruments.  
</p>
<p>463. China is a country governed by the rule of law. Everyone is equal before the law and 
anyone who violates the law shall be liable to punishment in accordance with the law, with no 
distinction made for citizens on account of their religious beliefs. During the violent criminal 
acts that were perpetrated in Lhasa and other locations, a small number of monks and nuns took 
part in unauthorized demonstrations; in the course of these demonstrations they engaged in 
violent activities that lead the death of scores of persons and the inuring of hundreds more; they 
burned and destroyed public property, including numerous homes and schools, they advocated 
separatism, they harmed the State and they jeopardized public safety, seriously violating the Law 
of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions and Demonstrations and the 
Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The treatment shown by China&#8217;s law 
enforcement and judicial authorities will differ depending on the nature of the criminal offence: 
where the offence is serious, the offender&#8217;s criminal responsibility will be ascertained; where the 
offence is minor, the offender will be provided with education and released. This work is already 
under way.  
</p>
<p>464. In the wake of the violent criminal events that transpired in Lhasa, the law enforcement 
and judicial authorities of China and the Tibet Autonomous Region conducted investigation sand 
inquiries in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>465. On 29 April 2008, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court held and open trial of 
some persons accused of participating in the &#8220;events of 14 March&#8221;. The court found 30 accused 
persons, (Pasang et al.) guilty of the crimes of arson, looting, instigating fights and 
troublemaking, assembling a group to attack a State organ, disrupting public service and theft. 
The defendants Pasang, Sonam Tsering and Tsering were sentenced to life imprisonment. The 
defendants Jigme, Kalsang Bagdro, Karma Dawa, Dorje, Migmar, Ngawang Choeyang and 
Bagdro were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years and more. The defendants </p>

</p>
<p>Yargyal, Choephel Tashi, Dorje Dargye, Ngawang, Kalsang Tsering, Migmar, Sonam Tsering, 
Kelsang Samten, Tseten, Palsang Tashi, Lhagpa Tsering Chewa (Sr), Lobsang Tashi, 
Lhagpa Tsering, Darchen, Thubten Gyatso, Tashi Gyatso, Kalsang Dondrub, Tenzin Gyaltsen, 
Kalsang Nyima and Yeshe were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment ranging 
from 3 to 14 years.  
</p>
<p>466. The court informed the accused that if they refused to accept these judgements they could 
file an appeal with the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court or with the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Supreme People&#8217;s Court within 10 days of the date of service of the 
judgement.  
</p><p>467. China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that People&#8217;s Courts may or should appoint a 
defence counsel in cases where the defendant has not appointed counsel, the case is of great 
social significance, the defendant is totally without financial resources or the court considers that 
the prosecution arguments and evidence submitted may affect the proper determination of the 
severity of the sentence. Accordingly, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court 
appointed defence attorneys for the 30 defendants. The defence arguments presented by theses 
lawyers were given full value during the trial proceedings, and the mitigating circumstances that 
they cited in respect of the defendants, which were verified through investigation, were all 
accepted by the court. 
</p>
<p>468. China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that all citizens who are members of ethnic 
minorities have the right to use their own spoken and written language in an appeal. Of the 
14 open hearings held in the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, the proceedings were 
fully conducted in the Tibetan language in 9, while in the remaining 5 cases, the defendants were 
provided with Tibetan-Chinese interpretation. 
</p>
<p>469. It has been explained that the costs associated with the defence lawyers and interpreters 
provided for the defendants were entirely borne by the Tibet Autonomous Region Legal Aid 
Centre. On the day of the hearings, more than 300 Lhasa residents, students and monks 
representing all ethnic minorities and all groups within society attended the trials.  
</p>
<p>470. The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other localities intend to 
continue their efforts to deal in accordance with the law with the criminal suspects who 
participated in these violent criminal acts. China will continue to transmit to the relevant bodies 
information regarding the outcome of these negotiations.

<p>472. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Yang Chunlin, a 
farmers&#8217; representative and land-rights activist in Heilongjiang Province. Mr. Yang Chunlin was 
the subject of a letter of allegations sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General </p>

</p>
<p>on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 22 February 2008, and an urgent 
appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, on 5 September 2007, following his detention on 6 July and formal arrest 
on 13 August 2007.  
</p>
<p>473. According to new information received at the time, on 24 March 2008 Mr. Yang Chunlin 
was sentenced to five years&#8217; imprisonment and two years&#8217; deprivation of political rights for 
&#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221;, following a trial which lasted approximately 20 minutes. 
The court police hit Mr. Yang Chunlin several times with electric batons when he attempted to 
speak with his family attending the sentencing hearing in Jiamusi City Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court, Heilongjiang Province.  
</p><p>474. While in detention, Mr. Yang Chunlin was subjected to torture and coerced to confess. The 
authorities denied Mr. Yang Chunlin access to his family and restricted access to his legal 
counsel. Mr. Yang&#8217;s conviction was related to his collecting more than 10,000 signatures 
endorsing the open letter, &#8220;We Want Human Rights, not the Olympics&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>475. Concern was expressed for Mr. Yang Chunlin&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity in 
detention. Further concern was expressed that his conviction may be directly related to his 
non-violent activities in defense of human rights, particularly his exercising of the right to 
freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government

Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, issued an urgent 
appeal to the Government concerning reports of killings, injuries and arrests of protestors in 
Gan Zi Xian, Sichuan Province, and the arrests of over 570 Tibetan monks, including children, in 
Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige Xian the Tibetan Autonomous Region. A communication with

</p>
<p>478. According to new information received at the time, on 3 April 2008 at least eight protestors 
were killed and several injured when security forces opened fire during a peaceful protest in 
Zithang Township in Gan Zi Xian, Sichuan Province, calling for the release of two monks 
previously arrested. Several protestors were also arrested. 
</p>
<p>479. On 28 and 29 March 2008, over 570 Tibetan monks, including some children, were 
arrested following raids by security forces of the Chinese People&#8217;s Armed Police and the Public 
Security Bureau on monasteries in Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige Xian in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region. Arrests were made of those suspected of participating in protests and those 
suspected of communicating with the exiled Tibetan communities. 
</p>
<p>480. Serious concerns were expressed over the aforementioned arrests and detention of, and the 
excessive use of force against, the above-mentioned persons, including reportedly peaceful 
protestors. Further concerns were expressed that independent observers and foreign journalists 
have been restricted from accessing regions in which protests have taken place and that 
limitations have been imposed on the media, including Internet websites, to prohibit the 
dissemination of information throughout China concerning the events in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Region and abroad. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>481. Reference is made to the response of the Government to the communication 
of 20 March 2008, reflected above. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 14 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>482. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sent an urgent appeal 
to the Government concerning Mr. Hu Jia. Mr. Hu Jia is a pro-democracy campaigner and 
HIV-AIDS activist. He is co-founder and former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute of 
Health Education and an outspoken advocate for those affected by HIV/AIDS. Mr. Hu Jia was 
the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 4 January 2008, 
following his detention on 27 December 2007. Mr. Hu Jia was also subject of communications 
sent by mandate holders on 30 November 2007, 31 May 2007 and 2 June 2004.  
</p>
<p>483. According to information received, on 3 April 2008 Mr. Hu Jia was sentenced to three 
years and six months&#8217; imprisonment and one year of political rights deprivation for &#8220;inciting 
subversion of state power&#8221; by the Beijing Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. 
</p><p>484. Mr. Hu Jia was convicted on the basis of political articles he wrote for the internet, 
interviews he had given to the media, and his signing of the letter &#8220;The Real China Before the 
Olympics&#8221;, which demands an end the pre-Olympics human rights abuses. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 89 
 
</p>
<p>485. Mr. Hu Jia was officially charged on 30 January 2008 by the Beijing Municipal Peoples 
Procurate, and he stood trial on 18 March 2008. Reports indicate that his lawyers were given 
only 20 minutes to deliver a defense during the four-hour session and were prevented from 
responding or interjecting throughout the proceedings. International observers and diplomats 
were barred from the courtroom during the trial, as were Mr. Hu Jia&#8217;s father and wife. Some of 
Mr. Hu Jia&#8217;s friends and colleagues were detained and moved to locations outside Beijing, 
allegedly to prevent them from speaking to the media outside the courtroom. 
</p>
<p>486. Reports indicate that the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) has refused to supply 
Mr. Hu Jia with necessary medication in detention and to deliver him the medication brought by 
his relatives to the detention centre. Mr. Hu Jia suffers from a liver disease and must take daily 
medication. 
</p>
<p>487. Concern was expressed that the alleged verdict of Mr. Hu Jia may have been directly 
related to his human rights activities, particularly his exercising of the right to freedom of 
expression. Further concern was expressed for Mr. Hu Jia&#8217;s medical condition and psychological 
integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>488. In a letter dated 4 June 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. At the

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>489. On 23 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal Mr. Hu Jia, a Beijing-based 
HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute for Health 
Education. Mr. Hu Jia has been the subject of communications sent by several mandate holders 
following his detention on 27 December 2007 and his sentencing on 3 April 2008 to three years 
and six months&#8217; imprisonment and one year of deprivation of political rights for &#8220;inciting 
subversion of state power&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>490. According to new information received, Mr. Hu Jia has been prevented from submitting an 
appeal. According to the law, Mr. Hu Jia had ten days to appeal the sentence from the day it was 
issued by the Beijing Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. However, Mr. Hu Jia was 
denied legal representation in this period, preventing him from discussing the details of a 
possible appeal.  
</p>
<p>491. Reports further indicate that Mr. Hu Jia has not been able to see his relatives 
since 3 April 2008, and that his health condition has been deteriorating.  
</p>
<p>492. Concern was expressed that the denial of access to legal representation and the consequent 
absence of any opportunity for Mr. Hu Jia to appeal the sentence might be related to his peaceful 
and legitimate activities in the defence of human rights and in disseminating information about 
HIV/AIDS. Further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Hu Jia while imprisoned.  </p>

<p>494. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. Zheng Mingfang, a human rights defender and 
petitioner in Ji County, Tianjin. According to information received, on 29 February 2008 the 
Tianjin police arrested Ms. Zheng Mingfang at her home. She had been held incommunicado 
since the arrest. Her family had not received any formal detention order and their requests to 
contact and meet with her had been repeatedly denied by the police. In addition, she had not been 
allowed to meet with a lawyer. According to unofficial sources, Ms. Zheng Mingfang had been 
sentenced to two years of re-education through labor (RTL) and was being held at the 
Xian district centre in Tianjin, east of Beijing.  
</p><p>495. Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s health had deteriorated and she had begun to lose her sight. 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s husband&#8217;s mobile phone and computer equipment were confiscated after 
her arrest. On 4 April 2008, the Tianjin police warned Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s family not to 
communicate with foreigners. The husband was told that, if he did not comply, 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang would not be released. Her sister was ordered to turn off her mobile phone 
and keep away from journalists.  
496. Shortly before her detention, Ms. Zheng Mingfang had campaigned and protested against 
the arrests of Ye Guozhu and Hu Jia. In particular, she had been collecting signatures to demand 
that authorities release Mr. Hu Jia. 
</p>
<p>497. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Zheng Mingfang might be 
solely connected to her peaceful activities in defending human rights and the exercise of her right 
to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the reported incommunicado detention of 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang at an unknown place of detention, further concerns were expressed that she 
might be at risk of ill-treatment. Further concern was expressed at the restrictions on the exercise 
of the right to freedom of expression imposed on the family of Ms. Zheng Mingfang. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>498. On 13 June 2008 the Government issued a response acknowledging receipt of the joint 
appeal from the Special Rapporteurs. The Chinese Government noted that it had made diligent 
inquiries into the matters raised therein, and responded as follows: 
</p>
<p>499. A. Zheng Mingfang, female, born on 5 July 1963, junior middle-school education, from 
Ji County in Tianjin City. On 1 March 2008, Zheng concocted a terrorist message, claiming that 
a man driving a vehicle supposedly filled with explosive was going to blow up a State 
gymnasium. Since the story she made up and spread caused a disturbance and seriously disrupted </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 91 
 
</p>
<p>public order, the Tianjin public security authorities, acting in accordance with the relevant 
Chinese regulations on re-education through labour, applied re-education through labour to 
Zheng on 1 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>500. B. Re-education through labour in China is conducted on basis of the decision on the 
matter approved in 1957 by the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress and other 
such laws and regulations. It is not a criminal punishment but an administrative one. The 
people&#8217;s government in every province, autonomous region, city reporting directly to the 
Government, and every large and medium-sized city in China has established a re-education 
through labour management committee, and re-education through labour activities are supervised 
by the people&#8217;s procuratorates. Under the regulations, re-education through labour is applicable 
only to people aged 16 years and older who have disrupted the social order in large or 
medium-sized cities and refused to mend their ways, or who have committed petty offences not 
meriting a criminal penalty, and who meet the conditions laid down in the regulations. There is a 
strict legal procedure for ordering re-education through labour, and a statutory supervision 
system. Persons wishing to challenge a re-education order can appeal to the re-education through 
labour management committee or, under the terms of the Administrative Proceedings Act, to the 
people&#8217;s courts. Apart from being required to comply with disciplinary measures under the 
re-education through labour regulations which restrict some of their rights, individuals subject to 
re-education retain the wide range of civil rights afforded to them by the Constitution and laws, 
including permission to see family members while undergoing re-education and freedom of 
correspondence, rest on holidays and so forth.

<p>510. Shortly before their detention, Ms. Li Xige and Ms. Miaojue Cizhi had publicly called for a 
hunger strike to protest against the recent imprisonment of Mr. Hu Jia, a fellow HIV/AIDS 
activist and human rights defender. In January 2008, Mr. Miaojue Cizhi had issued an open letter 
calling on the country&#8217;s leaders to release Mr. Hu Jia.  
</p>
<p>511. Since August 2006, Ms. Li Xige has been under house arrest with periodic cessation, by 
the police from Ningling County. Ms. Li Xige&#8217;s husband has recently also been put under house 
arrest by the police in order to stop him from contacting anyone about his wife&#8217;s situation. 
</p>
<p>512. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Li Xige and 
Ms. Miaojue Cizhi might have been solely connected to their peaceful activities in defending

under administrative detention. 
</p>
<p>516. On 10 May 2008 a police spokesperson stated at a press conference in Chengdu that the 
four internet writers were detained for posting articles that &#8220;created, spread and stirred up rumor&#8221; 
and for using the internet to spread harmful information. It was further maintained that they had 
incited the manifestation that took place in Chengdu on the 4 May 2008, where about 200 people

</p><p>525. According to information received, on 13 May 2008 Mr. Qi Chonghuai and Mr. He Yanjie 
were sentenced to four years imprisonment for &#8220;extortion and black mail&#8221; by the Tengzhou City 
Court, Shandong Province.  
</p>
<p>526. Two court policemen reportedly hit Mr. Qi Chonghuai&#8217;s head against the floor several 
times during the trial. He was also dragged out of the courtroom when he tried to comfort his 
wife during a break in the trial. Mr. Qi Chonghuai and Mr. He Yanjie were arrested on 
25 June 2007 by Tengzhou police officers, following a publication of an article alleging official 
corruption in the Tengzhou Communist Party. They were formally charged with &#8220;extortion and 
blackmail&#8221; on 2 August 2007. Both men are currently held at the Detention Center of Tengzhou 
City. Mr. Qi Chonghuai was allegedly held incommunicado during the first two months of his 
detention and has been repeatedly assaulted and threatened by security guards throughout his 
eleven-month pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p>527. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Qi Chonghuai and Mr. He Yanjie may 
be directly related to their reportedly peaceful human rights activities, particularly their advocacy 
of an end to corruption and social injustice. Further concern is expressed for their physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>529. On 23 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women its causes and consequences, issued a letter of allegations to the 
Government in relation to Ms. Yuan Weijing, wife of Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a well-known 
human rights lawyer who has denounced alleged violations linked to China&#8217;s one-child policy, 
including forced sterilizations and abortions.  
</p>
<p>530. According to information received, on 24 August 2006 after allegedly taking legal action 
against Linyi city authorities for their practice of forced abortions, Mr. Chen Guangcheng was 
sentenced to four years and three months imprisonment for &#8220;organising a mob to disrupt traffic&#8221;. 
Ms. Yuan Wejing has been working together with her husband in gathering evidence in this case 
against the Linyi city authorities and has been publicly opposing his imprisonment. 
Mr. Chen Guangcheng was already the subject of six previous communications to the 
Government sent by the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders and other mandate-holders on 27 June 2006, on 14 July 2006, on 
7 April 2006, on 31 October 2005 and on 19 September 2005. Ms. Yuan Weijing and 
Mr. Chen Guangcheng were the subjects of a communication on 21 December 2006 sent by the 
former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences. Receipt was acknowledged of replies from the Government 
dated 12 December 2005, 14 June 2006 and 3 October 2006 and 14 February 2007.  
</p>
<p>531. According to the new information received, on 14 May 2008 the Beijing Municipal 
Chaoyang District People&#8217;s Court upheld an administrative ban against Ms. Yuan Weijing issued 
in August 2007 by the Beijing General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. The ruling 
followed a lawsuit filed by Ms. Yuan Weijing to challenge the administrative decision. The court 
closed the hearing on grounds that the case involved State secrets. Ms. Yuan Weijing was 
reportedly unable to attend the hearing because she was confined to her home in the city of Linyi 
by local authorities. 
</p>
<p>532. The administrative decision barred Ms. Yuan Weijing from travelling to the Philippines to 
receive the 2007 Ramon Magsayay Award for Emergent Leadership on behalf of her husband in 
August 2007. On 24 August 2007, she was intercepted by police at Beijing International Airport, 
reportedly beaten, her passport was revoked, and forced to return to her home. 
</p>
<p>533. Ms. Yuan Weijing has reportedly been subject to repeated acts of harassment by the 
authorities following the arrest of her husband and she is kept under residential surveillance by 
the police. Several times she has been brought in by police for questioning. According to the 
information received, she has not been allowed to visit her husband for eight months.  
</p>
<p>534. Concern was expressed that the reported harassments against Ms. Yuan Weijing and the 
decision of Beijing Municipal Chaoyang District People&#8217;s Court to uphold the travel ban may 
aim to sanction Ms. Yuan Weijing and Mr. Chen Guangcheng because of their non-violent 
activities in defence of human rights.  </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 6 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>536. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of Ms. Ren Shangyan, Assistant 
Director of the China Justice Advocacy Web (Zhonghua Shenzheng Wang), a website which 
frequently has reported on cases related to alleged corruption and social justice.  
</p><p>537. According to the information received, on 16 May 2008 Ms. Ren Shangyan was arrested 
by several Shuangyashan Public Security Bureau (SPSB) officers in Shuangyashan City, 
Heilongjiang Province. Her current whereabouts are unknown, and her family has not been 
informed by the police of her detention. The current conditions of her detention and whether she 
has formally been charged remain unclear. Shortly before her arrest, Ms. Ren Shangyan had been 
investigating accusations against the Vice-Chief of the Anti-Corruption Bureau under the 
Procuratorate of Lingdong District, Shuangyashan City. In March 2008, shortly after the China 
Justice Advocacy Web initiated to investigate the case, the website was temporarily closed by 
the internet police. In 2007, the website was repeatedly blocked following various reports on 
corruption cases in Shanghai.  
</p>
<p>538. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Ren Shangyan may have been 
directly related to her reportedly peaceful human rights activities, particularly her advocacy of an 
end to corruption and social injustice. Further concern was expressed for her physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention. Finally, concern was expressed that the above 
mentioned allegations may form part of a pattern of harassment against human rights defenders 
in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>539. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at, the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communications. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 16 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>540. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
issued an allegation letter to the Government in relation to Ms. Liu Jie, a human rights defender 
and democracy activist. Ms. Liu Jia was the subject of urgent appeals sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 
25 October 2007, and by these mandate-holders, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, on 28 December 2007. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 97 
 
</p>
<p>541. Prior to her arrest on 11 October 2007, Ms. Liu Jie had been coordinating the presentation 
of a public letter, signed by over 12,000 petitioners, calling on Chinese Communist Party leaders 
to enact political and legal reforms. She was subsequently ordered to be detained at a 
Re-education through Labour (RTL) camp for 18 months on charges of &#8220;disturbing social order&#8221;. 
There are also concerns for Ms. Liu Jie&#8217;s health, particularly her vision, addressed in the 
aforementioned communications and in the Government&#8217;s response of 6 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>542. According to new information received at the time, on 22 May 2008 Ms. Liu Jie was 
transferred from Qiqihar RTL camp to Harbin Drug Rehabilitation Center. At the Center, 
Ms. Liu Jie was forced to sit on a &#8220;Tiger Bench&#8221;, for five consecutive days. This involves the 
person being forced to sit upright on a long bench, with her hands tied behind the back. The 
thighs are fastened with a rope to the bench while the feet are raised off the floor by bricks 
placed under the feet, placing extreme strain on the knees and causing pain. This practice aims at 
instilling discipline among those detained. 
</p>
<p>543. Concern was expressed that the ongoing detention of Ms. Liu Jie may be directly related to 
her activities in defense of human rights, particularly her exercise of the right to freedom of 
expression. In view of the above allegations of ill-treatment, serious concern was reiterated for 
Ms. Liu Jie&#8217;s physical and mental integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>544. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at, the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communications. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 30 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>545. On 30 June 2008, Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Mr. Yao Lifa, an activist promoting local democratic elections in 
Hubei Province.  
</p>
<p>546. According to information received, on 26 June 2008 Mr. Yao Lifa participated in a 
demonstration against alleged police brutality which was held outside the government building 
in Qingjiang City. Mr. Yao Lifa disappeared during the demonstration, at which local and 
National Security police were present. At 7 p.m. on the same evening, Yao called his family and 
told them that he had been abducted and brought to Gaoshibei Township, 50 kilometers from 
Qingjiang City. At 11 p.m., Yao&#8217;s family received another call from him, informing them that he 
was at Zhongxiang Township, about 100 km from Qingjiang City. It is feared that he has been 
detained by Hubei police and his currents whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>547. Mr. Yao Lifa was an elected member of the People&#8217;s Congress of Qingjiang City 
from 1999 to 2004. He subsequently published a book outlining the challenges to independent 
politicians, which was banned. He has reportedly been subject to intimidation and harassment by 
police after running as an independent candidate in 2006. In September 2007, Yao Lifa was 
vocal in demanding the removal of the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 
Hubei Province. Reports indicate that following this, in October 2007, he was secretly detained 
for a month at Qianjiang City Xiongkou Farmers Liaison Office. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 98 
 
</p>
<p>548. Concern was expressed that the disappearance of Mr. Yao Lifa may have been directly 
related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular through his exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In view of reports of his detention in 
October 2007, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>549. In a letter dated 03 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 30 June 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;The Government has made careful and 
detailed inquiries in connection with the matter raised in the communication and wishes to make 
the following reply. Yao Lifa, male, born on 20 November 1958, is a teacher at the Experimental 
Primary School in Qianjiang, Hubei Province. In 1999, he was elected as a Deputy to the 
Qianjiang Municipal People&#8217;s Congress. In November 2006, the city of Qianjiang held elections 
for deputies to the sixth municipal and township people&#8217;s congresses. During the election period, 
Yao illegally distributed publicity materials containing false information in the downtown area. 
When the Qianjiang police were informed of this, they issued Yao, in accordance with the law, a 
summons together with a warning to observe the relevant laws and regulations and not to use any 
deceitful methods during the elections. The public security authorities were doing their duty in 
accordance with the law, and the allegation in the communication that Yao was &#8220;subject to 
intimidation and harassment by the police&#8221; does not tally with what really happened. In 
September 2007, the municipal education authorities in Qianjiang, seeking to address a problem 
posed by some teachers in the city who had long failed to observe professional discipline or meet 
their responsibilities as professional educators, organized a study group which included lectures 
on such topics as the Teachers Law and instruction in how teachers could fulfil their professional 
responsibilities and be good teachers. Yao was one of the teachers who had long neglected his 
professional responsibilities, regularly arriving late and leaving early, and absenting himself 
from work without requesting leave. He was thus one of the participants in the study group. The 
allegation in the communication that Yao was secretly detained in the Xinogkou Farmers Liaison 
Office in Qianjiang in September and October 2007 is not consistent with the facts. On 
26 June 2006, Yao and some other teachers from the Qianjiang Experimental Primary School 
were sent to an appropriate institution to study. The allegation in the communication that Yao 
was detained by the police after participating in a demonstration on that day and that his 
whereabouts are unknown is inconsistent with the facts. At present, no government departments 
or judicial authorities are restricting Yao&#8217;s freedom of movement, and no coercive measures 
have been taken in respect of him; the relevant government and judicial authorities have not 
received any complaint from Yao himself or from his representative.  
</p>

<p>550. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 15 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>551. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government 
regarding human rights lawyers Messrs Li Baiguang, Jiang Tianyong, Teng Biao, Li Heping, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 99 
 
</p>
<p>Li Xiongbing, Li Fangping and Zhang Xhigshui. Messrs Li Baiguang, Teng Biaou and 
Li Heping were presented with the Democracy Award by the United States of America 
foundation for Democracy in June 2008.  
</p>
<p>552. Communications have previously been sent to your government regarding some of these 
defenders. The most recent one concerning Mr. Teng Biao and Mr. Jiang Tianyong was sent 
on 25 June 2008. Mandate-holders reported information on the situation of Mr. Li Baiguang with 
a letter sent on 1 December 2006 to which your Excellency&#8217;s Government responded on 
26 February 2007. The most recent communication concerning Mr. Li Heping was sent on 
13 March 2008. We acknowledge receipt of the response of the Government on 24 April 2008. 
Regarding Mr. Li Fangping, the most recent communication was sent on 22 January 2008, to 
which no response has been received to date. 
</p>
<p>553. According to information received, on 29 June 2008 Beijing-based human rights lawyers 
Li Baiguang, Jiang Tianyong and Teng Biao were prohibited by security forces from attending a 
dinner with members of the United States of America Congress. Mr. Li Baiguang was kept under 
surveillance by four policemen at a holiday resort in the suburbs of Beijing and was not allowed 
to return to the city for three days. Mr. Teng Biao was taken to the suburbs before being placed 
under house arrest. Mr. Jiang Tianyong was stopped from leaving his apartment block by 
two policemen from Beijing PSB Haidian sub-division until after the dinner had finished. 
Human rights lawyers Li Heping, Li Xiongbing, Li Fangping and Zhang Xingshui also failed to 
attend the dinner after pressure was put on them to stop them from going. The measures taken 
against all of the human rights lawyers were lifted after the departure of the members of the 
United States of America Congress.  
</p>
<p>554. After traveling to the United States of America to collect the Democracy Award from the 
United States of America National Endowment for Democracy (NED) on 17 June 2008, 
Messrs. Li Baiguang and Li Heping were questioned and intimidated by police. Mr. Teng Biao 
was not allowed to travel to accept the award given that his passport had been confiscated.  
</p>
<p>555. Concern was expressed that the prohibition of Messrs Li Baiguang, Jiang Tianyong, 
Teng Biaou, Li Heping, Li Xiongbing, Li Fangping and Zhang Xhigshui from attending a dinner 
with members of the United States of America Congress may be directly related to their 
activities in defense of human rights, in particular through their legal action against alleged 
human rights violations in China. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of the human rights lawyers in question. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>556. In a letter dated 03 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 15 July 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;In June 2008, United States 
Congressmen Wolf and Smith came to China at the invitation of the United States Embassy to 
hold consultations with the Embassy on internal matters. After their arrival in China, however, 
they engaged in activities that were inconsistent with the purpose of their visit, and after 
returning to their country they fabricated lies and slandered the Chinese Government. It appears </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 100 
 
</p>
<p>that during their visit to China the two United States Congressmen did not meet with Li Heping, 
Li Baiguang, Teng Biao, Jian Tianyong and other individuals. However, the Chinese 
Government and the police did not take any restraining measures, including house arrest, and the 
above-mentioned individuals went about their work and their lives with freedom of movement. 
The allegation in the communication that the police and public security officers placed these 
individuals under house arrest in order to prevent them from meeting with the United States 
Congressmen does not tally with what really occurred, and is sheer fabrication.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>557. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>558. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent appeal 
to the Government regarding Mr. Ye Guozhu. It was noted that Mr. Ye had already been the 
subject of a joint communication sent by the then Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 5 April 2005. 
</p>
<p>559. According to new information received at the time, on 22 July 2008 Mr. Ye Guozhu was 
taken away from Chaobai Prison in Tianjin by officers of the Beijing Public Security Bureau 
(PSB), Xuanwu Sub-division, where he has been serving a prison sentence that was due to come 
to an end on 26 July 2008.  
</p>
<p>560. His brother received a call from the prison authorities at around 4 p.m. on 22 July, 
explaining that it would not be necessary for him to come and pick up his brother on 26 July. 
Mr. Ye&#8217;s brother immediately called the police in Xuanwu, who initially denied any knowledge 
of Mr. Ye Guozhu&#8217;s whereabouts, however, later admitted that Mr. Ye had been transferred from 
Chaobai Prison. The authorities refused to disclose Mr. Ye&#8217;s place and envisaged duration of 
detention. 
</p>
<p>561. Mr. Ye Guozhu was active in assisting petitioners to file complaints with the central 
government against forced evictions. After he had applied for permission, in August 2004, to 
organise the so called &#8220;September 18 10,000 People March&#8221; he was sentenced by the Beijing 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court to four years in prison for &#8220;disturbing the social order&#8221;. He was 
reportedly ill-treated while in detention.  
</p>
<p>562. In view of his reported incommunicado detention at an undisclosed place of detention 
grave concerns were expressed as regards Mr. Ye Guozhu&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity. 
Further concern was expressed that Mr. Ye&#8217;s continued detention beyond the reported release 
date might be solely connected to his previous activities in defence of human rights and the 
upcoming Olympic Games. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>563. In a letter dated 17 November 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 15 July 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;Ye Guozhu is an ethnic Manchu male 
born in 1955 and residing in Beijing. On 18 December 2004, the Dongcheng District 
People&#8217;s Court in Beijing sentenced him to four years&#8217; imprisonment (from 27 August 2004 
to 26 July 2008) for the crime of picking quarrels and stirring up trouble. While he was serving 
his sentence, the public security authorities discovered additional criminal facts with which 
Ye Guozhu was associated that still required investigation and action. On 22 July 2008, the 
public security authorities released him for retrial. On 26 July, the Xuanwu Sub-Station of the 
Beijing Public Security Bureau placed him in criminal detention. On 23 August, with the 
authorization of the Xuanwu District People&#8217;s Procuratorate, Ye was arrested on suspicion of 
assembling a crowd to disturb order in a public place. Upon examination, Ye confessed 
truthfully in respect of the aforementioned criminal facts, acknowledging his guilt and 
submitting himself to the law. Accordingly, on 15 October the Xuanwu Sub-Station, acting in 
accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, decided to 
release him on bail.&#8221;

<p>565. On 29 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Mr. Xie Changfa, a human rights defender from Changsa, Hunan Province, and Mr. L&#252; Honglai, 
a human rights defender from Tianjin. 
</p><p>566. According to the information received, Mr. Xie Changfa was arrested and detained 
on 25 June 2008 by the Yuhua branch office of the Changsa Public Security Bureau (PSB). The 
ground for his detention was &#8220;suspicion of subverting state power&#8221;. According to unconfirmed 
reports, Mr. Xie Changfa might be currently detained at the detention centre in Changsa City.  
</p>
<p>567. Mr. L&#252; Honglai was arrested and detained on 9 July 2008. The wife of Mr. L&#252; Honglai was 
informed by the Tianjin Municipal State Security Bureau that her husband was under 
investigation. The current place of detention of Mr. L&#252; Honglai is unknown. When his wife 
inquired about his whereabouts, authorities refused to provide information. 
</p>
<p>568. Mr. Xie Changfa was formerly a cadre at the Changsha steel factory and the Changsha city 
government, and also served as a township head in Liuyang County. He was arrested several 
times before and served two years&#8217; &#8220;re-education through labour&#8221; for his 1989 activities in 
support of democracy. 
</p>
<p>569. Mr. L&#252; Honglai served a four-year prison term beginning in 1981 for his editorship of a 
magazine during the so-called &#8220;Democracy Wall period&#8221; between 1979 and 1981. </p>

<p>572. On 30 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. Ni Yulan, a housing 
rights activist and lawyer. Ms. Ni Yulan has been active for several years in assisting victims of 
forced evictions in Beijing. Ms. Ni Yulan was previously sentenced to one year of imprisonment 
for &#8220;obstructing official business&#8221; after she had sought redress for being beaten by Beijing police 
on 27 September 2002 while she was trying to film the forced demolition of a Beijing home. 
Those beating left her disabled and in need of crutches for walking. 
</p>
<p>573. According to the information received, on 15 April 2008 demolition workers and 
policemen knocked down a wall of Ms. Ni Yulan&#8217;s home, following which Ms. Ni Yulan 
allegedly hit one member of the demolition crew. She was then detained for a short while 
on 15 April 2008 and rearrested by the Xicheng District sub-division of the Beijing Security 
Bureau on 29 April 2008 on charges of &#8220;obstructing official business&#8221;. While in custody at the 
Xinjekou Police Station, she was reportedly beaten and mistreated, which resulted in her losing 
consciousness for two days. Also, her crutches had been taken away from her, and she was 
forced by the police to crawl when she needed to use the bathroom.  
</p>
<p>574. In view of the reported ill-treatment grave concerns were expressed as regards 
Ms. Ni Yulan&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity. Further concern was expressed that

Ms. Wu Dianyuan, aged 77, Ms. Wang Xiuying, aged 79, and Mr. Ji Sizun, aged 58, a legal 
activist from Fujian Province. </p>

</p>
<p>577. According to information received, in the morning of 11 August 2008 Mr. Ji Sizun was 
arrested at the Deshengmenwai police station in Beijing&#8217;s Xicheng District. He had called at the 
police station to check the status of an application he had made for a permit to hold a protest in 
one of the city&#8217;s three designated &#8220;protest zones&#8221; during the 2008 Olympic Games. At 
approximately 12.15 p.m. Mr. Ji Sizun was escorted from the police station by several plain 
clothed policemen, into a dark coloured unmarked vehicle. Reports claim that Mr. Ji Sizun 
managed to make a short call to his family to notify them that he had &#8220;problems&#8221;. His 
whereabouts are currently unknown and his family has been unable to reach him on his mobile 
phone. Mr. Ji Sizun had purportedly noted in his application that the proposed protest would call 
for greater participation of Chinese citizens in political processes, and would denounce alleged 
official corruption.  
</p>
<p>578. On 5 August 2008, Ms. Wu Dianyuan and Ms. Wang Xiuying were detained at the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB), Security Administration Unit, where they were 
interrogated for a period of ten hours. 
</p>
<p>579. Prior to their detention Ms. Wu Dianyuan and Ms. Wang Xiuying had visited the 
PSB Security Administration Unit, on five occasions between 5 August and 18 August, to apply 
for permits to demonstrate in one of the aforementioned &#8220;protest zones&#8221;. The two women, who 
used to be neighbours, applied to demonstrate against the alleged forced eviction from their 
homes in 2001. Their applications were neither granted nor denied on each of their five visits to 
the Security Administration Unit.  
</p>
<p>580. On 17 August 2008, Ms. Wu Dianyuan and Ms. Wang Xiuying received a 
&#8220;Re-education-Through-Labor&#8221; (RTL) decision, dated 30 July 2008, from the RTL Commission 
of the Beijing Municipal Government. The decision requires Ms. Wu Dianyuan and 
Ms. Wang Xiuying to serve one year of RTL for &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221;. The decision states 
that the term will be served outside the RTL camp however; it places restrictions on movement 
and stipulates that if provisions of the decision or other regulations are violated, they will be sent 
to the RTL camp. 
</p>
<p>581. Furthermore, in late July 2008, Ms. Zhang Wei was arrested at Beijing&#8217;s Haidian district 
police station after police officers reportedly refused to accept an application she had made to 
protest over the demolition of her home for Olympics-related development. On 12 August 2008, 
Ms. Zhang Wei was sentenced by the District Court to a month in prison for &#8220;disturbing social 
order&#8221;. The sentence is related to a small protest that Ms. Zhang participated in at the end of 
July, along with approximately 20 of her former neighbours, in Beijing&#8217;s Qianmen district.  
</p><p>582. On 23 July 2008, the Security Director for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games (BOCOG) announced the creation of three protest zones in Beijing parks during 
the Olympic Games. According to reports, applicants must give formal notification of a proposed 
protest at least five days in advance. The application must be given police approval if it is to be 
permitted. Only citizens from Beijing are reportedly allowed to apply for a permit, and protests 
which are deemed to harm &#8220;national unity&#8221; and &#8220;national, social or collective interests&#8221; are 
legally forbidden. Reports claim that to date, none of the 77 applications to conduct protests in 
the three designated protest areas have been granted. </p>

</p>
<p>583. Concern was expressed that aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
prevent public protests in China in the areas designated for this purpose during the Olympic 
Games, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country.

</b></p>
<p>585. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the case of 
Mr. Duan Jun, a prominent national advocate of AIDS treatment access, founder of AIDS Care 
Home, an organization in Henan province reportedly providing support to children affected by 
AIDS. Mr. Duan Jun is also a representative of the Country Coordinating Mechanism of the 
Global Fund to Combat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Finally, Mr. Duan Jun has been 
awarded a summer fellowship at AIDS Concern by the non-governmental organization 
Asia Catalyst. The purpose of the fellowship is to build non-profit leaders&#8217; management skills at 
larger and more established organizations. 
</p>
<p>586. According to the information received, on 16 August 2008 Mr. Duan Jun travelled from 
Hong Kong where he was attending a summer fellowship at AIDS Concern, to Shenzhen to 
renew his travel permit. Mr. Duan Jun was expected to return to Hong Kong on 18 August in the 
afternoon. After his failing to return, the colleagues of Mr. Duan Jun called him on his mobile 
phone to enquire about his whereabouts. He told them first that he had been stopped at customs. 
He later called them again to inform them that he was being held at an undisclosed location. 
</p>
<p>587. Concern was expressed that the reported arrest and detention of Mr. Duan Jun may be 
linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular his AIDS advocacy 
work.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>589. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government regarding the case of Mrs. Liu Jie, veteran rural campaigner 
advocating the rights to complain and to seek justice. Mrs. Liu Jie was the subject of a joint 
urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 25 October 2007, and of a joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 105 
 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 28 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>590. According to new information received at the time, on 15 August 2008 Mrs. Liu Jie, whose 
health is still very poor, was reportedly assaulted by a guard at the Harbin Drug Rehabilitation 
Centre (i.e. RTL camp) where she is currently detained, when she argued with him about the 
alleged mistreatment of a fellow detainee. During the assault, Mrs. Liu Jie shoved the guard 
forward in an act of self-defence. She was then accused of attacking the staff of the RTL camp 
and, as punishment, was forced to sit on a &#8220;tiger bench&#8221;. The practice consists of forcing the 
victim to sit upright on a long bench, with her hands tied behind her back; her thighs are fastened 
with a rope to the bench while her feet are raised off the floor by bricks placed under her feet. 
Extreme strain is put on the knees of the victim. Such practice, which amounts to torture, causes 
great pain. 
</p>
<p>591. On 22 May 2008, Mrs. Liu Jie was reportedly forced to sit on a &#8220;tiger bench&#8221; for seven 
consecutive days because she protested against the harsh working conditions in Qiqihar RTL 
camp. 
</p>
<p>592. Serious concern was reiterated for the health and physical integrity of Mrs. Liu Jie. As 
stated in the aforementioned joint urgent appeal of 28 December 2007. It was noted that 
Mrs. Liu Jie suffers from a severe eye illness which may cause blindness. It was further noted 
that in the response of the Government of 6 March 2008, it was mentioned that the doctor who 
examined Mrs. Liu Jie on 20 December 2007 &#8220;did not on any account say that, if she did not 
receive urgent treatment, she could lose the vision in her eye or that Heilongjiang province did 
not have adequate facilities to treat Liu&#8217;s eye injury and that she must be sent to Beijing for 
treatment, and other such allegations&#8221;. Furthermore it was noted that the Government response 
indicated that &#8220;[i]n mid-January 2008, Liu&#8217;s husband came to the labour re education facility to 
demand that Liu be allowed to see a doctor outside the facility immediately. As Liu herself was 
not cooperating in having examinations, it was impossible to determine whether or not, in 
accordance with the stipulations of the law, her medical condition warranted her being allowed 
to leave the facility for medical treatment&#8221;. While the Rapporteurs thanked the Government for 
its response, it noted that it did not dispel entirely the serious concern for the integrity of 
Mrs. Liu Jie&#8217;s health while in detention. Indeed, in addition to her severe eye illness, she 
reportedly suffers from heart disease and cholecystitis (an inflammation of the gallbladder wall 
and nearby abdominal lining), and she is forced to work fourteen hours a day, six days a week at 
the RTL camp.

</p>
<p>human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. Wang Xiaqiao, a 
petitioner and HIV/AIDS, activist since 2003 following the infection of her husband with 
HIV/AIDS when he was transfused at the No. 2 People&#8217;s Hospital at Xincai County in 1996. 
Prior to petitioning, Ms. Wang Xiaqiao exhausted all legal means to obtain compensation for her 
husband. 
</p>
<p>595. According to the information received, on 27 November 2007 Ms. Wang Xiaoqiao was 
reportedly arrested on charges of &#8220;extortion&#8221; while petitioning the provincial Government in 
Zhengzhou.  
</p>
<p>596. On 12 June 2008, the trial of Ms. Wang Xiaoqiao opened. Due to insufficient evidence, her 
case was sent twice from the Procurator back to the Public Security Bureau for further 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>597. On 12 August 2008, Ms. Wang Xiaoqiao was sentenced by the Xincai County Court to one 
year&#8217;s imprisonment for &#8220;extortion&#8221;. She has appealed the decision, and is currently detained at 
the Xincai County Detention Centre. It is reported that the lawyers of Ms. Wang Xiaoqiao have 
been intimidated not to publicize the case. 
</p>
<p>598. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and sentencing of Ms. Wang Xiaoqiao 
may be linked to her non-violent activities in defense of human rights, i.e. her HIV/AIDS 
advocacy work.

<p>600. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of 
Ms. Wang Guilan, a human rights activist from Enshi City, Hubei Province. Ms. Wang Guilan 
was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders on 6 March 2008.  
</p>
<p>601. According to new information received at the time, on 29 July 2008 Ms. Wang Guilan was 
criminally detained on suspicion of &#8220;disturbing social order&#8221; after she had allegedly given a 
phone interview to a foreign journalist. She is currently being held at the Enshi City Detention 
Centre. On 28 August, Chinese authorities decided to send Ms. Wang Guilan to a &#8220;Re-education 
through Labour&#8221; (RTL) camp for fifteen months, without trial or having been presented to a 
judge. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Wang Guilan had been held incommunicado at an unknown 
location since 17 April, reportedly to prevent her from &#8220;making trouble&#8221;. </p>

20 May 1961, high school education, a native of Hubei Province residing at 27 Dongfeng Dadao, 
Enshi, is a laid-off employee of the Wuyang Shopping Mall in Enshi. In August 2005, she was 
ordered by the Re-education through Labour Committee of the Enshi Tujia-Miao Autonomous 
Prefecture to undergo re-education through labour for a period of one year and three 
months (from 2 August 2005 to 1 November 2006) for having disrupted social order. On 
2 November 2005, she was sent to the Hubei Women&#8217;s Labour Re education Facility to undergo 
re-education; she was released on 3 October 2006. The communication alleges that Wang was 
ordered to undergo further re-education on 28 August 2008; inquiries have revealed that the 
person in question is not currently in a labour re-education facility&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>605. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government in 
relation to Ms. Amanda McKeown, a British charity worker, along with US nationals 
Mr. James Powderly, an artist and graphic designer, Mr. Brian Conley, an independent video 
journalist, and bloggers Mr. Jeffrey Rae, Mr. Michael Liss, Mr. Jeffrey Goldin and  
Mr. Tom Grant. All are members of the New York based Students for a Free Tibet, an 
organization which was founded in 1994.  
</p>
<p>606. According to information received, on 19 August 2008 Mr. James Powderly, 
Mr. Brian Conley, Mr. Jeffrey Rae, Mr. Michael Liss, Mr. Jeffrey Goldin, and Mr. Tom Grant 
were arrested by police officers and sentenced to 10 days of administrative detention at 
Dongcheng police station in Beijing. The group had travelled to Beijing to document a pro-Tibet 
protest during the Olympic Games. According to a statement issued by Public Security Bureau 
officials in Beijing the six men had been &#8220;apprehended for upsetting public order&#8221;. All were 
released from detention on 24 August and deported by Chinese authorities on a China Air flight 
to the United States.  
</p>
<p>607. On the night of 20 August 2008, Ms. Amanda Mc Keown was arrested by police officers 
outside the National Stadium in Beijing. She had been photographing three fellow Students for a

</p>
<p>interrogated during two sessions, lasting four and seven hours, respectively before being moved 
to a detention centre in the capital. During the interrogation sessions Ms. Mc Keown, along with 
other activists who had been arrested, was reportedly locked into high-backed metal chairs with 
bars across their laps while interrogators shone bright lights in their faces. Ms. Mc Keown was 
sentenced to 10 days of administrative detention. However, she was released after three days and 
deported to the United Kingdom on 24 August.

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>609. In a letter dated 03 January 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
of 04 September 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;On 19 August 2008, 
six foreigners - James Marlon Powderly, Brian Joel Conley, Jeffrey William Rae, 
Michael Bentley Liss, Jeffrey Robert Goldin and Thomas Carr Grant - were apprehended by 
officers of the Beijing Public Security Bureau for disrupting order in a public place. In 
accordance with article 23 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, the Dongcheng branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau 
decided to impose a penalty of 10 days&#8217; administrative detention on the above six individuals. At 
approximately 12.30 a.m. on 21 August 2008, four foreigners engaging in activities contravening 
China&#8217;s laws and regulations on the west side of Beichen bridge, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 
were summarily stopped by police officers on duty. Upon investigation these were found to be 
Florian Norbu Gyanatshang (male, German national), John Allen Watterberg (male, 
United States national), Jeremy Michael Wells (male, United States national) and Amanda 
McKeown (female, United Kingdom national), all of whom had entered the country on tourist 
visas. Pursuant to article 23 of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, the Chaoyang branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau imposed 
a penalty of 10 days&#8217; administrative detention on all four. China is a country governed by the 
rule of law and guarantees citizens&#8217; enjoyment of all fundamental rights, including the right of 
assembly, procession and demonstration, in accordance with the law. Under the Law of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions and Demonstrations, any person holding 
a gathering, parade or demonstration must apply to the public security authorities. The competent 
authorities accept and consider the application and issue a decision. Foreigners in China are 
likewise bound to observe the country&#8217;s laws and regulations. In the two cases cited above, it 
was illegal for foreigners who had neither applied to hold a gathering, parade or demonstration 
nor obtained permission to do so from the competent Chinese authorities to demonstrate outside 
the place where a major international athletic competition was being held. In dealing with this 
situation in accordance with the law, China&#8217;s judicial authorities took measures that were 
consistent with the provisions of the relevant international human rights instruments. In dealing 
with these cases, China&#8217;s public security authorities observed the law scrupulously, respecting 
and guaranteeing the dignity and all legitimate rights of the individuals concerned, and promptly 
notifying their respective embassies and consulates. The allegation in the communication from 
the Special Rapporteurs that the individuals concerned were subjected to corporal punishment is 
inconsistent with the facts. </p>

human rights defenders and regarding Messrs. Liu Xueli and Li Jincheng. Mr. Liu Xueli is a 
petitioner for the defense of land rights in Henan Province. In 2004 he was reportedly sent to a 
re-education through labor camp for one year on charges of &#8220;disturbing social order&#8221; after 
petitioning for years in protest against the forceful appropriation of land by the local government 
in Bopo Village, Henan Province. Mr. Li Jincheng is a petitioner from Xinjiang Province.  
</p><p>612. According to the information received, in early August 2008 Messrs. Liu Xueli and 
Li Jincheng applied for the right to protest at the official &#8220;Protest Zones&#8221;. They were informed 
that their application had been successful and that, in nine days, they could come back to collect 
a written permit. However, Mr. Liu Xueli was placed under residential surveillance after making 
the application. On 6 August 2008, he was arrested by Beijing police while he was sleeping. He 
was then forcibly returned to his home town. He was told in late August that his case would be 
dealt with in October and that he might face more serious punishment then. Meanwhile, 
on 8 August 2008, Mr. Li Jincheng disappeared near the Bird&#8217;s Nest Stadium in Beijing. Since 
then it has not been possible to contact him. On 23 September 2008, Mr. Liu Xueli was sent to 
re-education through labor camp. At approximately 2.45 p.m., he was forced into a car by police 
from Song County Public Security Bureau. Hours later he was told that he was going to be sent 
to re-education through labor camp although he was not given a written order and was not told 
why or for how long he was being sent there. 
</p>
<p>613. Concern was expressed that the disappearance of Mr. Li Jincheng and the fact that  
Mr. Liu Xueli was sent to re-education through labor camp may be related to their activities in 
petitioning to defend land rights. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Liu Xueli and Mr. Li Jincheng.

resident of Sertar County, Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. On 
10 September 2008, he was issued a subpoena by the Sichuan judicial authorities, acting in 
accordance with the law, on suspicion of having engaged in separatist acts and acts harmful to 
State security (that same day the subpoena was modified to a criminal detention order). While 
undergoing investigation, he made no attempt to deny his illegal acts but expressed genuine 
repentance and promised that he would never again engage in such illegal activities. Following

highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to food, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding alleged threats against voluntary 
lawyers involved in a campaign initiated by Mr. Li Fangping, a human rights lawyer in Beijing. 
The campaign aimed to bring about justice for the children victim of milk contamination 
following more than 50,000 cases of kidney infections reportedly caused by drinking milk mixed 
with melanin. At least 22 Chinese companies were allegedly responsible for the contamination. 
</p>

3 September 2008 and 10 September 2008.  
</p>
<p>621. According to information received, as of 24 September, more than 100 lawyers 
from 22 provinces had signed up to offer voluntary legal aid to the victims of contaminated milk 
powder products. On 28 September 2008, many of those lawyers had dropped out of the group 
because of pressure from officials. The lawyers were reportedly told that &#8220;they would face 
serious repercussions if they stayed involved&#8221; in the campaign.  
</p>
<p>622. Concern was expressed that the threats against the voluntary lawyers involved in the 
campaign organized by Mr. Li Fangping may have be related to their legitimate activities to seek 
justice for the victims of contaminated milk. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and </p>

Li Subin, members of the Beijing Yitong Law Firm, and Tang Jitian, previous member of the 
Beijing Haodong Law Firm.  
</p><p>625. According to the information received, Cheng Hai, Li Subin and Tang Jitian were 
among 35 lawyers who signed and published an appeal on the internet on 26 August 2008 calling 
for direct elections of the chairperson and the board of directors of the Beijing Lawyers 
Association, which operates under the control of the Bureau of Justice. Subsequently, the 
lawyers used text messages, letters and other means to disseminate their appeal to all Beijing 
lawyers and called upon them to demand their rights and actively participate in the upcoming 
elections for representatives to the Lawyers Association. The Association issued a reply to the 
appeal on its website on 5 September 2008. This appeal allegedly states that the use of text 
messages, the internet or other media to privately promote and disseminate the concept of direct 
elections and to express controversial opinions related to the Association is illegal. 
</p>
<p>626. On 30 October 2008, officials of the Haidian District Bureau of Justice came to the Yitong 
Law Firm, which has dealt with several rights defense cases in the past. The officials took 
photographs and questioned members of the law firm about cases the firm has handled. 
Following this visit, the director of the law firm expressed concern as he felt strong pressure 
from the authorities to stop taking on such cases and employing individuals supporting the direct 
election of the Lawyers Association.  
</p>
<p>627. In early September, Tang Jitian was asked by his superiors to leave his post in order not to 
put the future of the firm in peril. On 24 September 2008, Tang had filed a complaint with the 
Xicheng District Court against the Beijing Lawyers Association, stating that the written 
statement by the Association violated domestic law and international treaties signed by the 
Chinese Government. This complaint has allegedly not yet been registered. In mid-October, the 
Haodong Law Firm terminated Tang&#8217;s employment, reportedly under pressure of the authorities.  
</p>
<p>628. Information has also been received that many lawyers who have signed the appeal have 
been summoned by the district bureaus of justice to report on their motivation to participate in 
the appeal. Several directors of law firms have also been informed by the bureaus of justice that 
in case the concerned lawyers refused to withdraw their signatures, their firms would risk 
difficulties in the annual licensing procedure. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>629. In a letter dated 13 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
of 07 November 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;The Beijing Lawyers Association 
is an association having legal personality and registered with the civil authorities in accordance 
with the law which conducts its activities independently. The competent Chinese Government 
authorities have never interfered in its internal affairs, such as elections, nor have they ever 
exerted pressure on any unit or individual in this regard, nor have the competent authorities ever 
received any complaint to this effect. Because of problems involving unlawful breaches of 
discipline by the Beijing Yitong Law Firm and its lawyers in the course of their professional 
activities, with the parties concerned being the subject of numerous complaints and even being 
disciplined by the Lawyers Association, the Beijing municipal judicial authorities investigated 
the matter and sought on the spot clarification from the law firm; such activities are part of the 
judicial authorities&#8217; normal supervisory and managerial activities. The allegations in the 
communication are thus inconsistent with the facts. Tang Jitian&#8217;s contract of employment with 
the Beijing Haodong Law Firm had expired, which meant that he could not continue working for 
that firm. In November 2008, Tang submitted an application for work with the Beijing Anhui 
Law Firm, where he is currently employed as a lawyer. The allegation in the communication that 
pressure was placed on the law firm to fire Tang is inconsistent with the facts.&#8221;

<p>630. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>631. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
the situation of Mr. Chen Daojun, a freelance writer and cyber activist based in Sichuan. 
Mr. Chen Daojun, together with Messrs Xin Wu, Shi Jianhua and Lin Yong, were the subject of 
an urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2008 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the previous Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders. A response of the Government of Your Excellency has not yet been received. 
</p>
<p>632. According to new information received, on 21 November 2008, the Chendu Intermediate 
People&#8217;s Court in Sichuan convicted Mr. Chen Daojun of &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221; 
(after having been initially charged with &#8220;inciting secession&#8221;), and sentenced him to three years 
of imprisonment and deprivation of political rights. This was reportedly in response to internet 
articles written by Mr. Chen Daojun, in which he supported the protests held in March 2008 in 
Tibet. During the trial, Mr. Chen Daojun pleaded &#8220;innocent&#8221;, and he may appeal the decision. 
</p><p>633. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Chen Daojun may be linked to his 
non-violent activities in defence of human rights. Further concern is expressed for 
Mr. Chen Daojun&#8217;s physical and mental integrity while in detention.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>634. In a letter dated 17 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
of 24 November 2008, providing the following information: &#8220;Chen Daojun, male, born on 
3 January 1968, was arrested on 13 June 2008. On 21 November he was sentenced by the 
Chengdu Intermediate People&#8217;s Court to three years&#8217; imprisonment and deprived of his political 
rights for three years for the crime of inciting subversion of State political power. Following the 
hearing in the court of first instance, Chen accepted the verdict and did not file an appeal. The 
judgement of the court of first instance has become effective. The court in question conducted 
the trial in this case in strict compliance with the law. During the trial, not only did Chen himself 
exercise his right to a defence, but his designated counsel also made a full submission in his 
defence. While the Chinese Constitution stipulates that citizens enjoy the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, it also provides that when exercising this right, citizens may not harm 
the interests of the State, society or the community, or the legitimate freedoms and rights of other 
citizens. The articles which Chen signed and published on the Internet employed rumour 
mongering and libel to incite others to repudiate the State&#8217;s political power and social system. 
Under article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, such acts 
constitute the crime of inciting subversion of State political power. China&#8217;s judicial authorities 
investigated Chen&#8217;s criminal responsibility in accordance with the country&#8217;s laws and cannot be 
reproached&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>635. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>636. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation 
of Mr. Xiaobo Liu, Chinese citizen, age 53, resident of Haidian District, Beijing, is a 
Beijing-based writer, intellectual and human rights activist; and currently the editor of the online 
journal Democratic China, the former president of the independent Chinese PEN. 
</p><p>637. On 8 December 2008, Mr. Liu was taken away from his home by the Local police and the 
National Security police (guobao) from Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB). 
According to the detention warrant presented by the police at the time of arrest, he was to be 
detained on suspicion of &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>638. The police authorities have not informed his family about his detention, nor the type of 
detention, nor the reasons for the detention. It is alleged that the police authorities told Mr. Liu&#8217;s 
wife that his detention &#8216;&#8216;was a very high level decision&#8217;&#8217;, and that the police authorities can 
provide no further information regarding the detention. 
</p>
<p>639. In the past, Mr. Liu was detained several times: in 1989, he was jailed for 18 months for 
participating in the student democracy movement; in 1995, he was de facto detained under </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 114 
 
</p>
<p>ruanjin, (or &#8220;soft detention&#8221; regime, a form of residential surveillance) for 8 months in a Beijing 
suburb for issuing a public petition; in 1996, he was sent to three years of Re-education through 
Labor (RTL). Since 1999, Mr. Liu has been under residential surveillance. 
</p>
<p>640. Mr. Liu&#8217;s arrest came a day before the issuance of Charter 08, a public appeal calling for 
reforms that promote democracy and human rights in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. Mr. Liu is 
one of the 303 Chinese citizens who signed this petition. It is alleged that Mr. Liu is detained for 
signing the petition, and also suspected of organising the signature of the petition.  
</p>
<p>641. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Liu may be related to his 
non-violent exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression in the course of his 
activities in defence of human rights. Further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Liu while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>642. In a letter dated 13 February 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. 
At the time this report was finalized, the reply of the Government had not been translated. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>643. In a letter dated 15 January 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 30 November 2007. The Government reported on Yang Maodong, male, ethnic Han Chinese, 
born in 1966 in Gucheng county, Hubei province, nom de plume &#8220;Guo Feixiong&#8221;. On 
14 September 2006, Yang was taken into police custody by the Guangdong public security 
authorities on suspicion of the offence of operating an unlawful business and on 30 September he 
was formally placed under arrest, in accordance with the law, by the Guangdong province public 
security authorities. Following an inquiry, the Tianhe district people&#8217;s court in Guangzhou city 
established the following: in early July 2001, without obtaining the requisite publication 
authorization, Yang Maodong fabricated a non-existent publishing company, of a legal journal 
entitled Fal&#252; Zongheng (&#8220;Length and Breadth of the Law&#8221;), misappropriated the publication 
number &#8220;CN11 2135&#8221; from the journal Huaxue Shiji (&#8220;Chemical Reagents&#8221;) and, at premises 
situated at No. 604 Shangya Street in Guangzhou city, had copies printed of a purported 
&#8220;2001 special issue&#8221; of Fal&#252; Zongheng, entitled &#8220;Political upheaval in Shenyang&#8221;, and assigned 
other persons to carry out the typesetting and to prepare the offset plates for the publication, and 
then proceeded to have two batches, totalling 26,098 copies, printed of the so called 2001 special 
issue of Fal&#252; Zongheng - &#8220;Political upheaval in Shenyang&#8221;, setting a price of 10 yuan per copy. 
He then had these publications shipped as goods consignments to booksellers in Shenyang and 
Dalian. In all, 20,680 copies were shipped to booksellers in Shenyang in two consignments, on 
12 July and 21 July 2001. The Tianhe district people&#8217;s court in Guangzhou city determined that 
the defendant Yang Maodong had fabricated a publishing outlet, had misappropriated publishing 
numbers and had unlawfully printed and distributed 26,098 copies of a publication, thereby 
seriously disrupting market processes, and that the circumstances of his offence were particularly 
serious and his conduct constituted the offence of operating an unlawful business. In view of the 
facts, the nature and the circumstances of Yang Maodong&#8217;s offence and the harm caused to 
society, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of articles 225, paragraph 4, and 52 of the 
Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and paragraph 15 of the Supreme Court&#8217;s 
interpretation of certain aspects of the application of law in criminal cases involving illegal </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 115 
 
</p>
<p>publications, on 14 November the Tianhe district people&#8217;s court sentenced him, for the offence 
of operating an unlawful business, to five years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment and fined him the 
amount of 40,000 yuan renminbi. Acting in accordance with the law, the Tianhe district people&#8217;s 
court in Guangzhou heard the case in public proceedings, and there were no irregularities in the 
legal procedures followed. During the trial, Yang conducted his own defence and, in addition, 
the legal counsel appointed by him also made full submissions in his defence. The defendant&#8217;s 
and his legal counsel&#8217;s rights in litigation were fully upheld and there was no question of 
confessions being extorted from Yang by torture. 
</p>
<p>644. In a letter dated 15 January 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 30 November 2007. The Government reported on Rongal Adrak, male, ethnic Tibetan, born 
on 3 February 1955 in Lithang County, Garz&#234; prefecture in Sichuan Province, illiterate, herder. 
On 1 August 2007, he took advantage of public events being conducted in Lithang County to call 
for the division of the State and the subversion of national unity. In consequence of these actions, 
on 25 August a number of people, who lacked a clear understanding of the situation, gathered in 
a mob and created a public disturbance, seriously disrupting law and order. Rongal Adrak was 
taken into custody, in accordance with the law, on suspicion of the offence of incitement to 
division of the State. On 20 November 2007, in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
article 103, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the people&#8217;s 
intermediate court of Garz&#234; Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture sentenced Rongal Adrak to 
eight years&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment and stripped him of his political rights for four years. 
Adruk Lopoe, male, ethnic Tibetan, born on 8 September 1962 in Lithang County, Garz&#234; 
prefecture in Sichuan Province, monk at Changqing Chunke&#8217;er monastery in Lithang County. 
On 12 September 2007, Adruk Lopoe was taken into custody, in accordance with the law, on 
suspicion of the offences of espionage for persons or bodies outside the country, illegally 
providing intelligence and incitement to division of the State. Proceedings were instituted by the 
people&#8217;s intermediate court of Garz&#234; Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province and 
Adruk Lopoe voluntarily confessed to commission of the offences. On 20 November 2007, the 
people&#8217;s intermediate court of Garz&#234; Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province 
sentenced Adruk Lopoe, under the relevant provisions of article 111 and article 103, paragraph 2, 
of the Criminal Code of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, to seven years&#8217; fixed term 
imprisonment and stripped him of his political rights for three years; and for the offence of 
incitement to division of the State, the court sentenced him to four years&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment and stripped him of his political rights for three years. Applying the principle of 
joinder of punishments for combined crimes, the court decided that he should serve 10 years&#8217; 
fixed-term imprisonment and be stripped of his political rights for 5 years. 
</p>
<p>645. In a letter dated 15 January 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 9 October 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;Zheng Dajing, male, ethnic Han Chinese, 
born 9 March 1962, from Yunxi county, Shiyan municipality in Hubei, formerly an employee at 
the Yunxi local branch of the Bank of China. On 20 December 2000, the Yunxi branch was 
closed down and Zheng&#8217;s employment contract with the Bank of China was terminated, and a 
lump-sum compensation payment made to him of 59,133.33 yuan. After termination of his 
employment contract, Zheng initially continued to occupy the single-storey house allocated to 
him by his former work unit, and subsequently sublet it to another tenant. In 2004, Zheng asked 
to be allowed to participate in the housing reform process and to be able to buy the single-storey 
house which he had been occupying. Because he had already terminated his employment 
contract with his former work unit, however, the house in question did not fall within the scope </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 116 
 
</p>
<p>of the housing reform process; accordingly, the work unit refused his request. In June 2004, the 
Shiyan branch of the Bank of China placed the remaining assets of the Yunxi local branch under 
administration and, acting in accordance with the law, arranged to sell these assets in a job lot by 
auction, including the house which Zheng had been occupying, together with its plot of land. The 
bank proceeded to carry out the transfer of ownership formalities, in accordance with the law. On 
21 May 2005, the purchaser posted announcements that the property should be vacated, giving 
notice that redevelopment of the property would commence on 25 May. Zheng was of the view 
that he had a lease agreement with the Shiyan branch of the Bank of China and that he had the 
right of first refusal in purchasing the property. He then instituted court proceedings against the 
Shiyan branch of the Bank of China and the purchaser, seeking a court order nullifying the sale 
between the Shiyan branch of the Bank of China and the transfer of ownership of the land and 
confirming his right of first refusal in purchasing the property. Hearing the case at first instance, 
the Maojian district court in Shiyan city decided that, following the termination of Zheng&#8217;s 
employment relationship with his original work unit, his status had become that of a 
non-employee and he no longer had any property rights to the building in question, nor was there 
any evidence to show that he had a lease agreement with the work unit that owned the building. 
Accordingly, the court dismissed his application. Zheng refused to accept the court&#8217;s decision 
and lodged an appeal. On 9 December 2005, the Shiyan city people&#8217;s high court passed 
judgement, dismissing the appeal and upholding the original ruling. In order to resolve the issue 
of Zheng&#8217;s housing, on 27 June 2007 the local authorities allocated funds to buy housing to 
provide Zheng with free accommodation, and also set aside adequate housing and a lump sum 
for his relocation costs. Zheng would not accept the arrangement, however. In view of Zheng&#8217;s 
difficult living circumstances, in the second quarter of 2002 the local authorities started issuing 
him the minimum social welfare support. Zheng refused to accept the court&#8217;s ruling and on many 
occasions travelled to Beijing to lodge appeals. On 14 June 2007, Zheng and other complainants 
gathered at the supreme court to submit complaints, and were involved in clashes with the 
security personnel. The public security authorities investigated Zheng&#8217;s conduct on suspicion 
that the irregular manner in which he had lodged his complaints had disrupted law and order, but 
he was neither taken into criminal custody nor placed under arrest. Nor was there any instance of 
Zheng being subjected to beatings or ill treatment. Since 2005, Zheng Dajing&#8217;s wife 
Cao Xiangzhen has accompanied her husband to Beijing to make complaints, bringing her 
daughter with her. The relevant authorities approached Cao, pointing out that her daughter 
should be temporarily entrusted to the care of friends or family, but Cao argued that her daughter 
Zheng Linxin was still very young and unable to fend for herself, and that Cao had to keep the 
child with her. There was no question, as alleged, of Cao being detained together with her 
daughter. Taking into consideration the fact that, while accompanying her parents on their trips 
to make complaints, Zheng Linxin was missing out on school, the relevant district authorities in 
this county town specially appointed two school teachers to provide make-up classes for the girl 
during the summer vacation period, which were provided at a specially reduced rate. 
</p>
<p>646. In a letter dated 6 March 2008, the Government responded to joint urgent appeals 
of 25 October 2007 and 28 December 2007. The Government reported about Liu Jie, female, 
born 1 March 1952, junior secondary education, resident at row No. 26 in Xunke farm in 
Heilongjiang province, unemployed. The Government stated that because she had caused a 
public nuisance and disturbed the peace, Jie was ordered to serve a term of one year and 
six months&#8217; labour re education, to run from 13 October 2007 to 12 April 2009. On 
14 November 2007, Liu was sent by the public security bureau attached to the agricultural and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 117 
 
</p>
<p>land reclamation service in the city of Bei&#8217;an to the labour re education facility in the city of 
Qiqihar to serve her term of labour re education. After entering the facility, Liu had problems 
with her vision in both eyes. On 15 November 2007, the doctor at the re education facility first 
took Liu to the hospital of the agriculture and land reclamation service and then to the eye, ear, 
nose and throat hospital in Qiqihar to be examined. The results of the examination were as 
follows: &#8220;1. Ametropia and vitreous opacity in the right eye; 2. traumatic cataract in the left eye 
(aphacia); 3. high degree myopia in the right eye.&#8221; As Liu was not prepared to cooperate, it was 
not possible for any further examinations to be carried out. On 20 December 2007, the hospital at 
the labour re education facility once again sent Liu for an examination by eye specialists at 
Qiqihar hospital No. 1. The results of the consultation were as follows: &#8220;The left eye has 
undergone cataract surgery; high degree myopia in the right eye; pathological retinal 
degeneration.&#8221; The consultant suggested that Liu see an optometrist to have glasses prescribed, 
but she refused. At that time Liu asked the doctor about the possibility of a lens implant in her 
left eye, and whether implanting a lens could have other consequences for her eyes. The doctor 
told her that whether she had this done sooner or later would not affect the consequences, but 
that it would be better to have it done sooner. The doctor did not on any account say that, if she 
did not receive urgent treatment, she could lose the vision in her eye or that Heilongjiang 
province did not have adequate facilities to treat Liu&#8217;s eye injury and that she must be sent to 
Beijing for treatment, and other such allegations. In mid January 2008, Liu&#8217;s husband came to 
the labour re education facility to demand that Liu be allowed to see a doctor outside the facility 
immediately. As Liu herself was not cooperating in having examinations, it was impossible to 
determine whether or not, in accordance with the stipulations of the law, her medical condition 
warranted her being allowed to leave the facility for medical treatment. Following Liu&#8217;s 
admission to the facility, the labour re education facility has enforced the law with fairness and, 
in accordance with the law, has protected Liu&#8217;s rights and interests; she has not been beaten, 
subjected to punishment or to any form of ill treatment. Liu&#8217;s eye problems are also not growing 
worse. In view of Liu&#8217;s state of health, the re education facility is particularly attentive to her. 
Liu is only required to perform light manual duties that are well within her grasp and she has not 
been placed on any fixed work schedule or duty roster.

</p>
<p>663. Adem&#225;s se hab&#237;an recibido informaciones sobre amenazas en contra de la Sra. Ana Mar&#237;a 
S&#225;nchez, el Sr. Gustavo Gall&#243;n Giraldo y la Sra. Claudia Julieta Duque. La Sra. S&#225;nchez es

es periodista aut&#243;noma y colaboradora de la organizaci&#243;n de derechos humanos Equipo Nizkor. 
</p>
<p>664. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 1 de mayo de 2008, la Sra. S&#225;nchez habr&#237;a 
recibido un correo electr&#243;nico firmado por el grupo paramilitar, las Aguilas Negras. El correo 
habr&#237;a sido de car&#225;cter amenazante y antisemita, afirmando que se limpiar&#237;an &#8216;las calles de la 
basura comunista, jud&#237;a y antinatural&#8217;. Por otra parte, la periodista Claudia Julieta Duque 
habr&#237;a tomado la decisi&#243;n de renunciar a los escoltas otorgadas a ella por el Estado en 
diciembre de 2003 como medida de protecci&#243;n, tras informarse de que &#233;stos le hicieron falsas 
imputaciones a la susodicha en sus informes al Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad. 
</p>
<p>665. Tambi&#233;n se hab&#237;a recibido informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con amenazas ocurridas en las semanas 
anteriores por varios miembros de organizaciones no gubernamentales y movimientos de la 
sociedad civil colombiana incluyendo: los Sres. Jos&#233; Humberto Torres, Nicol&#225;s Castro y Pr&#237;ncipe

</p>
<p>conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o 
arbitrarias, el 22 de febrero de 2008. La Sra. Duque fue el objeto de un llamamiento urgente 
conjunto enviado por la entonces Representante Especial del Secretario-General para los 
defensores de los derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n del 
derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n el 23 de septiembre de 2004. 
</p>
<p>667. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 22 de abril, los miembros de la Central 
Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) en el departamento de Santander, en el nordeste de Colombia, 
habr&#237;an recibido una amenaza de muerte por escrito del grupo paramilitar &#8216;Nueva Generaci&#243;n de 
&#193;guilas Negras de Santander&#8217;. La amenaza, con fecha del 18 de abril, advert&#237;a contra la 
celebraci&#243;n de marchas o manifestaciones con ocasi&#243;n del D&#237;a Internacional del Trabajo, el 
1 de mayo; &#8220;hay dispuesto un destacamento de hombres quienes cumplir&#225;n nuestras ordenes y 
har&#225;n limpieza de todos ustedes serviles de la guerrilla&#8221;. La comunicaci&#243;n habr&#237;a nombrado a 
17 miembros de sindicatos y organizaciones de derechos humanos a los que declaraba &#8220;objetivo 
militar&#8221; y entre los que se encontraban algunos de los susodichos. 
</p>
<p>668. El 23 de abril, los Sres. Jos&#233; Humberto Torres y Jes&#250;s Tovar habr&#237;an recibido por correo 
electr&#243;nico una amenaza de muerte firmada las &#8216;&#193;guilas Negras al Rearme&#8217;. La amenaza, con 
fecha del 21 de abril, habr&#237;a acusado a los dos hombres de ser guerrilleros, advirti&#233;ndole a 
Jos&#233; Humberto Torres &#8216;que se cuide, donde lo veamos lo damos&#8217;. Adem&#225;s, habr&#237;a advertido a los 
miembros de otros sindicatos y organizaciones de derechos humanos de que guardaran silencio, 
se&#241;alando que Mar&#237;a Cede&#241;o y Nicol&#225;s Castro estaban siendo vigiladas. 
</p>
<p>669. Los titulares de mandato quer&#237;an tambi&#233;n se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno declaraciones 
hechas en contra del Sr. Iv&#225;n Cepeda Castro, dirigente de la Fundaci&#243;n Manuel Cepeda Vargas, 
representante del Movimiento Nacional de V&#237;ctimas de Cr&#237;menes del Estado y columnista con el 
seminario El Espectador. El susodicho fue objeto de un llamamiento urgente, emitido el 
12 de diciembre de 2006 por la Representante Especial del Secretario-General para los 
defensores de los derechos humanos.  
</p>
<p>670. Valoraron el respaldo y reconocimiento del importante papel de los defensores de derechos 
humanos en Colombia, expresado en la respuesta del Gobierno al reciente comunicado de prensa 
y reconocieron los esfuerzos por parte del Estado colombiano para mejorar la seguridad de los 
defensores. No obstante, deseaban manifestar su preocupaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con declaraciones 
como aquellas hechas el pasado 6 de mayo en Monter&#237;a y en la C&#225;tedra Colombia en Bogot&#225; por 
el Presidente de Colombia respecto a algunos defensores de derechos humanos, en particular al 
Sr. Iv&#225;n Cepeda Castro. Seg&#250;n se inform&#243;, el Presidente Uribe habr&#237;a declarado que personas 
como el susodicho se arropar&#237;an en la protecci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas, la cual &#8216;les sirve para instigar la 
violaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos en contra de las personas que no comparten sus ideas&#8217; y para 
&#8216;salir a amenazar, ... calumniar, &#8230; acusar falazmente&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>671. A juicio de los titulares de mandato, estas declaraciones, sumadas a otras hechas en los 
&#250;ltimos meses por representantes del gobierno colombiano, podr&#237;an resultar sumamente 
perjudiciales, dado que, actualmente en Colombia muchos defensores de derechos humanos se 
enfrentan a intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas como aquellas resumidas m&#225;s arriba. Se expres&#243; profunda 
preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de todos aquellos individuos que se 
encuentran amenazados debido a su trabajo leg&#237;timo en defensa de los derechos humanos. </p>

Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la emisora comunitaria Sarare Est&#233;reo en 
Saravena, departamento de Arauca. Sarare Est&#233;reo emite noticias departamentales y nacionales 
de diversa &#237;ndole y emplea a una plantilla que incluye al Sr. Emiro Goyeneche; director, el 
Sr. Ismael Rodriguez y la Sra. Fanny Fern&#225;ndez; lectores de noticias, la Sra. Ella Patricia Ardila;

</p>
<p>675. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 29 de mayo de 2008 el personal de la 
emisora habr&#237;a encontrado un graffiti en la puerta del edificio con la sigla del grupo paramilitar, 
las Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). Este graffiti se suma a otras comunicaciones de 
car&#225;cter intimidatorio como mensajes de texto que habr&#237;an recibido algunos trabajadores de la 
emisora, incluidos los susodichos, en varias ocasiones desde el 8 de mayo, advirti&#233;ndoles que no 
se metieran en lo que no les interesaba. Los citados individuos ignorar&#237;an el motivo de las 
amenazas, pues no referir&#237;an a una noticia espec&#237;fica emitida por Sarare Est&#233;reo. 
</p>
<p>676. Se alega que las amenazas recibidas por los individuos aqu&#237; mencionados, y el 
hostigamiento de la emisora Sarare Est&#233;reo, podr&#237;an estar directamente relacionados con sus 
actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular el derecho a la libertad de

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>772. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding 
Mr. Dusan Miljus, a leading crime journalist with the Croatian daily, Jutarnji List.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 139 
 
</p>
<p>773. According to information received, on 2 June 2008 at approximately 8.15 p.m., 
Mr. Dusan Miljus was violently attacked by two unidentified individuals, in a parking lot in 
front of his home in Zagreb. The assailants reportedly beat Mr. Dusan Miljus with baseball bats 
until he lost consciousness, before fleeing the scene. Mr. Dusan Miljus was hospitalised with a 
concussion, a broken arm and facial injuries.  
</p><p>774. According to reports, Mr. Dusan Miljus was followed by two men on a motorcycle just 
prior to the attack; he was however unable to identify them as they were wearing helmets. 
</p>
<p>775. Mr. Dusan Miljus is well known in Croatia for his reports on organised crime activities and 
corruption, and it is believed that the aforementioned events may be linked to his coverage of 
mafia related crime and its alleged connection to politicians in the country. Most recently he had 
been involved in investigating illegal arms production and trafficking in Croatia. 
Mr. Dusan Miljus has been threatened in the past, in relation to his investigative journalism, but 
had reportedly received no protection.  
</p>
<p>776. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to 
stifle independent reporting in Croatia, thus restricting the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in the country.   
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>777. In a letter dated 10 November 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 08 July 2008. The Government provided the following information: &#8220;the facts from the letter 
and the enquiry of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression are correct with the additional information that Mr. Miljus 
sustained the multiple physical injuries on being attacked by the attackers who staked him in 
front of the house in which he lives. The criminal charge against unknown culprits was filed by 
police officers with the Municipal Public Prosecutor in Zagreb on 13 Mule 2008. The facts 
established lead to the conclusion that it was a serious crime (attempted murder), and the case 
was forwarded to the County Public Prosecutor. Pursuant to the request of the County Public 
Prosecutors the police continued the investigation to identify the culprits. To date, a number of 
interviews have been conducted with the injured party and eyewitnesses with crime 
investigation, fingerprint search and police line ups, various checks and analyses as well as other 
investigation activities but the culprits have not been identified yet. The current proceedings are 
at the pre-investigation stage. According to Croatian Law on Criminal Procedures, court 
investigation may only be instituted against identified culprits. For the time being, Mr. Miljus is 
under police protection, and the County Public Prosecutor Zagreb is continuing its 
comprehensive investigation into the motives and the identity of the perpetrators of this crime&#8221;.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>779. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations concerning </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 140 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ivo Pukanic, a prominent journalist and owner of the NCL Media Group in Zagreb and 
Mr. Niko Franjic, marketing executive of the weekly newspaper, Nacional, published by NCL. 
Nacional is an investigative paper that often exposes alleged corruption and human rights abuses 
in Croatia. 
</p>
<p>780. According to the information received, on 23 October 2008, at approximately 6.20 p.m., 
Mr. Ivo Pukanic and Mr. Niko Franjic were killed in a car bomb. The explosive device went off 
as the two men got into Mr. Pukanic&#8217;s car which was parked in front of the offices of the NCL 
Media Group in the centre of Zagreb. Two other Nacional staff members, who were in the 
parking lot at the time, were injured in the blast. 
</p><p>781. Previously, in April 2008, Mr. Pukanic escaped injury in an assassination attempt, when an 
unidentified individual carrying a gun approached him on the street in front of his apartment. 
The assailant reportedly threatened to kill Mr. Pukanic before firing a shot at him. 
Mr. Pukanic was under police protection at the time, however this was later suspended in 
August. Mr. Pukanic apparently complained about threats he had been receiving since 2002. A 
police investigation has reportedly been launched into the killing of Mr. Ivo Pukanic and 
Mr. Niko Franjic. However as yet no-one has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the 
motive of the killing remains unclear. 
</p>
<p>782. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
prevent independent reporting in Croatia, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>783. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at, the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communications. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 2 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>784. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations concerning 
Mr. Drago Hedl, a prominent journalist and columnist with the Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji 
List. Mr. Hedl mainly conducts investigative reporting on alleged war crimes committed during 
the 1991-1995 civil war in the former Yugoslavia, particularly those in the Osijek area. He has 
received numerous international awards for his work on transitional justice in Croatia.  
</p><p>785. According to information received on 27 November 2008, Mr. Hedl received a text 
message on his mobile phone, which contained serious death threats. Mr. Hedl reported the 
incident to the police and has been granted 24 hour police protection. Mr. Hedl has been the 
victim of at least four death threats since 2005, including in February 2008, when he received a 
letter accompanied by a photograph of a human skull, warning him to be &#8220;silent&#8221;. Mr. Hedl 
received the letter a few days after he had written articles in the Feral Tribune magazine about a 
Croatian general, Mr. Branimir Glavas, suspected of having been responsible for the killing of 
Croatian Serb civilians in Osijek in 1991. In one of his most recent articles published in Jutarnji 
List, Mr. Hedl returned to the case of Mr. Glavas, who was elected as a Member of Parliament in 
the November 2007 legislative elections. He also gave evidence at the opening of the trial of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 141 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Glavas in 2005. While there has apparently been some progress in the investigation 
concerning the most recent threat against Mr. Hedl, it seems that only one of the previous 
investigations of death threats issued against him and his family resulted in a prosecution.  
</p>
<p>786. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Hedl, 
particularly in light of reports of ongoing harassment and threats against journalists, including 
recent events which claimed the lives of journalists Mr. Ivo Pukanic and Mr. Niko Franjic. 
Further concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may be related to Mr. Hedl&#8217;s 
involvement in investigating cases of alleged war crimes and may represent a direct attempt to 
prevent independent reporting in Croatia, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>787. In a letter dated 3 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication sent on 
2 December 2008. The Government reported that the Police Directorate of the 
Republic of Croatia, in coordination with the Osijek-Baranja Police Department and the Zagreb 
Police Department, had completed the criminal investigation into the criminal offence of threat, 
sanctioned in Article 129 of the Criminal Code, committed against Mr. Drago Hedl. Mr. Hedl 
reported the threat on 27 November 2008 to the Osijek-Baranja Police Department, stating that 
he received a death threat by SMS on his mobile phone. The report was forwarded to the 
Municipal Public Prosecutor in Osijek, and the subsequent criminal investigation showed that the 
perpetrator of the offence was a Croatian citizen, a police officer working for the Zagreb Police 
Department. During the criminal investigation it was found that the motive of the offence was 
not to jeopardize the personal safety of Mr. Hedl, but an attempt by the perpetrator to draw 
attention to himself due to the dissatisfaction with his status issues. A criminal application was 
filed against the suspect with the Municipal Prosecutor in Osijek for the criminal offence of 
threat sanctioned in Article 129 of the Criminal Code, and the suspect was suspended from his 
work as a police officer, and disciplinary proceedings were also instituted against him. The 
Police convened a special press conference on 4 December 2008 to announce the findings of the 
criminal investigation to the public.

<p>805. Luego de dos horas de llevar a cabo la protesta contra el mantenimiento en detenci&#243;n de 
sus familiares, agentes policiales y miembros de la Seguridad cubana dispersaron la 
manifestaci&#243;n de mujeres haciendo uso de la fuerza. Los agentes policiales introdujeron a las 
manifestantes en un autob&#250;s estacionado a unos 100 metros del lugar donde se encuentran las 
sedes del Ministerio de las Fuerzas Armadas y del Ministerio del Interior. 
</p>
<p>806. Las Sras. Berta Soler y Sra. Noelia Pedraza se habr&#237;an resistido a ser detenidas y fueron 
arrastradas sobre el pavimento hasta que fueron puestas de pie. Este acto de fuerza les habr&#237;a 
producido magulladuras en brazos y espaldas. El autob&#250;s las condujo a sus respectivos 
domicilios. Durante el trayecto los agentes policiales no les hicieron ninguna pregunta.  
</p>
<p>807. Se aleg&#243; que los actos de hostigamiento e intimidaci&#243;n sufridos por las mujeres del 
colectivo Las Damas de Blanco pudieran estar directamente relacionados con sus actividades en 
defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular, su ejercicio pac&#237;fico del derecho a la libertad de 
expresi&#243;n. Asimismo, se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de las 
mujeres de este colectivo.

<p>808. Mediante carta fechada 26 de mayo de 2008 el Gobierno de Cuba transmiti&#243; informaci&#243;n 
en relaci&#243;n con la carta de alegaciones. El Gobierno rechaz&#243; las alegaciones incluidas en la carta 
de alegaciones e inform&#243; que Las Damas de Blanco no constituye una asociaci&#243;n u organizaci&#243;n 
alguna. Seg&#250;n el Gobierno, Las Damas de Blanco es una creaci&#243;n de los servicios especiales de 
Estados Unidos, que opera bajo instrucciones y con el financiamiento que recibe de modo directo 
de la Secci&#243;n de Intereses de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica en La Habana.  
</p>
<p>809. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que en Cuba no hay prisioneros pol&#237;ticos. Los familiares de las 
se&#241;oras de Las Damas en Blanco no fueron juzgados o sancionados por el disfrute de alguno de 
los derechos humanos reconocidos en la Declaraci&#243;n Universal. Ellos se encuentran en prisi&#243;n, 
en cumplimiento de sentencias firmes de los tribunales cubanos y luego de haber sido procesados 
con todas las garant&#237;as del debido proceso, por haber incurrido en graves hechos constitutivos de 
delitos, actuando como asalariados de la potencia extranjera que viola mas elementales derechos 
del pueblo cubano. El Gobierno manifest&#243; que son falsas las alegaciones de supuestos 
hostigamientos, intimidaciones, insultos y agresiones. Ninguna de las mujeres ha sido objeto de 
violaci&#243;n alguna a sus derechos humanos.  </p>

Las Damas de Blanco, una organizaci&#243;n de familiares de disidentes pol&#237;ticos encarcelados. La 
Sra. Laura Poll&#225;n Toledo es la esposa del Sr. H&#233;ctor Maseda Guti&#233;rrez, periodista independiente 
condenado a 20 a&#241;os de c&#225;rcel. La organizaci&#243;n Las Damas de Blanco fue sujeto de dos 
comunicaciones dirigidas al Gobierno de Cuba con fecha de 7 de abril de 2008 y 19 de mayo 
de 2008, de la entonces Representante Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos y del Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n del

</p>
<p>812. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 1 de julio de 2008, la Sra. Poll&#225;n Toledo habr&#237;a 
denunciado actos de hostigamiento por parte de agentes del Estado. Habr&#237;a afirmado que no 
pod&#237;a salir de su casa sin que agentes de la polic&#237;a la siguieran y la vigilaran. Se habr&#237;a instalado 
una c&#225;mara de seguridad cerca de su casa y la oficina central de las Damas de Blanco. Se aleg&#243; 
que los supuestos actos de hostigamiento contra la Sra. Laura Poll&#225;n Toledo pod&#237;an estar

<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>813. Mediante carta fechada 22 de julio de 2008, el Gobierno de Cuba respondi&#243; a la carta de 
alegaciones. Dado que ya hab&#237;a contestado a dos llamamientos anteriores relacionados con las 
Damas de Blanco, el Gobierno expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n de que, al parecer, sus respuestas no 
hab&#237;an sido debidamente tomadas en consideraci&#243;n. Reiter&#243; la falsedad de los hechos referidos 
por las tres comunicaciones sobre las Damas de Blanco y afirm&#243; que este grupo no constitu&#237;a 
una asociaci&#243;n u organizaci&#243;n alguna sino una creaci&#243;n de los servicios especiales de Estados 
Unidos, que opera bajo instrucciones y con el financiamiento que recibe de modo directo de la 
Secci&#243;n de Intereses de los Estados Unidos (SINA) en La Habana. As&#237; trabaja para subvertir el 
orden constitucional leg&#237;timamente establecido en Cuba. 
</p>
<p>814. El Gobierno afirm&#243; que la Sra. Laura Poll&#225;n Toledo nunca ha sido v&#237;ctima de 
hostigamiento ni persecuci&#243;n por parte de agentes del Estado o la polic&#237;a. Por el contrario, en 
ocasiones, los agentes estatales se han visto obligados a intervenir para proteger a la Sra. Poll&#225;n 
y a otras integrantes del grupo de las Damas de Blanco ante ciudadanos que no aceptan sus 
actividades mercenarias. La falsa imagen de violencia y salvajismo en la conducta de las 
autoridades y el pueblo cubano, que pretenden fabricar el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos, sus </p>

medios transnacionales de la desinformaci&#243;n controlados por Washington, que cumplen 
instrucciones de repetir hasta la saciedad las mentiras fabricadas por los personeros del Imperio.  
</p>
<p>815. La carta del Gobierno tambi&#233;n comunic&#243; que alegaciones de maltratos, hostigamientos y 
violaci&#243;n de derecho a la intimidad personal a cualquiera de las Damas de Blanco eran falsas. El 
Gobierno reiter&#243; que en Cuba no hay prisioneros pol&#237;ticos, y que los familiares de las se&#241;oras de 
Las Damas de Blanco no fueron juzgados o sancionados por el disfrute de alguno de los

detenido a la Sra. Espinosa en una imprenta donde retiraba un afiche de denuncia de la violaci&#243;n 
de derechos humanos, respecto a los disturbios que tuvieron lugar en noviembre de 2007 en

del motivo de su arresto mas se ha informado que un militar de rango mayor, cuyo nombre me ha 
sido referido, habr&#237;a presentado una denuncia en su contra ante la fiscal&#237;a de la provincia de 
Orellana, en la cual se habr&#237;a afirmado que dicho afiche fuera de car&#225;cter calumnioso y 
difamatorio hacia el Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica, el Ministro de Defensa y el militar a cargo de la 
regi&#243;n. El 12 de junio de 2008, la Sra. Espinosa habr&#237;a comparecido ante el juez, que habr&#237;a

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 3 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>832. The Special Rapporteur, together with the President of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr. Khaled Hamza, editor-in-chief of &#8220;Ikhwan 
Web&#8221; of the &#8220;Muslim Brotherhood Organization&#8221; and member of the Arab Human Rights 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>833. According to the information received, on 20 February 2008, Mr. Hamza was arrested by 
the police in Naser City, Al Wafaa wal Amal, as he left his office at 3:00 a.m. after participating 
in a meeting with human rights defenders. He asked one of the police officers whether there was 
an arrest warrant against him and was reportedly told that &#8220;there is no need for a warrant&#8221;. He 
was taken to the center of the security services in Lazoghli, where he was questioned throughout 
the night until 9:00 am. His heart medicine was reportedly seized. Mr. Hamza&#8217;s office was 
searched by the police and all documents as well as 16 computers were seized. His home was 
also searched, with documents, books, electronic equipment and computers being confiscated. 
After his arrest, Mr. Hamza was accused of &#8220;belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood 
Organization&#8221; and taken to the Tora Prison. He currently shares his cell with 50 other prisoners, 
most of whom are allegedly serving criminal sentences. On 9 March, due to his inability to 
follow his medical treatment in prison, he was urgently taken to Kasr Al Eni hospital.  
</p>
<p>834. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Mr. Hamza was related to his activities as a 
member of the Arab Human Rights Commission and as editor-in-chief of a &#8220;Muslim

assaulted by a police officer in a courtroom in the town Kafr El Dawwar, the district of Beheira. 
She suffered a broken shoulder, as well as injuries to the head. She lost consciousness for thirty 
minutes. The assault occurred after Ms. Magda Adly had testified in a case concerning members 
of a local family who allegedly had been subjected to torture by local police. On the morning of 
30 April 2008, El Nadim Centre had released a statement calling for an investigation into the 
allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of members of the Sobhi Mohamed Sobhi Hussein 
family by the local police in Kafr El Dawwar. After the assault, the police officer who attacked </p>

the car of Ms. Mona Hamdy, another psychiatrist at the El Nadim Centre, which was parked 
outside the courtroom, was vandalized under circumstances that are not yet clear.  
</p>
<p>838. Concern was expressed that the assault against Ms. Magda Adly was related to her 
legitimate and non-violent work in the defense of human rights, in particular her work to defend 
the rights of victims of violence and torture. Concern was also expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Magda Adly, as well as that of all members of the

Special Rapporteurs on 16 May 2008. The Government reported that domestic mechanisms 
continue to consider the complaint and are impartially reviewing the allegations of the different 
parties and the evidence at their disposal. The Department of Public Prosecutions, as an 
investigative body, is competent to decide whether an offence has been committed and whether 
or not to proceed with the prosecution. The Buhairah Security Department is in charge with the 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>840. When interviewed by the investigative authorities, the accused, Mr. Ahmad Antar Ibrahim 
Mahmud, denied the charges against him. Medical reports of the persons involved in the incident 
were taken at the Department of Forensic Medicine and the car of Dr. Magda Mohamed Adali 
was examined by the Department of Public Prosecutions was examined at the outset of the 
investigation, and an engineer from the Kafr al-Dawwar transport unit was dispatched to carry 
out a technical examination of the vehicle.  
</p>
<p>841. The Buhayra Security Department stated that, according to a fax received from the General 
Department for Security in Cairo, the accused, Mr. Ahmad Antar Ibrahim Mahmud was a soldier 
who had been on official leave on 21 April 2008. The fact that he had gone missing had been 
reported on 29 April 2008. At a hearing held on 17 May 2008, the Misdemeanors Court decided 
to release the accused, Mr. Ahmad Antar Ibrahim Mahmud. On the same day, the Department of 
Public Prosecutions appealed the decision. The appeal was heard on 18 May 2008. The court 
accepted the appeal but decided on the merits to uphold the decision to release the accused, on 
condition that he was not being sought on another count.

sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Kamal Murad, a journalist for the newspaper Al-Fajr. He has 
reported on alleged cases of corruption and human rights violations committed by police officers 
in Egypt. According to information received, on 17 June 2008, in Rahmaniya in the Buhaira

<p>843. While in detention, Mr. Murad was beaten and verbally abused by three police officers 
whose names are known to the Special Rapporteur and who reportedly referred to him as &#8220;the 
one who sent the officer to jail for three years&#8221;. Kamal Murad had previously reported on a 
torture case which resulted in the conviction and three-year prison sentence of a police officer. 
Mr. Murad was charged with attacking police officers and inciting the peasants against security 
forces and released after several hours in detention. His confiscated property has not yet been 
returned to him. 
</p>
<p>844. Concern was expressed that the arrest and ill-treatment of Mr. Kamal Murad could be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular to his reports about 
alleged human rights violations committed by members of the police force. In view of the 
incident outlined above, further concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of 
Mr. Murad. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>845. In a letter dated 5 December 2008 the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 30 June 2008. At the time of the finalization of the current report, a translation of this reply 
was not yet available.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal on 21 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>846. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr. Mohamed Bayoumi, a lawyer and 
representative of the Association for Human Rights and Legal Aid (AHRLA). He was the 
defence lawyer of Ms. Awleel, a Sudanese refugee who was assaulted and raped by two 
Egyptian police officers. As a result of the court case, one of the police officers was sentenced 
to 25 years in prison.  
</p>
<p>847. According to the information received, Mr. Mohamed Bayoumi and members of his family 
have been harassed and intimidated several times over the past two months. In July 2008, the 
sentenced police officer offered him a bribe of 50.000 LE in order to drop the charges against 
him, which Mr. Bayoumi refused. On 2 August 2008, relatives of the sentenced police officer 
stopped Mr. Bayoumi in the street, beat his leg and stole his case files on Ms. Awleel. 
On 13 August 2008, his family received a phone call claiming that Mr. Bayoumi had been shot 
dead and that his body could be found in the morgue. Mr. Mohsen, who is Mr. Bayoumi&#8217;s 
partner on the Awleel case, received a similar phone call.  
</p>
<p>848. Concern was expressed with regard to the acts of harassment and intimidation against 
Mr. Bayoumi, which are connected with his activities in defense of human rights. Further 
concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Bayoumi and 
that of his family. </p>

</b></p>
<p>850. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the alleged threats against 
Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd. Mr. Nasser Amine is the Director General of 
the Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession (ACIJLP). 
Mr. Hammad Wadi Sannd is a lawyer and a researcher with the same organization. The ACIJLP 
is a non-governmental institution that works to reinforce the status of justice, the independence 
of the judiciary and the legal profession, and the respect of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in the Arab region. In Darfur, Sudan, it works to strengthen the implementation of 
criminal justice and to advocate for the intervention of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  
</p><p>851. According to the information received, on 25 October 2008 threats were sent by email to 
the official ACIJLP address by a group which called itself the Middle East Mujahedeen in Cairo. 
The email threatened to kill Mr. Nasser Amine if he, the ACIJLP, or the International Criminal 
Court, continued to intervene in the Darfur crisis. Threats were also made against Mr. Hammad 
Wadi Sannd. 
</p>
<p>852. Concern was expressed that the threats against Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi 
Sannd could be related to their legitimate activities in the strengthening of criminal justice in 
Darfur. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>853. In a letter dated 15 January 2009, the Government responded to the communication sent on 
31 October 2008. The Government reported that neither the Ministry of Interior, nor the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had prior information regarding this case. The Government also noted that 
neither Ms. Nasser Amin, nor Mr. Hammad Wadi has filed a complaint to the Ministry of 
Interior or the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office that they have received such threats. The Ministry of 
Interior took note of the aforementioned &#8220;Middle East Mujahedeen in Cairo&#8221; group and is 
carrying out investigations regarding its existence.

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>855. In a letter dated 11 April 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 11 October 2007. The Government reported that Ahmad Mus`ad Subih and Mohamed 
Ramadan al-Durayni were arrested on the basis of a warrant issued by the Higher State Security 
Prosecution Service for giving press interviews in which they alleged falsely that prisoners were </p>

</p>
<p>physically abused in prison, in addition to disseminating ideas contradicting and disparaging the 
fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. The above-mentioned persons were presented to the 
Office of the Higher State Security Prosecutor and charged in Supreme State Security case 
No. 1061/2007 with disseminating false and tendentious statements and information, making 
provocative claims designed to cause a public disturbance and damage the public interest, 
disparaging the Islamic faith and spreading ideas contrary to the true faith and its precepts. They 
admitted the charges and the Office of the Prosecutor gave orders for them to be placed in 
custody pending further investigations. When the two accused were brought back to the Office of 
the Prosecutor again, the Office ordered the release of Ahmad Subih, on 10 November 2007, and 
that of Mohamed al-Durayni on 30 November 2007; the orders of the Office were executed.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>864. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
government concerning Misses Yalemzawd Bekele, Adane Shewa Megenta, and Alemayehu 
Fantu Woldeyes. Ms. Yalemzawd Bekele is a lawyer working on projects related to human rights 
and civil society for the European Commission&#8217;s office in Addis Ababa, and a prominent civil 
rights lawyer who volunteered with the Ethiopian Women Lawyers&#8217; Association (EWLA), 
Addis Ababa. Ms. Bekele was the subject of an urgent appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 23 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>865. According to new information received, since 15 January 2008 Ms. Yalemzawd Bekele, 
Adane Shewa Megenta, and Alemayehu Fantu Woldeyes were being tried before the Federal 
High Court on the charge of participating in one of the most serious political offences in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 155 
 
</p>
<p>Ethiopia, under Article 32(1)(a) and 257(a) of the Revised criminal code of Ethiopia. The basis 
of this charge, which carries a punishment up to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment, was her alleged 
possession and distribution in September 2006 of a Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) 
&#8220;calendar of civil disobedience&#8221; circulating in Moyale town in September 2006. The calendar 
reportedly advocated solely non-violent civic action.  
</p>
<p>866. On 19 October 2006, Ms. Bekele was arrested at Moyale at the Ethiopian border with 
Kenya when she tried to cross the border through the official border post. She was arrested on 
the basis of a police warrant issued earlier in Addis Ababa in relation to police investigations 
into the CUD calendar. She was taken to court in Moyale, then transferred to Addis Ababa the 
next day and held in the Central Police Investigation Bureau known as Maikelawi. She was not 
taken to court again, but transferred for interrogation on 27 October 2006 to the Woreda 
(District) 8 police station, where over 100 CUD detainees were also held there in connection 
with the CUD calendar. She was reportedly arrested on the basis of a &#8220;confession&#8221; obtained 
under torture by one of these detainees. She was later released on the same day unharmed and 
unconditionally. On 25 October 2007, she was summoned to appear in court. 
</p>
<p>867. Concern was expressed that the charge against Ms. Yalemzawd Bekele, Adane Shewa 
Megenta, and Alemayehu Fantu Woldeyes could be linked to their non-violent activities in 
defence of human rights in Ethiopia. Further concern was expressed that Ms. Yalemzawd 
Bekele, Adane Shewa Megenta, and Alemayehu Fantu Woldeyes could not enjoy a fair trial. 
<b>Observations

<p>868. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at, the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 17 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>869. On 17 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to 
the Government in relation to concerns about the restrictions to the effectiveness of human rights 
organizations in Ethiopia that might result from the adoption and implementation of the draft law 
&#8220;Charities and Societies Proclamation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>870. According to information received, there were concerns that the Charities and Societies 
Proclamation (hereinafter &#8220;the Proclamation&#8221;) would result in an excessive control of the 
activities of civil society organizations (CSO) by the Government. The Proclamation had a 
narrow definition of Ethiopian CSOs whereby if any of a CSO&#8217;s members were foreign or more 
than ten per cent of its funding came from foreign sources the CSO would be classed as foreign 
and would therefore face the same restrictions which would be placed on foreign 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) under the Proclamation. These restrictions included 
prohibition from work in certain fields, including human rights, unless the NGO in question was 
chosen as an exception by the government. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 156 
 
</p>
<p>871. A taskforce of CSO representatives brought concerns about the Proclamation to the 
attention of the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister in meetings held on 6 May and 
24 May 2008, respectively. While the Government of Ethiopia was encouraged to engage in 
regular consultations with CSOs, particularly on draft laws affecting them, concerns were 
expressed at the provisions of the draft Proclamation. 
</p>
<p>872. In particular, concern was expressed about provisions in the Proclamation, which 
threatened to curtail freedom of association and freedom of expression in Ethiopia by 
introducing penalties of up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment for attending meetings of unregistered 
NGOs or disseminating information in the interests of unregistered charities.  
</p>
<p>873.  Under the Proclamation the Government would be at liberty to decide whether NGOs 
should be legally registered or not through the Charities and Societies Agency (CSA), a body 
which would be established with the adoption of the Proclamation. The CSA would be 
accountable to the Ministry of Justice; its Director would be appointed by the Prime Minister 
after being nominated by the Minister for Justice; and its Deputy Directors would be appointed 
by the Minister for Justice after being nominated by the Director. Only NGOs registered under 
the CSA would be allowed to operate. NGOs recognized within the existing legislation would 
have to re-register and would possibly run the risk of not being granted registration by the CSA. 
Concern was also expressed that the CSA would have the authority to appoint and dismiss NGO 
officials while the Proclamation would remove the right of NGOs to appeal the decisions of the 
CSA in an independent court. NGOs would also be obliged to inform the CSA of any meetings 
with at least a week&#8217;s notice. The CSA would then be allowed to send an investigator to 
participate and report, search the property of organizations and confiscate documents without a 
warrant, thus breaching the right to privacy of the NGOs.  
</p>
<p>874. Further concern was expressed at the position taken by the Prime Minister, who reportedly 
stated that rules against foreign NGOs, foreign contributions to local organizations and the 
participation of foreign NGOs in areas such as human rights were a way of protecting Ethiopia 
against foreign intervention.  
</p>
<p>875. Concern was expressed that the Charities and Societies Proclamation would restrict the 
legitimate work of Ethiopian CSOs and NGOs and international NGOs, including work in the 
defense of human rights. The Government of Ethiopia was therefore urged to consider revising 
the draft in compliance with international norms, standards and recommendations.

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 157 
 
</p>
<p>878. According to information received, on 4 August 2008 staff members at Awramba Times 
received two separate phone warnings, allegedly from senior police officials, demanding an end 
to reporting on &#8216;anti-constitutional organizations.&#8217; The warning referred to the newspaper&#8217;s 
extensive coverage of the activities of Ginbot 7, a new party based in the Netherlands and headed 
by leading opposition figure Mr. Berhanu Nega. On 29 July 2008, an article was published in 
Awramba Times revealing Ginbot 7&#8217;s alleged plan to launch a radio programme which will 
broadcast into Ethiopia via satellite and the Internet.

<p>881. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding 
Mr. Russell Hunter, publisher of the Fiji Sun newspaper. According to the information received, 
on 26 February Mr. Russell Hunter, an Australian national, was removed from Fiji after being 
arrested the day before by men who claimed to be officials of the Immigration Department. He 
was subsequently declared a security risk and prohibited immigrant. The office of the Minister of 
Defense and Immigration reportedly issued a statement claiming that Mr. Hunter had acted in a 
manner that was &#8220;prejudicial to the peace, defense, public safety, public order, security and 
stability of the sovereign state of the Fiji Islands&#8221;. Prior to Mr. Hunter&#8217;s arrest and removal, the

arrested and detained by the police as they stood peacefully at the seawall opposite the Chinese 
Embassy at Nasese Road, Suva Point, Queen Elizabeth Drive in Suva. The protest was organized 
in connection with the current events in the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. 
</p>
<p>885. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned twelve human

</p>
<p>888. According to information received, on 10 August 2008, Ms. Serafina Salaitoga was 
arrested by eight police officers at her home in Labasa, in the presence of her children. 
Ms. Salaitoga, who is pregnant, was reportedly taken away and interrogated at length in a local 
police station. Ms. Salaitoga was released from custody later the same day. The day prior to her 
arrest, an article written by Ms. Salaitoga and published in the Fiji times, quoted businessman 
Mr. Charan Jeath Singh as criticising Finance Minister Mr. Mahandra Chaudhry. On 
2 August 2008, Mr. Isaac Lal was arrested by Crime Investigation Officers (CID) at his home, 
and brought to the local police station for questioning. Mr. Lal was reportedly interrogated for a 
period of approximately six hours in relation to an article he had written which quotes a police 
spokesperson as linking an alleged offender, to a suspected plot to assassinate national leaders. 
The police spokeswoman on the case reportedly complained about being quoted in Mr. Lal&#8217;s

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 1 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>892. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the situation of 
Mr. Yaya Dampha, a journalist who worked for the Gambian newspaper Forayya and 
investigated cases of enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and other human rights 
violations. On 6 October 2007, Mr. Dampha was arrested for &#8220;espionage&#8221;, and was conditionally 
released six days later. Continuous threats against him and his family reportedly from agents of 
the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) forced Mr. Dampha to seek refuge in Senegal. 
Mr. Dampha was the subject of a joint allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 11 October 2007.  
</p>
<p>893. According to the information received, on 10 March 2008 two members of NIA reportedly 
visited in Senegal the residential complex where the flat of Mr. Dampha is located, and asked his 
neighbours where he was. Mr. Dampha then approached the two men who invited him to follow 
them immediately in order to discuss &#8220;an urgent matter&#8221;. Facing the refusal of Mr. Dampha, a 
third agent was called to force him to enter a car without any license plate. Screams of protest 
and requests for help from Mr. Dampha alerted the neighbours and people quickly gathered 
around the vehicle. The three NIA agents then fled the scene. 
</p>
<p>894. On 11 March 2008, members of the National Intelligence Office of Senegal (Bureau 
national de renseignement du S&#233;n&#233;gal) reportedly invited Mr. Dampha to file a complaint, and 
told him that an investigation on this incident will be conducted. 
</p>
<p>895. Concern was expressed that the attempt to abduct Mr. Dampha in Senegal as well as the 
acts of harassment against him and his family which reportedly forced him to flee Gambia may 
be linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 14 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>897. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the situation of 
Fatou Jaw Manneh, a Gambian journalist who has been living in the USA for the past decade. 
</p><p>898. According to information received, Ms. Manneh returned to Gambia for her father&#8217;s 
funeral in March 2007. It was reported that she was arrested by officers of the National 
Intelligence Agency (NIA) upon her arrival in the country on 28 March and accused of sedition, 
for an article she published in the now-banned newspaper &#8220;The Independent&#8221; in June 2004 - 
article which was posted on the US-based &#8220;AllGambian.net&#8221; website in October 2005, in which 
she accused President Yahya Jammeh of &#8220;tearing our beloved country to shreds&#8221;, calling him a 
&#8220;bundle of terror&#8221;. After her arrest, Ms. Manneh was detained for one week, without access to a </p>

</p>
<p>lawyer and her family, after which she was released on bail; however, her travel documents were 
confiscated, preventing her to return to the USA. On 4 April 2007, Ms. Manneh appeared before 
a court in Kanifing, and was charged under the criminal code with &#8220;intention to commit 
sedition&#8221;, &#8220;publication of seditious words&#8221; and &#8220;publication of false news intended to cause 
public fear and alarm to the Gambian public&#8221;. It is reported that if found guilty of the charges 
brought against her, Ms. Manneh faces a maximum of 6 years in prison. Several hearings were 
held since then, the latest on 17 March 2008. At this last hearing, the trial magistrate 
Judge Buba Jawo indicated that he did not have Ms. Manneh&#8217;s file before him and adjourned the 
case indefinitely.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>900. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Mr. Saba Tsitsikashvili, a journalist and HRIDC coordinator for the Shida Kartli region of 
Georgia. According to the information received, on 1 September 2008 Mr. Tsitsikashvili was 
covering a demonstration in Karaleti village, Shida Kartli region, when he was physically and 
verbally assaulted by several high-ranking officials. Mr. Lado Vardzelashvili, the Governor of 
Shida Kartli and Mr. Zurab Chinchilakashvili, the Deputy Governor grabbed him and threatened 
him with disappearance if he continued his activities. After this verbal abuse two unknown 
persons appeared and beat his ribs and legs. Afterwards he was again beaten near the car of the 
Governor of Gori District, Mr. Davit Khmiadashvili, in the presence of the Deputy District 
Governor, Mr. Giorgi Kvitsinadze. 
</p>
<p>901. Concern was expressed that the physical and verbal harassment of Mr. Tsitsikashvili may 
be solely connected to his peaceful activities in the defence of human rights. Further concern was 
expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Tsitsikashvili. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>902. In a letter dated 22 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteurs on 8 September 2008. The Government assured that it is fully aware 
of obligations incumbent upon it by the Declaration on human rights defenders. The 
Government noted that it deemed the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Tsitsikashvili is 
of utmost importance and that it is at the same time cognizant of his rights to freedom of 
expression and the right to pursue his activities as a journalist. The Government reported that on 
5 October 2008, the Gori District Unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia initiated 
an investigation into the alleged unlawful interference in the journalistic activity of 
Mr. Tsitsikashvili, a crime sanctioned in Article 154 of the Criminal Code of Georgia. The 
Government also noted that Mr. Tsitsikashvili has never applied to the police concerning the 
facts mentioned in the communication, and the investigation was launched in response to the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 161 
 
</p>
<p>letter received from the Office of the Public Defender (Ombudsman) of Georgia. In the course of 
the investigation Mr. Tsitsikashvili was interrogated as a victim and other investigative activities 
are being carried out. The Government also noted that it will provide further updated information 
on the developments of the case.

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 20 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>904. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the situation of 
Mr. Dariusz Bohatkiewicz, a reporter and Mr. Marcin Wesolowski, a cameraman working with 
the Polish television station &#8220;Telewizja Polska&#8221; (TVP), and Mr. Levan Guliashvili, a Georgian 
national and driver employed by TVP. 
</p>
<p>905. According to information received, on 8 September 2008 when Mr. Dariusz Bohatkiewicz, 
Mr. Marcin Wesolowski, and their driver, Mr. Levan Guliashvili, tried to enter the buffer zone 
between South Ossetia and Georgia to cover an expected Russian troop withdrawal, they were 
prevented from entering the village by Russian troops stationed at a checkpoint when they failed 
to produce press accreditation issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Following this, when they 
tried an alternative route, at approximately 4 p.m., they were arrested near the village of Karaleti 
by members of a unit claiming to be from the South Ossetian police. They took the crew by car 
to an unknown location, where they questioned them for approximately three hours. They then 
transferred them to the South Ossetian regional capital, Tskhinvali, where they detained them 
overnight. The crew&#8217;s equipment and cell phones were confiscated. One of the crew members 
reportedly managed to send a text message to TVP&#8217;s Tbilisi office before his phone was seized, 
saying that they had been detained and that they were not being mistreated. On 9 September, 
Mr. Dariusz Bohatkiewicz, Mr. Marcin Wesolowski, and Mr. Levan Guliashvili were released 
from detention and transferred to the custody of Russian peacekeepers who subsequently turned 
them over to Georgian authorities and Polish diplomats. Their equipment and car was returned to 
them undamaged. 
</p>
<p>906. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt by 
authorities operating in South Ossetia to prevent independent reporting in the region, following 
the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>907. In a letter dated 27 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteurs on 20 October 2008: The Government noted that it fully commits 
itself to the relevant human rights and humanitarian law obligation incumbent upon the State of 
Georgia in form of relevant international instruments as well as customary international law. 
Against this background, the Government informed it has taken relevant measures in order to 
investigate any allegations of human rights and humanitarian law violations that has taken place 
in the course of Russia&#8217;s invasion and subsequent occupation of the parts of the territory of 
Georgia. In that respect, the Investigative Unit of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Georgia 
initiated investigation into the facts of violation of the rules of international humanitarian law </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 162 
 
</p>
<p>committed in course of an armed conflict on the territory of Georgia, the crime envisaged under 
article 411 of the Criminal Code of Georgia. The investigation covers all relevant incidents and 
alleged facts of human rights abuses committed in armed conflict. The Government noted that 
the fact mentioned in the letter had not been brought to the attention of the Georgian law 
enforcement authorities. The information contained in the letter would serve as the basis for 
carrying out specific investigative measures into the aforementioned facts.

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>909. In a letter dated 28 February 2008, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
of 13 November 2007. The Government reported that about the facts that took place on 
2 November 2007, and with especial regard to the bodily injuries inflicted upon several persons 
as a result of the activities occurred. While the investigation is underway, 12 people were 
detained, 5 of then were treated at the hospitals and the remaining were held for various 
violations of law. 
</p>
<p>910. In a letter dated 28 February 2008, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 13 November 2007. In its reply, the Government informed that &#8220;the incident on 
7 November 2007 represented part of the chain of event that developed since the beginning of 
November 2007 in Geogia. Therefore, the measures taken were aimed at restoring the public 
order and responding to the national security concerns existing within the country in the course 
of the existing situation&#8221;. The Government informed that it acted in accordance with the 
international norms and standards that govern the limitation of certain rights and freedoms as 
well as situation of national emergency. It stated that Georgia, as a party to the ICCPR, has 
abided to the rules and procedures emanating from the aforementioned treaty. The Government 
also provided a detailed account of the events of 7 November 2007. In addition, the Government 
explained the circumstances that led to the declaration of the state of emergency, explaining that 
the situation in the capital was &#8220;extremely tense and constituted a threat to the well being of the 
nation&#8221;. The Government added that &#8220;the decision was motivated by the attempted <i>coup d&#8217;&#233;tat</i> 
that threatened the life of the nation. In order to deter the threat and due to the necessity to avoid 
further disturbances in the country and ensure restoration of the rule of law and effective 
functioning of the government institutions certain constitutional rights of the citizens were 
restricted by the Presidential Decree No. 1 of the Measures to be Taken in relation to the State of 
Emergency Declared in the Whole Territory of Georgia. In particular, the limitations have been 
imposed on the enjoyment of the rights under Article 24 (Freedom of Expression), Article 25 
(Freedom of Assembly and Manifestation) and Article 33 (Right to Strike) of the Constitution of 
Georgia&#8221;. The Government stated that the decision on the declaration of the State of Emergency 
and the specific measures undertaken thereafter were taken in full conformity with the 
Georgian legislation and the margin of appreciation given by Article 4 of ICCPR and Article 15 
of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The 
Government also provided information regarding the investigations into the alleged physical 
insult upon the Ombudsman of Georgia, which was ongoing at the time of the response. In 
addition, the Government provided information concerning investigations into the physical abuse 
of protesters on 7 November 2007, which was also ongoing at the time of the reply. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 25 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>912. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance, sent a letter of allegations 
to the Government concerning Mr. Panayote Dimitras, spokesperson for the Greek Helsinki 
Monitor and a member of the OMCT Assembly of Delegates, Ms. Andrea Gilbert, GHM&#8217;s 
specialist on anti-Semitism, and Messrs. Moses Konstantinis, Benjamin Albala, Abraham Reitan 
and Leon Gavriilidis, four members of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece 
(Kentriko Israilitiko Symvoulio - KIS). 
</p>
<p>913. According to information received, all of the aforementioned testified against 
Mr. Kostas Plevris on 4 December 2007 during a trial against him and the extreme-right 
newspaper Eleftheros Kosmos which had published articles from Mr. Plevirs&#8217; anti-Semitic book 
entitled The Jews - The whole truth. In the book, Mr. Plevris reportedly alleges that &#8220;Jews are 
sub-human, mortal enemies and worthy of the firing squad&#8221;, that &#8220;Hitler is only criticized for not 
clearing Europe of the Jews&#8221; and that &#8220;[Auschwitz] is rightly preserved in good condition, 
because nobody knows what might happen in the future&#8221;. Mr. Plevris was convicted of 
&#8216;incitation to racial violence and hatred and for racial insult&#8217; and was reportedly given 
a 14-month suspended sentence. 
</p>
<p>914. Following the trial on 4 December, Mr. Dimitras was verbally abused by a journalist who 
reportedly tried to assault him. Later that evening, a video showing the attempted assault was 
uploaded on the internet with messages inciting viewers to take action against Mr. Dimitras. 
Threatening messages have also been found on fora linked to extremist right movements in 
Greece. Mr. Plevris has also reportedly taken legal action against the aforementioned, accusing 
them of defamation. Further complaints have been filed by Mr. Plevris against GHM and NGOs 
in general reportedly claiming they are redundant, illegal and implying they are foreign agents. It 
is alleged that these complaints again contain racist and defamatory comments; however trial 
dates have reportedly been set for later in 2008. 
</p>
<p>915. Concern was expressed that the harassment of the aforementioned, the threats made against 
them and the judicial proceedings initiated, may be directly linked to their human rights 
activities, particularly their activities against discrimination and anti-semitism in Greece. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>916. On 18 April 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 25 January 2008. 
The Government emphasized that Mr. K. Plevris was sentenced to fourteen months of 
imprisonment by the Court of Appeals of Athens, with suspension, on the grounds that he 
&#8220;publicly and intentionally incited, through the press, the commission of acts and activities 
conducive to discrimination, hatred and violence against persons and groups of persons, on the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 164 
 
</p>
<p>sole basis of their racial and national origin, while at the same time he expressed ideas which are 
insulting against a group of persons due to their racial and national origin, namely the Jews&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>917. According to the Government, the sentence was in conformity with the Greek Constitution. 
In addition, Law No 927 of 1979 criminalizes acts or activities aiming at racial discrimination, in 
implementation of both the relevant constitutional provisions as well as of the relevant 
international obligations of the country, particularly those deriving from the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination and the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In the case against Mr. Plevris, the Government emphasized 
that the prosecution for anti-Semitic propaganda took place proprio motu in application of the 
provisions of the said law, which criminalizes acts or activities aiming at racial discrimination, as 
amended, in order to provide for proprio motu prosecution, without any need for individual 
complaints. There was no information with regard to Mr. Dimitras&#8217; claims about verbal attack 
and threats against him as described in the urgent appeal, as no relevant complaint has been filed 
to the Greek Authorities. Furthermore, Mr. Plevris, who has been sentenced to fourteen months 
of imprisonment, with suspension, has filed two lawsuits and has also lodged complaints in order 
to restore the moral damage which he claims to have suffered due to the alleged malicious 
defamation of his person by Mr. P. Dimitras and others as mentioned on your letter, on the basis 
that they testified against him in the above mentioned trial as well as because, as he claims, they 
systematically and publicly support views in a manner which constitutes an insult against his 
personality. The government emphasized that these cases are pending. 
</p>
<p>918. The first lawsuit was filed in January 2007 against Mr. Moses Konstantinis, 
Mr. Benjamin Albala, Mr. Abraham Reitan, Mr. Leon Gavriilidis, Mrs. Andrea Helen Gilbert 
and Mr. Panayote Dimitras. This case was to be discussed on January 24th 2008, but the court 
decided not to go ahead with the case. The second lawsuit was filed on 25th of January 2007 
against Mr. Panayote Dimitras and the Greek Helsinki Monitor. This case was to be discussed on 
February 7th 2008, but at the court house only the plaintiff was present, the defendants did not 
appear and a request for postponement was filed. This case is now to be tried on 
October 10th 2009. 
</p>
<p>919. The Government reiterated that it is the right of any Greek citizen to launch judicial 
proceedings and this cannot in any way be considered as a judicial harassment. The same right 
applies both to Mr. Dimitras and to Mr. Plevris.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>921. On 29 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning Mr. Makis Nodaros, a journalist and human rights defender. Mr. Nodaros works for 
the Athens daily Eleftherotypia, the Patras daily Imera, and the Patras TV station Teletime, and 
the Patras radio station Radio Gamma, and he is host of the daily programme of the Elia radio 
station Ionian FM. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 165 
 
</p>
<p>922. According to the information received, on 23 October 2008, Mr. Makis Nodaros was 
attacked by unidentified men as he was returning home after his morning radio show. 
Two individuals attacked him and beat him until he fell down and started bleeding. They also 
stole his mobile phone and tried to break his laptop. The assailants later fled on a motorcycle. 
Mr. Makis Nodaros published several articles recently exposing corruption and mismanagement 
of relief aid received by local authorities for victims of the forest fires of 2007. He also wrote 
articles about an alleged corruption case involving the mayor of Zacharo. 
</p>
<p>923. Concern was expressed that the assault on Mr. Nodaros could have been related to his 
work in defence of human rights, especially his articles about alleged corruption and 
mismanagement cases involving local officials and authorities. Further concern was expressed 
that the aforementioned events may have represented a direct attempt to prevent independent 
reporting in Greece, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>924. In a letter dated 9 December 2008, the Government responded to the urgent appeal. The 
Government stated that according to Mr. Nodaros&#8217;s deposition to the Police Authorities, the 
two perpetrators of the attack against him were waiting for him outside his home address on 
23 October 2008 and, after making sure of his identity, they attacked him, although not 
provoked, by fists and kicks, causing him bodily injuries (art. 308 A&#8217; of the Penal Code). During 
the incident and as a result of it, Mr. Nodaros dropped his laptop and his mobile phone, which 
were subsequently taken by the perpetrators (art. 372 of the Penal Code) who left the scene by 
motorcycle. Immediately after the incident Mr. Nodaros went to the Health Centre of Gastouni 
where he was examined by doctors. It was found that he had suffered scratches on his elbow, his 
knee and the hair part of his head. After he was treated accordingly, he left the hospital. 
</p>
<p>925. The Police Station of Lechaina became involved in the case as soon as it was notified and 
started inquiries together with the Sub-Directorate for Public Safety of Pyrgos and the Security 
Division of Amaliada under the supervision of high-ranking officers of the competent Police 
Directorate. A preliminary investigation was also initiated by the Sub-Directorate for Public 
Safety of Pyrgos under the monitoring and supervision of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of 
Amaliada. Both investigations for substantiating the facts of the case and finding the perpetrators 
are under way, but no conclusive result has bee reached so far. The two perpetrators have not 
been identified yet. All possible aspects are under investigation, since all allegations concerning 
journalists, whether human rights defenders or not, are of particular importance. 
</p><p>926. According to Mr. Nodaros, the assault on him is related to a story he had published in the 
newspaper he is working for, concerning illegal construction activities in the &#8220;KAIAFA&#8221; forest 
of Zacharo. Apart from that, however, the police authorities are also investigating a possible 
connection to some other cases that Mr. Nodaros&#8217;s research had brought to the surface. These 
cases include alleged corruption of public servants, issues concerning environmental protection 
etc. that may have led some people to commit the aforementioned acts. 
</p>
<p>927. The letter expressed the Greek authorities&#8217; intention to look, in depth and to the extent 
possible, into the case under discussion since they attach the utmost importance in upholding the 
provisions of the Greek Constitution and the respective Laws as well as those arising from 
relevant international obligations of the country. </p>

(Sindicato de Trabajadores Bananeros del Sur), que habr&#237;a sido asesinado en el pueblo de 
El Semillero, departamento de Escuintla, a unos 150 kil&#243;metros de la Ciudad de Guatemala. 
Quiero tambi&#233;n expresar mi preocupaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas en contra de otros 
sindicalistas de SITRABANSUR. El sindicato SITRABANSUR fue creado por trabajadores del 
sector bananero en julio de 2007 para negociar un convenio colectivo. 
</p><p>930. Seg&#250;n los informes, los propietarios de la plantaci&#243;n no pagar&#237;an el salario m&#237;nimo, ni 
tampoco la seguridad social y otras contribuciones. El 20 de noviembre de 2007, todos los 
miembros fundadores del sindicato, incluidos sus dirigentes y sus familias, habr&#237;an sido 
despedidos de sus empleos y desalojados de sus casas, al parecer a consecuencia de sus 
actividades sindicales. Los Sres. Germ&#225;n Aguilar Brego, Alberto L&#243;pez P&#233;rez y V&#237;ctor Manuel 
G&#243;mez habr&#237;an denunciado que, el d&#237;a anterior, hab&#237;an recibido una amenaza de muerte de un

habr&#237;an estado acechando cerca de la casa del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez. Cuando &#233;ste regres&#243; a su 
casa, habr&#237;an abierto fuego contra &#233;l. El Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;a entrado corriendo en la casa 
y habr&#237;a tratado de escapar por la puerta trasera. Uno de los hombres lo habr&#237;a seguido, mientras 
el otro habr&#237;a rodeado la casa para interceptarlo y lo habr&#237;a arrojado al suelo. El Sr. Ram&#237;rez 
Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;a tratado de huir, pero le dispararon por la espalda. Luego le habr&#237;an disparado 
varias veces m&#225;s, mientras yac&#237;a herido en el suelo. Habr&#237;a muerto unas dos horas despu&#233;s en el 
hospital. Los informes iniciales indican que su cad&#225;ver presentaba cuatro heridas de bala y al 
menos una de arma blanca. 
</p>
<p>932. Los familiares del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez habr&#237;an declarado que, unos 15 d&#237;as antes de ser 
asesinado, habr&#237;a dicho que los gestores de la plantaci&#243;n le hab&#237;an ofrecido dinero para que 
dimitiera de su cargo en SITRABANSUR. Tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a dicho que hab&#237;a recibido amenazas 
de muerte telef&#243;nicas. 
</p>
<p>933. Otros miembros del Comit&#233; Ejecutivo de SITRABANSUR habr&#237;an sufrido intimidaci&#243;n. 
El 29 de febrero, el Sr. V&#237;ctor Manuel G&#243;mez Mendoza habr&#237;a informado que unos hombres </p>

vigilando su casa. Durante la noche del 8 de marzo, unos intrusos habr&#237;an entrado en su casa, 
pero el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez y su familia habr&#237;an logrado escapar. 
</p>
<p>934. Se tem&#237;a que el asesinato del Sr. Ram&#237;rez Enr&#237;quez y las amenazas contra los sindicalistas 
de SITRABANSUR estaban relacionados con su labor en defensa de los derechos humanos, en 
particular los derechos de los trabajadores del sector bananero. Estos hechos, de ser confirmados, 
se enmarcan en el cuadro de gran inseguridad y riesgo que constatado por la Representante

<p>972. Recordamos que el 20 de mayo de 2008, el Juez Cojul&#250;n habr&#237;a anunciado p&#250;blicamente 
que hab&#237;a recibido amenazas por tel&#233;fono. Los que le amenazaron le habr&#237;an instado para que 
dejara su trabajo con la Audiencia Nacional Espa&#241;ola. El Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n habr&#237;a 
recibido estas amenazas poco despu&#233;s de haber presentado una denuncia en la que pidi&#243; 
investigaciones respecto de personas e instituciones se&#241;aladas en los testimonios de v&#237;ctimas del 
conflicto armado interno de Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>973. Se manifest&#243; preocupaci&#243;n respecto de la decisi&#243;n de retirar los escoltas del Juez Jos&#233; 
Eduardo Cojul&#250;n a pesar de las amenazas en su contra. Asimismo, se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n que 
dichas amenazas en contra del Juez Cojul&#250;n podr&#237;an estar directamente relacionadas con sus 
actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular con las investigaciones de 
genocidio, torturas, asesinatos y detenciones ilegales durante el conflicto armado en Guatemala. 
En vista de lo aqu&#237; resumido, se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del 
Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n. </p>

<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>974. Mediante carta fechada 23 de julio de 2008, el Gobierno contest&#243; el llamamiento urgente. 
A trav&#233;s de esta carta, la Comisi&#243;n Presidencial Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en 
Materia de Derechos Humanos (COPREDEH) afirm&#243; que, seg&#250;n informaci&#243;n divulgada por 
los medios de comunicaci&#243;n social, espec&#237;ficamente el diario matutino Prensa Libre, el 
Juez Eduardo Cojul&#250;n S&#225;nchez hab&#237;a denunciado las amenazas de muerte que hab&#237;a recibido. La 
COPREDEH tambi&#233;n comunic&#243; que se estaba coordinando con las autoridades correspondientes 
para que se restituya la seguridad del Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n S&#225;nchez y se garanticen sus 
derechos humanos mediante los mecanismos nacionales de protecci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>975. Mediante otra carta fechada 28 de agosto de 2008, la COPREDEH confirm&#243; que los 
hechos de los que ten&#237;a conocimiento coincid&#237;an con los del llamamiento urgente. Seg&#250;n la 
Fiscal&#237;a de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico, dicha Fiscal&#237;a se aperson&#243; ante 
Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n S&#225;ndhcez, quien manifest&#243; que no iba a dar informaci&#243;n de dicha 
situaci&#243;n a ninguno y que no desea presentar denuncia. Por tal circunstancia no hay denuncia 
presentada ante los Tribunales correspondientes. 
</p>
<p>976. Respecto al retiro de los escoltas del Juez Cojul&#250;n, la carta afirm&#243; que el Licenciado Jos&#233; 
Eduardo Cojul&#250;n S&#225;nchez goza de seguridad personalizada desde enero de 2007 hasta la fecha, 
por orden del entonces Director General de la PNC. Por lo tanto el Estado de Guatemala informa 
que el Estado no ha retirado los escoltas del Juez Cojul&#250;n y que a&#250;n sigue contando con 
seguridad proporcionada por el Estado.

Tambi&#233;n la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de derechos humanos y el

urgente a su Gobierno el 27 de mayo de 2008 en relaci&#243;n con amenazas de muerte contra el

los integrantes de la FAFG siguieran estando amenazados desde hace varios a&#241;os sin que se 
hayan procesado o condenado a los responsables de las amenazas. Adem&#225;s se aleg&#243; que la

</p>
<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>981. Mediante cartas fechadas 19 de septiembre de 2008, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento

recibidas por el Sr. Jos&#233; Suasnavar entre el 27 y 29 de julio de 2008, enviados a su tel&#233;fono

</p>
<p>982. La carta comunic&#243; que el 13 de agosto de 2008, se sostuvo en la sede la Comisi&#243;n

Activistas de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico en la cual la victima manifest&#243; su 
preocupaci&#243;n por el hermetismo del Ministerio P&#250;blico sobre las investigaciones de las 
amenazas en contra la Fundaci&#243;n de Antropolog&#237;a Forense de Guatemala (FAFG) - 24 en total - 
desde el 2002. Se inform&#243; que el Ministerio se han solicitado los desplegados telef&#243;nicos a la 
Empresa telef&#243;nica, TELGUA, para determinar de d&#243;nde se han generado las llamadas, pero es 
imposible establecer la identidad de qui&#233;n adquirieron los celulares pre pago. 
</p>
<p>983. La carta inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos otorg&#243; 
Medidas Provisionales a favor de los miembros de la Fundaci&#243;n de Antropolog&#237;a Forense de 
Guatemala en 2006, mismas que son implementadas a trav&#233;s del Misterio de Gobernaci&#246;n quien 
inform&#243; que la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil ha asignado 24 agentes para brindar la seguridad de los 
miembros de la FAFG, por lo tanto el Sr. Jos&#233; Suasnavar es beneficiario de dichas medidas de

ejecutados con un disparo en la cara y dos tiros de gracia dados en la parte de atr&#225;s de la cabeza. 
</p><p>987. Se aleg&#243; que los asesinatos de los Sres. Eliazar Hern&#225;ndez, Mario G&#225;mez y Juan Navarro 
podr&#237;an estar relacionados con sus actividades para disuadir a los j&#243;venes de unirse a las

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 21 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1006. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the suspension of CNS 
Channel 6. According to the information received, on 12 April 2008, CNS Channel 6 was 
suspended for four-months on the President&#8217;s orders on the grounds that it &#8220;infringed the terms 
of its licence&#8221; after it aired, on three occasions, a call-in by a viewer calling for the President&#8217;s 
assassination. CNS reportedly suspended the airing of this comment after it received a warning 
from the Advisory Committee on Broadcasting (ACB) and its Director subsequently issued a 
public apology for the incident. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 179 
 
</p>
<p>1007. While condemning the threatening statements made by said viewer, concern was 
expressed that the suspension of CNS Channel 6 could characterize an undue limitation to the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the related right to freedom of the press. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>1008. In a letter dated 30 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteurs on 21 April 2008, providing the following information: 
</p>
<p>1009. &#8220;The Government of Guyana concurs that as Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, you are charged with responsibility 
to seek clarification on all cases brought to your attention and that you are expected to report on 
those cases to the UN Human Rights Council. It is therefore in view of these responsibilities and 
the concomitant obligations to be fair and transparent that the Government expresses its extreme 
surprise and profound reservations that, while you were awaiting a formal response from the 
Government of Guyana, you have publicly, at the international level, issued statements that 
clearly indicate that you have prejudged the matter. 
</p><p>1010. Your extremely prejudicial comments were made and internationally circulated in your 
Statement released on May 2, 2008 on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day. You have 
therein identified the suspension of CNS Channel 6 as an example of Governments&#8217; exploitation 
of regulations and as an example of subtle tactics of Governments that &#8220;severely restrict the 
independence of the press while seemingly allowing States to maintain a fa&#231;ade of respect to 
democratic principles such as freedom of expression&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1011. It is especially alarming that you rush to judgment in favour of CNS Channel 6 before 
allowing yourself to be apprised of the facts and the law concerning this matter. Moreover, an 
official release of the Government of Guyana outlining the relevant facts of the matter has been 
readily available online since April 12. 
</p>
<p>1012. More significantly, the Government puts for your consideration, whether in any part of 
the world, a person will be permitted, without grave sanction, to use the airwaves, a public 
resource, to repeatedly advocate the killing of a Head of State. Would such an act not be viewed 
as treasonable, in any part of the world? And would it not also be the responsibility of the 
Special Rapporteur to denounce such abuse of the airwaves and such seditious acts? 
</p>
<p>1013. Is it not also the obligation of the Special Rapporteur to ascertain whether CNS Channel 
6 is in fact a bona fide media operator deserving of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s precipitous 
denouncement of the suspension? The Proprietor of CNS Channel 6, Mr. Chandranarine Sharma, 
is in fact the leader of a political party in Guyana and has led his party in contesting the two 
General Elections in Guyana. Does this not cast his acts of repeated broadcasts of threats to the 
life of the Head of State in a category of conduct that would cause the Special Rapporteur to 
consider whether the Channel ought to be considered a part of the regular media? 
</p>
<p>1014. The Government of Guyana is confident that when you allow yourself to fully consider 
the matter you will unreservedly retract your statements publicized on May 2 and will proffer an </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 180 
 
</p>
<p>appropriate apology to the Government of Guyana. You will see from the facts outlined below 
that even if the proprietor of CNS Channel 6 could be viewed as unmotivated by political aims, 
his conduct is nevertheless clearly contrary to the law and deserving of serious sanction. The 
facts are as follows: 1. On February 21, 2008, CNS Channel 6 on its &#8220;Voice of the People&#8221; live 
call in programme aired certain comments that advocated the killing of the Head of State, 
along with other offensive comments. The Channel rebroadcast the offending comments on 
three subsequent occasions later on February 21, on February 22 and February 23, 2008. 2. The 
Advisory Committee on Broadcasting (ACB) that was set up by the Wireless Telegraphy 
Regulations, 2001, to advise the Minister on Licensees&#8217; compliance with Licence conditions and 
the relevant law, wrote to CNS Channel 6 on February 26, 2008 citing alleged infringements by 
the licensee by the comments aired on February 21, 2008. The ACB indicated that the broadcast 
constituted an incitement to crime, was offensive to good taste and decency and was presented 
without due accuracy. The ACB afforded the Licensee an opportunity to respond to the charges 
of infringement. The Licensee responded to the ACB on February 28, 2008, expressing regret 
about the content of the broadcast in issue and indicated that he did reprimand the Caller for 
&#8220;making such irresponsible statements on the air&#8221;. The Licensee also apologized for the 
&#8220;unfortunate incident&#8221;. 3. When the ACB became aware that the Licensee had in fact 
re-broadcast the offending statements on three occasions subsequent to the February 21 live 
programme, the ACB again wrote to the Licensee on March 10, 2008, citing alleged 
infringements of the licence and the law on the basis of the offending rebroadcasts. The ACB 
noted that each rebroadcast was deemed a new infringement and that though the first broadcast 
was a spontaneous infringement; the licensee could have and ought to have edited out the 
offending comments before the rebroadcasts were aired. Again, the ACB required the Licensee 
to indicate his position in respect of these further infringements. 4. The Licensee responded on 
March 28, 2008 stating that the programme in question was re-aired on February 21, February 22 
and February 23, 2008 by the &#8220;person who books programmed&#8217; without the knowledge of the 
Licensee. The Licensee expressed regret about the rebroadcasts and indicated that he would 
put in place measures to ensure that such an occurrence was not repeated. 5. On April 2, 2008 
the ACB forwarded to President Bharrat Jagdeo, who holds the Ministerial portfolio for 
Communications, copies of the letters sent to the Licensee and his responses. 6. On 
April 8, 2008, Dr. Roger Luncheon, Head of the Presidential Secretariat and Secretary to the 
Cabinet wrote to the Licensee, on behalf of President Jagdeo indicating that the Minister was of 
the opinion that the Licensee&#8217;s written responses to the ACB were not adequate and that the 
Minister was of the opinion that the infringements were sufficiently grave to warrant cancellation 
or suspension of the Licence. The letter also reminded the License that the relevant law provided 
for the suspension or cancellation of the Licence for the breach or infringement of the conditions 
of the Licence. The Licensee was invited to meet with Dr. Luncheon, on behalf of the Minister 
on Thursday, April 10, 2008 to show cause why the Licence should not be cancelled or 
suspended. The Licensee was also invited to bring his legal or other representative to the 
meeting. 7. Twenty minutes prior to the meeting, the Licensee approached the court for, and 
obtained, an order prohibiting Dr. Luncheon from convening the meeting on the basis that he had 
no authority to do so. 8. In view of the court order, President Jagdeo issued a similar letter to the 
Licensee inviting the Licensee to meet with him on Friday, April 11, 2008. 9. The Licensee 
attended the meeting with his legal counsel and others, and acknowledged that the broadcasts 
infringed the conditions of the licence and the law and he apologised for the infringements. He </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 181 
 
</p>
<p>also stated that the offending comments were rebroadcast &#8220;by the person who books 
programmed&#8221; without the knowledge of the Licensee. 10. The Licensee was found to have failed 
to provide satisfactory explanations as to why the offending comments were repeatedly 
rebroadcast on CNS Channel 6 even after the Licensee recognized that the comments were 
offensive and amounted to infringements of the conditions of the licence and the law and he was 
found to have committed serious infringements of the conditions of the Licence and the law. 
Accordingly, his Licence was suspended for a period of four months. 11. It should also be noted 
that the licensee has approached the court in pursuit of a legal remedy. You will observe that the 
facts of the case differ significantly from the summary contained in your letter. 
</p>
<p>1015. Further information concerning the legal basis of the suspension is as follows: 1. CNS 
Channel 6 is licensed under the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act, Cap 47:01. The 
Licence is subject to the provisions of the Act, the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations and the 
conditions of the Licence. The law provides for the Licensees to adhere to certain standards and 
to ensure that the content of broadcasts comply with the provisions of the Act and Wireless 
Telegraphy Regulations. The law also provides for the cancellation or suspension of a Licence 
where the provisions of the Act, the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations and/or conditions of the 
Licence are infringed. 2. The Licensee was found to have materially infringed the Wireless 
Telegraphy Regulations, 2001 and the conditions of his Licence resulting in suspension of his 
Licence. 3. The licensee was given every opportunity to make representation and to explain the 
broadcasts in accordance with the constitutionally guaranteed right to fairness and in accordance 
with the Rules of Natural Justice. 4. President Bharrat Jagdeo holds the ministerial portfolio for 
communications consistent with the Constitutional provisions that provide that where 
responsibility for a subject area is not specifically assigned to a Minister of Government such 
responsibility resides with the President. President Jagdeo) had to address this matter himself as 
his delegate in the matter was prevented from dealing with the matter by Court Order obtained 
by the Licensee. 5. The relevant Act and Regulations are consistent with international norms and 
standards concerning the right to freedom of expression and opinion. Such rights are also 
enshrined in the Constitution of Guyana in a manner similar to all democratic, Commonwealth 
Sates. It is well established as indeed, Your Excellency recognizes in your letter that &#8220;The right 
to freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities&#8221;. Such 
right to freedom of opinion and expression is facilitated by the Act and the Wireless Telegraphy 
Regulations and the special duties and responsibilities that attach to such rights are prescribed in 
the Act and the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations. The Government of Guyana expects that the 
information given herein will sufficiently clarify your misunderstanding of the matter. The 
Government looks forward to a retraction of the misleading public statements disseminated on 
May 2, 2008.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1016. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1017. On 22 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal in relation to 
Mr. Gordon Moseley, a senior reporter and producer with the privately owned news station, 
WHRM Capitol News, based in Georgetown. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 182 
 
</p>
<p>1018. According to information received, on 13 July 2008, Mr. Moseley was denied access to 
the office of the President following an invitation to cover an award ceremony. Members of the 
security forces reportedly informed Mr. Moseley that the Government Information Agency 
(GINA) had withdrawn his accreditation for assignments to the President&#8217;s office and official 
residence. The accreditation withdrawal was reportedly linked to &#8216;disparaging and disrespectful 
remarks&#8217; which Mr. Moseley had made about the President in a letter which was published in the 
daily Stabroek News on 8 July 2008. In the aforementioned article, Mr. Moseley had responded 
to the President&#8217;s alleged criticism of his coverage of a meeting which the President had with 
Guyanese living on the nearby island of Antigua. 
</p>
<p>1019. According to reports, Mr. Moseley received an official letter from the GINA suggesting 
that the decision to ban him from covering Presidential assignments may be reviewed if 
Mr. Moseley were to issue an apology in relation to the allegedly offensive remarks he made 
against the President. Mr. Moseley has reportedly refused to issue an apology and the ban 
remains in place. 
</p>
<p>1020. Concern was expressed that aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to 
stifle independent reporting in Guyana, thus infringing on freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1021. In a letter dated 17 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
sent by the Special Rapporteurs on 22 July 2008, providing the following information: 
</p>
<p>1022. &#8220;The Government of Guyana holds the view that the facts as alleged in the case of 
Mr. Moseley are inaccurate. The Office of the President and State House, the official residence 
of the President, are open to the public only by invitation or appointment. To enable participation 
to press conferences held at this venue by His Excellency the President and/or officials in the 
office of the President, an established process exists whereby invitation is extended to media 
house, and individually to media practitioners, by the Government Information Agency (GINA). 
In keeping with this practice, both the WRHM Capitol News and Mr. Moseley were accredited 
to attend press conference in the Office of the President and State House. 
</p>
<p>1023. In the case in question, Mr. Mosely&#8217;s accreditation was withdrawn by the competent 
authorities following remarks made in a letter to the press that were considered as disparaging 
and disrespectful to the person and Office of the President. 
</p>
<p>1024. However, the decision is subject to review on the tender of an apology of Mr. Moseley. 
The withdrawal of accreditation does not apply to WRHM Capitol News or to its other 
employees. I have attached, for your perusal, copies of Mr. Moseley s letter of July 9, 2008 and 
of the letter from the Director of GINA advising of the withdrawal of his accreditation. 
</p>
<p>1025. Apart from this restriction, Mr. Moseley is free to enter government premises or attend 
media events hosted by government ministries and agencies. His work as a journalist has not 
been encumbered in any way and his media house continues to cover media events hosted by the 
President and his Officers. In light of the foregoing, the Government of Guyana does not share 
the view that Mr. Gordon Moseley&#8217;s right to freedom of opinion and expression, or his right to 
work as a journalist has been, in any way, curtailed or violated. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 183 
 
</p>
<p>1026. In respect of national legislation related to freedom of expression, I would invite your 
attention to the Constitution of the Republic of Guyana, the supreme law of the land, which, in 
its article 40 enshrines freedom of expression as fundamental right and its article 146 provide for 
the protection of the right to freedom of expression. The Constitution may be consulted at 
www.parliament.gov.gy. 
</p>
<p>1027. The press remains free in Guyana to scrutinise and criticise the Government and does so 
without hesitation. The meetings of five Parliamentarian Standing Committees directly charged 
with oversight and scrutiny of government&#8217;s policy and administration and financial 
accountability are open to the media and the public. These are the Public Accounts Committee, 
the Economic Services Committee, the Social Services Committee, the Foreign Relations 
Committee, and the Natural Resources Committee. 
</p>
<p>1028. It is my Government&#8217;s view that the action taken in this case is such as would apply to 
any other individual whether from the media or otherwise under similarly exceptional 
circumstances. This was an administrative decision taken with the view to upholding respect for 
the office of the President. We believe it to be fully compatible with our obligation under the 
Constitution and relevant human rights instruments to which Guyana is Party. 
</p>
<p>1029. It may be observed that the right to freedom of expression is not absolute, but rather 
circumscribed by various limitations to protect the rights and interests of others and of the 
society as a whole. Article 146 of Guyana&#8217;s Constitution outlines a number of provisions in this 
regard. The Government of Guyana views the actions of Sir Moseley as falling within the 
content and context of Article 146 and as an abuse of the right afforded him under Article 19 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, as well as under the Constitution of Guyana. I would recall that the decision in respect of 
Mr. Moseley is subject to review&#8221;.

<p>1052. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Mr. Lachit Bordoloi, a journalist and a peace activist. Mr. Bordoloi is 
also the adviser of Manab Adhikar Sangram Samiti (MASS), the convener of the Peoples 
Committee for Peace Initiatives in Assam (PCPIA) and a member of the Peoples Consultative 
Group (PCG). 
</p>
<p>1053. According to information received, on the night of 9 February 2008, Mr. Bordoloi&#8217;s 
home in Guwahati was reportedly raided by members of the Guwahati police while he was 
absent. The police seized his laptop and other material without presenting any warrant to his 
family members. On 11 February 2008, police reportedly stopped the bus in which 
Mr. Lachit Bordoloi was returning from a meeting in Tinsukia district to Guwahati, arrested him 
and brought him to the Dibrugargh Police Station. The following day, Mr. Bordoloi was 
transferred to Chandmari police station in Guwahati, and placed on remand there for five days. 
On 18 February, he was remanded in police custody for a further two days by the Chief Judicial 
Magistrate of Kamrup District. He was reportedly charged with &#8220;having a role in fund collecting 
for the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)&#8221;, an active armed group in the State of Assam, 
under the Unlawful Prevention Activities Act and with &#8220;waging war against the State&#8221; under 
sections 120B and 121 of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>1054. On 8-9 February 2008, the police had arrested two supposed ULFA activists and, 
subsequently, police spokespersons had stated that the arrested activists were due to try and 
hijack a plane and that prominent persons were helping them. It is believed that Mr. Bordoloi 
may have been arrested on the basis of a statement given by one of the two detainees. Reports 
suggested that Mr. Bordoloi had been repeatedly threatened, harassed and intimidated by the 
Superintendent of Police (SP) in Nagaon district, Assam, since the former published an article in 
2001 in the Assamese daily Asomiya Protidin. The article highlighted corrupt practices on the 
part of police in Nagaon and led to a high-level departmental inquiry concerning the SP for 
Nagaon. 
</p>
<p>1055. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Lachit Bordoloi may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression through criticism of alleged corruption in the police force of Nagaon. 
Concern was also expressed for his physical and psychological safety while in detention.

<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>1056. In a letter dated 12 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteurs on 19 February 2008. The Government provided the following </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 188 
 
</p>
<p>information: &#8220;Mr. Lachit Bordoloi was arrested on specific charges of involvement in 
four terrorist cases and links with the banned militant outfit ULFA. Following the order of the 
Honorable High Court, Guwahati, in June 2008, Mr. Bordoloi was subsequently released.&#8221;

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 28 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1058. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning mass arrest of participants in the &#8220;The Long March for Justice for 
Special Task Force (STF) Victims&#8221;, including Messrs Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of 
People&#8217;s Watch, Mahaboob Batcha, Managing Trustee of the Society for Community 
Organisation Trust (SOCO Trust), and V.P. Gunasekaran, District Secretary of the Communist 
Party of India. 
</p>
<p>1059. According to information received, on 20 April 2008 the Long March for Justice for 
STF Victims commenced from Erode District, Tamil Nadu. The peaceful march, which had 
reportedly been refused police permission, was organized in the framework of the Campaign for 
Relief and Rehabilitation of Victims of violence allegedly perpetrated by the STF in the states of 
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. At 9.30 a.m., a public meeting took place in Sathyamangalam, after 
which approximately 500 persons proceeded with the march. On the outskirts of 
Sathyamangalam, police officers prevented the marchers from advancing. Four hundred of the 
marchers, including the above-mentioned individuals, were then reportedly arrested and taken 
into under police custody at the Ramasamy Goundar Maryammal Wedding Hall in 
Sathyamangalam. 
</p>
<p>1060. On the evening of 20 April 2008, police released the demonstrators, who subsequently 
moved to Anthiyur to participate in a public meeting of over 1,000 people. The organizers then 
decided to continue the protest. The following day, media reported that a clarification had been 
issued by the state administration, stating that victims had already been compensated and that the 
Government of Tamil Nadu had fulfilled its obligations. On the morning of 21 April 2008, the 
local police informed the organizers that they had been given instructions to arrest them if they 
continued to demonstrate. At 9.30 a.m., the protestors were stopped by the police, who 
reportedly arrested 115 marchers, including 38 women and one child. 
</p>
<p>1061. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned arrests may be related to the protestors&#8217; 
activities in defense of human rights; their peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression 
and assembly and their protest against alleged crimes perpetrated by members of the Special 
Task Force. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1062. In a letter dated 19 January 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 28 April. In transmitting the reply of the concerned authorities in India, the Government 
noted that the allegation contained in the communication was examined by the Government and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 189 
 
</p>
<p>that an enquiry was conducted on the above incident by the concerned authorities. It was 
revealed that the aforementioned individuals along with 205 other party members intended to go 
on a protest march from Exode to Chennai in order to draw attention to the relief and 
rehabilitation of the purported Special Task Force victims. However, in violation of law, they did 
not seek any prior permission from the concerned police authorities. If they had been allowed to 
proceed with this march it could have resulted in a disruption of law and order and 
inconvenienced the general public. Hence, as a preventive measure, the aforementioned persons 
were taken into police custody as per law and a case was registered against them. However, they 
were released on the very same day and all further action against them was dropped. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1064. On 16 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei, President of the Manipur Forward Youth Front (MAFYF), a civil 
society organization which works for the protection and promotion of human rights, peace 
building and social issues at the grass-roots level. 
</p>
<p>1065. According to information received, on 7 May 2008, at approximately 7 p.m., Mr. Sapam 
Kangleipal Meetei was arrested after speaking publicly at the Manipur Press Club in Imphal. In 
the course of this speech, Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei was said to have advocated an attempt 
to reach a permanent solution to the conflict in Manipur State, claiming that, in arming civilians 
to counter insurgent groups in the State, the authorities negated the purpose of an elected 
government, and that this approach would lead to anarchy. He also reportedly drew attention to a 
Supreme Court directive which prohibits the arming of civilians. It was reported that two police 
officers used force to switch off the live telecast during the speech. Mr. Sapam Kangleipal 
Meetei was reportedly charged with undermining the security of the state and encouraging 
insurgency under section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code and section 9 of the Punjab Security 
Act and Section 8 (b) under the Assam Maintenance of Public Order Act (FIR 129 (5) 08 IPS). 
</p>
<p>1066. On 8 May 2008, Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei appeared before the Chief Judicial 
Magistrate in Imphal, where he was remanded to police custody until 13 May 2008. He was then 
released on bail, before being immediately rearrested under Section 3 (2) of the National 
Security Act, 1980, reportedly for activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. Under 
this legislation, Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei might be detained for up to one year. It is reported 
that the MAFYF, supported by other civil society organizations, has called a general strike 
for 14 May 2008 in protest at the detention of Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei. 
</p>
<p>1067. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei may be directly 
related to his work in defence of human rights, and in particular, to his exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1068. In a letter dated 28 January 2009, the Government responded to the urgent 
appeal of 16 May 2008. The Government informed that the allegation contained in the 
communication was examined by the Government of India and informed that Mr. Sapam 
Kangleipal Meetie was arrested in the interest of public safety. During the investigation of the 
case, it has been well established that Mr. Sapam Kangleipal Meetei had close nexus with the 
outlawed Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) and Kanglei Yaol Kanna Lup (KYKL), even to 
the extent of helping these outlawed organizations in procuring sophisticated arms and 
ammunitions from foreign countries for insurgent activities.

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 10 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1070. On 10 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning 
Messrs Henri Tiphagne, Executive Director of People&#8217;s Watch and member of the National 
Human Rights Commission of India; S. Martin, Regional Law Officer at People&#8217;s Watch; and 
G. Ganesan and M.J. Prabakar, both State Monitoring Officers at the same organization. 
</p>
<p>1071. People&#8217;s Watch, a non-governmental organisation based in Tamil Nadu, is part of the 
National Project on Preventing Torture in India (NPPTI), which currently operates in nine states 
and of which Mr. Tiphange is National Director. The aforementioned was also one of the 
subjects of a letter of allegation sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 28 April 2008, to which, to date, 
no reply has been received from your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p>1072. According to information received, between 29 and 31 May 2008, complaints were filed 
against the four aforementioned individuals under sections 147, 342, 366, 323, 332, and 225 of 
the Indian Penal Code (rioting, wrongful confinement, kidnapping/abducting, voluntarily causing 
hurt, deterring a public servant from his duty, and resistance/obstruction of lawful apprehension 
of another person). These charges were brought following the People&#8217;s Tribunals on Torture, 
organized by People&#8217;s Watch within the framework of the NPPTI, during which there were 
allegations of police harassment, arbitrary detention and intimidation of victims who had come 
to testify at the Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>1073. It was alleged that the charges brought against the aforementioned individuals may be 
directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, in particular their efforts to end 
impunity for crimes of torture in India. In view of these reports, concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of those named. </p>

Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 10 June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 18 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1075. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Kirity Roy, 
President of Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), a human rights 
non-governmental organization based in Kolkata, West Bengal. Mr. Roy is also State Director of 
the National Project on Preventing Torture in India (NPPTI). Mr. Roy was the subject of a letter 
of allegation sent on 14 December 2005 by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and also of an urgent appeal 
and letter of allegation sent by the latter on 25 January 2006 and 9 January 2007 respectively. 
</p>
<p>1076. On 9 and 10 June 2008, MASUM coordinated the People&#8217;s Tribunal on Torture (PTT) in 
Moulali, Kolkata, during which 1,200 victims and their families were present and 82 victims 
testified before the tribunal. Judicial harassment of other individuals in relation to the PTT was 
the subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression on 10 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>1077. According to the new information received, on 12 June 2008, between 10 and 12, police 
officers from the Detective Department searched the MASUM premises. The police were led by 
the Assistant Commissioner of Police and 10 more armed officers waited outside. The operation 
was undertaken with a warrant issued by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kolkata, but without 
indicating the motive for the search warrant. 
</p>
<p>1078. On 10 June 2008, the Commissioner of Police Mr. Gautam Mohan Chakrabarty had 
informed Mr. Kirity Roy that a charge had been filed against him for his role in organizing the 
People&#8217;s Tribunal on Torture. Reports indicated that the complaint against Mr. Roy was filed 
under sections 179 (refusing to answer public servant authorised to question) and 229 
(impersonation of juror or assessor) of the Indian Penal Code. 
</p><p>1079. Concern was expressed that the search of the offices of MASUM and the complaint filed 
against Mr. Kirity Roy may be directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular the protection of the rights of victims of torture thought the People&#8217;s Tribunal on 
Torture (PTT). Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Roy 
and that of all members of MASUM.

<p>1080. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1081. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent a 
letter of allegations concerning Dr. Andana Chatterji convener of the International People&#8217;s 
Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice in Indian-administered Kashmir and Mr. Parvez Imroz, 
lawyer and also convener of the tribunal, who have been subjected to intimidation and 
harassment. The civil society established tribunal, which began on 5 April 2008, was created in 
order to investigate allegations of systematic violence and human rights violations in 
Indian-administered Kashmir. 
</p>
<p>1082. According to information received, on 21 June 2008, Dr. Andana Chatterji was followed 
from her hotel to the office of the tribunal by eight members of the intelligence service, who 
remained outside the office throughout the day and questioned anybody entering or leaving the 
building. 
</p>
<p>1083. The previous day, 20 June, Dr. Andana Chatterji and Mr. Parvez Imroz had been visiting 
mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir and in the course of the day had been questioned by 
twelve intelligence personnel from Special Branch Kashmir (SBK) and Counter Intelligence 
Kashmir (CIK) regarding their activities, the villages they had visited and whether they had 
taken photographic or video evidence of what they had observed. 
</p>
<p>1084. After being questioned, they were followed and their vehicle was forcibly boarded in 
Shangargund, Sopore by members of intelligence personnel who did not show identification. 
They were then briefly detained at a police station where officers confiscated their tapes, 
claiming they contained objectionable and dangerous material and from where they were 
followed once again. 
</p>
<p>1085. Dr Andana Chatterji has previously been subject to harassment and intimidation. In 
April 2008, after announcing the formation of the tribunal, she was stopped and intimidated at 
immigration control when leaving India for the USA, where she is resident. In June 2008, when 
she was returning to India, she was subjected to similar treatment. 
</p><p>1086. Concern was expressed that the intimidation and questioning of Dr. Andana Chatterji and 
Mr. Parvez Imroz may be directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular in their role in the civil society established International People&#8217;s Tribunal on Human 
Rights and Justice in Indian-administered Kashmir. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of both individuals. Finally, concern was expressed that the 
incidents outlined may represent an attempt to restrict the work of the individuals, including as a 
lawyer, in addressing human rights violations in the region. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1087. In a letter dated 19 March 2009, the Government responded to the communication sent 
by the Special Rapporteurs on 8 July 2008. The Government provided the following information: 
&#8220;the Government of India rejects the allegations leveled by Dr. Angana Chatterji and 
Advocate Parvez Imroz. Owing to the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is a sensitive border State of 
India, that has been a victim of cross-border terrorism for nearly two decades, any person </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 193 
 
</p>
<p>venturing near the Line of Control (LoC) without informing the authorities, is liable to be 
questioned and asked to prove credentials by the law enforcing agencies. Since Dr. Chatterji and 
Advocate Parvez Imroz had been frequently visiting areas falling close to the Line of Control 
without informing the authorities, they may have been stopped by the law enforcing agencies for 
ascertaining the purpose of their visit close to the Line of Control. Such actions are necessary to 
maintain public order in a terrorism-prone area and cannot be termed as harassment/intimidation. 
It may also be noted that a vigil over the movement of foreigners in such a sensitive State is for 
their own safety as well as to prevent activities by them that might cause public disorder&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>1088. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1089. The Special Rapporteur , together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government in relation to information received regarding Mr. Shindu Chattar, 
Mr. Rabindra Majhi, Mr. Madhusudum Munda, Mr. Kanderam Hemrom, Mr. Duskar Barik, 
Ms. Mamata Barik, Ms. Jyanti Sethy and Mr. Ranjan Patnaik, all members of the Keonjhar 
Integrated Rural Development and Training Institute (KIRDTI), an organisation which 
peacefully defends the land rights of adivasis (indigenous people) in Harichandanpur, 
Keonjhar District, Orissa State. 
</p><p>1090. According to information received, between 1 and 11 July 2008, four members of the 
KIRDTI were arrested on suspicion of having links with armed Maoist groups. On 1 July 2008, 
Mr. Shindu Chattar was arrested. On 10 July 2008, Mr. Rabindra Majhi and 
Mr. Madhumusudum Munda were arrested. On 11 July 2008, Kanderam Hemrom was arrested. 
While in police custody Mr. Rabindra Majhi was badly beaten. 
1091. Following the arrests of the above members of the KIRDTI, on 11 July 2008, 
Mr. Duskar Barik, Ms. Mamata Barik, Ms. Jyanti Sethy and Mr. Ranjan Patnaik fled Keonjhar 
District, fearing torture and ill-treatment, after reports that police planned to question them too 
for having links with armed Maoist groups. On 12 July 2008, local newspapers published that 
Keonjhar Police believed that the KIRDTI had links with armed Maoist groups. The KIRDTI 
and other human rights organisations that work with them strongly denied these links, 
maintaining that their defence of indigenous land rights was entirely peaceful. 
</p>
<p>1092. District Collectors in Orissa have now pledged to guarantee that any questioning of the 
four members of the KIRDTI who fled from Keonjhar District would be carried out in a safe 
environment. However, the four members of the KIRDTI who were arrested remained in judicial 
custody and Mr. Rabindra Majhi was not allowed access to a doctor. 
</p><p>1093. The pledge of the District Collectors to protect the members of the KIRDTI during 
questioning, as well as the transfer of the detained members of the KIRDTI from police custody 
to judicial custody, was welcomed. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 194 
 
</p>
<p>1094. However, concern was expressed that the police&#8217;s plans to question members of the 
KIRDTI maybe related to their legitimate and peaceful activities in the defence of land rights of 
indigenous people in Keonjhar District. 
1095. Concern was also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Rabindra Majhi while in custody. 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1096. In a letter dated 12 February 2009, the Government responded to the above 
communication. The Permanent Mission of India informed that the allegation contained in the 
communication was examined by the Government which found that the alleged harassment and 
torture of KIRDTI activists was baseless. According to the investigation report, about forty 
armed persons, including five women, entered the house of Ms. Tulasi Mahanta (village Rebana 
Palasapal; police station Daitari; Keonjhar district), and assaulted the inmates, looted the house, 
damaged household articles and set fire to a tractor and four motorcycles while threatening 
Mr. Tulasi Mahanta to leave the village. In connection with this incident, Mr. Sindhu Chattar, 
Mr. Rabindra Kumar Majhi, Mr. Madhusudan Bodra and Mr. Kanderam Hembram were 
subsequently arrested on the basis of evidence collected during the investigation. The 
above-mentioned arrested persons have confessed their involvement in the incident and also 
disclosed that Mr. Diskar Barik, Secretary of KIRDTI was also present at the time of the 
attack on the house of Mr. Tulasi Mahanta on the night of 30 June 2008 and is in possession 
of illegal firearms. Further investigation also revealed that Mr. Rabindra Kumar Majhi, 
Mr. Madhusudan Bodra, Mr. Kanderam Hembram and Mr. Duskar Barik, all working for 
KIRDTI, are involved in violent Maoist activities. The Government noted that Mr. Barik has 
been spreading reports of the harassment of members of KIRDTI in order to mislead the 
investigation and evade arrest. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>1097. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 5 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1098. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent a letter of allegations in relation to allegedly excessive use of force 
by the security forces in confronting the ongoing demonstrations in Jammu and Kashmir. 
</p>
<p>1099. According to information received, since June 2008, protests have increased in Jammu 
and Kashmir. The demonstrations began after a state government decision on 26 May 2008, to 
transfer 100 acres of land to a Hindu trust (the Amarnath Shrine Board) to build temporary 
shelters during an annual Hindu pilgrimage. Once the decision became public knowledge in 
June, Muslim Kashmiris started protesting against the land transfer. The decision to transfer the 
land was revoked on 1 July 2008, fuelling counter protests from Hindu Kashmiris calling for the 
reinstatement of the transfer. During these demonstrations in Jammu, Hindu protesters reportedly </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 195 
 
</p>
<p>obstructed traffic on the Jammu-Panthankot National Highway, the main land route to the 
Kashmir region. The blockades allegedly led to shortages in essential food and medical supplies 
in the Kashmir valley. Protesters chanted anti-Indian slogans, burned Indian flags and effigies of 
Indian leaders, blocked highways and attacked the security forces with sticks and stones. 
</p>
<p>1100. On 11 August 2008, approximately 100,000 Kashmiris marched toward the Line of 
Control in protest. Police, military and paramilitary forces responded with bamboo rods, tear gas, 
rubber bullets and live ammunition, resulting in at least ten deaths of protestors (see attached 
Annex for details). At least another 17 protestors and one news cameraman were shot by security 
forces the next day, on 12 August 2008 (see attached Annex). On 13 August 2008, the 
Government allegedly issued an order authorising state security forces to &#8216;shoot on sight&#8217; in 
response to communal violence in the town of Kishtwar, Doda District. More protestors were 
shot by state forces in the following days (see attached Annex). On 24 August 2008, hundreds 
of protesters defied a Government imposed curfew and tried to march from Narbal to the 
Lal Chowk (Red Square) in Srinagar, where a rally was planned on the following day. The 
Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) opened fire on the protesters, killing one person 
(see attached Annex). At least eight protestors were killed the following day, on 25 August 2008, 
and three on 27 August 2008 (see attached Annex). According to the allegations we have 
received, each of these 43 deaths was the result of excessive use of force by state security forces 
(see attached Annex for details of each incident). 
</p>
<p>1101. At least 13 journalists were also reportedly beaten by CRPF officers in Srinagar, 
on 24 August, as they tried to reach their offices despite the curfew introduced earlier in the day. 
The journalists had passes issued on 11 August but police officers reportedly said they were no 
longer valid. The curfew also prevented the publication of regional newspapers on 25 August, 
and the authorities asked local TV stations not to broadcast reports liable to &#8220;excite&#8221; the 
population until further notice. TV executives and editors were reportedly summoned and told it 
would be preferable if they suspended news programmes and just broadcast entertainment. The 
government claimed that reports broadcast by certain stations violated the Cable Television 
Network (Regulation) Act 1995. 
</p>
<p>1102. Concern was expressed that, while it appears that some of the aforementioned 
demonstrations may not have been entirely peaceful; the alleged use of excessive force by police 
personnel may seek to restrict the legitimate right to freedom of assembly. Further concern was 
expressed that the reported ban on media publications and broadcasting could represent an 
attempt to prevent independent reporting during the ongoing demonstrations in Jammu and 
Kashmir.

Commando Police took T. Dewal, L. Bipin, L. Bobojit and H. Kendra Luwang of the MDACTO 
from their homes and detained them for several hours. In detention they were forced to renounce 
their MDACTO membership and were warned not to rejoin the organization. They were released 
that evening. On 11 September 2008, five more members of the MDACTO (T. Kumar Mangang, 
an advisor; Ramthar Saiza, the Chairperson; J.S. Wungreiso, the Vice Chairperson; 
Lenpu Lupheng, the Secretary; and S. Deben, the Joint Secretary) were all summoned to the 
local police station for questioning. Fearing that they would be arrested because of their peaceful 
activities in protest against the dam construction project, they did not go. 
1106. Subsequently, their homes were raided by security forces. Thereafter they stayed away 
from their homes, feeling that they were no longer safe to return to. 
</p>
<p>1107. Concern was expressed that the arbitrary detention and intimidation of the members of 
the MDACT may have been related to their activities in the defense of the rights of communities 
affected by the construction of the Mapithel Dam. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of the members of the MDACT.

<p><b>Observations

<p>1108. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 23 September 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 7 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1109. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Mr. Kirity Roy, lawyer and Secretary of Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM) 
and State Director of the National Project on Preventing Torture in India (NPPTI). MASUM is a 
human rights non-governmental organization based in Kolkata, West Bengal. On 9 and 
10 June 2008, in Molali, Kolkata, MASUM coordinated the People&#8217;s Tribunal on Torture (PTT), 
an initiative which works within the framework of the NPPTI and aims to bring about justice in 
cases of police torture. 
</p>
<p>1110. Mr. Kirity Roy was the subject of communications sent by mandate holders 
on 14 December 2005, 25 January 2006, 9 January 2007 and 18 June 2008. The most recent of 
these communications concerned reports of a raid on the office of MASUM on 12 June 2008. 
The PTT was the subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression on 10 June 2008. No responses to any of these 
communications have yet been received from the Government. </p>

</p>
<p>1111. According to new information received, on 18 September 2008, a complaint was filed by 
MASUM (Writ Petition 25022 (W)/2008 Kirity Roy vs State of West Bengal and others) before 
the Honorable High Court, Kolkata, regarding the alleged raid on their offices on 12 June 2008. 
On 27 September 2008, at approximately 4.00 p.m., a group of Kolkata Police agents whose 
identities are known entered the offices of MASUM to search for Mr. Kirity Roy who was not 
there at the time. They then requested three documents relating to three alleged victims of police 
torture who had sworn affidavits for the PTT. 
</p>
<p>1112. Concern was expressed that the harassment of Mr. Kirity Roy and MASUM may have 
been related to their legitimate activities in the defense of victims of police torture. Further 
concern was expressed that the incident described above may form part of an ongoing trend of 
harassment against human rights defenders involved in the investigation of police torture in 
India. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1114. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent a letter of allegations in relation to Madesh, Dil Faraz, Kokila, Shahana and 
Savita. 
</p>
<p>1115. On 20 October 2008, Madesh, Dil Faraz, Kokila, Shahana and Savita went to the 
Girinagar police station as they have received news about five hijras arrested and detained, and 
allegedly beaten by members of the Girinagar police. As they tried to inquire about the detention 
of the hijras, the members of the Sangama crisis intervention team were assaulted and detained at 
the Girinagar police station, and later at the Banashankari police station. They have been accused 
of offences punishable under Section 143 (unlawful assembly), 145 (joining unlawful assembly 
ordered to be dispersed), 147 (rioting), and 353 (obstructing government officials in performing 
their duty) of the Indian Police Code. They were brought before a magistrate and sent into 
judicial custody later that evening. All five crisis team members have been released on bail 
on 22 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>1116. In the evening of 20 October 2008, about 150 human rights activists and lawyers 
gathered in front of the Banashankati police station to peacefully protest against the arrest and 
detention of the Sangama crisis team members and to try and negotiate their release. Six 
delegates from the protesters had been detained for about four hours at the police station and 
subjected to physical and verbal abuse. In the meantime members of the Banashankati police 
attacked the peaceful protesters with sticks, subjected them to physical, verbal and sexual 
assault. 31 human rights activists were closed into a small police van, and kept there for about 
seven hours. </p>

<p>1118. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Mr. Parvez Imroz, and advocate and president of the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society 
(JKCCS). 
</p>
<p>1119. Mr. Imroz was previously the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the then Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. He was also the subject of urgent 
appeals sent by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human-rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
on 1 May and 14 September 2006, of an urgent appeal sent by the then Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 11 May 2005, for which we 
received a reply on 15 February 2005, and of an urgent appeal sent by the then Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 5 October 2004. 
</p>
<p>1120. According to the information received, on 17 November 2008, Mr. Parvez Imroz was 
arrested along with several other persons, while he was monitoring the first phase of the Jammu 
and Kashmir state legislative election in Bandipora. The police dispersed an anti-election 
demonstration, allegedly using tear gas and batons. As Mr. Imroz and his volunteers reached the 
spot of the demonstrations, they were beaten and dragged by police officers. Mr. Imroz and the 
two volunteers were taken to the Badinpora police station afterwards, and released at 
about 10.15 p.m. the same day. 
</p>
<p>1121. Concern was expressed that the alleged beating, arrest and detention of Mr. Parvez Imroz 
may be related to his peaceful activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>1122. Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Imroz, especially in light of the several previous threats to his life and security.

</b></p>
<p>1124. In a letter dated 21 February 2009, the Government responded to a letter of allegations 
sent on 17 February 2006. The Government reported that &#8220;the incident actually took place </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 199 
 
</p>
<p>three days prior to the telecast of the Marathi skit, in protest against which the alleged attack 
took place. A criminal complaint was subsequently lodged at the local police station under 
relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Bombay Police Act and action taken against 
the nine accused who were arrested upon their identification by the witnesses. A charge sheet is 
being submitted in the court of law against the accused. No compensation has been demanded by 
or provided to the complainant&#8217;s office. It may be noted that Marathi skit was subsequently 
telecasted peacefully on Zee Marathi channel on the scheduled date, i.e., 11 February 2006. 
</p>
<p>1125. In a letter dated 21 July 2008, the Government responded to a letter of allegations 
sent on 18 May 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;on May 9, 2007, a crowd gathered in front 
of Tamil newspaper Dinakaran&#8217;s office in Madurai, burnt newspapers and then dispersed. They 
were demonstrating against the results of opinion polls published in the newspaper, one of which 
rated the performance of Union Ministers from Tamil Nadu and the other which speculated on 
the possible successor of the incumbent Chief Minister. The supporters of Mr. Azhagiri (one of 
the sons of the Chief Minister who was not favourably rated in the poll) went on protest, 
demonstrated and burnt newspapers. Prompt action was taken by the police and a case was 
registered. The 5 accused by the names of Gopinathan, Kumar, Sekar, Pondy and Arunachalam 
were arrested. A few hours later, another group led by Saravanan entered the premises of the 
Dinakaran office, pelted stones and smashed the glass panes. A complaint was registered and 
2 of the accused namely Alaguraja and Premkumar were arrested. After another hour, another 
group of persons came in a vehicle, entered the office overpowering the police, threw in bottles 
of petrol set the building on fire and escaped. The fire services were immediately called who 
were successfully in putting out the fire. However, unfortunately, 2 computer engineers, 
Mr. Gopinath and Mr. Vinod and the building&#8217;s caretaker, Mr. Muthuramalingam were caught in 
the midst of the fire and died due to suffocation. In this incident, a case was registered and a 
Special Team was appointed which apprehended 5 of the accused and the vehicle used by them. 
In Madurai itself, 82 persons were arrested and the situation in the city was rapidly brought 
under control. Necessary protection was provided to the offices of Dinakaran in the state of 
Tamil Nadu to avert any further untoward incidents. The Chief Minister of the State, 
acknowledging that his own family members were associated with the incidents, decided to 
entrust the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The case is under investigation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1126. In a letter dated 17 July 2008, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 23 August 2007. In its reply, the Government informed that &#8220;a complaint was registered 
by Mr. Nirbhay Vishnu Mane, an office assistant in Outlook&#8217;s Mumbai office stating that on 
August 14, 2007, about 12 men barged into the said office shouting slogans of &#8220;Shiv Sena 
Zindabad&#8221;. They enquired about the Editor and when they were informed of his absence, they 
threatened those present in the office. They broke some glass panes of the office and pushed the 
fax and photocopying machines on to the floor. In about 5 to 7 minutes and they left the office 
shouting slogans. Ms. Sangita Shah, a worker informed the police of the incident who 
immediately rushed to the spot. After preliminary enquiries, the statement of Mr. Mane was 
recorded and an offence was registered. According to the complainant, the said act was in 
retaliation to some allegedly defamatory information published in the magazine issue dated 
August 20, 2007. The office bearers of Shiv Sena have denied their involvement and stated that 
the attack on the Outlook office was carried out by others to tarnish the image of Shiv Sena. The 
case is under investigation&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1128. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations in relation to the alleged arrest and 
detention of nine activists from Papua, for displaying the Papua Morning Star flag. 
</p>
<p>1129. According to information received, on 13 March 2008, a demonstration was organised in 
Manokwari, in West Papua, to protest against the 2007 Government Regulation 77, which bans 
the display of &#8220;separatist symbols&#8221;, including the Morning Star flag. It is reported that during the 
demonstration, the police arrested nine people, including a 16 year-old boy. It is further reported 
that the nine have been charged with breach of regulation 77/2007, as well as with rebellion 
(&#8220;makar&#8221;), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Information received 
indicates that people have in the recent past been sentenced to penalties of up to 17 years 
imprisonment for possessing and displaying &#8220;separatist symbols&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1130. By a letter dated 21 October 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information: &#8220;on 13 March 2008, several individuals decided to stage a 
demonstration in West Papua to protest against the 2007 Government Regulation 77 in 
Manokwari. According to our sources, this was a peaceful gathering until certain groups 
attempted to use this occasion as a political rally to demonstrate their opposition to the 
constitutionally established national rule of law. 
</p>
<p>1131. In Indonesia, it is not unlawful to protest against a specific matter or event. However, 
according to established national norms, it is important that the government is informed of the 
decision to hold a rally. Indeed, this is clear from the stipulations of national norms such as 
Law No. 2/2002 of the State Police of the Republic of Indonesia and Law No. 9/1998 which 
concerns the freedom of expression in public it is also evident from the provisions of the 
Criminal Code chapter 510 on the permission to hold public events, that is permissible to hold 
peaceful demonstrations in Indonesia as long as permission is sought in advance from the 
concerned law enforcement authorities in the region. This measure exists in order to ensure that 
the protests take pace in an orderly and peaceable manner with law officials present in case any 
problems arise. On 13th March 2008, several individuals illicitly unfurled the outlawed separatist 
&#8220;Free Papua&#8221; flag during the rally. The police had to break up the gathering when it became 
evident that the protesters were not respecting the established national norms relative to holding 
peaceful demonstrations in Indonesia. As a result, nine out of the thirteen protesters arrested 
were detained and charged. They are now facing trial for breaching Article 106-110 of Criminal 
Code regarding &#8220;makar&#8221; or rebellion. Four out of the thirteen who were originally arrested have 
since been released. However, the legal process which concerns the nine in custody is one which 
is determined by the relevant national courts. It should be further recalled that the Indonesian 
Judiciary is independent from the Executive. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 201 
 
</p>
<p>1132. It should furthermore be noted that within the stipulations of national legislation, and in 
particular, Government Regulation 77/2007 (03/PIM-MRP/2008), the display of separatist 
symbols in Indonesia is expressly banned. In particular, Article 6 of Government 
Regulation 77/2007 prohibits the display of the Morning Star Flag in Papua as this is counter to 
efforts to maintain peace, national unity and territorial integrity. At this point, it is also important 
to recall that Indonesia is a sprawling archipelago which has long been sensitive to attempts by 
separatist movements to divine this peaceful nation. Thus, the government has long been 
concerned about regional divisions. In 2003, the government attempted to divide Papua into 
three provinces, namely: Central Irian Jaya (Irian Jaya Tengah), Papua (or East Irian Jaya, 
Irian Jaya Timur), and West Irian Jaya (Irian Jaya Barat). The Constitutional court annulled this 
decision in 2004 as it was considered to be in opposition to Papua&#8217;s Special Autonomy status. 
However, the court did in fact accept the establishment of the West Irian Jaya province, which is 
in the westerly region of Papua. 
</p>
<p>1133. Historically, the Papuan People&#8217;s Council (MRP) was set up under a &#8220;Special 
Autonomy&#8221; law for West Papua, which was passed in 2001, Under the Presidential Decree of 
2004, the Papuan People&#8217;s Council (MRP) was established months later, in January 2005. It was 
established to give indigenous West Papuans a voice which would be heard directly in the 
Indonesian central government in Jakarta and also, in order to protect their rights and cultural 
identity. Since then, the government has continued with efforts to establish and enact other laws 
which protect and promote the rights of people in the region. Furthermore, it must be understood 
that the Government of Indonesia considers the spirit of unity and constructive partnership which 
exists between the various regions of the country as being vital to the future of the county. This 
diversity of cultures enriches the mosaic patchwork of identities which together, has created 
today what is considered as Indonesia&#8217;s dynamic and multi-ethnic society. Therefore, the illicit 
actions of a few protesters have served to cause division and destructive regional unrest. The 
government is also currently in the process of issuing an emergency government regulation to 
justify the formation of Irian Jaya Barat province. It is intended that the Perpu/Law will 
acknowledge Irian Jaya Barat as province. The new law to be established will be synchronized 
with the existing 2001 law on special autonomy for Papua. It is hoped that this will help ensure 
that there is peace in the region and bring clarity to the legal status of the Irish Jaya Rarat 
province. In the meantime, the government is continuing efforts to improve the situation in the 
region by investing heavily in local infrastructure. In this regard the President in August 2007 
issued a presidential instruction to accelerate the development efforts in Papua and in the 
West Papua provinces. The central government is expected to spend Rp. 22 trillion, which will 
be mainly dedicated to building the regions infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>1134. It is therefore incorrect to allege that the government is in some way not doing its best to 
ensure that the rights of its citizens, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion is 
not protected. In this regard, apart from the stipulations in the 1945 Constitution (Article 28) 
which implicitly protects this right, it should be notes that all citizens are treated equally. 
According to Article 27 (1) of the 1945 Constitution, &#8220;all citizens shall be equal before the law 
and the government and shall be required to respect the law and the government, with no 
exceptions&#8221;. Concurrently, taking from the reading of Article 19 of the ICCPR, it is observed 
that the respect for the right to freedom of expression is expressly limited to instances that do not 
interfere with the &#8220;... protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public 
health or morals&#8221;. Or in Article 22 where it states that limitations are within the rights of the 
State if they are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 202 
 
</p>
<p>national security or public safety, public order (ordre public) ... or the protection of the rights and 
freedoms of others&#8221;. Moreover, the Government of Indonesia takes this occasion to reiterate its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of fundamental human rights which are established 
and protected in its national legislation through norms such as law 39/1999 on Human Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1135. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 29 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1136. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning reports that a new law on 
&#8220;Electronic Information and Transaction&#8221; was passed on 25 March 2008. While the main 
purpose of the law is to combat online crime, pornography, gambling, blackmail, lies, threats and 
racism, it is reported that provisions in the law prohibit citizens from distributing in any 
electronic format information that is defamatory, allegedly punishing transgressors with a 
maximum of six years in prison or a fine of one billion Rp (approx. US$ 109,000) or both. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1137. By a letter dated 27 May 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information: &#8220;the &#8220;Economic information and Transaction Law&#8221; is a 
national law that was passed on 25 March 2008. Primarily, this law was established to cover the 
use of the Internet and focuses on issues such as web content, information technology and 
business transactions. The Ministry of Communications and Information was the agency placed 
in charge of the draft which is formally known as the &#8220;UU ITE&#8217; Undoing Undang Informasi and 
Transaksi Elektronik&#8221; or Law No. 11/2008 on Economic Information and Transaction Law. This 
law was issued to ensure that there is a full and complete coverage of many issues such as 
intellect property rights, economic transfers and consumer protection measures. After five years 
of consultations and consolidation, in March 2008, the government officially ratified the 
Undang-undang Informasi and Transaksi Elektronik (UU ITE) and it was expected to come into 
force as of 1st of April 2008. 
</p>
<p>1138. This new legislation also forms part of the Government of Indonesia&#8217;s effort, to establish 
and enact comprehensive legislation on cyberspace uses while taking into account the 
UNCITRAL model law requirements on e-commerce. It was also created to cover issues such as 
the communications, information technology and cybercrime. It is intended to complement the 
existing Undang-undang Hak Cipta (the Indonesian Copyright Law) as well as other such related 
laws. Therefore, while it is true that one of this new law is intended to restrict access to 
pornographic websites because such sites raise serious questions on morality and public order, it 
should also be noted that the new law was however not created exclusively for this purpose but 
also to encompass, in an updated manner, other aspects of internet use and the defamatory or 
negative use of information technology. 
</p>
<p>1139. Moreover, it must be understood that it is was in fact at the instigation and request of 
concerned members of the general public that the government decided to block access to sites 
with violent and pornographic content. To this end, the Information and Communications 
Ministry has made available to the public, software which blocks websites with pornographic </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 203 
 
</p>
<p>content and which is also be available for download from its official website. This is software 
which the general public can choose to obtain for their personal use or on the other hand, choose 
not to. It was important to impose sanctions to discourage access to such sites and to this effect, 
there is the possibility that a maximum imprisonment term of three years may be imposed on 
those found guilty before a court of law of violating this law as well as a possible fine amounting 
to a maximum of one billion rupiah. 
</p>
<p>1140. The Government of Indonesia considers it important to reiterate at this point its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Indeed, 
Law No. 9/1998 regarding freedom of expression in public as well as the Indonesian 
Constitution guarantees the freedom of opinion and expression of its citizens. This is evident 
from the provisions of Article 28 E sub-paragraph (3) and Article 28 F whereby the protection 
and fulfilment of human rights are considered as the responsibility of the State, especially that of 
the government. In addition, Article 28 J sub-paragraph (2) provides that &#8220;In exercising his/her 
rights and freedoms, every person shall have the duty to accept the restrictions established by 
law for the sole purposes at guaranteeing the recognition and respect of the rights and freedoms 
of others and of satisfying just demands based upon considerations of morality, religious values, 
security and public order in a democratic society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1141. In addition, the government is of the view that such legally binding restrictions will also 
be beneficial to the wellbeing and social upbringing of the most vulnerable group to such 
uncensored exposure, which are the children in the country. In this particular reference, the 
Indonesian Constitution of 1945 as well as its most recent amendments expressly protects the 
rights of children. In Article 28 B. it is clearly stipulated that every child has the right to grow 
and develop, and has the right to protection from violence. Therefore, as in several international 
laws such as the &#8220;Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of 
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography&#8221;, it must be clearly underlined that 
violations to constitutional freedoms in Indonesia are thus contrary to the provisions of the 
national constitution.&#8221;

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1143. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, sent an urgent appeal regarding a joint ministerial decree with regard to members of the 
Ahmadiyya community in Indonesia. According to the information received, on 9 June 2008, a 
joint ministerial decree by the Religious Affairs Minister, the Home Minister and the 
Attorney General warned and instructed adherents, members and/or board members of the 
Indonesian Ahmadiyya Congregation (Jemaat Ahmadiyya Indonesia), as long as they claim to be 
Muslims, to stop the spreading of the belief that there is another prophet with his own teachings 
after the Prophet Muhammad. Members who disobey this instruction of the decree or who spread 
interpretations that deviate from the principal teachings of the religions in Indonesia are warned 
that they and their associated organizations will face legal action. Furthermore, the decree 
appeals to society to refrain from violent acts against Ahmadiyya followers. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 204 
 
</p>
<p>1144. On 1 June 2008, more than 500 people from the Islam Troop Command attacked 
about 100 activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion who were 
holding a peaceful rally for religious tolerance at Jakarta&#8217;s National Monument. 75 people were 
injured in the attack and several Ahmadiyya followers had to be hospitalised. Although police 
were in the area they reportedly did little to stop the violence and some police officers allegedly 
blamed the organizers of the rally that keeping the agenda of their peace parade had created the 
tensions. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1145. By a letter dated 27 June 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;In reference to the allegation concerning the Ahmadiyya community in 
Indonesia, it is important to first begin by reiterating that in Indonesia the freedom of religion or 
belief is constitutionally established and protected. Similarly, the freedom of religion in 
Indonesia and the practices linked to individual belief are guaranteed under Articles 28 E, 28 I 
and 29 of the Constitution which clearly states that the exercise of freedom of religion cannot be 
limited other than by law. Moreover, further guarantees concerning the respect of this 
fundamental freedom and of religious practice are protected in various laws, and specifically, 
Law No 39 of 1999 on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>1146. Indeed, in addressing the issue, the Government of Indonesia has been mindful of the fact 
that incidents relating to Ahmadiyya have multiple facets. On the one hand, the doctrinal aspect 
of this particular religious movement has long been considered by some communities as deviant. 
On the other hand, sporadic acts of violence by the mob against members of this group have 
resulted in public disturbance and constituted led to acts of intolerance and crimes punishable by 
law. 
</p>
<p>1147. As regards the doctrinal aspect of this movement, it should be noted that in recent years, 
the interaction of this movement with many communities in the country has created major social 
tension. The government has been endeavouring to resolve the issue through dialogue. It has 
held a several sessions to dialogue with the leaders of Ahmadiyya on issues such as the 
protection of their followers. The government is also continuing to promote dialogue between 
Ahmadiyya and various religious groups in order to enhance mutual respect and understanding. 
</p>
<p>1148. The second aspect of this matter relates to law enforcement. In particular, there have been 
incidents of intolerance against the followers of Ahmadiyya. In this regard, on the occasions 
when members of Ahmadiyya have been at risk, the authorities have stepped in to assure their 
protection in the same manner they have been obliged to ensure the protection of ordinary 
citizens against the violence inflicted by any group or persons. 
</p>
<p>1149. Following such attacks in the past, the perpetrators of the acts of violence have been 
detained for questioning and several were brought before the law. Hence, at the same time as 
enforcing the law, the government also takes into account the need to address the related social 
tension and the need to promote further dialogue among groups. 
</p>
<p>1150. In light of the need to resolve the issue in a sustainable manner and to prevent its 
recurrence in the future, the government recently issued a specific decision on this issue which 
takes into account the principle of freedom of religion as well as the need to respect the existing </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 205 
 
</p>
<p>relevant laws and regulations in the country. The policy, which comes in the form of the joint 
decree under reference KEP-033/A/JA16/2008 or SKB No. 3/2008, contains among others, the 
following elements: it does not outlaw lhe Ahmadiyya faith, but rather, orders its followers to 
halt their proselytization (Sylar) activities and to fully respect the existing laws and regulations; 
it appeals to the Ahmadiyya followers to return to the Islamic mainstream religion and at the 
same time, it appeals to the people in general to refrain from acts of violence against Ahmadiyya 
followers. 
</p>
<p>1151. Indeed, the Ahmadiyya organization became legally registered in Indonesia through the 
Law Minister&#8217;s Decision of 1953 under reference Rl No. JA123113 of 13th March 1953 and to 
date, there is no regulation which annuls the said decision. Furthermore, the issuance of such a 
decree was never meant to be an intervention by the State in people&#8217;s right to freedom of 
religion. It is merely an effort by the government, as mandated by the Constitution and national 
laws, to uphold law and public order and protect the followers of Ahmadiyya from any criminal 
attacks. It does not interfere with religious doctrines or limit religious freedom. 
</p>
<p>1152. As regards the acts of violence, on June 1st of this year, on the day marking 
the 63rd anniversary of Indonesia&#8217;s Pancasila, it was reported that a group comprised of 
500 individuals called the Islamic Defender&#8217;s Front (FPI) attacked over 100 activists from the 
National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion during an interfaith rally on religious 
tolerance in front of the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta. Several people were injured and 
have since been treated in hospital. However, in response to this illicit act of violence, there have 
been several measures taken by the government, including the arrest of two leaders of the FPI, 
namely Mr. Habib Rizik and Mr. Munarman. Concurrently, there have also been police 
investigations into the violence which has led to the arrest of several other individuals who were 
involved in the violence. 
</p>
<p>1153. In addition, the government has called upon the local communities and civil societies to 
keep the peace and not attempt any acts of violence or illegal actions against the Ahmadiyya 
community. Through the application of the laws on hate crimes, there will also be legal 
prosecution of those who attack members of Ahmadiyaa. 
</p>
<p>1154. Therefore, as regards Ahmadiyya, the Government of Indonesia as a budding democracy 
is not of the view that this is an issue which exceeds the precepts of national sovereignty, nor is it 
one that infringes on the freedom to practice religions. Therefore, the Government of Indonesia 
is of the view that the solution to the issues concerning Ahmadiyya needed to also take into 
account the two-fold perspective, namely, the preservation of public order, and the protection of 
the followers of Ahmadiyya from any criminal attack by mob. In other words, the government 
limits is role to the levels of maintaining public order and protecting its citizens. 
</p>
<p>1155. Moreover, while it is acknowledged that human rights are universal in character, it is 
generally understood that their domestic expression and implementation should remain the 
responsibility of each individual government. This is consistent with the basic principles 
contained in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which in Article 29B 
addresses two aspects: &#8216;On the one hand, there are principles that respect the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of the individual; on the other, there are stipulations regarding the obligations of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 206 
 
</p>
<p>the individual to society and state&#8217;. The implementation of human rights implies the existence of 
a balanced relationship between individual human rights and the obligations of individuals 
towards their community. Without such a balance, the rights of the community as a whole can be 
denied, which can lead to instability and anarchy, especially in developing countries. It is thus 
important to recall at this point that Indonesia is a multi-ethnic and multi cultural country which 
prides itself of its harmonious mosaic of diverse communities living together and practising 
several religious beliefs of their choice, as long as their religious practices do not infringe on 
public order and the harmonious wellbeing of the society as a whole. Additionally, the 
government considers efforts being undertaken in this respect, to form a vital part of its ongoing 
commitment to the eradication of religious radicalism and all acts of violence stemming from 
religious intolerance.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1156. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 14 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1157. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a letter of allegations concerning the 
arrest and detention of Mr. Simon Tuturop, Mr. Tadeus Weripang, Mr. Viktor Tuturop, 
Mr. Tomas Nimbitkendik, Mr. Benedidiktus Tuturop and Mr. Teles Piahar. 
</p>
<p>1158. According to information received, in the morning of 19 July 2008, at 
approximately 4.30 a.m., 46 Papuan nationals were arrested by police during a flag-raising 
ceremony outside a government archive office, in the city of Fakfak, western Papua. During the 
arrests, police officers reportedly beat and kicked the protesters, forcing the men to strip to their 
underwear in the street, before loading them onto trucks and taking them to Fakfak police 
station. Reports claim that many of those arrested suffered bruising to their faces and bodies, 
with two complaining of serious eye injuries. 
</p><p>1159. According to reports, six of those arrested, including Mr. Simon Tuturop, 
Mr. Tadeus Weripang, Mr. Viktor Tuturop, Mr. Tomas Nimbitkendik, Mr. Benedidiktus Tuturop 
and Mr. Teles Piahar, have been charged with subversion for threatening the state and by raising 
a &#8216;separatist flag&#8217;. In accordance with Indonesia&#8217;s criminal code subversion carries a maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment. On 23 July, five more activists were reportedly arrested while 
37 from the original group of detainees were released. The police reportedly stated that it will 
investigate allegations related to detainees who suffered eye injuries, but has denied claims that 
any of the protesters were beaten or that they were subjected to humiliating treatment. 
1160. In March 2008, nine Papuan activists were arrested and jailed for displaying the Papuan 
Morning Star flag. Their trial, on charges of subversion, is ongoing and the nine remain in 
detention. 
</p>
<p>1161. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned individuals 
may represent a direct attempt to stifle freedom of expression. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 207 
 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1162. By a letter dated 21 October 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information. 
</p>
<p>1163. &#8220;On 19 July 2008, it was reported that the six abovementioned Papuans were involved in 
a flag-raising incident which took place outside an Indonesian government archive office in 
Fak Oak, West Papua. The above individuals were just some of the 46 who were arrested for 
their participation in this illicit event which took place without any authorisation in the early 
hours of Saturday morning at approximately 04.30 am. 
</p>
<p>1164. As a result of their actions Simon Tuturop, 58 years old, Tadeus Weripang, 52 years old, 
Victor Tuturop, 42 years old, Tomas Nimbitkendik, 19 years old, Benediktus Tuturop, 35 years 
old and Telas Piahar, 20 years old were all arrested and charged under section 110 of the 
Indonesian Criminal Code for Subversion. 
</p>
<p>1165. Following further investigations the others who were arrested at the same time as the 
six abovementioned individuals have since been released and the charges against most of them 
dropped. At the time, the other 37 detainees were to be sent home after meeting with and being 
briefed by the Fakfak Regent, Dr. Wahidin Puarada. 
</p>
<p>1166. The incident in question was the result of an illegal flag being raised. The flag bore the 
insignia and colours of the West Papuan independence which is known as the Vlorning Star flag 
and which it is nationally well known under Indonesian law to be a separatist symbol and thus 
banned. To this effect, Article 6 of Regulation PP 77/2007 (03/PI \/I-MRP/2008) is part of the 
2007 law which expressly bans the display of separatist symbols, including flags in all parts of 
Indonesia. The six individuals mentioned above were thus in violation of this law for attempting 
to cause a rebellion. Their case will be handled in application of the national judicial procedure 
which will accordingly decide the verdict applicable to the six men. 
</p>
<p>1167. Additionally, under Article 106 of the Indonesian Criminal Code, those detained by the 
appointed authorities can be charged with plotting a coup. The charge also carries a maximum 
punishment of life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>1168. As already mentioned at various occasions in the past Indonesia protects the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression which is constitutionally guaranteed (Articles 27 and 28 of 
the 1945 Constitution and its subsequent modifications). This right however can not be used in a 
manner which is detrimental to national norms or the &#8220;state Constitution&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1169. Indeed, it is the government&#8217;s view that as is the case with any democratic nation, it is the 
role of the government to establish parameters within which these rights may be fully enjoyed 
without causing untoward harm to others. If these rights should impede the fundamental interests 
of others, including those of the national community as well as its unity or territorial integrity, 
restrictions may be placed to limit the harmful consequences of such a right. To this point, the 
ICCPR has been clear in supporting this argument. In Article 19 of the ICCPR, if is observed 
that the respect for the right to freedom of expression is expressly limited to instances that do not 
interfere with the &#8220;... protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public 
health or morals&#8221;, and in Article 22, it states that any limitations to these rights are within the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 208 
 
</p>
<p>rights of the State if they are &#8220;prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the 
interests of national security or public safety, public order (orders public) &#8230; or the protection of 
the rights and freedoms of others.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1170. Hence, it must be left within the authority of the judiciary to determine what measures 
will be taken in the case of the six abovementioned individuals to punish any attempts to 
sabotage national democracy and territorial integrity. 
</p>
<p>1171. In essence, Indonesia prides itself of being a nation which is united under one banner but 
which also comprises of a rich patchwork of different cultures, religious beliefs and languages 
spoken by a multitude of ethnic groups. As an archipelago which is in fact the largest in the 
world, this is no easy task for any government to ensure unity and cohesion at all times with all 
its citizens. All this said, Indonesia has always sought to achieve the essential balance which is 
necessary for this unity and thus acts which seek to subvert, destroy or diminish these efforts are 
not considered lightly. 
</p>
<p>1172. As a whole, the government is continuing to do its best to avoid as best possible, regional 
divisions which would only fracture the peace and the unity in Indonesia. Already in this year 
alone, there have been several meetings involving the President and Vice-President of Indonesia 
in talks, respectively, with various stakeholders on how to improve the situation in the Papua 
region. 
</p>
<p>1173. At this juncture, it should be recalled that Indonesia is a democratic nation which is also a 
signatory to many international treaties and conventions, a majority of which have been ratified, 
acceded to and which have since formed part of its national norms. Therefore, allegations that 
the government does not respect the rights of its citizens are both incorrect and unjustified.&#8221; 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1174. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1175. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations on the killing of Mr. Opinus Tabuni, an 
activist of an indigenous peoples&#8217; organisation in West Papua, at a rally on 9 August 2008. 
According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>1176. On 9 August 2008, International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People, a peaceful rally 
took place through the town of Wamena, in the middle mountain region of West Papua. A march 
concluded with an event staged near Santa Thomas school in Wamena. Police were stationed 
around the ground where the event took place. Army and intelligence services were present as 
well. Only the security forces were carrying guns. 
</p>
<p>1177. In the course of the event the Morning Star flag, which is a symbol of the West Papua 
independence movement, was raised. Raising the Morning Star flag reportedly constitutes, under 
Indonesian law, the offence of subversion and carries a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 209 
 
</p>
<p>1178. At this point, the police started moving in on the demonstrators and started shooting. 
Mr. Opinus Tabuni, a leader of the Wamena branch of an indigenous peoples&#8217; organisation in 
West Papua, was hit by a bullet and died. An autopsy performed on Mr. Tabuni at the hospital in 
Wamena on 10 August 2008 showed that a bullet travelled through his right side and through his 
heart. The bullet has been sent by the police to Makassar for further analysis. 
</p>
<p>1179. Another Papuan man, who was not identified, was reportedly seriously injured by 
gunshot. This man has disappeared since then. A further man was reportedly beaten by police 
with rifle butts and has also disappeared. There are concerns that the two men could have been 
apprehended by the police and may be in police detention. 
</p>
<p>1180. The Indonesian police are reportedly investigating the incident and have detained a 
number of witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1181. By a letter dated 28 October 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information. 
</p>
<p>1182. &#8220;On 9 August 2008, sympathizers to the Dewan Adat Papua/DAP (Papuan Custom 
Council) cause from the sub-district of VI Lapago Balliem marched from Sinakma Wourma, 
Pikhe and Wesaput Wamena. They brought with them traditional defense armaments such as 
arrows, spears and machetes. They yelled continuously &#8220;International Koteka Naire and 
Independence for Papua&#8221;. Their march continued onwards to the conference building on 
Yos Sudarso Street in the Wamena District of the Papua Province. At 1.45 p.m., in the public 
square of Sinapuk, there was a commemoration of the &#8220;International Day of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous People&#8221;. The rally was attended by approximately 10,000 sympathizers of the DAP 
group and they chose to celebrate the event by illegally raising the Morning Star flag, a separatist 
flag. The sympathizers of this movement then marched together with the leaders of the DAP. At 
2.15 p.m., the participants of the &#8220;International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People&#8221; carried 
the Morning Star flag side by side with the Indonesian flag, the UN flag and the SOS 
(emergency) flag on which was written &#8220;Papuan are in danger&#8221;. Upon seeing the Morning Star 
flag raised, the county police of Jayawijaya tried to lower and confiscate it. However, there was a 
strong opposition from the crowds. In order to calm the protestors down, the police officers fired 
a warning shot in the air and this happened to strike the flag of the DAP sympathizers. Chaos 
ensued and within 30 minutes, individuals in the crowd started using a gun, arrows, spears and 
machetes. At 3.30 p.m., leaders of DAP held a meeting with the head of the county police of 
Jayawijaya and Dandim 1702, and were informed that the individual(s) who raised the Morning 
Star flag must be given up to the police officers and thereafter face legal prosecution. At that 
moment, just as the crowds began to leave the area in order to return home, a man was 
found dead. He was identified as Mr. Opius Tabuni. An investigation into the cause of his 
death commenced immediately. At 4.45 p.m., the DAP sympathizers carried the body of 
Mr. Opius Tabuni to the Honai (traditional house) of the DAP Lapago in Mapina. They 
requested an inquiry into the death of Mr. Opius Tabuni. On 10 August 2008, the autopsy of the 
body was performed, and it was found that there was a bullet in his heart. On 13 August 2008, at 
the Sinapuk Wamena public square, a team from the Indonesian Police Headquarters 
investigated the third crime scene with regard to the raising of the Bintang Kejora Flag, and the 
incident which also led to the death of the Mr. Opius Tabunil. Another team from the Indonesian </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 210 
 
</p>
<p>Police Headquarters investigated the fourth crime scene at the public square. It was determined 
that the individuals responsible for the deterioration of the rally included the head of the DAP 
(Mr. Forkorus Yaboisembut) as well as prominent members of the Presidium Dewan Papua 
(DPD). It was also discovered that the rally was attended by several prominent figures from the 
contentious 2000 Papuan People&#8217;s Congress and this separatist group was ultimately found to be 
behind the creation of the Presidium Dewan Papua/PDP and other civilian separatist movements 
in general. The individuals who raised the Morning Star flag have since been identified as having 
the initials AW and AH. It was also found that these individuals originate from the Piramid 
village in the Assologaima district. Since then, the following steps have been taken by the 
regional police of Papua to address this problem: conducting investigations into finding the 
perpetrators who shot Mr. Opius Tabuni; conducting interrogations of the 4 witnesses from the 
civil society body, 31 members of the county police of Jayawijaya who were on duty and who 
were supposed to provide security during the rally and 19 members of the county police of 
Jayawijaya who were armed during the rally; and conducting &#8220;back-up&#8221; support from the county 
police of Jayawijaya and assisted the team of forensic experts from the Indonesian Police 
Headquarters and the Criminal Investigation Body (Bareskrim).&#8221;

</b></p>
<p>1184. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning a group of between 20-30 students, including Ms. Rosa &#8216;Essa&#8217;ie, a student at 
Tehran&#8217;s Amir Kabir University, Mr. Mehdi Geraylou, Ms. Anousheh Azadfar, and 
Mr. Rouzbeh Safshekan; all students at Tehran University, Ms. Ilnaz Jamshidi, a student at 
Free University of Central Tehran, Mr. Nasim Soltan-Beigi, a student at &#8216;Allameh Tabatabai 
University, Mr. Yaser Pir Hayati, a student at Shahed University and the students 
Mr. Milad Moini, Mr. Younes Mir Hosseini, Ms. Anahita Hosseini and Ms. Bita Naghashiyan. 
The aforementioned are all associated with the student groups Students for Freedom and 
Equality (Daneshjouyan-e Azadi Khah va Beraber Talab) and the Office for Strengthening Unity 
(Daftar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat). 
</p>
<p>1185. According to information received, all but two of the 20 to 30 students arrested for 
participating in demonstrations for the National University Students&#8217; Day on 7 December 2007 
were still detained without charge. It was reported that Mr. Milad Moini and Mr. Younes 
Mir Hosseini had been recently released, but at least nine other students, including 
Ms. Anahita Hosseini and Ms. Bita Naghashiyan, had reportedly been arrested in recent days. 
The circumstances of their arrest and their current whereabouts remain unknown, although it had 
been reported that they may have been transferred to Evin Prison in Teheran. Before they were 
arrested, many of the students reportedly received mobile phone text messages, threatening them 
with arrest if they participated in the events. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1186. One detained student, whose identity is not known, was reported to have attempted 
suicide. Unconfirmed information states that pressure exerted by officials and harsh detention 
conditions may have been factors in this suicide attempt. The Ministry of Intelligence has 
reportedly suggested that students were in possession of &#8220;catapults, sound grenades, alcoholic 
drinks and misleading books&#8221;. However, students&#8217; groups are said to have dismissed these 
claims as fabrications. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of 
those detained. Concern was also expressed that the arrests and detention of all of the 
aforementioned persons may be directly linked to their activities in defense of human rights, 
particularly their exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association.

<p>1187. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1188. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the arrest of Mr. Behrouz Seferi, Iranian 
Azerbaijani human rights activist and his wife, Ms. Layla Heydari. 
</p><p>1189. According to the information received; Mr. Behrouz Seferi, who had campaigned for 
Iran&#8217;s Azerbaijani minority to be given greater rights to use their mother tongue, has been 
detained without charge or trial since late May or early June 2007. He has not been allowed to 
consult a lawyer. Mr. Seferi was arrested shortly after demonstrations around the first 
anniversary of the publication of a cartoon in an Iranian newspaper which many Iranian 
Azerbaijanis found offensive. He was held in his home town of Zanjan until 4 December 2007, 
when, according to sources, he was moved to Evin Prison. 
</p>
<p>1190. Reportedly, his wife, Ms. Layla Heydari, had been detained since 28 August 2007. 
According to the information received, Ms. Heydari ran a shop selling Azerbaijani books, music 
and other cultural material until the authorities closed it down in 2006. She obeyed official 
warnings not to publicise her husband&#8217;s arrest, but on 28 August 2007 she was summoned to 
visit him at the Ministry of Intelligence detention centre where he was held at the time, and was 
arrested. She too was moved to Evin Prison on 4 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>1191. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Seferi and Ms. Heydari may 
be linked to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular the cultural rights 
of the Iran&#8217;s Azerbaijani minority. Further concern was expressed that they both may have been 
tortured to obtain confessions. Finally, concern was expressed for their psychological and 
physical integrity. Ms. Heydari was reportedly in poor health, suffering from heart problems and 
had been treated on the medical wing, whose staff reportedly recommended that she be allowed 
medical treatment outside prison. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1192. By a letter dated 6 May 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information: &#8220;Mr. Behrouz Sefari and his wife Mrs. Leila Heydari 
travelled to Turkey as tourists and participated in training sessions, which according to authentic 
information, were organized by Americans. According to the confirmed information the agenda 
of the training courses included overthrow of the system government through abuse of civil and 
social rights existing in the country. The participants in the training courses are taught the special 
methods for recognition and absorption of new members, organizational techniques extremist 
propagation on the existing weaknesses in the country, as well as disturbing of public opinion 
through resorting to propagation of lies and false information. It is noteworthy that the 
U.S. government, under the pretext of establishment of democracy in Iran has openly allocated 
millions of dollars in its annual budget for overthrowing the Government of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. 
</p>
<p>1193. Mr. Behrouz Sefari and his wife Mrs. Leila Heydari together with other seven individuals 
participated in the above-mentioned course and took the oath to implement what they had 
learned in the course. Following their return to the country, Mr. Safari was arrested on 
19 June 2007 and Mrs. Heydari was arrested on 27 August 2007. Following the relevant 
investigations, they were bailed out on 2 March 2008 and their case, together with the bill of 
indictment, was sent to branch 15 of Tehran penal Court. The court met on June 2008, in the 
presence of their defence lawyers, Dadkhah and Raeisian Firouzabad, and convicted them to one 
year&#8217;s suspended imprisonment, through verdict NO 87/104. Upon complaint of the defence, the 
case was raised in branch 36 of the Court of Appeal and reinstated through verdict No. 1257 
of 28 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>1194. As stated above, the two individuals were arrested merely in relation with their illegal 
activities and they were treated in accordance with the rule of law and enjoyed all their legal 
rights before the court of justice. Any allegation on maltreatment or lack of proper attention to 
his physical or psychological integrity as well as any other allegation such as &#8220;torture to obtain 
confession&#8221; or&#8221; arrested in relation with their peaceful activities in credence of human rights&#8221; 
and likewise are baseless and mere fabrication of lies aiming at mal-intended objectives. 
</p><p>1195. The laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran are based on prohibition of any form of 
mistreatment of individuals. This overriding principle has been accorded special attention in the 
Constitution In order to ensure effective respect for this principle, not only has the Constitution 
provided for the punishment of those who ignore the prohibitions and commit acts of 
mistreatment and torture, but provisions have also been made for the legal protection of the 
victims of mistreatment. Furthermore, confession extracted through torture is invalid. Article 38 
of the Constitution states that: &#8220;All forms of torture for the purpose of extracting confession or 
acquiring information are forbidden. Compulsion of individuals to testify, confess, or to take an 
oath is not permissible; and any testimony, confession, or oath obtained under duress is devoid of 
value and credence. Violation of this article is liable to punishment in accordance with the law.&#8221;

Government concerning Mr. Amin Ghaza&#8217;i, aged 29, writer, chief editor of an electronic journal 
called &#8220;ArtCult&#8221;, and prominent member of an organisation called &#8220;Students for Freedom and 
Equality&#8221; (&#8220;Daneshjouyan-e Azadi Khah va Beraber Talab&#8221;). Some other student members or 
affiliates of this group were already been the subject matter of a joint urgent appeal to the 
Government by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 21 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>1198. According to the information received; Mr. Amin Ghaza&#8217;i was arrested in 
Tehran on 14 January 2008 at a meeting along with 14 other students. He was currently being 
held without charge or trial in solitary confinement in Section 209 of Evin Prison in Tehran and 
had been ill-treated. On 15 January 2008 the police searched Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i&#8217;s home and 
confiscated his computer and papers. On 30 January 2008, Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i was allowed a 
three minute telephone conversation with his family in the presence of guards, during which he 
appeared to be intimidated. Apart from this phone call Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i had not been allowed access 
to his family or a lawyer. Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i suffers from a peptic ulcer, heart problems, and asthma. 
</p>
<p>1199. Mr. Ghaza&#8217;i has published articles on the internet and written books about gender identity 
and has translated into the Persian language books on the subject, which are banned in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>1200. In view of his reported incommunicado detention concerns were expressed as to 
Mr. Amin Ghaza&#8217;i&#8217;s physical and mental integrity and his state of health. 
</p>
<p>1201. Further concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Amin Ghaza&#8217;i might 
solely be connected to his reportedly peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and 
association. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1202. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>

Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
situation of Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi, two members of the One Million 
Signatures Petition Campaign, which calls for an end to discriminatory laws against women in 
Iran. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1204. According to the information received, on 14 February 2008, Ms. Asgarizadeh and 
Ms. Khosravi were arrested in Daneshjoo Park in Teheran, while collecting signatures in support 
of the Campaign&#8217;s petition. They were then taken to Tehran&#8217;s police station n&#176;129 (Jaami) and 
later transferred to the security police station number 8 for interrogation. Upon completion of 
their interrogation, they were transferred to the Vozara detention centre. 
</p>
<p>1205. On 15 February, Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi were charged by the Revolutionary 
Court with &#8220;propaganda against the state&#8221;. They were then transferred to Evin prison as they 
were unable to provide the requested bail of $22,000. Concern was expressed that the arrest, 
detention and charging of Ms. Asgarizadeh and Ms. Khosravi may be linked with their 
non-violent activities in defense of women&#8217;s rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>1206. Further concern was expressed at the campaign of harassment against women human 
rights activists involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1207. By a letter dated 4 March 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;The existing laws and regulations in connection with women, in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, which are guaranteed and safeguarded by anticipated legal instruments

</p>
<p>1210. Equal Pay: in Article 38 of the labor Code, adopted on 24 October 1989 also ratified by 
the Sate Expediency Council on 20 November 1990, the need for the above equality and 
non-discrimination is expressed explicitly as follows: &#8216;Equal wages shall be paid to men and 
women performing work of equal value in a work-place under the same conditions. Any 
discrimination on the basis of age, gender, race, ethnic origin and political and religious 
convictions shall be prohibited.&#8221; Violations of these provisions shall be punished in accordance 
with Article 174 of the labor Code. 
</p>
<p>1211. Political Social and Cultural Participation: Women in Iran are active in social and 
political life of the country and have high profiles in the official governmental positions The 
most notable are: a number of members of the Parliament, Vice-President for Environment, 
Adviser to the President on women&#8217;s affairs, Advisers to the Ministers of interior, Health, Higher 
Education and Labor, Director General for Human Rights (in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), 
Adviser to the head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, a number of Directs General in 
Government Ministries, as well as many executives in the public and private sectors. Recently 
the Ministry of Higher Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced that there are no 
gender restrictions choosing various disciplines in the universities. In fact, women in Iran are 
among the leading university students in engineering a medicine. The majority of teachers are 
women who are extreme active in education. 
</p>
<p>1212. Rights and Special Privileges of Women in Magnate: According to the Islamic tradition, 
as well as regulations the Islamic Republic, women constitute a willing partner marriages and 
their consent is required both for the initiation as for the termination of this institution. 
Furthermore, a number of provisions in Iranian legal system are geared to guarantee economic 
well-being and independence married women, including: the wife can independently do what she 
likes with her or property; immediately after the marriage ceremony the wife becomes the owner 
of the Dowry and can dispose of it in any way and manner that she may like; the alimony of the 
wife is born entirely by the husband - the alimony includes dwellings clothing food, furniture in 
proportion to the situation of the wife, on a reasonable basis, a provision of a servant if the wife 
is accustomed to have servants or she needs one because of illness or physical handicap. The 
same is true in the case of a divorced wife during the period of &#8220;Eddeh&#8221; or when she is pregnant </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 216 
 
</p>
<p>by her husband until her child is born; Maintenance of children is the duty of the father; 
Article 111 of the Civil Code provides that: &#8220;The wife can refer to the court if her husband 
refuses to provide her maintenance. In such a case, the court will fix the amount and will compel 
the husband to pay it.&#8221; If the enforcement of the provisions of the foregoing is impossible or the 
husband is unable to provide for the maintenance of the wife, the wife can refer to the judge 
applying for divorce and the judge will compel the husband to divorce her. According to 
Article 105 of the Islamic Punishment Law, &#8220;Any financially capable person, who refuses to pay 
his wife&#8217;s maintenance, while the latter fulfills her matrimonial duties, will be sentenced by the 
court&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1213. Right to Divorce and Community Property Rights: According to legislation enacted 
through Parliamentary procedure in Iran, the divorce does not take place simply on the basis of a 
request by the husband; rather it should be based on a decision by a competent court and through 
a legal procedure. The consent of the wife is required in divorce cases. Furthermore, the wife has 
the right to seek divorce through the same procedure. If the court finds that the husband is asking 
for a divorce without legitimate cause, he is required to pay for all his wife&#8217;s work at home as 
determined by the court. In addition, in such a case, the court could rule for equal division of 
property, registered in husband&#8217;s name.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1214. The Government also provided detailed information concerning new developments in the 
realm of Iranian women affairs. 
</p>
<p>1215. The Government informed that &#8220;the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s national human rights 
policy is based on the Constitution which is inspired by the Islamic principles and is in full 
compliance with its commitments arising from international instruments and duly respects the 
internationally accepted human rights values and Standards. The principles, prevailing the 
human rights policy, enshrined in the National Development Programs, clearly represent 
vigorous attempt aimed at Human Rights, mainstreaming and stipulating full respect for the 
status and the inherent dignity of human beings from the Islamic perspectives as well as full 
respect for the citizens&#8217; rights. These programs have been designed in a manner to adequately 
address all economic, social, cultural and civil and political rights of citizens including the rights 
to development and provide to the full extent possible, the effective enjoyment of the said rights 
and their promotion and protection. To this end, the Islamic Republic of Iran while reviewing, 
amending and updating the existing regulations has taken measures for legislations of new and 
additional new regulations. Simultaneously, creation of national human rights institutions and 
bodies has effectively been pursued. 
</p>
<p>1216. To accomplish the goals of National Development Programs, development of different 
approaches for national capacity building, strengthening of national institutions, human rights 
education and further attention to the economic, social and cultural rights particularly rights to 
development has been foreseen. To this end, strengthening of civil society, fostering an 
environment conducive for enhancement of national human rights mechanism such as standing 
human rights committee in judiciary, Article 90 commission within the Parliament, organization 
of National Ombudsman, Bar Association. Department of Administrative Justice and Islamic 
Human Rights Commission as well as drafting and implementation of Citizen&#8217;s Rights bill have 
been accomplished.&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 217 
 
</p>
<p>1217. The Government informed that &#8220;the Islamic Republic of Iran is also faced with certain 
shortcomings and difficulties, the roots of which are generally developmental questions and 
imposition of economic sanctions and application of unilateral policies by certain countries 
during the past quarter of century. In spite of the aforementioned obstacles, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran within the context of its National Development Programs is committed to take the 
necessary measures to uphold the highest standards and promotion and protection of the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of all citizens, realization of which is not only dependent on the 
national endeavors, it is also interlinked with the international support and cooperation 
particularly with regard to realization of the right to development, as stipulated in the 
&#8220;Declaration on the Right to development. 
</p>
<p>1218. The importance of role and contribution of civil society in different fields particularly 
issues pertaining to human rights policy through provision of their consultative views has 
precisely and completely been foreseen, and reiterated in National Development Programs. 
Furthermore the necessity of continuation of empowerment policy of NGOs has also been 
underlined in the said program. The vigorous pursuance of enabling policy has led to 
establishment or enhancing of scope of activities of some 2000 NGOs throughout the country as 
well as facilitating the acquiring of international consultative status for 16 Iranian NGOs. 
Furthermore, convening of different seminars and workshops relating to different aspects of 
NGOs&#8217; activities in collaboration with foreign counterparts at local, national and regional levels 
are yet another tangible result of above-mentioned policies. 
</p>
<p>1219. In spite of all the above-mentioned plans and activities, which have already opened new 
horizons, there are efforts made by some women to belittle the achievements. They have been 
gathering signatures from women for fiur~her/equa~ rights for women. Those individuals, 
instead of bringing Heir efforts, talents and energy together in the context of the already existing 
NGOs or a new legally-established NGO, have unfortunately resorted to malicious moves such 
as claiming to be human rights defenders who are opposed by the Iranian Government and so on. 
The Government and pertinent organizations have repeatedly announced that they would 
welcome and support any individual or organization who/which genuinely desires to work 
toward empowerment of women in the Iranian society. We do not believe that bossing or 
bullying around would bring about any assistance or solution to problems. At the same time, 
neither the Government nor the people of Iran may tolerate and watch silently and indifferently 
those who might dream to hinder or hurt advancement of the society, particularly advancement 
and empowerment of women, who have been genuinely and whole-heatedly sacrificing 
themselves for their sublime Godly causes, under the disguise of empty slogans and abuse of 
internationally recognized and respected human rights instruments.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1220. To conclude, the Government informed that Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and 
Ms. Nasim Khosravi Moghaddam were arrested and charged with disturbing public order. The 
investigating court dropped the charge against them on 19 August 2008, stating that they had not 
premeditated a disturbance and that their activity was originally peaceful. The two individuals 
were treated on the basis of the rule of law and they enjoyed all their rights.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1222. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent 
an urgent appeal regarding the arrest of Mr. Reza Daghestani, an Azerbaijani rights activist, at 
his family&#8217;s house in the city of Oroumiye. Mr. Reza Daghestani is the editor of a student 
newsletter, Chamlibel, published in both Azerbaijani Turkic and Persian and he has written for 
several other publications; he started a series of Azerbaijani Turkic classes in the town of 
Naghadeh and established groups to organize peaceful demonstrations in the province of 
West Azerbaijan in connection with International Mother Tongue Day on 21 February. He was a 
member of the committee of a campaign group called Urmu Azerbaijan Sesi, which actively 
supported several would-be candidates from Oroumiye who all were disqualified from standing 
for the Majles (parliament) elections to be held on 14 March. 
</p><p>1223. According to information received, during Mr. Daghestani&#8217;s arrest on 21 February 2008, 
his house was searched and his computer, CDs, papers and books were confiscated, along with 
printouts of his newsletters. Mr. Daghestani called his family on 22 February 2008, saying he 
was being held in a detention centre belonging to the Ministry of Intelligence in Oroumiye. 
Mr. Daghestani has had no access to a lawyer and his family. When his family tried to visit him 
on 25 February, they were told that visits would not be allowed until at least 10 March. It is 
feared that Mr. Daghestani may have been tortured to force him to provide information, as 
security forces searched his house a second time on 26 February and appeared to know where to 
find other papers and books. 
</p>
<p>1224. With a view to his incommunicado detention concern was expressed for 
Reza Daghestani&#8217;s physical and mental integrity. Further concern was expressed that his arrest 
and detention of Mr. Daghestani may be related to his non-violent activities in defense of 
Azerbaijani rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1225. By a letter dated 4 March 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;Mr. Reza Daghestani, born in 1981, was arrested on 2 February 2008, under the 
charge of extremist incitement to ethnic feelings and sentiments, organizing of illegal gatherings 
as well as ethnic propagation against other Iranian ethnic groups. Following investigations, he 
was released on bail. On 14 May 2008, the penal court of Oroumiye city sentenced him, in the 
presence his lawyer, Mr. Karim Najafi, to eight month&#8217;s imprisonment, including his earlier days 
of intention. Taking into consideration Mr. Daghestani&#8217;s young age and respecting the Islamic 
affection as weft his lack of criminal record and finally, on the basis of Article 25 of the Islamic 
Penal Code, the remaining of his sentence was suspended. 
</p>
<p>1226. As it was explained, Mr. Daghestani was treated in accordance with the rule of law, 
enjoying the highest level of affection as well as all his legal rights before the court of justice. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 219 
 
</p>
<p>The charges laid down against Mu Daghestani had no connection, whatsoever, with her, if any, 
social human rights activities, and the case was heard and settled in the shortest possible time. 
Therefore any allegations on maltreatment or lack of proper attention to his physical or 
psychological integrity as well as any allegation on threat against his family are baseless, mere 
fabrication of lies aiming at mal-intended objectives as well as an abuse of 
internationally-recognized instruments&#8221;.

<p>1227. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 11 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1228. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, and the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Ms. Khadijeh Moghaddam, a member of 
the Mother&#8217;s Committee of the &#8220;One Million Signatures&#8221; Petition Campaign, which seeks to 
abrogate legal provisions that have adverse effects on women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>1229. According to the information received, Ms. Khadijeh Moghaddam was 
arrested on 8 April 2008 at about 11:00 a.m. at her house by agents of the police, who forced 
their way into her home and refused to show her an arrest warrant. Ms. Maghaddam was then 
transferred to the Eshrat Abad Security Police Station, where she was interrogated during several 
hours, and, from there, to the Revolutionary Court, where she was interrogated by an 
Investigative Judge. 
</p>
<p>1230. During the hearing, Ms. Modghaddam denounced that she had been ill-treated during her 
arrest. She was accused of hosting political meetings in her house and was asked to identify 
members of the Petition Campaign who had participated in the meetings. Subsequently, 
Ms. Moghaddam was charged with &#8220;spreading of propaganda against the State&#8221;; &#8220;disruption of 
public order&#8221; and &#8220;actions against national security&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1231. A temporary arrest order was issued against her and the bail for her release was 
set to 1,000 million Rials. As she declared that she was unable to pay such an excessive amount 
of money, the Investigative Judge ordered her transfer to prison for a week. Ms. Moghaddam is 
currently detained at the Vozara Detention Centre. 
</p>
<p>1232. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and charging of Ms. Moghaddam may 
be linked to her peaceful activities in defense of women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1233. By a letter dated 28 April 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;Upon the several complaints filed by neighbours of Ms. Khadijeh Moghaddam, 
stating that she had been constantly disturbing the tranquillity of her neighbours by causing noise </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 220 
 
</p>
<p>and other disturbances, an officer from the local police office calls on Ms. Moghaddam to advise 
her not to cause problem for her neighbours; but as a result of her heedless reaction and obtrusive 
behaviour, she was arrested by the police officer and taken to police station. According to the 
existing report she was released on the same day, upon her expression of regret, and no judicial 
action was taken against her. 
</p>
<p>1234. There is much to be regretted that such an incident is maliciously reported to the Special 
Procedure and then reflected to us as &#8220;arrest by agents of the police&#8221;, &#8220;transferred to security 
police station&#8221; and etc. The charges laid down against Ms. Moghaddam had no connection, 
whatsoever, with her, if any, social/human rights activities, and the case was immediately settled. 
Any allegation on maltreatment or lack of proper attention to her integrity is baseless and mere 
fabrication of lies aiming at abusing the existing instruments.&#8221; 
</p>

<p>1235. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 15 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1236. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Vice-Chairperson of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Behrooz Karimizadeh, Peyman Piran, Ali Kantouri and Majid Pourmajid, four students and 
members of the organisation &#8220;Students Seeking Freedom and Equality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1237. According to information received, three of the four students were arrested in 
December 2007, apparently to prevent demonstrations to commemorate the &#8220;Students Day&#8221; on 
7 December 2007. Behrooz Karimizadeh was arrested on 2 December 2007 by Ministry of 
Information agents at the house of a friend in Tehran; Peyman Piran was arrested on 
4 December 2007 by plainclothes agents from the Ministry of Information as he was leaving 
Tehran University campus following a peaceful demonstration; and Ali Kantouri was arrested 
approximately two weeks later in the town of Ghazvin. Behrooz Karimizadeh and Peyman Piran 
are being detained in Units 209 and 305 in Evin prison in Tehran, and Ali Kantouri is detained in 
Ghezel Hesare near Tehran. Bail was refused for Mr. Kantouri, and prohibitively high bail was 
set for Mr. Piran and Karimizadeh. 
</p>
<p>1238. Majid Pourmajid was arrested on 29 March 2008 in Tabriz; he was hospitalized 
three days after his arrest and transferred two days later from the hospital to an undisclosed 
location by the authorities. Since then his whereabouts are not known. 
</p>
<p>1239. The four students are accused of taking part in &#8220;armed activities&#8221; and &#8220;forming groups 
against the State&#8221;. Their lawyers have not yet had access to their clients or their files. The 
detained students are reportedly being subjected to long periods of solitary confinement and 
physical and psychological ill-treatment. Approximately 40 students were arrested since 
December 2007, and all except these four were later released, some of them alleging that they 
were ill-treated during their detention. </p>

</p>
<p>1240. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Behrooz Karimizadeh, 
Peyman Piran, Ali Kantouri, and Majid Pourmajid may be linked to their non-violent activities in 
defense of human rights, in particular in the exercise of their right to freedom of expression and 
assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1241. By a letter dated 28 April 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;In the Islamic Republic of Iran, all walks of life have been enjoying their 
extensive social and political liberties, and exclusive extra concessions are provided to university 
students through special regulations, observing the civil and social rights of students on the basis 
of national and international norms, laws and regulations. We also wish to draw the kind 
attention of the Honourable Rapporteurs to the fact that all countries have adopted special 
measures for management of student activities, and I.R. Iran is not an exception to the rule. The 
Iranian authorities consider student social and political moves as positively as possible and 
particularly with due consideration of the million-numbered students in Iranian universities, they 
have helped them with and welcomed their free movement and enjoyment of their legitimate 
rights with considerable tolerance. Therefore, we hope that the issue of gatherings and activities 
of Iranian students in Iran is not politically-misinterpreted or to be considered as a grave concern 
of the pertinent authorities. 
</p>
<p>1242. On the basis of investigations, the mentioned individuals in the communication are not 
students and they had resorted to illegal instruments, violation and extremism and started their 
activities through establishment of illegal organization with extremist Marxist inclinations, 
named Hekmatism, Azadi guard branch. Aiming at creating insecurity in the country, the 
organization had set up a military branch, disguised under the umbrella of student activities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1243. The Government also provided the following information: &#8220;Hekmatism, which 
sometimes introduces itself as a party, was created with extremist Marxist and ideas and 
subversive intentions, inter alia through armed struggle. The abused their civil rights and through 
organizing covert meetings and committees of actions (terminology used by its members), and 
with the intention sabotage actions throughout the country inter alia disturbing public order and 
causing of riots, intended to achieve their illegitimate objectives. 
</p><p>1244. On 4 December 2007, the un-normal behavior of the four individuals mentioned in the 
communication (Behrouz Karimzadeh, Peyman Piran, Ali Kantouri and Majid Pourabdollah (not 
pourmajid) who had participated in a gathering in commemoration of the Day of Student, made 
police officers suspicious. Consequently they were arrested and the investigations revealed the 
following. 
</p>
<p>1245. Mr. Peyman Piran, from the city of Mahabad, whose parents are living out of the country, 
had been expelled from the university of Tehran, and he had had a record of arrest for acts of 
extremism with leftist Marxist inclinations in relation with Hekmatism (sometimes also 
self-declared as the communist workers party of Iran) with armed struggle policies. 
</p>
<p>1246. Mr. Behrouz Karimizadeh from the city of Mahabad, who had been expelled from the 
University of Tehran, and Mr. Ali Kantouri, from the city of Qazvin, with records of illegal </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>activities, extremist leftist inclinations, acts leading to public disorder, destruction of public 
property and one case of blackmail (record of kidnapping a child in the city of Sanandaj, 
Kurdistan province, and receiving of 200 thousand dollars from the child&#8217;s parents to release 
their child) were both actively involved in the armed activities of Azadi guard of Hekmatism. 
</p>
<p>1247. Majid Pourabdollah: He has had records of illegal activities, extremist leftist inclinations, 
acts leading to public disorder, destruction of public property and actively participated in 
implementation of armed activities policies of Hekmatism. The mentioned individuals were 
charged with: 1. Founding an extremist group with the objective of disturbing security of the 
country, 2. Propagation against the state in favour of the hostile groups (extremist Marxists with 
armed struggle policies). Their cases were referred to branch 15 of the penal court and later on 
they were released on bail. Their cases are not finalized yet. 
</p>
<p>1248. Charges laid down against the above-mentioned individuals have had no connection, 
whatsoever, with their peaceful social/human rights activities. All the individuals enjoyed their 
rights as well as having access to the existing services and facilities, similar to any other 
individual under detention. Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and Ms. Mahnaz Parakan were the lawyers 
of the individuals. Any allegation on maltreatment or lack of proper attention to their physical or 
psychological integrity is baseless and mere fabrication of lies aiming at mal-intended objectives 
through abusing the existing international human rights instruments. It is noteworthy that 
according to the latest information, Mr. Karimzadeh and Mr. Piran have illegally left the country 
and are seen in northern Iraq.&#8221;

<p><b>Observations

<p>1249. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1250. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent appeal 
regarding the situation of Mr. Ali Muhaqiq Nasab, editor of the monthly Kabul-based magazine 
Haqoq-e-Zan (Women&#8217;s Rights). Mr. Nasab has written a number of articles and books which 
are considered to be controversial both in Afghanistan and Iran. One of them deals with the issue 
of whether the Islamic Revolution of Iran and its theological developments apply to all Shias - 
including Afghan Shias - or if it applies only to those in Iran. Mr. Nasab was the subject of an 
urgent appeal sent to the Government of Afghanistan by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 6 October 2005. 
</p>
<p>1251. According to information received, on 4 March 2008, Mr. Ali Muhaqiq Nasab was 
arrested by Iranian officials at his home in Qom. He was then transferred to a detention facility 
in Tehran, where he has been held without charge. At the time of his arrest, a computer, mobile 
phones and documents were confiscated. Mr. Nasab&#8217;s wife was denied access to or any 
information about him. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 223 
 
</p>
<p>1252. Mr. Nasab was sentenced to two years of imprisonment in Afghanistan in October 2005 
on charges of blasphemy related to the publication of articles in Haqoq-e-Zan questioning harsh 
penalties for adultery and theft which were judged to be &#8220;anti-Islamic&#8221;. The sentence was 
reduced on appeal to six months of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>1253. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Nasab might be solely 
connected to his reportedly peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and to religion. 
</p>
<p>1254. In view of his reported incommunicado detention without charge, further concern was 
expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1255. By a letter dated 28 April 2009, the Government responded to the letter of 
allegations, providing the following information: &#8220;according to the time-consuming efforts and 
the reports received from all prisons throughout the country, there are two Ali Mohaqiq Nasab, 
both of whom are Afghan citizens, recognized in the city of Qom, by pertinent authorities. 
</p><p>1. Mr. Ali Mohaqiq Nasab, son of Gholamhossein, born in 1957. A complaint was 
filed against him by his wife, claiming that he had not been paying alimony, and also 
destroying the belongings of his wife. Their case was settled in the pertinent family court. 
2. Mr. Ali Mohaqiq Nasab, son of Khademhossein, born in 1958. He was arrested on 
25 May 2008, charged with illegal entry into the country and sent back to Afghanistan four days 
later. We could not establish any relation between the two individuals and the allegations made 
through the communication of the Special Rapporteurs.&#8221; 
</p>

<p>1256. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1257. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Vice-Chairperson of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Ms. Rugeyye Leysanli 
(or Lisanli), wife of the activist for the rights of Iranian Azeri Turks, Mr. Abbas Leysanli, who 
has been the subject of two joint urgent appeals by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
22 June 2006, and by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 14 November 2006, 
respectively. Both of these communications have regrettably remained without a reply from the 
Government to date. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 224 
 
</p>
<p>1258. According to the information received, Ms. Rugeyye Leysanli was arrested at her 
home on 12 April 2008 at around 1:30 a.m. without a warrant by members of the Iranian secret 
police (Ettelaat), who searched the house and confiscated Ms. Leysanli&#8217;s computer. During the 
arrest and search the officers used force. Her current whereabouts are unknown. Ms. Leysanli 
had been threatened with arrest by authorities on a number of occasions in connection with her 
reporting about allegations of ill-treatment of her husband, who is currently serving a prison term 
in the Yazd province, and it is believed that her arrest was carried out as a deterrent. 
</p>
<p>1259. In view of her reported incommunicado detention and alleged ill-treatment of her 
husband while in detention, grave concern was expressed for Ms. Leysanli&#8217;s physical and mental 
integrity. Further concern was expressed that her arrest and detention may be linked to her 
reportedly non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular her reporting on the 
alleged ill-treatment of her husband. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1260. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1261. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the sentencing to death on appeal of 
Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar, a Kurdish journalist and environmentalist, by Branch No. 1 of the 
Revolutionary Court in Marivan City in the Province of Kordestan. An urgent appeal was sent on 
26 July 2007 on behalf of Hiwa Butimar and his cousin Adnan Hassanpour, a Kurdish journalist 
and cultural rights activist, by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, to which your Government replied on 23 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>1262. According to the information received, Hiwa Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour were 
arrested on 23 December 2006 and 25 January 2007 respectively and reportedly held 
incommunicado in the Ministry of Intelligence facility in Marivan until 26 March 2007, when 
they were transferred to Marivan prison. They were tried on 12 June 2007 on charges of 
espionage and crime of &#8220;Moharebeh&#8221; (enemy of God) and sentenced to death on 17 July, 
although information received indicated that the charges were not supported by evidence. They 
appealed the sentence, and on 23 October 2007 the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence 
against Adnan Hassanpour, while it overturned the sentence against Hiwa Butimar for procedural 
irregularities and sent it back to the Marivan Revolutionary Court for re-examination. 
</p>
<p>1263. According to information received, Hiwa Butimar&#8217;s death sentence was recently upheld 
on appeal. It is reported that the case was referred to the same judge on appeal as the first 
instance judge. </p>

question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. Nashrin Afzali, Ms. Nahid Jaafari, 
Ms. Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh, Ms. Rezvan Moghadam and Ms. Parvin Ardalan, members of the 
One Million Signatures Petition Campaign. This Campaign seeks to abrogate legal provisions 
that have adverse effects on women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>1266. These women&#8217;s rights activists, along with other members of the campaign, were the 
subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and the 
then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 7 March 2007. We regret we have not yet received a response to that communication. 
</p>
<p>1267. In addition, Ms. Ardalan, along with other members of the campaign, was the subject of 
an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to

allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, on 
11 March 2008. While we acknowledge receipt of a reply from your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
to the communication of 16 June 2006, we regret not yet having received a response to the 
communication of 11 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>1268. According to the information received, on 19 April 2008, the 13th Chamber of the 
Tehran Revolutionary Court sentenced Ms. Nasrin Afzali to six months&#8217; suspended 
imprisonment and ten lashes after having found her guilty of &#8220;disruption of public order&#8221; for 
having participated, on 4 March 2007, in a peaceful gathering in front of the Tehran 
Revolutionary Court to mark International Women&#8217;s Day. On 21 April 2008, Ms. Nahid Jaafari 
received the same sentence, on the basis of the same charges. On 29 March 2008,  
Ms. Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh was sentenced to two years&#8217; suspended imprisonment for &#8220;acting 
against national security&#8221; by the 16th Chamber of Tehran Revolutionary Court. 
</p>
<p>1269. On 28 April 2008, Ms. Rezvan Moghadam and Ms. Parvin Ardalan were notified that, 
subsequent to a hearing that took place on 4 February 2008, the Tehran Revolutionary Court had 
sentenced Ms. Moghadam to six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment and ten lashes and 
Ms. Ardalan to two years&#8217; imprisonment on charges of &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;. On 
4 March 2007, the Iranian authorities arrested at least 31 women&#8217;s rights activists, including 
Ms. Afzali, Ms. Jaafari, M. Peyghambarzadeh, Ms. Moghadam and Ms. Ardalan, for staging a </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 226 
 
</p>
<p>peaceful demonstration against the prosecution of six women&#8217;s rights defenders charged with 
criminal offences against public order and security for having organized a peaceful 
demonstration in Haft-e Tir Square of Tehran on 12 June 2006. 
</p>
<p>1270. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Ms. Afzali, Ms. Jaafari, 
Ms. Peyghambarzadeh, Ms. Moghadam and Ms. Ardalan may be directly related to their 
peaceful activities in defense of women&#8217;s rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, in particular 
within the framework of the One Million Signatures Petition Campaign. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1271. By a letter dated 14 April 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information: &#8220;on the basis of the principles 26 and 27 of the constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, any people may enjoy their legitimate right of holding 
gatherings. Those constitutional principals are well observed and every year different types of 
gatherings are held by any walks of life including workers, students, women and etc. through 
coordination and receiving of the required permit from pertinent authorities. Similar to any other 
country around the world, different issues such as avoiding disturbance of people&#8217;s lives and 
peace, observance of public orders, observance of city traffic, observance of citizens&#8217; rights, 
acceptance of the responsibility of the gathering by an individual/group and coordination with 
the police for control and organization of the gathering are the requirements for issuing the 
permit for holding an organized gathering. 
</p>
<p>1272. The organizers of the gathering referred to in the above-mentioned letter, unfortunately, 
did not observe the required elements and committed the following offences: -The individuals 
mentioned in the letter have had no registered or recognized or applied organizational entity and 
have constantly ignored the existing official regulations of the country. The two gatherings had 
not met the legal requirements/permit; no route for their direction of move was introduced; and 
they were held in the very heavy-trafficked square of &#8220;Hafte Tir&#8221; without any coordination with 
traffic police, which resulted in six hours of disorder in one of the busiest squares of the city, 
during a working day. Although the number of people participating in the gathering was about 
eighty people, they were watched by by-passers and the whole ended in blockage of one of the 
main highways on the northern side of Hafte Tir square. 
</p>
<p>1273. According to investigations, there were a group of twenty women as the core participants 
of the gathering and none of them had made earlier coordination with the pertinent city 
authorities for organization of the gathering and prevention of any possible disorder. It is 
noteworthy that every year hundreds of women NGOs who organize gatherings in different parts 
of the country on different issues without any problem did while those twenty women called 
themselves representatives of all Iranian women, with the belief that causing disorder could 
magnify their presence. - Some of those women were arrested merely due to their illegal actions 
and incitement into disorder. 
</p>
<p>1274. Their next illegal gathering was held a few months later on 4 March 2007 in front of the 
court in which their cases were under judicial procedure. The report is as follows: </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 227 
 
</p>
<p>1275. Ms. Nasrin Afzali: according to the report of Tehran police station 106, a number of 
women, carrying placards, gather in front of one of the judicial complexes of Tehran, and in spite 
of police warning they do not disperse and continue with disturbing public order. Thus, 
Ms. Nasrin Khajeh Afzal and four other individuals, who had effective role in disturbance, get 
arrested introduced to one of the investigation branches. The mentioned individual was 
released, on introduction of surety, on 7 March 2007. According to the judgment No. 86/7702 
of 19 March 2007, issued by Branch 13 of the penal court, she was sentenced to six months&#8217; 
suspended imprisonment. The judgment was objected by her defence lawyer, 
Mr. Mohammad Mosaffayi, and later reinstated by branch 21 of the court of appeal through 
judgment No. 876 of 8 September 2008. 
</p><p>1276. Ms. Nahid Jafari: Ms. Jafari was arrested on the same above-mentioned charges and she 
was released, on introduction of surety, on 7 March 2007. According to the judgment No. 5658 
of 4 February 2008, issued be Branch 13 of the penal court, she was sentenced to six months 
suspended imprisonment. The judgment was objected by her decency lawyer, Ms. Arzani, before 
branch 17 of the court of appeal, as a result of which the court acquitted Ms. Jafari of the charges 
laid against her, through judgment No. 401 of 18 June 2008. 
1277. Ms. Zeinab Peyghambarzadeh: Ms. Peyghambarxadeh was arrested for the first 
time, on 27 December 2006, under the charge of disturbing public order and due to lack of prior 
records in courts; she was released on a suspender write of prosecution. But, two months later, 
she was arrested ant charged with disturbing public order and refusal of police order (the report 
of Tehran police station 106) and introduced to the investigation branch. She was bailed out on 
7 March 2007 According to the judgment No. 4209 of 2 December 2007, issued by Branch 13 of 
the penal court; she was sentenced to two years suspended imprisonment. The judgment was 
objected by her defence lawyers, Ms. Dadkhah and Ms. Hajar Sabbaghiyan), and later the verdict 
was commuted by branch 31 of the court of appeal to one year suspended imprisonment, through 
judgment No. 758 of 18 August 2008. 
1278. Ms. Rezvan Moghaddam: Ms. Moghaddam was arrested under the charges referred to in 
the afore-mentioned cases. She was released on 7 March 2007, on introduction of surety. 
According to the judgment No. 7641 of 5 March 2007, issued by Branch 13 of the penal court, 
she was sentenced to six months&#8217; suspended imprisonment. The judgment was objected by her 
defence lawyers (Soltani and Mahnaz Parakan), and later reinstated by branch 21 of the court of 
appeal through judgment No. 877 of 8 September 2008. 
1279. Ms. Marvin Ardalan: Ms. Ardalan was charged as the other four women, and she was 
released on introduction of surety, 17 March 2007. According to the judgment No. 4029 of 
17 November 2007, issued by Branch 13 of the penal court, she was sentenced to two years&#8217; 
suspended imprisonment. The judgment was objected by her defence lawyer, which is under 
review by the pertinent court of appeal. 
</p>
<p>1280. As it was described, a. all of the mentioned individuals were released; b. none of them 
was sentenced to imprisonment, c. only three individuals, who didn&#8217;t have records, were 
sentenced to six months suspended imprisonment, d. the suspended imprisonment verdicts were 
issued merely to deter the individuals to abide by the rule of law and public order which are to be 
observed for the good of the society. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 228 
 
</p>
<p>1281. We would also like to mention that the sentences issued for the abovementioned 
individuals have had nothing to do with their activities in defence of human rights or any other 
peaceful activity. Their trial was in accordance with the rule of law and merely in relation with 
their illegal activities. In the Judicial System of the Islamic Republic of Iran, judicial procedure 
on different cases are carried out on the basis of law, disregarding social titles or positions of the 
accused individuals. The afore-mentioned individuals enjoyed all his legal rights before the court 
of justice&#8221;.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 30 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1283. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations 
concerning the arrest and detention of workers of the Haft-Tepeh Sugar factory during a peaceful 
protest in the city of Shush, southern Iran. 
</p>
<p>1284. According to information received, on 26 May 2008, a peaceful gathering attended by 
thousands of workers from the Haft-Tepeh Sugar factory, was violently dispersed by members of 
the security forces and riot police, in the southern Iranian city of Shush. The protest had been 
organised, as part of a series of demonstrations held over a period of 21 days, demanding unpaid 
wages for the previous three months, and to call for the resignation of management and 
representatives of the Intelligence Ministry, as well as an end to the prosecution of many workers 
who have been detained and put on trial. Twelve workers were reportedly detained during the 
demonstration by the authorities and have since been released. 
</p>
<p>1285. According to reports, on 21 May 2008, 26 workers who were planning to join a 
protest against the detention of five colleagues were arrested. All were subsequently released 
on bail; however five of them, including Mr. Fereydoon Nikoofar, Mr. Jalil Ahmadi, 
Mr. Ghorban (Ramezan) Alipour, Mr. Mohammad Heidari Mehr, and Mr. Ali Nejati reportedly 
face possible prosecution. In addition, Mr. Abolfazl Abedini Nasr is reportedly under 
prosecution for covering their protests. Previously, on 8 April 2008, a protest led by workers&#8217; 
families, including women and children, was intercepted by the security forces, allegedly using 
20 rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowd, whilst beating protesters with batons. According to 
reports, many protesters sustained injuries and at least one person was hospitalised. 
</p><p>1286. Concern was expressed that the afore-mentioned incidents may represent a direct attempt 
to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Iran.

</b></p>
<p>1288. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Mr. Arzhang Davoodi, an engineer and poet. 
</p>
<p>1289. Mr. Davoodi was the subject of urgent appeals sent by several mandate-holders, 
including the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on torture, the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, on 
29 January, 10 and 24 March and 23 August 2004. These appeals, which followed the arrest of 
Mr. Davoodi in October 2003, received responses from Your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
on 10 June and 6 October 2004. 
</p>
<p>1290. According to new information received, on 18 April 2008, Mr. Davoodi began a hunger 
strike in Evin Prison in protest at his detention. Since the beginning of the hunger strike, 
Mr. Davoodi has not received any medical care. Reports indicate that his health has been 
seriously compromised as a result of torture and ill-treatment while in detention. His eyesight has 
been seriously affected and he also suffers from pain in his left shoulder and right knee, a burst 
left eardrum and bleeding gums. Since his initial detention in Evin Prison in 2003 after making 
statements in a documentary which were critical of the Government, Mr. Davoodi has been 
transferred five times in five years. 
</p>
<p>1291. On 27 April, Mr. Davoodi was again transferred to Gohardasht Prison, reportedly after a 
warrant bearing no names and signatures was issued. He has reportedly received threats that a 
case will be fabricated against him and submitted to the court because he is on hunger strike. The 
nature of the charges against Mr. Davoodi, the verdict of the Revolutionary Court and the length 
of his prison sentence remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>1292. Concern was expressed that the continued detention of Mr. Davoodi may be directly 
related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular his exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression. In view of reports of Mr. Davoodi&#8217;s hunger strike and his ill-health, and 
the conditions of his detention, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity.

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 230 
 
</p>
<p>on violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegations concerning 
the arrest and detention of the following nine female human rights defenders, including 
five journalists: Ms. Jila Bani Yaghoub, an online journalist with the daily Sarmayeh and the 
Canon Zeman Irani; Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, member of the One Million Signatures Campaign and a 
regular writer for the website of Change for Equality; Ms. Aida Saadat, of the daily Etemad 
and Change for Equality website; Ms. Farideh Ghayeb and Ms. Sara Loghmani, both 
journalists for Canon Zeman Irani; Ms. Alieh Motalbezadeh, a journalist and photographer; 
Ms. Nasrine Satoudeh, lawyer and women and children&#8217;s rights activist; and women&#8217;s rights 
defenders, Ms. Nahid Mirhaj and Ms. Nafiseh Azad. 
</p><p>1295. According to information received, on 12 June 2008, Ms. Jila Bani Yaghoub, 
Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, Ms. Aida Saadat, Ms. Farideh Ghayeb, Ms. Sara Loghmani, 
Ms. Nasrine Satoudeh, Ms. Nahid Miraj, Ms. Nafiseh Azad, and Ms. Alieh Motalebzadeh were 
arrested by members of the security forces outside the Rahe Abrisham Gallery in Tehran. The 
women had gathered to attend a seminar organised to mark the second anniversary of Iran&#8217;s 
National Day of Solidarity of Iranian Women (an event which first took place in June 2005). On 
arrival at the Gallery, organisers of the event found the door to the building locked. They were 
informed that the seminar had been cancelled by the security forces, a large number of which 
were reportedly present at the scene. Ms. Aida Saadat and Ms. Nahid Miraj remained outside the 
Gallery to inform participants about the cancellation of the seminar, but were arrested at 
approximately 3.00 p.m. When Ms. Nasrin Satoudeh and Ms. Jilla Baniyaghoub made 
enquiries about the arrests of their colleagues, they too were arrested. Ms. Nafisah Azad, 
Ms. Jelve Javaheri, Ms. Sarah Loghmani, Ms. Farideh Ghaeb and Ms. Alieh Motalbezadeh were 
arrested soon afterwards. All were brought to Vozara Detention Centre where they were detained 
for approximately 8 hours before being released in the early hours of the following morning. The 
women are currently waiting to hear whether charges are to be brought against them. 
</p>
<p>1296. On the same day, the police reportedly visited the home of Change for Equality editor 
Ms. Parvin Ardalan. However, she was not in the house at the time and they were unable to 
arrest her. On 2 May 2008, Ms. Parvin Ardalan received a suspended sentence of two years&#8217; 
imprisonment and ten lashings for a period of three years on charges of &#8220;illegal gathering and 
collusion and refusal to obey the orders of the police with the intent of endangering national 
security&#8221;. The charges against her are related to her involvement in the organisation of a peaceful 
demonstration in Hafte Tir Square, Tehran, on 12 June 2006, in protest of discrimination against 
women. 
</p>
<p>1297. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned nine women 
human rights defenders may be linked to their non-violent activities in defense of women&#8217;s 
rights. Further concern was expressed that the afore-mentioned incidents may represent a direct 
attempt to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1298. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 3 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1299. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Mohammad 
Sadegh Kabovand, a Kurdish journalist and former editor of the weekly newspaper 
Payam-e Mardom-e Kurdestan (a Kurdish weekly that was closed down by the authorities 
in 2004). 
</p>
<p>1300. According to information received, on 22 June 2008, Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kabovand 
was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of alleged &#8220;activity against national security&#8221;. 
The sentence was issued by the Tehran Revolutionary Court and is reportedly based on 
Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kabovand&#8217;s involvement in establishing the Organisation for the 
Defence of Human Rights in Kurdistan. The trial was reportedly postponed on three occasions 
since Mr. Kabovand&#8217;s arrest on 1 July 2007, and took place behind closed doors under 
article 188 of the Criminal Code. Article 188 of the Code is applied for trials in which the details 
discussed could offend public morality. 
</p>
<p>1301. Since his arrest Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kabovand has been detained in Tehran&#8217;s 
Evin prison, where he reportedly spent the first five months in solitary confinement. Reports also 
claim that Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kabovand suffers from health problems, including headaches 
and dizzy spells, the most recent of which occurred on 19 May 2008. The medication which he 
has been administered in prison has apparently done little to alleviate his condition. 
Furthermore, Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kabovand Kabovand was reportedly unable to take 
advantage of a provisional release order prior to his trial because his family was unable to raise 
the 150 million toumen (approx. 145,000 euros) requested. 
</p>
<p>1302. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
stifle independent reporting in Iran, thus restricting the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1303. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 11 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1304. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on arbitrary detention, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
members of the One Million Signatures Campaign, Ms. Hana Abdi, Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh 
and Ms. Nasim Khosravi. The One Million Signatures Campaign seeks to change discriminatory 
laws against women and to promote gender equality in Iran. Ms. Hana Abdi is also a member of 
the women&#8217;s rights NGO Azar Mehr. 
</p>
<p>1305. Ms. Hana Abdi was the subject of a joint allegation letter sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women on 19 December 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 232 
 
</p>
<p>Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi were the subjects of a joint urgent appeal 
sent by the same mandate-holders on 22 February 2008. No response to either correspondence 
has yet been received from your Government. 
</p>
<p>1306. According to information received, on 4 July 2008, Ms. Hana Abdi began a five-year 
prison sentence. Her detention started on 4 November 2007, when her computer and pamphlets 
relating to the One Million Signatures Campaign were also confiscated. The sentence was passed 
on 18 June 2008 for &#8220;gathering and collusion to threaten national security&#8221; under Article 610 of 
the Islamic Penal Code. The sentence was reportedly based on interrogations carried out whilst 
Ms. Hana Abdi was in isolated detention and was not allowed access to her lawyer. During her 
detention she was reportedly tortured. An appeal against her sentence was filed by her lawyer. 
The appeals court had not issued a decision in relation to the appeal. 
</p>
<p>1307. On 20 July 2008 Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi were scheduled to 
appear in court. They were arrested on 14 February 2008 while collecting signatures as part of 
the One Million Signatures Campaign. The following day they were charged with &#8220;propaganda 
against the state&#8221; and transferred to Evin prison. 
</p>
<p>1308. Concern was expressed that the prison sentence of Ms. Hana Abdi and the trial of 
Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms. Nasim Khosravi may be related to their work in the defense 
of human rights, in particular their work to defend the rights of women in Iran. Concern was also 
expressed about the allegations of ongoing harassment of women human rights defenders 
involved in the One Million Signatures Campaign in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1309. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 14 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1310. On 14 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal 
regarding Mr. Mohamad Sadigh Kaboudvand, journalist and President of the Association for the 
Defence of Human Rights in Kurdistan. Mr. Kaboudvand was the subject of two urgent appeals 
sent on 22 September 2006 and on 10 July 2007, for which no response has been received. 
</p>
<p>1311. According to information received, in late May 2008, Mr. Mohamad Sadigh Kaboudvand 
was sentenced to eleven years&#8217; imprisonment. A ten-year sentence was issued for &#8220;acting against 
State security&#8221; by establishing the Association for the Defence of Human Rights in Kurdistan, 
and a one-year sentence was added to that for &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;. 
On 19 May 2008, Mohamad Sadigh suffered a stroke and seriously needed medical attention. 
</p>
<p>1312. Mr. Mohamad Sadigh Kaboudvand has been in detention since being 
arrested on 1 July 2007. His home was then searched and property, such as his computer and 
various documents, was confiscated. In 2006, he was given a suspended prison sentence of 
one year and was prohibited from working as a journalist for five years because of his work in 
defence of human rights and articles he had published defending the rights of Kurdish people. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 233 
 
</p>
<p>1313. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Mohamad Sadigh Kaboudvand may be 
related to his work in the defence of human rights, in particular his work to defend the rights of 
Kurdish people. In view of the poor health of Mr. Mohamad Sadigh Kaboudvand, serious 
concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. Concern was also 
expressed by the allegations of ongoing harassment of journalists in the Kurdish region of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1314. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the 
communications of 14 July 2008 and 10 July 2007. The Government noted that 
Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kaboudvand has been enjoying all facilities as well as the existing 
medical services offered by medical centers in and out of prison, as available to any other 
prisoner. He suffered from high blood pressure and therefore he has been regularly visited and 
under constant supervision by skilled cardiologists, nephrologists, neurologists and other 
required specialists. His medical condition is now stable through prescribed medications. Latest 
medical tests confirmed that Mr. Kaboudvand is in stable condition. 
</p>
<p>1315. The Government further noted that the prison sentence for Mr. Kaboudvand has not been 
in relation with his activities in defence of human rights or any other peaceful activity. Any 
allegation of maltreatment or lack of proper medical attention to his physical or psychological 
integrity is baseless. His trial was in accordance with the rule of law and merely in relation with 
his illegal activities. The allegations in defence of the Kurdish people are not but an instrument 
to cover his mal-intended activities, and deceiving international human rights bodies. 
Mr. Kaboudvand also enjoyed all his legal rights before the court of justice. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1316. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1317. On 31 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Qulamriza Nejefi, aged 36; 
Mr. Hemid Valai, aged 27, a university graduate of law and an associate of the Association of 
Southern Azerbaijani Academics; Mr. Vedud Esedi, aged 28, a student reading geology at the 
Open University in Rasht, former student in the Open University in Ardebil, former 
Secretary-General of the Islamic Student Society and Director of the students&#8217; publication 
&#8220;Seher&#8221;; Mr. Sejjad Radmehr, aged 26, student of mechanical engineering; Mr. Aydin Khajei, 
aged 23; Mr. Feraz Zehtab, aged 23, both students reading law and members of the 
Islamic Student Society at Tabriz University; Mr. Dariyush Hatemi, aged 29, student; and 
Mr. Shahrukh Hatemi, aged 27, dentistry student in Turkey, all of them activists supporting 
cultural rights of Iranian Azerbaijanis. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 234 
 
</p>
<p>1318. According to the information received, the above mentioned persons have been arrested 
and detained without indictment or trial since 5 June 2008 together with other individuals, whose 
identities are not yet known. They are being held in incommunicado detention without access to 
lawyers and have not been allowed visits by their relatives. 
</p>
<p>1319. Mr. Qulamriza Nejefi was arrested at his workplace in Tabriz on 5 June. One of the 
charges brought against him relates to a number of student publications issued under licence, 
which had been found during the searches of his workplace at the time of the arrest. Security 
agents, who then searched his home without a court warrant, confiscated his computer, books, 
CDs and posters. 
</p>
<p>1320. Mr. Nejefi&#8217;s family was unaware of his whereabouts for 15 days when it learned that he 
had been transferred to Tabriz prison, where he is not allowed to receive visits from his relatives. 
It is believed that the shutting down of Mr. Nejefi&#8217;s shop at the Rasta Bazaar in Tabriz despite a 
valid licence was effected by the Ministry of Information&#8217;s Office in Tabriz. 
</p>
<p>1321. Mr. Hemid Valai was detained on 15 June 2008 at the Ministry of Information&#8217;s 
interrogation unit in Tabriz after he had been summoned there. His current place of detention is 
unknown. When family members inquired about his whereabouts with Iranian judicial and 
security authorities they were threatened not to publicise the case. 
</p>
<p>1322. Mr. Valai has been active in defending and researching ethnic rights. His articles have 
been published in a host of Azerbaijani student publications as well as in the &#8220;Dilmaj&#8221;, which 
has recently been banned by Iranian authorities. At the intervention of the Ministry of 
Information he was barred from membership of the bar of judiciary lawyers, despite fulfilling all 
professional requirements. 
</p>
<p>1323. Mr. Vedud Esedi was arrested at his home in Rasht on 22 July 2008 by four security 
agents who confiscated his computer, CDs, books, handwritings, a photo album, a wedding 
video tape and a diary. It is feared that Mr. Esedi has been transferred to Section 209 of the 
Evin Prison in Tehran; however, his family has not been able to establish his exact whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>1324. It is believed that Mr. Esedi&#8217;s arrest is attributed to his wedding ceremony, where the 
colour decorations on his wedding cake coincided with the three colours contained in the 
national flag of Azerbaijan and where folk songs in Azerbaijani Turkic were sung. Mr. Esedi had 
been detained by the Ministry of Information in Tabriz and Ardebil before following his 
participation in the May 2006 demonstrations. He was released after three months and reportedly 
ill-treated while in detention. 
</p>
<p>1325. Mr. Sejjad Radmehr, Mr. Aydin Khajei, and Mr. Feraz Zehtab were arrested by security 
agents on 17 July at Tabriz University. All have been taken to a location undisclosed by the 
Iranian authorities and did not reveal their places of detention during one single short phone call 
they have been allowed to make to their families. It is believed that the men were arrested in 
connection with Mr. Radmehr&#8217;s viva voce of his master thesis. He was only allowed to defend 
his thesis after staging a &#8220;sit-in&#8221; protest in the mosque of the University on 11 May 2008 and a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 235 
 
</p>
<p>hunger strike, and following a signature campaign at Tabriz and Urmiye Universities and the 
publication of open letters sent to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mr. Aydin Khajei 
and Mr. Feraz Zehtab supported Mr. Radmehr during the sit-in protests and had been banned 
from the University for one year before. 
</p>
<p>1326. Mr. Dariyush Hatemi and his brother, Mr. Shahrukh Hatemi, were also arrested by 
security agents on 17 June 2008 at their home in Tabriz. There is no confirmed information on 
their whereabouts and the charges brought against them are unknown. 
</p>
<p>1327. In view of their reported incommunicado detention, grave concerns were expressed as 
regards the physical and psychological integrity of the above mentioned persons. Further concern 
was expressed that their arrests and detention might be solely connected to their reportedly 
peaceful exercise of their right to, in those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities exist, enjoy their own culture or to use their own language, in community with the 
other members of their group. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1328. By a letter dated 20 February 2009, the Government responded to the letter of 
allegations, providing the following information: &#8220;in the judicial System of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, judicial procedures on different cases are carried out on the basis of law disregarding 
social titles, positions, profession, belief or religion and etc. of the accused individuals. Arrest of 
the individuals mentioned in the letters of the honorable Special Rapporteurs, has been as a result 
of their illegal activities and on the basis of charges laid against them in accordance with the rule 
of law. Any allegation stating otherwise, including attribution of their arrest to their belief or 
ideology, is baseless and distortion of realities with the purpose of inciting public opinion for 
politically motivated objectives. 
</p><p>1329. Pursuant to receiving of complaints from a considerable number o individuals of all 
walks of life, by judicial authorities of the country, against a sect oriented organization, 
attributed to Baha&#8217;is under supervision of seven individuals, namely Khanjani, Tvakoli Tizfahm, 
Rezaei, Fariba Kamalabadi, Afif Nafimi and Mahvash Shahriyan. On the basis of the statements 
and evidences provided by the complaints, they had received threats and intimidation from the 
mentioned individuals or their subordinates to join the sect organization. The complaints were, 
furthermore, threatened through interference and men with their private lives and beliefs, to be 
expelled and disconnected from their families and relatives. Following registry of the complaints 
and seriousness of allegations, strict orders were issued, by the pertinent authorities, for carrying 
out through investigations into the case. 
</p>
<p>1330. The result of exhausting investigations on complaints and allegations revealed that the 
afore-mentioned individuals had played an effective role in the occurring and realization of the 
mentioned offences. Through formation of a clandestine and frightful organization, and 
systematic control of the private, social and economic activities of their sect members as well as 
accurate planning and programming for entrapping other people into the sect through abnormal 
and illegal methods including persuasion temptation and threat, they intended to expand their 
illegal organization and ultimately achieve their goals through creating deviant move. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 236 
 
</p>
<p>1331. On the basis of the existing authentic evidences, the organization had received several 
directives from Israel, as the center as well as considerable financial assistance for realization of 
its objectives. Pursuant to the registry of complaints and the result of the alarming investigation 
findings, particularly relation of the illegal organization with a foreign country, the mentioned 
individuals were legally charged and sued, for action against state national security. Therefore 
six of them were arrested on 14 May 2008, on the writ issued by the Tehran Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office. Later the writ was objected and case was referred to the pertinent court. Pursuant to the 
review of the objection the writ was reinstated. 
</p><p>1332. The seventh individual, Ms. Mahvash Shahriyari, who was arrested earlier in 
Mashad city, was transferred to Tehran due to the result of investigations and the statements 
made by the abovementioned individuals on her connection with the dossier under investigation. 
Presently, the preliminary stage of investigations is complete, and the case is referred to the 
competent court. Upon exhaustion of the national judicial procedures, the Special Rapporteurs 
shall be advised of the final verdict.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1333. In the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Geneva, we have been 
receiving letters; inter alia from the special procedures mechanism of the Human Rights Council, 
which express concern over alleged violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Oftentimes, shocking and vitriolic in content, such letters mirror a very horrendous picture of the 
situation of a few individuals or members of illegal groups temporarily detained by the ruling of 
the competent courts. Being cautioned, in the most aggressive and vitriolic terms, against the 
so-called maltreatments against those individuals, we even sometimes, learn through particularly 
some UN human rights mechanisms, about the false threat of imminent death or execution 
thereof. 
</p>
<p>1334. In the spirit of trust and confidence in the lofty aspirations of the United Nations and in 
observance of the legitimate and civil rights of Iranian people, the UN Human Rights 
Mechanisms have always given the benefit of doubt to the expressed concerns. We, however, 
have never been satisfied and convinced if the attitude of the Special Procedure or similar 
mechanisms toward the government of Iran has been in a way proportionate to the alleged 
gravity of the situation of the particular individuals in Iran. For instance, within the last 
two years the OHCHR and the Special rapporteurs embarked on a series of correspondence on 
the situation or arrest of a number of individuals who were treated on the basis of the rule of law. 
Meanwhile, a large number of strongly worded letters to the same effect have been circulated to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>1335. Accountability has been defined as: &#8220;the processes through which an organization makes 
a commitment to respond to and balance the needs and aspirations of stakeholders in its decision 
making processes and activities, and delivers against them&#8221;. As a government who has been the 
target of some malicious campaigns for mere allegations made against it, we would like to 
humbly alert the Special Procedure Mechanism against any politically motivated move&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1336. By a letter dated 12 March 2009, the Government responded provided additional 
information to the Special Rapporteur: </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 237 
 
</p>
<p>1337. &#8220;In the Islamic Republic of Iran, all walks of life have been enjoying their extensive 
social and political liberties, and exclusive extra concessions are provided to university students 
through special regulations, such as the strict in universities limitation imposed on police forces&#8217; 
entry into university campuses. 
</p>
<p>1338. University students enjoy their rights of holding their own gatherings and 
demonstrations. The Islamic Republic of Iran has always been proud of observing the civil and 
social rights of students on the basis of national and international norms, laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p>1339. We also wish to draw the kind attention of the Rapporteurs to the fact that all countries 
have adopted special measures for management of student activities, and IR. Iran is not an 
exception to the rule. The Iranian authorities consider student social and political moves as 
positively as possible and particularly with due consideration of the million-numbered students 
in Iranian universities, they have helped them with and welcomed their free movement and 
enjoyment of their legitimate rights with considerable tolerance Therefore, we hope that the issue 
of gatherings and activities of Iranian students in Iran is not politically-misinterpreted or to be 
considered as a grave concern of the pertinent authorities. 
</p>
<p>1340. All the eight individuals, during their apprehension, have been in contact with their 
families. Any allegation on their incommunicado detention is categorically false and fabricated. 
On the basis of investigations, the mentioned students in the communication have had extremist 
ethnic inclinations and their activities have constantly aimed at creating hatred toward other 
Iranian ethnic groups with the ultimate separatist objectives. They resorted to illegal instruments, 
violation and extremism and even did not hesitate to have contacts with outlawed groups in some 
neighbouring countries, for which the Iranian Government has officially taken measures through 
diplomatic channels. According to the existing information, they started their activities through 
establishment of a literature association named &#8220;Sahand&#8221; without any coordination or 
information of the university&#8217;s vice-chancellor for cultural affairs, which was a requirement. The 
association was merely used as an umbrella for their activities. 
</p>
<p>1341. They also continued with their separatist and extremist ideas through propagating and 
releasing of articles and making of baseless allegations in a Website in Canada, which has been 
established by anti-Iranian groups. Iranian laws do not allow using internet websites, for 
advertisement or propagation issues, which do not observe social morality standards or incite 
public opinion or create discord among ethnic groups. They further developed their activities by 
formation of the illegal group of &#8220;Azoukh&#8221;. They later put their group at the service of the 
separatist and extremist group of &#8220;Gamouh&#8221; which located out of the country, which, in fact, 
alerted the Iranian pertinent authorities to make the necessary investigations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1342. The Government also provided the following information concerning the &#8220;Gamouh&#8221; 
group: &#8220;The group is stationed in USA and Azerbaijan and considers itself as a &#8220;national 
movement for awakening of Azerbaijan&#8221;. It is led by an Iranian, by the name of 
Mr. Mahrnoud Chehregani, who has fled the country. Goumeh is known as an extremist and 
separatist group which has openly announced its goal as establishment of southern Azerbaijan 
government and state as well as separation from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Group, which 
receives financial assistance from foreign countries, has taken extensive measures toward ethnic 
hatred against other ethnic groups of the country, inter alia through propagating extremist 
ideology and literature (such as Fars chauvinism), which is against the existing national law and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 238 
 
</p>
<p>relations as well al international standards. Goals of the &#8220;Azoukh&#8221; Group: the group follows the 
extremist objectives of &#8220;Gasmouh&#8221; group through creating a Weblog and a Website by the 
assistance of Gamouh members and buying of the permit from Canada. They collected particular 
pieces of News on student activities, labour union activities/strikes and other ordinary news of 
the country and reflected and commented them in a way which incited separatist and ethnical 
ideas and unrest. The other activities of Azoukh included: a. providing malintended information 
to all Websites affiliated to terrorist groups which have been hostile to Iran, b. deceiving students 
and formation of covert teams with the objective of separatism and ethnical provocations and 
ultimate overturning of the government, c. distribution of books and written materials on their 
ideas as well as dragging the &#8220;Sahand&#8221; illegal literature association into their activities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1343. In addition, the Government provided the following information about specific cases. 
</p>
<p>1344. Mr. Hamid Valai: Mr. Valai was arrested being charged with acts of 
extremism, disturbing of public order, act against national security, cofounding of 
the illegal group of &#8221;Azoukh&#8221;, with extremist goals. He was released on bail 
(50 million toomans/50 thousand dollars) on 29 October, 2008. He had two lawyers 
Mr. Mahmoudi and Mr. Jamali. There is no final verdict issued yet. 
</p>

is baseless and mere fabrication of lies aiming at mal-intended objectives.&#8221;

Mr. Abdullah Momeni, a human rights defender, and spokesperson for Advar Tahkim Vahdat 
(the Alumni Association of Iran), an organization of student groups. 
</p>
<p>1354. Mr. Abdullah Momeni was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 12 July 2007 by the 
then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
and by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression. No response has yet been received by

<p>1355. According to the information received, on 25 July 2008 Mr. Abdullah Momeni was 
prevented by members of the intelligence services from travelling to Malaysia, to attend the 
Asia-Pacific Forum. Mr. Abdullah Momeni was already prevented in 2007 from travelling to the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</p>
<p>1356. Concern was expressed that the travel ban imposed on Mr. Abdullah Momeni is directly 
related to his activities in defence of human rights. 
</p>

<p>1359. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
execution, sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad, a journalist and activist 
working in defense of the cultural and civil rights of Baluchi peoples in northern Iran. 
Mr. Mehrnehad was a civic activist and the General Secretary of the Youth Association of 
Justice Voice in Zahidan. 
</p>
<p>1360. Mr. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad had been the subject of a previous urgent appeal, 
sent on 15 February 2008 by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. To 
date we have not received a reply to that communication from your Government. 
</p>
<p>1361. According to the new information received, Mr. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was executed 
on 4 August 2008 after his death sentence was approved by the Prosecutor-General of Iran. 
Mr. Mehrnehad was sentenced to death in February 2008, a fact which was confirmed at a press 
conference by Judiciary spokesman Mr. Ali Reza Jamshidi on 19 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>1362. Mr. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was arrested in early May 2007 along with five other members of 
the association after they attended a meeting in the provincial office of Culture and Islamic 
Guidance. The five other men were later released. Five months after his arrest, 
Mr. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was allowed visits from his lawyer and his family who alleged that he 
had been tortured, had lost about 15 kg and was unable to keep his balance. 
</p>
<p>1363. According to the Public and Revolution Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Zahedan, Mr. Mehrnehad 
was accused of being a member of Jondallah (also known as the Iranian Peoples&#8217; Resistance 
Movement) and considered having aided Mr. Abdolmalek Rigi, the head of a Baluchi armed 
group. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was charged with Mohareb (enmity with God) and Mofsed fi&#8217;l arz 
(corruption on earth). </p>

of the civil and cultural rights of the Baluchi people.

the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Massoud Kordpour, founding 
member of the Foundation for Democracy and Human Rights in Iranian Kurdistan, who works 
on human rights and environmental issues. 
</p>
<p>1367. According to the information received, on 8 August 2008 Mr. Kordpour was arrested in 
his home, in Boukan. Allegations against him included &#8220;espionage for foreign powers&#8221;, 
apparently due to interviews he allegedly gave to Kurdish and Farsi language news sources. His 
current places of detention as well as the charges brought against him are unknown. He could be 
being kept in incommunicado detention. 
</p>
<p>1368. Concern was expressed that the detention of Mr. Kordpour at an unknown location may 
be connected to his activities in defence of human rights and his work on minority issues.

</b></p>
<p>1371. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegations concerning 
Mr. Amir Yaghoub-Ali, a member of the Men&#8217;s Committee of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign which calls for gender equality under Iranian legislation and for amendments to laws 
that discriminate against women. 
</p>
<p>1372. According to the information received, on 11 July 2007, Mr. Yaghoub-Ali was arrested 
in Andisheh Park in Tehran while collecting signatures for the One Million Signatures 
Campaign. He was taken to security police station in the park, and was detained there for 5 days. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>On 15 July 2007, Mr. Yaghoub-Ali was transferred to Evin prison, where he was detained until 
his release on bail on 8 August 2007. During his detention in Evin prison, he was allegedly 
interrogated eight times blindfolded, facing a wall, and was harassed several times by the guards. 
During his detention, he was allowed no contact with his family. 
</p>
<p>1373. On 25 May 2008, Mr. Yaghoub-Ali was convicted by the Revolutionary Court on 
charges of &#8220;endangering national security through spreading propaganda against the state&#8221;. He 
was sentenced to one year in prison. 
</p>
<p>1374. Mr. Yaghoub-Ali is currently free on bail, and his sentence is being reviewed by 
Branch 54 of the Appeals Court. 
</p>
<p>1375. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of, and subsequent court proceedings 
against Mr. Yaghoub-Ali may be solely connected to his peaceful activities in the defence of 
human rights, in particular his work on gender equality issues.

</b></p>
<p>1377. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Ms. Mahboubeh Karami, a journalist and active member of the Campaign for Equality, a 
women&#8217;s rights movement in Iran which calls for reform of laws that discriminate against 
women, and a member of the One Million Signatures Campaign in Tehran. Members of the 
One Million Signatures Campaign have been the subject of previous communications sent to 
your Government by mandate holders, the most recent of which was sent on the 11 July 2008, on 
behalf of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>1378. According to information received, on 13 June 2008, Ms. Mahboubeh Karami was 
arrested by plain clothed security officers, who boarded a bus she was travelling on from 
Tajrish Square near Mellat Park, Tehran. Prior to her arrest Ms. Mahboubeh Karami used her 
cell phone to call her mother to tell her that she was on her way home but that the bus was 
delayed in traffic. A short time later, Ms. Mahboubeh Karami reportedly called her mother again 
to tell her that she was being forcibly removed from the bus. Her cell phone was then 
disconnected. 
</p>
<p>1379. Prior to Ms. Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s arrest, a demonstration had taken place near 
Mellat Park in Tehran. The protest had been organised to demonstrate against the arrest, on 
11 June 2008, of Mr. Abbas Palizdar, a member of Iran&#8217;s Majlis&#8217;s (Parliament) Judicial Inquiry 
and Review Committee, who had apparently accused several senior Iranian officials of financial </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 243 
 
</p>
<p>corruption. According to reports, security forces used tear gas and electric shock batons to 
disperse the crowd, and check points were also set up by security forces in Vali Asr Street which 
runs alongside Mellat Park. Several public buses were stopped and boarded by plain clothed 
officers. 
</p>
<p>1380. According to reports, on the day Ms. Mahboubeh Karami was detained, her 
family was unable to ascertain her whereabouts despite enquiries made by her brother at 
Vozara detention centre. The following day, a fellow passenger who had been on the bus with 
Ms. Mahboubeh Karami returned her bag to her family, informing them that all the women on 
the bus had been removed by security officers, and that seemingly none of them had been 
involved in any demonstration. 
</p>
<p>1381. On 14 June 2008, the Head of Tehran&#8217;s Judiciary reportedly issued a press statement 
declaring that 200 people had been arrested the previous day and that those who were innocent 
or were suspected of committing only minor offences would learn about the status of their cases 
within a week. On 25 June, Ms. Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s mother received a call from her daughter 
from Evin Prison saying that she was being held along with 90 other alleged female protesters. 
On 6 July, Ms. Mahboubeh Karami along with nine other women reportedly went on hunger 
strike to protest about the prison conditions. At that time they were all being held in a section 
of Evin Prison where detainees are not permitted visits. The protest ended after the other 
nine women were all released by 25 July. Ms. Mahboubeh Karami remained in detention but was 
moved to a &#8216;general&#8217; section of Evin Prison, and has since been allowed weekly visits from her 
family. 
</p>
<p>1382. According to reports, Ms. Mahboubeh Karami has been charged with &#8220;acting against 
national security,&#8221; and the Revolutionary Court in Mahabad has scheduled her next hearing for 
1 November 2008. Ms. Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s lawyer has reportedly only recently been allowed 
to see the court documents concerning her case, and will shortly meet with her for the first time 
since her arrest. The court set bail of one billion rials (approximately US$ 110,000) 
on 12 July 2008. However, Ms. Mahboubeh&#8217;s family has been unable to raise such a large 
amount. 
</p>
<p>1383. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may be in relation to 
Ms. Karami&#8217;s involvement in the Campaign for Equality and the One Million Signatures 
Campaign and may represent an attempt to prevent freedom of assembly and expression.

<p>1385. On 2 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding Mr. Yosef Azizi Bani Turfi, a journalist and a founding member of Iranian PEN. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 244 
 
</p>
<p>1386. According to the information received, Mr. Yosef Azizi Bani Turfi was 
sentenced to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment on 20 August 2008. He was charged with &#8220;acting against 
national security&#8221;, &#8220;incitement to rebellion&#8221; and &#8220;relations with foreign officials&#8221;. Mr. Bani Turfi 
had been initially arrested on 25 April 2005, and released on bail to await trial on 28 June 2008. 
Currently he is awaiting appeal. 
</p>
<p>1387. Mr. Yosef Azizi Bani Turfi is the author of several books. He worked as a journalist for 
the daily &#8220;Hamshari&#8221; for over 12 years. His persecution allegedly started after he exposed the 
excessive use of force used during demonstrations against Arab speaking Iranians. His daughter, 
Hanan, was banned from postgraduate study at Tehran University. 
</p>
<p>1388. Concern was expressed that the charges against, and the sentencing of Mr. Yosef Azizi 
Bani Turfi, is connected to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, especially in the 
area of the rights of Arab speaking communities in Iran. Further concern was expressed 
regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Yosef Azizi Bani Turfi and members 
of his family.

Ms. Zeynab Bayzeydi, a women&#8217;s rights activist and member of the Human Rights Organization 
of Kurdistan, and the Campaign for Equality, a network of individuals working to end legal 
discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>1391. According to the information received, Ms. Bayzeydi had been sentenced to four years&#8217; 
imprisonment and internal exile in Zanjan in August 2008 by the Mahabad Revolutionary Court. 
This sentence was upheld on 23 August 2008 by an appeal court in West Azerbaijan. Charges 
against Ms. Bayzeydi included &#8220;being a member of unauthorized human rights associations&#8221; and 
participating in the Campaign for Equality.

<p>1394. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the

regarding the sentencing of Ms. Parvin Ardalan, Ms. Nahid Keshavarz, Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, and 
Ms. Maryam Hosseinkhah, all members of the One Million Signatures Campaign. Mandate 
holders have sent several communications regarding members of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign. For instance, on 7 March 2007, a communication was sent about the arrest of all four 
of the aforementioned women, together with many other women human rights defenders, 
following a peaceful gathering. No response has yet been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p>1395. According to new information received, on 2 September 2008, Ms. Parvin Ardalan, 
Ms. Nahid Keshavarz, Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, and Ms. Maryam Hosseinkhah were sentenced to 
six months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;publishing information against the State&#8221; after having written 
articles for Zanestan and Tanir Bary Barbary, two online newspapers which defend women&#8217;s 
rights in Iran. Their sentences have since been appealed and they have been released on bail. 
</p>
<p>1396. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Ms. Parvin Ardalan, Ms. Nahid Keshavarz, 
Ms. Jelveh Javaheri, and Ms. Maryam Hosseinkhah may have been related to their work in the

on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of migrants, sent an urgent appeal concerning Dr. Mehdi Zakerian, a scholar of international 
relations and international law, chair of the International Studies Association of Iran (ISAI), also 
known by its French name and acronym Association iranienne des &#233;tudes internationales (AIEI), 
an independent body aimed at promoting the teaching, research and debate on international 
relations. 
</p>
<p>1400. According to the information received, Dr. Zakerian, was arrested on or 
around 15 August 2008. The exact circumstances of his arrest and the place of detention where 
he is being held are not known. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 246 
 
</p>
<p>1401. His family has been permitted to meet him only once, on 6 or 7 September, at Branch 12 
of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran under the supervision of court officials. Since then 
Dr. Zakerian has not been in contact with them. It is unclear whether this meeting was meant as 
an official courtroom appearance, since Dr. Zakerian has been accused of offences relating to 
national security including espionage, but has not formally been charged. During the meeting 
Dr. Zakerian appeared to be weak. 
</p>
<p>1402. It is believed that Dr. Zakerian&#8217;s detention might be an attempt to prevent him from 
travelling to the United States of America to take up a new post at the University of 
Pennsylvania as he was awaiting his visa when he was detained. Dr. Zakerian used to be an 
assistant professor at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran until September 2007, when he was 
dismissed from the post without explanation. He had taught for more than 10 years, holding 
posts at a number of important Iranian universities, and has written numerous articles. 
</p>
<p>1403. In view of Dr. Zakerian&#8217;s reported incommunicado detention at an undisclosed place of 
detention, grave concern was expressed as regards his physical and mental integrity. Further 
concerns were expressed that his detention might be solely connected to his reportedly peaceful 
exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and of his right to 
freely leave any country, including his own.

</b></p>
<p>1405. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Adnan Hassanpour, a 
journalist, an advocate of cultural rights for the Kurdish people in Iran, and a former member of 
the editorial board of the Kurdish-Persian journal, Aso (Horizon), which was shut down by the 
Iranian authorities in August 2005. On 25 August 2008, Mr. Adnan Hassanpour began a hunger 
strike, with 130 Kurdish prisoners in Iran, in protest against human rights violations such as 
torture. 
</p>
<p>1406. According to new information received, on 3 September 2008, Branch 32 of the Supreme 
Court overturned Mr. Adnan Hassanpour&#8217;s death sentence because the charges on which he had 
been convicted did not amount to moharebeh (enmity with God). However, he will be retried by 
Branch 1 of the Revolutionary Court in Marivan, Kordestan, on charges of espionage. 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour reportedly confessed under duress to the charges brought against him but 
retracted his confession. 
</p>
<p>1407. The Government&#8217;s response received on 23 August 2007, states that the charges against 
both Mr. Adnan Hassanpour and Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar are not related to their work as 
professional journalists. </p>

</p>
<p>1408. While this was acknowledged and the overturning of Mr. Adnan Hassanpour&#8217;s death 
sentence was welcomed, concern was expressed that both his and Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar&#8217;s 
work to defend the rights of Kurdish people in Iran is inhibited as long as there are charges 
against them.

<p>1411. The Special Rapporteur together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. Masouma Kaabi, aged 31, and her 
children Shima&#8217; Nabgan, aged 14; Asia Nabgan, aged 13; Asma&#8217; Nabgan, aged 11; Iyad Nabgan, 
aged 8, and Imad Nabgan, aged 4. Ms. Kaabi and her son Aimad were already the subject of a 
joint communication by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences on 13 April 2006. We acknowledged 
receipt of your Government&#8217;s reply dated 2 June 2006. According to new information received. 
</p>
<p>1412. Ms. Masouma Kaabi and her five children were forcibly returned on 27 September from 
the Syrian Arab Republic to Iran, where they are currently being detained. They were forcibly 
returned despite having registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) in order to seek asylum. The family was scheduled to leave for Denmark where they 
were to reunite with Ms. Kaabi&#8217;s husband and father of her children, Mr. Habib Nabgan. It is 
alleged that the family is solely being detained to force Mr. Nabgan to return to Iran. 
</p>
<p>1413. Mr. Habib Nabgan is a prominent member of the unauthorised organisation with the 
name of &#8220;Lejnat al-Wefaq&#8221; (&#8220;Reconciliation Committee&#8221;). He was resettled as a refugee in 
Denmark two years ago. Ms. Kaabi left Iran with her five children on 7 May 2008 and applied 
for refugee status with UNHCR in Damascus. She had been granted permission by the Danish 
authorities to join her husband. 
</p><p>1414. When Ms. Kaabi, on 9 September 2008, took her five children to the office of Syria&#8217;s 
Immigration Department in order to obtain an exit visa, they were all detained and forcibly 
returned to Iran on 27 September. Upon arrival in Tehran the family was held at a detention 
facility at the airport for one night, and then transferred to a detention facility run by the Ministry 
of Intelligence in Tehran. On around 29 September, the children were separated from their 
mother. All family members were again transferred and taken to another Ministry of Intelligence 
detention facility in Ahvaz, Khuzestan province, where Ms. Kaabi is still being held separately 
from her children. Officers of the Security Services then informed relatives of the place of 
detention of the children. It is alleged that they warned the family members not to ask questions 
about Ms. Kaabi. </p>

</p>
<p>1415. Ms. Kaabi and her youngest son Aimad were previously arrested on 27 February 2006 
and later released on bail. The other four children, and Mr. Nabgan&#8217;s mother, were also arrested, 
however, released the following day. It is alleged that Mr. Nabgan continues to receive threats 
that his family would be ill-treated or even killed if he does not return to Iran. 
</p>
<p>1416. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Kaabi might have been 
carried out solely to put pressure on Mr. Nabgan to return to Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1417. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1418. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami, a human rights defender and journalist. Ms. Sheikholeslami is the 
founder of the Azar Mehr Women&#8217;s Social and Cultural Society of Kurdistan. She is also 
associated with the Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan (HROK), which reports on human 
rights violations committed against ethnic Kurds in Iran. 
</p>
<p>1419. According to the information received, on 4 October 2008, Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami 
was arrested in her home in Tehran allegedly by members of the Iranian security forces. Her 
place of detention was not revealed to her husband until 9 October 2008. She is currently being 
held incommunicado in Section 209 of Evin Prison. 
</p>
<p>1420. Ms. Sheikholeslami underwent heart surgery a month before her arrest, and she is still in 
need of medical attention. Apart from recovering from the heart surgery, she also suffers from 
respiratory problems. Ms. Sheikholeslami was previously arrested in February 2001 for having 
participated in a demonstration in front of the Tehran UN Office, and in January 2002. 
</p>
<p>1421. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Negin Sheikholeslami may be 
related to her activities in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>1422. Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Ms. Sheikholeslami.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1424. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent an urgent appeal concerning the arrest of Ms. Esha Momeni, a member of the 
One Million Signatures Campaign and the branch of the Campaign for Equality in California, 
where she is a student. 
</p>
<p>1425. Various communications have been sent to your Government in relation to members of 
the One Million Signatures Campaign including Ms. Ronak Safarzadeh, Ms. Hana Abdi and 
Ms. Zeynab Beyezidi, all of whom are currently in detention. 
</p>
<p>1426. According to new information received, on 15 October 2008, Ms. Esha Momeni was 
arrested when driving on the Moddaress Highway in Tehran. Security officials who identified 
themselves as traffic police told her that she was being arrested for having illegally overtaken 
another vehicle. She is currently being held in detention in Evin Prison in Tehran although no 
charges have been brought against her and she is reportedly at risk of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>1427. Ms. Esha Momeni had been in Iran for approximately two months when she was arrested. 
During that time she visited her family and conducted research for her Master&#8217;s degree thesis 
on the Iranian women&#8217;s movement. Following her arrest she was taken to the home of her family 
which was searched. Property was confiscated, including Ms. Esha Momeni&#8217;s computer 
and material which was to be used for her thesis such as video recordings of interviews 
with members of the Campaign for Equality in Iran. The officials had a warrant for 
Ms. Esha Momeni&#8217;s arrest and court permission to search the home of her family and confiscate 
property. 
</p>
<p>1428. Following the search on Ms. Esha Momeni&#8217;s family home, she was taken to Section 209 
of Evin Prison. Her family was not allowed to see her but were told that, if they did not 
publicize her arrest, she would be released soon. Nevertheless, on 20 October 2008, when 
Ms. Esha Momeni&#8217;s family again sought information on her case, they were told by officials of 
the Revolutionary Court in Tehran that the case was being investigated and that details 
would not be made public until the investigation was finished. It was only after this that 
Ms. Esha Momeni&#8217;s family publicized her arrest.

<p>1429. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 12 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1430. On 12 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegations 
concerning Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 250 
 
</p>
<p>1431. According to new information received, on 23 September 2008, it was brought to the 
attention of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that the 
candidacy of Messrs. Mohammad Dadkhah and Abdolfattah Soltani, Dr. Hadi Esmailzadeh, and 
Ms. Fatemeh Gheyrat for the board of Iran&#8217;s Central Bar Association has been unfairly 
disqualified. This decision is based on the gozinesh (selection process) regulations, which may 
reduce equality of opportunity and treatment of candidates according to their opinions or 
religious beliefs. As well as contravening international human rights treaties to which Iran is 
party, these measures contravene Article 23 of Iran&#8217;s Constitution which states that &#8220;The 
investigation of individuals&#8217; beliefs is forbidden, and that no one may be molested or taken to 
task simply for holding a certain belief&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1432. Concern was expressed that the disqualification of Messrs. Mohammad Dadkhah and 
Abdolfattah Soltani, Dr. Hadi Esmailzadeh, and Ms. Fatemeh Gheyrat as candidates for the 
board of Iran&#8217;s Central Bar Association. Further concern was expressed that this may form part 
of an ongoing trend of harassment against Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and other members of the 
Centre for Human Rights Defenders in Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1433. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1434. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Ms. Shirin Ebadi, and the closure of the offices of two non-governmental organizations founded 
by her, the Defenders of Human Rights Center and the Center for Clearing Mine Areas. 
</p>
<p>1435. Ms. Ebadi was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers on 14 August 2008; an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 16 April 2008; an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the then Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 11 August 2006; an 
urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the then Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
4 August 2005; an urgent appeal sent by the then Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 13 January 2005 and an urgent appeal sent by the then Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders on 8 December 2003. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1436. According to the information received, on 21 December 2008, around 3:00 p.m., 10 
to 15 uniformed and plainclothes security agents entered the offices of the Defenders Human 
Rights Center, as approximately 300 members, including Shirin Ebadi herself, were preparing to 
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>1437. The security agents were allegedly not in possession of a search warrant. The agents 
videotaped guests arriving to the commemorative event, attacked and intimidated guests and 
prevented them from entering the building. The security agents filmed the premises, made an 
inventory and closed down the office. 
</p>
<p>1438. The prosecutor of Tehran later confirmed the closure of the Defenders of Human Rights 
Center, due to its &#8220;illegal activities&#8221;. According to the Tehran prosecutor&#8217;s office, the Center 
&#8220;was acting as a political party without having a legal permit, had illegal contacts with local and 
foreign organizations and organized news conferences and seminars&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1439. Concern was expressed that the closure of the offices of the Defender of Human Rights 
Center and the Center for Clearing Mine Areas could be related to the legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights of both Mrs. Shirin Ebadi and the non-governmental organizations 
founded by her. Further concern was expressed that the closure of the offices of the Defender of 
Human Rights Center and the Center for Clearing Mine Areas could form part of a broader 
attempt to silence Iran&#8217;s human rights community. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1440. By a letter dated 8 January 2009, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
providing the following information: &#8220;1. The Defenders of Human Rights Centre as a political 
organization (and not a non-governmental organization) had received preliminary permit of 
establishment from the but the Centre had never correctly provided its articles of association or 
its charter for approval legalization by the Commission. Therefore, in accordance with the 
existing laws and regulations, the Centre may not have any type of activities until it receives 
approval of its articles of association as well as its permit for activities. Temporary permits are 
usually issued to NGOs in the I. R. Iran with the purpose of giving the ground for their growth 
following which they will have a short period of time for having their articles of association 
approved for receiving an official permit for their activities. 2. The Commission of Article 10 of 
the Act on Activities of Associations and Parties which consists of representatives from the three 
Branches (two representatives from the Judiciary, two from the Legislative and one from the 
Executives) operates in the framework set by the Act on Activities of Parties and Associations, 
approved on 29 August, 1981 and its rules of procedure, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers on 
20 June, 1982. 3. Despite lacking an official permit for activities, Ms. Ebadi&#8217;s Centre has been 
freely operating in the course of recent years, carrying out freely its activities such as releasing 
statements, writing letters to different local governmental and non governmental organs and 
organizations, holding of meetings and seminars and etc. The pertinent authorities sent the 
required legal Notices to the Centre through letters No. 281/46 dated 20 November, 2005 and 
No. 4/43/104969 dated 16 January, 2006, but the Centre, ignoring the legal requirements, did not 
abide by regulations and continued its activities. 4. Considering the above mentioned 
developments and on the decision of the Commission of Article 10, the Secretariat of the 
Commission released a statement on 1 August, 2006, which stated that since the Centre had not 
duly observed the required regulations (provision of articles of association and its approval by </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 252 
 
</p>
<p>the Commission), any activity under the name of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre would 
be illegal and thus violators would be legally sued. 5. Lack of intention on the side of the Centre 
for taking the required action through the rules of procedure, within the following two years, was 
proved to the Commission and as a result, on 13 December, 2008, the Commission of Article 10 
requested the appropriate judiciary authority, through a letter, to investigate the case. Following 
completion of investigations, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office issued a legal order for sealing and closure 
of the Centre&#8217; office. The order was carried out, on 21 December, 2008, by law enforcement 
officers. 
</p>
<p>1441. We believe that it should not be assumed that winning a Noble Prize or any other award 
brings immunity or impunity, as well as, liberty of doing wrong against the rule of law. 
Ms. Ebadi is well aware of legal requirements for registering her centre, and she is expected, as a 
lawyer, to be a role model for others. The Iranian judicial authorities may not force her to 
provide the required documents if she doesn&#8217;t wish so. And, at the same time, you definitely 
agree, that the Judiciary, as a symbol of law, cannot ignore the prevailing laws and regulations. 
Ms. Ebadi and other members of the center are completely free, on the basis of their rights and 
responsibilities before law to enjoy their freedom of expression. 
</p><p>1442. It should also be said the Centre was simply closed following all the above-mentioned 
developments with due serious consideration of dignity of individuals. According to the reports, 
there was no arrest of individuals nor damages were inflicted to the Centre; and the officers who 
carried out the Prosecutor&#8217;s order presented their identifications. 
</p>
<p>1443. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, firmly believing in the rule of law, as a 
basis for development and progress of the country in different fields, has been under severe 
continuous criticism from different angles, including local NGOs, for, as they say, treating the 
Centre with an exceptional courtesy, and for its being tolerant and lenient with the Centre&#8217;s 
activities, while it has not abided by laws and regulations in obtaining a legal permit, while the 
other similar bodies had done so. Making a brawl over an unfounded allegation is not, 
absolutely, the solution. We believe that it is not only for what we do that we are held 
responsible, but also for what we do not. 
</p>
<p>1444. The distinguished Rapporteurs are assured that there was no &#8220;raid&#8221; or &#8220;attack&#8221; on the 
office or house of Ms. Ebadi. We would also like to reiterate that the reports conveying 
otherwise to the Rapporteurs are pure fabrication and misinterpretation of developments. It is 
also regrettable to hear that the legal investigation of the financial activities of Mrs. Ebadi, as a 
cause of her tax evasion, has been reported as removal of confidential files. We would like to 
alert against the political brawl that Ms. Ebadi or members of her office have been engineering. 
We do not wish to fall victim into it. 
</p>
<p>1445. As it was said, Ms. Ebadi and her colleagues are able to conduct their legitimate 
activities. Frequent meetings, statements and overseas visits of Ms. Ebadi and her colleagues, 
including the ones to Geneva are explicit demonstration of the enjoyment of their rights.&#8221; 
<b>Observations

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1447. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Ms. Shirin Ebadi, a prominent lawyer, human rights defender, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. 
</p>
<p>1448. Ms. Ebadi was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 22 December 2008; the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers on 14 August 2008; an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 16 April 2008; an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the then Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
11 August 2006; an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the then 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 4 August 2005; an urgent appeal sent by the then Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 13 January 2005 and an urgent 
appeal sent by the then Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights defenders on 8 December 2003. 
</p>
<p>1449. According to the information received, on 29 December 2008, at about 5:30 p.m., 
five plainclothes security officers identifying themselves as finance inspectors raided the offices 
of Ms. Ebadi&#8217;s law firm in Tehran. The security officers presented a letter that they said allowed 
them to take the computers and documents from the office. Ms. Ebadi refused to surrender her 
computer and case files, citing the confidential nature of her work. 
</p>
<p>1450. Following a five-hour search through client files, accounts, personal documents and 
computers, the security officers confiscated about 70 boxes filled with professional and personal 
files. The officers also took two central processing units (hard drives) of Ms. Ebadi&#8217;s computers. 
</p>
<p>1451. This latest raid follows the closure of the Defenders Human Rights Center 
on 21 December 2008, and the closure of the Center for Clearing Mine Areas on the same day. 
Both NGOs were founded by Ms. Ebadi. 
</p>
<p>1452. Concern was expressed that the raid by security officials on Ms. Ebadi&#8217;s law offices, as 
well as the confiscation of her confidential documents and computers may be related to her 
legitimate activities in defence of human rights. Further concern was expressed that this latest 
raid may form part of an ongoing harassment of human rights defenders in Iran. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1453. By a letter dated 8 January 2009, the Government responded to communication of the 
Special Rapporteurs. The letter is summarized above. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1454. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>1455. In a letter dated 4 May 2009, the Government responded to the allegation 
letter of 30 November 2007. The Government reported that Ms. Raheleh Asgarizadeh and 
Ms. Nasim Khosravi Moghaddam were arrested and charged with disturbing public order. The 
investigating court dropped the charge against them (19 Aug. 2008) stating that they had not 
premeditated a disturbance and that their activity was originally peaceful. The two individuals 
were treated on the basis of the rule of law and they enjoyed all their rights. 
</p><p>1456. In a letter dated 7 February 2008, the Government responded to the allegation 
letter of 15 November 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;Mr. Abolfattah Soltani was sued 
with the charge of espionage, in the past, and ultimately, the court of appeal acquitted him from 
his charges and was consequently released. Therefore, in accordance with law, he enjoys all his 
social rights. Presently, there is no verdict on prohibiting him from making trips out of the 
country. As for his claim of not having a passport, he may refer to the Passport Department of 
I.R. Iran, like any other Iranian citizen, to get a passport or in case of loss, a duplicate passport.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1457. In a letter dated 7 February 2008, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 14 December 2007. In its reply, the Government explained that although the letter of 
the Special Rapporteurs raises a number of 20 to 30 students, reference was made to only 
9 individuals, without any reference to their charges. The Government also noted that all 
countries have adopted special measures for the management of student activities and 
movements and that the Islamic Republic of Iran was not an exception to this rule. The 
Government explained that it considers student social and political movements as positively as 
possible and particularly with due consideration of the few million students in Iranian 
universities. The Government informed that the nine individuals, during the short time of 
apprehension, were in contact with their families. Only two of them are currently under arrest, 
for formation of an illegal group with fanatic socialist-oriented ideas, aiming at counter-security 
subversive objectives through setting up a military branch within the group. The Government 
stated that they abused students&#8217; freedoms and under the cover of political activities tried to 
achieve their goals. As for the other students, they were charged with unauthorized and 
disturbing gathering and were released, upon bail, after a short time. The Government informed 
that there is no report on the arrest of a Ms. Rosa Essa&#8217;ie. 
</p>
<p>1458. In a letter dated 12 February 2008, the Government responded to the allegation 
letter of 24 October 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;In the Judicial System of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, judicial procedure on different cases is carried out merely on the basis 
of law, irrespective of the social titles or positions of accused individuals. Also, similar to many 
other countries around the world, carrying out social activities should be in the framework of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 255 
 
</p>
<p>law, in compliance with the principle of fairness and avoidance from making lies and false 
statements with the aim of achieving political ends. Unfortunately, Mr. Emadeddin Baghi has 
resorted to inappropriate and incorrect statements in the course of his social activities. He was 
sued by Tehran Islamic Revolutions Court, charged with propaganda against the state through 
false statements aimed at disturbing public opinion; and by the verdict number 6/83/327 of 
3 October, 2004, based on Article 500 of the Penal Code which states,&#8221; Anyone propagating 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran Or in favour of groups and organizations who oppose the 
State, shall be subject to imprisonment from three months to one year&#8221; was sentenced to one 
year&#8217;s imprisonment. Upon the objection by his lawyer, Mr. Saleh Nikbakht, the court of appeal 
reviewed the case and confirmed the earlier verdict through verdict number 993, dated 
6 December, 2004, which was put into force from November, 2007. Then, after 76 days of 
imprisonment, Mr. Baghi was sent on an extendable medical leave, with the assistance of 
pertinent authorities, for treatment of the illness he had before imprisonment. It is noteworthy 
that Mr. Baghi was summoned by Branch 1 of Tehran Prosecutors Office, due to his repetition of 
his earlier offense, and a file was opened for him on his recent offense, which has slot received a 
judgment. We would also like to mention that the prison sentence for Mr. Baghi has not been in 
relation with his activities in defence of human rights or any other peaceful activity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1459. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to joint urgent 
appeals of 22 September 2006 and 10 July 2007. The Government reported that 
&#8220;Mr. Mohammad Sadegh Kaboudvand has been enjoying all facilities as well as the existing 
medical services offered by medical centres in and out of prison, as available to any other 
prisoner. He suffered from high blood pressure and therefore he has been regularly visited and 
under constant supervision by skilled cardiologists, nephrologists, neurologists and other 
required specialists. His medical condition is now stable through prescribed medications. Latest 
medical tests confirmed that Mr. Kaboudvand is in a stable condition (i.e. BP: 140/90, PR: 64). 
We would also like to mention that: the prison sentence for I. Kaboudvand has not been in 
relation with his activities in defence of human rights or any other peaceful activity; any 
allegation of maltreatment or lack of proper medical attention to his physical or psychological 
integrity is baseless arid mere fabrication of lies aiming at mal-intended objectives; his trial was 
in accordance with the rule of law and merely in relation with his illegal activities. The allegation 
of his activities in Presence of the Kurdish people is not but an instrument to cover his 
mal-intended activities, and deceiving international human rights bodies. In the judicial System 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, judicial procedure on different cases are carried out on the basis 
of law, disregarding social titles or positions of the accused individuals. Mr. Kaboudvand also 
enjoyed all his legal rights before the court of justice&#8221;. 
</p><p>1460. In a letter dated 12 February 2008, the Government responded to the letter of 
allegations of 21 August 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;unfortunately, 
Mr. Emadeddin Baghi has resorted to inappropriate incorrect statements in the course of his 
social activities. He was sued by Tehran Islamic Revolution&#8217;s Court, charge with propaganda a 
against the state through false statements aimed at disturbing public opinion; and by the verdict 
number 6/83/327 of 30 October, 2004, based on Article 500 of the Penal Code which states,&#8221; 
Anyone propagating against the Islamic Republic of Iran or in favour of groups and 
organizations who oppose the State, shall be subject to imprisonment from three months to 
one year&#8221; was sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment. Upon the objection by his lawyer, 
Mr. Saleh Nikbakht, the court of appeal reviewed the case and confirmed the earlier verdict </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 256 
 
</p>
<p>through verdict number 993, dated 6 December, 2004, which was put into force from 
11 November, 2007. Then, after 76 days of imprisonment, Mr. Baghi was sent on an extendable 
medical leave, with the assistance of pertinent authorities, for treatment of the illness he had 
before imprisonment. It is noteworthy that Mr. Baghi was summoned by Branch 1 of Tehran 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, due to his repetition of his earlier offense, and a file was opened for him on 
his recent offense, which has not received a judgment. We would also like to mention that the 
prison sentence for Mr. Baghi has not been in relation with his activities in defence of human 
rights or any other peaceful activity&#8221;.

<p>1462. On 31 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an allegation letter 
concerning Mr. Shihab Al-Timimi, a journalist and human rights defender. Mr. Al-Timimi was 
the head of the Iraqi Journalists&#8217; Union and a renowned campaigner for the right to freedom of 
expression in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>1463. According to information received, on 24 February 2008, Mr. Shihab Al-Timimi had just 
left the headquarters of the Iraqi Journalists&#8217; Union and was travelling to the Waziriya 
neighbourhood of north-eastern Baghdad when his car was ambushed by unidentified armed men 
who opened fire on the vehicle. Mr. Shihab Al-Timimi was taken to hospital where he suffered a 
stroke as a result of his injuries. He died on 27 February 2008. His son was also injured in the 
attack, but is now in a stable condition in hospital. 
</p>
<p>1464. Mr. Shihab Al-Timimi had reportedly been the subject of death threats prior to the attack, 
warning him that he would be killed if he did not retire from his position as head of the Iraqi 
Journalists&#8217; Union. 
</p>
<p>1465. Grave concern was expressed that the killing of Mr. Shihab Al-Timimi may have been as 
a direct result of his human rights activities, in particular his work to defend the right to freedom 
of expression in Iraq.

<p>1467. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary

</p>
<p>1468. According to information received, on 21 July 2008, Mr. Souran Mama Hama, 
a 23-year-old journalist, was shot dead outside his parents&#8217; house in Kirkuk. The killers, men 
wearing civilian clothes, shot from a car. On 15 June 2008, the independent magazine Lvin, 
published in Kirkuk in the Kurdish language, had published an article by Souran Mama Hama 
titled &#8220;Prostitutes conquer Kirkuk&#8221;. The article alleged that innumerable brothels were operated 
in Kirkuk with connivance by the police and that they were patronized primarily by police 
officers and military officers, including some arriving for the purpose from Suleymaniya and 
Arbil. The author of the article alleged, for instance, that he &#8220;managed to obtain the names of 
three police lieutenant colonels and colonels and other high ranking officers who are the 
prostitutes&#8217; customers. But on grounds of journalistic ethics we have not published their names, 
although their identities are kept at Lvin magazine.&#8221; In the 36 days between the publication of 
the article and his death, Souran Mama Hama had received numerous death threats. In a 
statement on the website of the Kurdish regional Government on 24 July 2008, the regional 
Presidency condemned the murder of Souran Mama Hama as a terrorist attack. 
</p>
<p>1469. Previously, on 6 March 2008, the academic &#8216;Abd al-Sattar Taher Sharif was killed by gun 
fire in Kirkuk. He had published articles critical of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and 
the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the two political parties holding power in the Kurdish 
Regional Government. 
</p>
<p>1470. Several other journalists and writers from the Kurdistan region of Iraq have recently 
received death threats. On 24 July 2008, Mr. Souran &#8216;Omar from Sulaimaniya received 
anonymous telephone calls threatening him with death if he did not stop writing. He had 
published a number of articles in a magazine called Rega, which he edits, as well as in Lvin. 
These articles alleged corruption and nepotism in the two main political parties of the 
Iraqi Kurdistan Region, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party (KDP), which together hold power in the Kurdish Regional Government. 
</p>
<p>1471. On 23 July 2008, men wearing civilian clothes went to the house of Mr. Nehad Jami, a 
journalist based in Kirkuk, which is under the effective control of the Kurdistan Regional 
Government (KRG). The men knocked at the door of his house, but he was not there. The men 
waited for him for several hours and then left. At around the same time, another journalist, 
Kusrat &#8216;Abd al-Rahman, received threats by phone related to articles he had written. 
</p>
<p>1472. Around mid-July 2008, a list of 16 journalists and writers, including &#8216;Abd al-Sattar 
Taher Sharif, Souran Mama Hama and Souran &#8216;Omar, was circulated within the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq. The authors of the list threatened those named with death. All the journalists and writers 
mentioned on the list are known to have been critical of the PUK and the KDP. Those named 
include journalists and writers resident in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, as well as several who 
are now resident abroad. The 16 names on the list are: 
</p>
<p>1. &#8216;Abd al-Sattar Taher Sharif

Ansar Al- Islam terrorist group. On 1 August 2008, late in the evening, Amanj Khalil reportedly 
escaped an assassination attempt in Suleimaniya. He notified the police in Suleimaniya and they 
provided a team to guard his house for one day. Mr. Amanj Khalil does not suspect government 
involvement in the assassination attempt.

<p>1475. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the reported arrest and 
detention under house arrest of pro-peace radio station &#8220;RAM FM&#8221; staff. According to 
information received, on 7 April 2008, the Israeli Police and officials of the Israeli Ministry of 
Communications raided the Jerusalem offices of Ramallah based RAM FM radio station, closing 
down the studio, seizing the radio station&#8217;s transmitter and arresting its seven staff. It is reported 
that the seven employees - three reporters, two disc-jockeys, one technician and the station 
manager of Israeli, Palestianian and South African nationalities, were detained overnight and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 259 
 
</p>
<p>released on bail by the Jerusalem District Court on Tuesday after signing bonds ranging from 
10,000 to 25,000 shekels (approximately 1,770 to 4,400 &#8364;). They were placed under house arrest 
until the next court appearance on 15 April. Reports indicate that until then, they are not to meet 
each other, or make any contacts. According to the information received, the raid was motivated 
by the interference allegedly caused by the transmitter in the communications between aircraft 
and the Ben Gurion airport. However, the temporary broadcast permit was delivered by the 
Palestinian authorities with Israel&#8217;s agreement, and the final licence was due to be delivered on 
8 April, the day after the raid. RAM FM continues to broadcast from its headquarters in 
Ramallah.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 28 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1477. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations 
concerning the Nafha Society for the Defense of Prisoners and Human Rights, a 
non-governmental organization (NGO) which was registered with the Palestinian Authority in 
</p><p>2006. The Nafha Society represents Palestinian detainees in Israeli courts, helps prisoners to 
become reintegrated with society after being released and offers social and psychological support 
to prisoners&#8217; families. 
</p>
<p>1478. On 2 August 2007, Mr. Mohammad Bsharat, Executive Director of the Nafha Society 
was reportedly arrested without a warrant by Israeli soldiers. On 26 August 2007, the Salem 
Military Court sentenced him to six months&#8217; administrative detention. This meant that by law it 
was neither necessary for charges to be brought against him nor for him to be allowed a trial. He 
was released on 24 February 2008. This case was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 31 August 2007. No response has yet been received to the communication. 
</p>
<p>1479. According to information received, on 8 July 2008, the Nafha Society and six other 
organizations were closed for two years by the Israeli authorities following the issuing of a 
military order by the Israeli Military Commander in the occupied West Bank. The reason given 
for the closure was that the organizations were involved in the financing of terrorist 
organizations. This allegation is strongly denied by the Nafha Society. 
</p>
<p>1480. Concern was expressed that the closure of the Nafha Society may be related to its work in 
defense of human rights, in particular its work to provide legal, psychological, medical support 
to Palestinian prisoners in Israel and their families. </p>

<p>1482. In a letter dated 31 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 28 July 2008. The Government reported that the Nafha Society for the Defense of 
Prisoners and Human Rights substituted and continued the work of the &#8220;Friends of the Prisoner 
Society&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Ansar El-Sageen&#8221;). On 31 August 2006, the Minister of Defense 
declared the &#8220;Friends of the Prisoner Society&#8221; to be an unlawful organization based on its 
connections with the Hamas terrorist organization. This decision stated that the declaration is 
also valid for any other name in which the organization shall be named in the future, including 
any section, branch, center, committee, group or fraction of it. As a result, although the 
organization changed its name, according to the Minister&#8217;s decision it remains an unlawful 
organization. Furthermore, according to information presented to the Minister of Defense and the 
Commander of the IDF forces in the West Bank, the Nafha Society continues to maintain various 
connections with the Hamas terrorist organization. Due to all of the above and the threat posed 
by the Nafha Society for public safety and the security of the State of Israel, the decision remains 
firm.

Government concerning Mr. Yusuf Qawariq, a field worker for Al-Haq. 
</p>
<p>1485. According to information received, on 24 July 2008, at approximately 2 p.m., 
Mr. Yusuf Qawariq was arrested by Israeli forces. Mr. Yusuf Qawariq had been passing through 
the Huwara checkpoint on his way out of Nablus in the occupied Palestinian territory of the 
West Bank. He used his Palestinian identity card and his Al-Haq employee card to identify 
himself but was accused of using false United Nations (UN) identification because it states on 
his Al-Haq card that the organization has consultative status with the Economic and Social 
Council of the UN. Mr. Yusuf Qawariq was then detained for three hours in a small cell. Soldiers 
told the mayor of the village of Awarta that Mr. Yusuf Qawariq was carrying false 
UN identification and that his arrest was due to his work in monitoring and documenting the 
Israeli military&#8217;s actions. 
</p>
<p>1486. Concern was expressed that the arbitrary arrest and detention of Mr. Yusuf Qawariq 
may have been related to his legitimate work in the defense of human rights in the

the World Health Organization (WHO). 
</p>

the 5th international conference of the Mental Health Programme, titled &#8220;Siege and Mental 
Health, Walls vs. Bridges&#8221; was scheduled to be held by the GCMHP and the WHO in Gaza City. 
However, Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) denied entry permits to approximately 
120 international academics, human rights defenders and physicians who were due to participate 
in the conference and prevented them from entering Gaza via Beit Hanoon (Erez checkpoint). 
Military authorities reportedly also forbade the entry of members of the &#8220;Physicians for Human 
Rights&#8221;, a Tel-Aviv based NGO; as well as of Palestinian physicians and academics from the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem. The names of the participants were reportedly submitted through 
the WHO to the IOF over a month before the conference in order to allow enough time to gain 
permission for them to attend. 
</p>

<p>1496. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human

urgent appeal regarding Mr. Tashi Tsering, aged 38. Mr. Tashi Tsering is the Vice-Chairman of 
the Taiwan branch of the Tibetan Youth Congress. 
</p>
<p>1497. According to the information received, on 26 April 2008, the day the Beijing Olympic 
torch was brought to Japan, Mr. Tashi Tsering was participating in a reportedly peaceful 
demonstration in Nagano against the Olympic torch relay. During the demonstration, 
Mr. Tashi Tsering was taken into custody by the Nagano police authorities. Mr. Tashi Tsering 
had reportedly not committed any violent acts during the demonstration. Before he was arrested, 
he had been calling for the independence of the Tibet Autonomous Region by approaching the 
torch and shouting, &#8220;Free Tibet!&#8221;. Mr. Tashi Tsering was charged with &#8220;forcible obstruction of 
business&#8221;. While in detention, Mr. Tashi Tsering allegedly did not have access to a lawyer 
during the first days, nor was he allowed receiving visitors. 
</p>
<p>1498. On 28 April, Mr. Tashi Tsering was brought before a prosecutor for interrogation. 
Thereafter, his detention was extended for another 10 days and he was once again not permitted 
to see any visitors during this extended detention period. On 8 May, another 10-day extension of 
Mr. Tashi Tsering&#8217;s period of detention was sought, allegedly to gather evidence against him to 
show that he is a terrorist. 
</p>
<p>1499. Mr. Tashi Tsering is currently detained at Nagano&#8217;s central police station. His indictment 
is reportedly scheduled for 15 May and the court hearing on his case is due to take place on 
17 May. If found guilty, Mr. Tsering may be sentenced to a fine of 500,000 Japanese yen 
(around US$ 4,800) or to a prison sentence of up to 3 years. 
</p>
<p>1500. Concerns were expressed that the detention of Mr. Tashi Tsering might be solely 
connected to his peaceful activities in defending human rights and the exercise of his right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1501. In a letter dated 28 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 14 May 2008. The Government stressed that it guaranteed freedom of assembly and 
association, as well as speech, press and all other forms of expression as major rights (Article 21 
of the Constitution of Japan). The case referred to in the communication includes an action that </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 263 
 
</p>
<p>went beyond the limits of the freedom and it was dealt with by the concerned authorities under 
appropriate legal procedures. The Government of Japan has no intention to restrict the freedom 
arbitrarily. 
</p>
<p>1502. The detailed facts of the case are summarized as follows. On 26 April 2008, when the 
Beijing Olympic Torch Relay, co-organized by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games 
of the XXIX Olympiad and the City of Nagano, was under way in the city, Mr. Tashi Tsering, 
the accused, jumped out towards the running course shouting &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; for the purpose of 
interfering this event, and as a result, prevented a runner from running forward. As it obstructed 
the business of the Organizing Committee and Nagano City by force, his action constituted 
&#8220;forcible obstruction of business&#8221;, which is stipulated under Article 234 of the Penal Code. On 
26 April 2008, at 9-06 a.m., the police arrested Mr. Tshering on the spot as a flagrant offender 
and detained him in a detention cell. On 27 April 2008 the police referred the case to the public 
prosecutor. On 28 April 2008 the public prosecutor requested Mr. Tshering to be detained for 
10 days and it was authorized by the judge after the direct judicial inquiry. On 7 May 2008 the 
prosecutor requested the extension of the period of detention for another 10 days, and it was 
authorized by the judge. Mr. Tshering was interviewed by a defense counsel 13 times between 
28 April and 14 May 2008. He also had an interview with a staff from the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Representative Office in Japan. On 16 May 2008 Mr. Tshering was fined 500.000 yen 
as a summary order, which he paid on the same day. He was released at 2.25 p.m. on 
16 May 2008. The reply of the Government also contained a detailed analysis of the relevant 
provisions of the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Director of the non-governmental organization Western Kenya Human Rights Watch 
(WKHRW), Mr. Taiga Wanyania, member of the Mwatikho Torture Survivors&#8217; Organization, 
located in Bungoma, Western Kenya, and accredited with the International Rehabilitation 
Council for Torture Victims, as well as Mr. Henry Wilberforce Lumbuku, human rights activist. 
According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>1505. Messrs. Job Wandalia Bwonya, Taiga Wanyania and Henry Wilberforce have been 
forced to flee their office in Bungoma and find refuge in another country after exposing in the 
media alleged acts of torture of Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) suspects by the military in 
the Mt. Elgon region. Atrocities committed allegedly by SLDF against the civilian population 
since 2006, with a peak of human rights violations in January 2008, triggered the deployment of 
soldiers in the area on 10 March 2008. Three days after the start of the military operation, 
WKHRW started receiving complaints from people from the area, allegedly arrested by the 
military, including children aged 13, who had been taken to Kapkota military camp, tortured, 
released or taken to court. A number of people were reported killed in the course of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 264 
 
</p>
<p>operation, and over 18 people died as a result of torture, including five in prison. From 14 to 
25 March 2008, WKHRW conducted a fact-finding mission to investigate the allegations 
received, and to identify other victims who had not filed official complaints yet. On 21 March, 
WKHRW visited victims at Bungoma prison who had multiple injuries allegedly inflicted by the 
military at Kaptoka camp before being handed over to the police for prosecution. 
</p>
<p>1506. On 28 March, Mr. Job Wandalia Bwonya went to Sirisia and Lwakhakha to interview 
more victims. The military arrested Mr. Job Wandalia Bwonya at noon at Lwandanyi market in 
Bungoma West District. He was interrogated for one hour on his activities, and then taken to the 
Chepkube military camp and further interrogated for three hours before being released. The 
military reportedly warned Mr. Job Wandalia Bwonya to stop alleging that soldiers were 
torturing people. On 29 March, 33 alleged victims of torture were transported to Bungoma to 
deliver testimonies regarding their treatment in Kapkota camp, in the presence of the media. On 
30 March and 1 April, the stories of these alleged victims were highlighted in both print and 
electronic media. A joint press release by Human Rights Watch, Mwatikho and WKHRW was 
issued on 4 April. On 4 April, soldiers visited several staff of WKHRW, asking about the 
whereabouts of Mr. Job Wandalia Bwonya. Hearing that the military was actively looking for 
him, he decided to flee the country. Soldiers also went to the house of Mr. Taiga Wanyania&#8217;s 
parents. Mr. Taiga was not present and decided to flee the country as well. On 16 April, 
Mr. Henry Wilberforce Lumbuku, who was also active in interrogating victims of torture, was 
arrested by the military, interrogated on his activities, and detained in Nakuru barracks for 
two days. He subsequently left the country as well. 
</p>
<p>1507. Serious concern was expressed that the abovementioned acts of harassment against 
Messrs Job Wandalia Bwonya, Taiga Wanyania and Henry Wilberforce Lumbuku may be linked 
to their non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular in investigating and 
exposing alleged human rights violations by the military in the Mt. Elgon region.

<p>1509. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the situation of Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya, a 
registered doctor with the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board practising at Moi Teaching 
and Referral Hospital. Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya has examined torture cases on behalf of the 
Kenyan Independent Medico-Legal Unit, a registered NGO defending the rights of torture 
victims in Kenya. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>1510. On 14 August 2008, Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya was reportedly summoned by police. 
Since then he has been held for interrogation at the Kakamega&#8217;s Provincial Criminal 
Investigation Office for his participation in documenting human rights violations in Mt. Elgon 
Hospital Kitale in relation to alleged acts of torture committed by the military in the Mt. Elgon 
region in March 2008. The findings of Dr. Walter Wekesa Nalianya were published by the 
Kenya National Commission on Human Rights in May 2008. </p>

<p>1511. Concern was expressed that the summoning and interrogation of Dr. Walter 
Wekesa Nalianya may be linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, i.e. his 
participation in documenting torture cases in the Mt. Elgon region. On 22 May 2008, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint 
urgent appeal on reported acts of harassment against Messrs Job Wandalia Bwonya, 
Taiga Wanyania and Henry Wilberforce Lumbuku who investigated and exposed similar human 
rights violations by the military in the Mt. Elgon region. So far no response from the 
Government of Your Excellency has been received on these allegations.

Ms. Pouline Kimani, a member of the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya. 
</p>
<p>1514. According to information received, on 23 August 2008, Ms. Pouline Kimani 
appeared on a television program which dealt with the issue of homosexuality in Kenya. On 
25 August 2008, she was the victim of intimidation by a group of men in her community, while 
on 1 September 2008 she was chased and threatened with rape by a group of men. On 
2 September 2008, she received threats in an envelope which was found outside her place of 
residence. These incidents were reported to the police by Ms. Pouline Kimani but she is unaware 
of whether there has been any investigation into them yet. 
</p>
<p>1515. Concern was expressed that the acts of intimidation against Ms. Pouline Kimani may 
have been related to her activities in defense of the rights of the gay and lesbian community in 
Kenya. Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Ms. Pouline Kimani.

presenter, Mr. Larry Asego and Mr. Mzee Jalang&#8217;o, co-presenters with Kiss FM radio station 
based, and Mr. Mwalimu Mati, former director of Transparency International in Kenya along 
with a number of other civil society activists and journalists. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 266 
 
</p>
<p>1518. According to information received, on 12 December 2008, Ms. Caroline Mutoko, 
Mr. Larry Asego, Mr. Mzee Jalang&#8217;o and Mr. Mwalimu Mati along with approximately 60 other 
journalists and civil society activists were arrested by police officers at Nyayo National Stadium, 
in Nairobi. The arrests took place during national Independence Day celebrations led by 
President Kibaki. The group had gathered during the event to protest against the Kenya 
Communications (Amendment) Bill 2008, passed by Parliament two days earlier. Ms. Mutoko, 
Mr. Asego, Mr. Jalang&#8217;o and Mr. Mati Nyayo were reportedly detained at Langata police station 
in the city, while the other activists and journalists were held in various police stations 
throughout the city. All were reportedly released later that day. 
</p>
<p>1519. If ratified, the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Bill 2008 could punish those 
responsible for alleged press offences with heavy fines and prison sentences. The Bill also 
envisages the creation of a Government-appointed Communications Commission that would be 
in charge of granting broadcast licenses. Article 46 of the Bill affords the Communications 
Commission powers to issue or deny licences. Under this section an applicant can be denied a 
license for failing to fulfil, among other requirements, &#8220;such other conditions as may be 
prescribed&#8221;. Article 86 of the Bill affords the Information Minister the power to interrupt 
broadcasts, dismantle radio and TV stations and tap telephones, while the Internal Security 
Minister would be empowered to seize broadcasting equipment. The Bill would also afford the 
Information Minister power to control programme content, as the commission he appoints would 
also be responsible for ensuring the &#8220;good taste&#8221; of broadcasts. 
</p>
<p>1520. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to 
prevent legitimate peaceful protests against the newly enacted Communications (Amendment) 
Bill 2008. Further concern was expressed that, if ratified, the Bill may be used as a tool to stifle 
media freedom in the country.

and Ms. Nazgul Turdubekova of Youth Human Rights Group and members of youth branches of 
political parties and movements Dilgir, Ar-Namys, Ata-Meken, Zelenye. 
</p>
<p>1523. According to information received, on 20 December 2007 militia officers arrested human 
rights defenders and 14 representatives of youth movements in Bishkek, for participation in a 
peaceful demonstration in protest at alleged irregularities in the parliamentary elections </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 267 
 
</p>
<p>of 16 December. The participants were brought to the Bishkek Department of Interior&#8217;s 
Temporary Facility Priemnik Raspredelitel&#8217; GUVD. Despite requests on the part of defence 
lawyers for an open hearing, an in camera session was conducted at night-time. Of the 19 people 
detained, 16, including the aforementioned human rights defenders, were sentenced to between 5 
and 7 days. 
</p>
<p>1524. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned human rights 
defenders and youth activists may have been directly related to their work in defence of human 
rights.

</b></p>
<p>1526. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the then Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent a letter of 
allegation to the Government concerning Mr. Maksim Kuleshov, head of the &#8220;Mir-svet kultury&#8221; 
Association. 
</p>
<p>1527. According to information received; on 16 January 2008 Maksim Kuleshov conducted a 
protest action at the Bishkek Mayor&#8217;s Office and Bishkek City Council. Mr. Kuleshov was 
standing alone in front of the building of the Mayor&#8217;s Office and held a sign with a note &#8220;Dusik, 
you are not right!&#8221; referring to the Mayor of Bishkek. The peaceful protest was forcibly stopped 
by police officers who arrested Mr. Kuleshov and transferred him to Police Station No 9. 
Witnesses reported seeing two unknown policemen and one officer allegedly identified as 
Sydykov, beating Maksim Kuleshov. The latter officer hit him twice in the abdomen; others beat 
on his head and feet. The two unknown policemen, one of whom was plainclothed, did not 
identify themselves when asked. The policemen also took Mr. Kuleshov&#8217;s personal belongings 
including his clothes and mobile phone. 
</p>
<p>1528. Subsequently Mr. Kuleshov appeared before the Leninsky Rayon Court, where 
Ms. Aziza Abdirasulova, an associate acting in his defense stated that the charges against him 
were based on explanatory notes without signatures and names. The charges were in Kyrgyz, 
which Mr. Kuleshov, an ethnic Russian, does not speak, nor was there any interpreter present. 
Mr. Kuleshov had requested a lawyer at the police station but his request was rejected, as was a 
request to see a doctor while he was in detention. 
</p>
<p>1529. Reports received indicated that the judicial outcome of the case concerning 
Mr. Kuleshov&#8217;s peaceful protest was dependent on the potential application of a Bishkek City 
Council decree which seeks to curtail assemblies, mass-meetings, marches, demonstrations and 
pickets in the city. 
</p>
<p>1530. Concern was expressed that Mr. Kuleshov&#8217;s alleged arrest, ill-treatment and detention 
may be directly linked to his activities in defense of human rights and his exercising of his right </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>1532. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the then Special Rapporteur on the situation

of civil society activists, including Mr. Tilek Sydykov, Mr. Aibek Bakasov, 
Ms. Aichurek Mamatkadyrova, Ms. A. Asanova, Mr. Joomark Saparbaev, 
Mr. Mirsulzhan Namazaliev, Ms. Gulshair Abdirasulova, Ms. Jibek Ismailova, 
Mr. Azamat Janybaev, and Mr. Mirzat Adjiev. 
</p><p>1533. According to information received; on 28 January 2008, the aforementioned were 
arrested following their participation in a peaceful demonstration outside the building of the 
Kyrgyz parliament in protest against allegedly questionable practices in the recent elections. It 
was reported that following their arrest, they were detained in Pervomayski Rayon Police 
Department. Mr. Mirzat Adjiev was reportedly released later the same day, but it is believed 
that the other participants in the peaceful demonstration remain in detention. These arrests 
were reportedly a result of a Bishkek City Council decree which entered into force on 
5 December 2007, which seeks to greatly restrict assemblies, mass-meetings, marches, 
demonstrations and pickets in the city. This decree was mentioned in a previous communication 
sent by mandate holders to the Government on 24 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>1534. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned may be 
directly linked to their activities in defense of human rights and their exercising of the right to

<p>1536. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the then Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning the alleged 
warrantless raid of the community centre of the organization Labrys, an organization working for 
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (LGBT). Labrys was founded in 
April 2004 to assist and advocate for the rights of lesbian and bisexual women, gay men, and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 269 
 
</p>
<p>transgender people. It has been a legally registered nongovernmental organization since 
14 February 2006. The community center of Labrys, opened in February 2008, serves as a place 
for meeting and discussion, as well as shelter for victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>1537. According to the information received, on the evening of 8 April 2008, three police 
forced their way into the building housing the group Labrys in Bishkek, which at the time was 
hosting a dinner for local and international LGBT groups from the Anti AIDS Association and 
Tais Plus, as well as for international partner organizations - COC (Cultuur en 
Outspannings-Centrum) and HIVOS (Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing 
Countries) from the Netherlands, and Gender Doc-M from Moldova. The police threatened to 
arrest anyone who did not produce identification, and searched private files. 
</p>
<p>1538. It was reported that the police demanded to see the organization&#8217;s registration documents, 
statutes, and rent statements. The police gained entry to a locked private office and went through 
desks and files. A short time later, the district police chief arrived and said the officers would 
leave only if Labrys promised to submit its administrative and financial documents to the police 
station the following day. Labrys complied with the request. 
</p>
<p>1539. This is reportedly the second time that the police have raided Labrys without a warrant. 
On 4 June 2006, police forced their way into the group&#8217;s office after verbally threatening that 
they would rape everyone inside. 
</p>
<p>1540. The mandate-holders expressed their concern that the warrantless raid of the community 
centre of Labrys may be related to the activities of the organization in defense of human rights, 
in particular LGBT rights, and also that restrictions or breaches of the right to freedom of 
association may discourage defenders working on the protection of the right of marginalized or 
stigmatized groups to carry out their activities.

Ms. Lena Mamadnazarova, Regional Representative and Project Coordinator respectively of the 
Norwegian Helsinki Committee (NHC) in Kyrgyzstan, Ms. Tolekan Ismailova of the 
organisation Citizens against Corruption, and Ms. Aziza Abdurasulova, head of the 
non-governmental organization (NGO) Kylym Shamy, an organization that monitors human 
rights violations in the Kyrgyz Republic. The NHC is an NGO which monitors compliance with 
the human rights provisions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
within all OSCE signatory states and supports democracy and civil society irrespective of the 
ideology and political position of states. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1543. Ms. Aziza Abdurasulova was the subject of a letter of allegation sent by the then Special 
Representative to the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 18 May 2006. A response from the Government was received on 4 July 2006. 
Ms. Tolekan Ismailova was the subject of a letter of allegation sent by the then Special 
Representative to the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 10 January 2008. No response from the Government has yet been received. 
</p>
<p>1544. According to information received, since arriving in Kyrgyzstan in November 2006, 
Mr. Ivar Dale made unsuccessful efforts to register his office through the Ministry of Justice. On 
many occasions he was assured that the organization would be registered and was told that only 
minor corrections to the documents in his application were necessary. Given that he was required 
to provide a valid contract with a landlord for his office in order to have it registered, he set up 
an office and began to use it for work. The Ministry of Justice was aware of this work and 
officials from the Government have attended NHC events in Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>1545. On 9 June 2008, two representatives from the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) came with 
two unidentified individuals to carry out a search on the NHC office. The unidentified 
individuals photographed documents and asked questions about NHC projects, mentioning 
current problems for NGOs in Uzbekistan. No search warrant was shown to Mr. Ivar Dale. He 
was also threatened by one of the unidentified persons with the words &#8220;If we want, we can just 
beat him up&#8221;. The MVD representatives refused to call the Ministry of Justice to seek 
confirmation that the NHC office&#8217;s application for registration was still under consideration 
despite Mr. Ivar Dale&#8217;s requests for them to do so. 
</p>
<p>1546. The following day, Mr. Ivar Dale and Ms. Lena Mamadnazarova were not provided with 
any information when they went to the Ministry of Justice for written confirmation that the NHC 
office&#8217;s registration was still under consideration. According to a statement made by the Minister 
for Justice on BBC Radio, the only reason that the NHC office had not been registered was that 
some of their documents were missing. However, Mr. Ivar Dale was called, usually without a 
warrant, to the police station several times. There he was threatened with having his 
visa annulled and threats were made about bringing charges against him and 
Ms. Lena Mamadnazarova for operating the office without proper registration. These threats 
came about in spite of the NHC agreeing on 12 June 2008, to suspend its activity until the 
necessary registration and work permits were granted, on the understanding that the Ministry of 
the Interior would confirm to the Ministry of Justice that it had no objection to the registration of 
the NHC in the Kyrgyz Republic. Mr. Ivar Dale was most recently called to the police station on 
14 July 2008. Ms. Tolekan Ismailova and Ms. Aziza Abudurasulova, who were present when the 
NHC office was being searched, were also been called to the police station and accused of 
interfering in the lawful work of law enforcement officials. Threats were also made about 
bringing charges against them. 
</p>
<p>1547. Concern was expressed that the threats and harassment against Mr. Ivar Dale, 
Ms. Lena Mamadnazarova, Ms. Tolekan Ismailova and Ms. Aziza Abudurasulova, as well as the 
reluctance to register the NHC office in the Kyrgyz Republic, might be related to the activities of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>the aforementioned in the defense of human rights. Concern was also expressed that while time

Kyrgyz Republic would be unable to carry out its work effectively.

<p><b>Letter of allegations on 15 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1549. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the Government in relation to the 
amendments to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on the Right of Citizens to Assemble Peaceably, 
without Weapons, to freely Hold Rallies and Demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>1550. According to information received, on 6 August 2008, President Bakiev signed an 
amendment to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on the Right of Citizens to Assemble Peaceably, 
without Weapons, to freely Hold Rallies and Demonstrations (2002). The amendments were 
passed by the Zhogorku Kenesh (Parliament) on 13 June 2008. Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the 
amended assembly law require organisers to submit notification of any public gathering to the 
local authorities at least twelve days in advance of the planned event. Local authorities may 
either permit the gathering or provide a &#8216;reasoned disagreement&#8217; six days before the event is due 
to take place. The law does not specify grounds for refusal, and it also prohibits the organisation 
of prolonged demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>1551. On 14 October 2004, a Court ruling deemed articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Law on Assemblies 
as null and void. In this context, the court also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits &#8216;state 
authorities and local self-government bodies and their officials&#8217; from &#8216;exceeding their authority 
as established by the Constitution and the laws.&#8217; In a ruling issued on 1 July 2008 the Court 
reportedly declared article 11 of the Law on Assemblies as unconstitutional. The article had 
given the Bishkek municipal assembly the authority to independently regulate the permission for, 
rallies, street marches and similar public events. The 2008 Constitutional Court ruling reportedly 
annulled a December 2007 ordinance by the Bishkek City Council based on this article. 
</p>
<p>1552. Concern was expressed that the amendments to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on the 
Right of Citizens to Assemble Peaceably, without Weapons, to freely Hold Rallies and 
Demonstrations (2002), may limit the right to freedom of assembly in Kyrgyzstan, thus stifling 
freedom of expression in the country.

<p>1554. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Ivar Dale, Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev and 
Ms. Guliza Omurzakova. Mr. Ivar Dale is the regional representative to Central Asia of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 272 
 
</p>
<p>Norwegian Helsinki Committee (NHC), a non-governmental organization which monitors 
compliance with the human rights provisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE) within all OSCE signatory states, and supports democracy and civil society. 
Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev is the Chairman of the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR). 
Ms. Guliza Omurzakova is also a representative of the KCHR. 
</p>
<p>1555. According to new information received, on 22 August 2008, Mr. Ivar Dale arrived in 
Manas International Airport in Bishkek and was told that his one-year multiple-entry visa which 
was supposed to be valid until 25 November 2008 had been annulled. It was replaced with a 
single-entry visa which would be valid until 1 September 2008. On 12 October 2008, 
Mr. Ivar Dale was refused entry to Kyrgyzstan in Manas International Airport. He was not given 
any official explanation by Kyrgyz Border Service representatives who told him that he would 
be banned from entering Kyrgyzstan for 10 years. They referred to a decision of the 
law-enforcement authorities dated 17 September 2008 but did not give details of its title or the 
authority which had issued it because it was reportedly confidential. Mr. Ivar Dale contacted the 
Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Embassy in Kyrgyzstan, and the 
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) but none of these contacts were 
able to resolve the matter. After almost a day in the airport Mr. Ivar Dale left Kyrgyzstan 
on 13 October 2008, taking a plane to Istanbul, Turkey. 
</p>
<p>1556. In a separate incident the following day, the car of Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev, in which 
he and Ms. Guliza Omurzakova were travelling, was intentionally hit by a large white jeep. 
Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev suffered concussion and Ms. Guliza Omurzakova subsequently suffered 
from headaches and dizziness. The left-hand side of the car was damaged and the front and back 
left lights were broken. Mr. Dyryldaev was scheduled to take part in a press conference on 
the creation of a national movement against human rights violations in Kyrgyzstan 
on 15 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>1557. Concern was expressed that the prohibition of Mr. Ivar Dale&#8217;s entry into Kyrgyzstan, and 
the attack on the car of Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev, may be directly related to their activities in the 
defense of human rights. Serious concern is expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Ramazan Dyryldaev and Ms. Guliza Omurzakova, as well as all members of the 
KCHR and other human rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan. Further concern was expressed that the 
incidents described above may form part of an ongoing trend of harassment aimed at restricting 
the work of human rights defenders in Kyrgyzstan.

Human Rights Resource Centre. </p>

</p>
<p>1560. According to the new information received, on 23 October 2008 Mr. Kuleshov was 
arrested in Bishkek and taken to the May Day area police station. He was arrested shortly after 
having started his so-called &#8220;street lesson on democracy&#8221;, which aims at training citizens in 
non-violent methods for protecting international human rights and the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>1561. Mr. Kuleshov was charged with &#8220;violating the established order on rallies and assemblies 
&#8220;(Art 392 of the Administrative Code), and &#8220;non-obedience to police forces&#8221; (Art 371 of the 
Administrative Code). He was kept in detention at the May Day area police station until 
24 October 2008, when he was sentenced to a fine of 2000 soms (approx 40 Euros) on charges of 
&#8220;violating the established order on rallies and assemblies&#8221;. He was acquitted of the second 
charge. 
</p>
<p>1562. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and sentencing of Mr. Kuleshov may be 
related to his legitimate activities in defence of human rights. Further concern was expressed that 
these acts may form part of an ongoing harassment due to his human rights activities.

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1563. By a letter dated 24 February 2009, the Government responded to the letter of 
allegations, indicating that: 
</p>
<p>1564. &#8220;Information on the arrest on 23 October 2008 of Mr. Kuleshov, Director of the Human 
Rights Resource Centre. Concerning the detention on 23 October 2008 of Mr. M.G. Kuleshov, 
Director of the Tokmok Human Rights Resource Centre, we wish to inform you that on 
23 October 2008, at approximately 3.30 p.m., Mr. M.G. Kuleshov held an unauthorized meeting 
on the south-western side of the Kyrgyz Republic&#8217;s Government House. At 3.40 p.m. on 
23 October 2008, Mr. Maksim Gennadyevich Kuleshov, born 1980, residing at [illegible], 
d. 8A, kv.3, in the town of Tokmov, was detained by officers from the patrol and inspection 
service, Bishkek Central Internal Affairs Department, and taken to the May Day district police 
station in Bishkek. Within three hours of the compilation of administrative materials on 
Mr. M.G. Kuleshov concerning the commission of the offence described in articles 371 and 392 
of the Code of Administrative Responsibility of the Kyrgyz Republic, the compiled materials 
were transferred for review to the May Day district court in Bishkek. The May Day regional 
court, having reviewed the materials it had received, found Mr. M.G. Kuleshov guilty of having 
committed an administrative offence under article 392 of the Code of Administrative 
Responsibility, as a result of which Mr. Kuleshov was fined 2,000 soms. Mr. Kuleshov was 
found innocent of committing any offence under article 371 of the Kyrgyz Code of 
Administrative Responsibility. However, he did infringe the requirements of Order No. 385, 
adopted by the Bishkek Chamber of Deputies on [illegible] December 2007, establishing the 
cules for holding meetings, marches, demonstrations, rallies and protests in Bishkek. He also 
violated the requirements of the Act on the right to assemble peacefully, without weapons, and to 
freely hold rallies and assemblies. Chapter 5, paragraph 2.1, of this Act states that under 
article 25 of the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic shall have 
the right to assemble peacefully, without weapons, and to conduct political meetings, rallies, 
marches, demonstrations and pickets on condition of prior notification to State or local 
authorities. Paragraph 2.2 of the Act states that notification of the holding of such events shall be 
given in writing to the office of the mayor of Bishkek or the district mayor&#8217;s office no later than 
10 days before the start of the event. Paragraph 2.4 of the Act states that the notification must </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 274 
 
</p>
<p>contain information on the starting and ending time of the event, the place where it is to be held 
and the expected number of participants, on the organizers of the event and their commitment to 
respect social order and the established rules, on payment for expenditure connected with the 
protection of social order, medical services and the clean-up of the site following the event, with 
an indication of the full name, place of residence and contact telephone number of the persons 
responsible. Paragraph 2.5 of the Act states that notification not made in accordance with the 
established procedure is to be considered invalid and not taken into consideration by the local 
authorities. Chapter 3, paragraph 2.1, of the Act states that the holding of events on roadways or 
sidewalks, in green areas, squares or parks or in proximity to health and leisure institutions, 
childcare facilities or educational institutions, government buildings or other locations without 
the permission of the local Bishkek law enforcement agencies is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>1565. Those who violate the requirements of existing regulations incur responsibility in 
accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. On 5 December 2008, the Bishkek 
May Day district procurator&#8217;s office received notice from Mr. Kuleshov of action taken against 
the police officers who on 2 December 2008, at approximately 2.10 p.m., detained him near the 
premises of the Ministry of the Interior of the Kyrgyz Republic and, having handed him over to 
the district police, collected administrative material on him. The Bishkek May Day district court, 
having reviewed the administrative material on Mr. Kuleshov, gave him a fine of 2,000 soins. 
The notice given by Mr. Kuleshov was reviewed by the procurator of the Bishkek May Day 
district court, following which, no charges were brought, in accordance with section 1, 
paragraph 2, of article 28 and article 156-1 of the Criminal Code, for lack of evidence of a crime. 
A verification of this review, carried out by the Bishkek city procurator, has yielded no evidence 
of violations of rights and freedoms or of unlawful activities against Mr. Kuleshov by the 
officers of the Bishkek district internal affairs office&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>1570. Par une lettre en date du 23 septembre 2008, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que 
le 15 mars 2008, Mme Nasrine Dandashli a quitt&#233; le domicile de son &#233;poux Hussein Askoul, 
dans le camp de Rashidieh, en compagnie de M. Nader Rashed Hussein. Les proches de Nasrine 
ont port&#233; plainte au poste de police des camps, relevant du d&#233;tachement de Tyr. Le 7 avril 2008, 
M. Jamal Mahmoud Dandashli a convoqu&#233; M. Rabieh Rashed Hussein, et l&#8217;a interrog&#233; dans son 
bureau pour savoir o&#249; se trouvait son fr&#232;re Nader. Il l&#8217;a retenu pour faire pression sur Nader et 
l&#8217;obliger &#224; rendre Nasrine &#224; sa famille. Des m&#233;dias ont appris la d&#233;tention de Rabieh et des 
journaux ont publi&#233; la nouvelle, qui a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; diffus&#233;e par des sites Internet. L&#8217;association 
palestinienne de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme &#171;Rased&#187; a signal&#233; l&#8217;enl&#232;vement de Rabieh sur 
son site Internet. MM. Jamal Dandashli et Ibrahim Mohammed Saaddin ont t&#233;l&#233;phon&#233; &#224; 
M. Abd al-Aziz Mahmoud Tarakji et l&#8217;ont menac&#233; pour avoir diffus&#233; cette information sur 
Internet. M. Abd al-Aziz Tarakji a enregistr&#233; leurs menaces sur son t&#233;l&#233;phone et a port&#233; plainte. 
Le dossier a &#233;t&#233; transmis au poste de police de la ville nouvelle de Sa&#239;da-Sidon. La famille de 
Nasrine s&#8217;est constitu&#233;e partie civile aupr&#232;s du parquet de la Cour d&#8217;appel du Sud dans l&#8217;affaire 
de la fugue de leur fille Nasrine et le dossier a &#233;t&#233; transmis &#224; l&#8217;antenne de police judiciaire de 
Sa&#239;da-Sidon pour enqu&#234;te. Nasrine s&#8217;est pr&#233;sent&#233;e et a d&#233;clar&#233; avoir abandonn&#233; de son plein gr&#233; 
le domicile conjugal et ne pas souhaiter y rentrer, apr&#232;s quoi elle s&#8217;est r&#233;fugi&#233;e aupr&#232;s de 
l&#8217;Organisation palestinienne des droits de l&#8217;homme, dont le conseil d&#8217;administration est dirig&#233; 
par M. Ghassan Sa&#239;d Abdallah. M. Ghassan Abdallah a alors entrepris, en compagnie de 
M. Edouard Khalil Kattoura, de d&#233;noncer les agissements de M. Dandashli, ce que ce dernier a 
consid&#233;r&#233; comme une intrusion dans sa vie priv&#233;e. Il a alors menac&#233; les deux hommes, que des 
officiers du Fatah ont en outre accus&#233;s d&#8217;&#234;tre des agents &#224; la solde d&#8217;Isra&#235;l et de l&#8217;Occident. Des

l&#8217;organisation, dans le camp de Mar Elias, ont circul&#233; &#224; de nombreuses reprises. M. Ghassan 
Abdallah a alors port&#233; les menaces le visant &#224; la connaissance du Haut Commissariat aux droits </p>

&#224; la Section antiterroriste de la police judiciaire, qui a enqu&#234;t&#233; &#224; ce sujet. Les protagonistes ont 
fini par se r&#233;concilier et Jamal Dandashli s&#8217;est engag&#233; &#224; ne s&#8217;en prendre &#224; personne du fait de 
cette affaire. Peu de temps apr&#232;s, Nasrine est rentr&#233;e chez les siens. Les menaces visant 
Ghassan Abdallah et Edouard Kattoura &#233;taient motiv&#233;es par le fait qu&#8217;ils avaient rendu public le 
comportement de Jamal Dandashli et non par leurs activit&#233;s dans le domaine des droits de 
l&#8217;homme. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1571. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial remercie le Gouvernement pour sa r&#233;ponse. 
</p>
<p><b>Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 4 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1572. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Fathi el-Jahmi, an activist advocating 
political reform in Libya. Mr. el-Jahmi was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 22 April 2004. To date, no reply to that communication has been received by the 
Special Representative or Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>1573. According to new information received, Mr. el-Jahmi is being detained at an undisclosed 
location, believed to be an Internal Security Agency facility on the outskirts of Tripoli. He is 
reportedly in urgent need of medical attention; witnesses have stated that he is emaciated and 
lacks strength to speak. It is also reported that he is suffering from swollen legs. Furthermore, 
Mr. el-Jahmi has reportedly been allowed only sporadic visits from his family; in 2007 he 
reportedly received no visits at all. He is apparently not allowed to receive mail, books or 
newspapers. 
</p>
<p>1574. Mr. el Jahmi was reportedly arrested on 26 March 2004, after he criticized 
H.E. Mu&#8217;ammar al-Gaddafi and called for political reform, in interviews with international 
media. According to reports, the Foreign Ministry stated in July 2006 that he was being tried on 
charges of &#8220;exchanging information with employees of a foreign state causing harm to the 
interests of the country and providing them with information with the aim of their states 
attacking [Libya]&#8221; and &#8220;scheming with a foreign state in peacetime&#8221;. The Foreign Ministry said 
that Fathi el-Jahmi had access to a lawyer, but did not disclose where he was being tried. In 
March 2005, a report by Physicians for Human Rights and the International Federation of Health 
and Human Rights Organisations concluded after examination of Fathi el-Jahmi that he had been 
receiving only &#8220;sporadic and inadequate medical treatment&#8221;, despite &#8220;suffering from several 
chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease) that are independently 
life-threatening and difficult to control&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 277 
 
</p>
<p>1575. Concern was expressed that Mr. el-Jahmi&#8217;s detention could be directly related to his 
activities in defense of human rights, and that the conditions in which he is being held may 
amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. In view of reports of his 
deteriorating health, grave concern was also expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1576. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Malaysia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1577. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Reppresentative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion and belief, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
situation of Mr. P. Uthayakumar, Legal Adviser of the Hindu Human Rights Action Force 
(HINDRAF), Mr. M. Manoharan, Counsel of HINDRAF, Mr. R. Kenghadharan, Counsel of 
HINDRAF, Mr. V. Ganabatirau and Mr. T. Vasanthakumar, members of HINDRAF. The 
five human rights activists were the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 27 December 2007 by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>1578. According to new information received, since their arrest on 13 December 2007 under 
Section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act for allegedly carrying out activities that threatened 
national security, Mr. P. Uthayakumar, Mr. M. Manoharan, Mr. R. Kenghadharan, 
Mr. V. Ganabatirau and Mr. T. Vasanthakumar have been kept in solitary confinement for more 
than 16 hours a day, and have been exposed to light continuously in order to prevent them from 
sleeping and to disorientate them. 
</p>
<p>1579. Furthermore, Mr. P. Uthayakumar and Mr. M. Manoharan are diabetic and access to 
appropriate medication has reportedly been denied. On 7 April 2008, Mr. P. Uthayakumar 
collapsed in his cell and was taken to a doctor who diagnosed a heart condition. Although they 
have access to their lawyers, it is reported that discussions between the aforementioned human 
rights activists and their lawyer have been monitored by guards who have taken notes of what 
was said. 
</p>
<p>1580. Finally, they are denied their right to worship. They do not have access to temples and 
prayer rooms and no time to worship has been allocated to them. In view of the above reports, 
serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of P. Uthayakumar, 
M. Manoharan, R. Kenghadharan, V. Ganabatirau and T. Vasanthakumar. Further concern is 
reiterated that their arrest and detention may be solely linked to their reportedly non-violent 
activities in defense of human rights - in particular the rights of members of the Indian 
community in Malaysia - in the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1581. In a letter dated 19 December 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. 
In its response, the Government informed that HINDRAF remains a non-registered society, in 
contravention to the Societies Act 1966. The Government noted that HINDRAF has actively 
been promoting ethnic Indian issues to an extent that has incited racial and religious hatred of the 
predominantly Hindu ethnic Indian community against Malay-Muslims. The Government 
provided information concerning the rallies and speeches attended by the persons mentioned in 
the communication, and stated that inflammatory sentiments were widely circulated through 
these forums. In this regard, HINDRAF was detained under section 8(1) of the Internal Security 
Act 1960 on grounds that they were a threat to public order and security. The Government also 
provided information concerning the conditions of detention of the individuals mentioned in the 
communications by the Special Rapporteurs, explaining that the allegations that these individuals 
were kept in solitary confinement for more than 16 hours a day and have been exposed to light 
continuously in order to prevent them from sleeping and disorienting them are untrue. The 
Government also affirmed that the allegations that Mr. Uthayakumar and Mr. Manoharan had 
been denied medical treatment are untrue. The Government provided information regarding the 
access to lawyers by the individuals and affirmed that it is untrue that the individuals are being 
denied the right to worship. The Government also provided detailed information concerning the 
legal proceedings against the five individuals and reaffirmed its adherence to Article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, maintaining its understanding that these rights are not 
absolute by virtue of the restrictions as outlined in Article 29(2) of the UDHR, Article 4(1) and 
Article 19(2) of the ICCPR. In this regard, the Government noted that freedom of expression in 
Malaysia is not absolute. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1582. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 15 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1583. On 15 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Reppresentative of the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding the trial of Dr. Irene Fernandez, Director of Tenaganita, an organization 
dedicated to the defense of women&#8217;s rights in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>1584. According to the information received, in 1995, Dr. Irene Fernandez published a 
memorandum entitled Abuse, Torture and Dehumanized Conditions of Migrant Workers in 
Detention Centers. The memorandum called for an inquiry into the conditions in Malaysian 
detention centers. However, instead of leading to such an inquiry, the publishing of the 
memorandum resulted in Dr. Irene Fernandez being charged under Section 8 A (1) of Malaysia&#8217;s 
Printing Press and Publication Act for maliciously publishing false news. In October 2003, 
Dr. Irene Fernandez was sentenced to 12 months&#8217; imprisonment. She was later granted bail on 
the condition that she applied to court every time she wished to travel overseas. A hearing was 
scheduled for 28 October 2008 for the case of Dr. Irene Fernandez at the High Court of Malaya, 
Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1585. Concern was expressed that the legal action against Dr. Irene Fernandez, as well as the 
travel restrictions which were imposed on her, may have been related to her activities in the 
defense the human rights of detainees in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1586. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 19 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1587. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and 
the Special Reppresentative of the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights 
defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin, 
editor and founder of the online newspaper Malaysia Today. 
</p>
<p>1588. According to information received, on 12 September 2008, Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin 
was arrested, together with Ms. Teresa Kok, a Member of Parliament with the Democratic 
Action Party (DAP) and State Legislative Councilor, and Ms. Tan Hoon Cheng, a senior 
journalist with Chinese-language newspaper Sin Chew Daily, under Section 73(1) of the Internal 
Security Act (ISA) for allegedly posing a threat to &#8220;security, peace and public order&#8221;. In 
accordance with Section 73 (1) of the Act, individuals can be detained for up to sixty days 
without trial, and thereafter for a period of two years should the Home Ministry decide to extend 
the detention order. 
</p>
<p>1589. Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin was arrested at this home in Sunglai Buloh, in the province 
of Selangor, at approximately 1:00 p.m., by ten police officers who took him for questioning to 
an unknown location in Bukit Aman. Mr. Kumaruddin&#8217;s arrest is apparently related to recent 
comments he made about Islam on the website Malaysia Today. Mr. Kamaruddin is already 
facing prosecution on alleged charges of defamation and sedition in relation to articles and 
comments he had posted on his website in the past. On 26 August 2008, access to the Malaysia 
Today website was blocked following pressure from the Malaysian Communications and 
Multimedia Commission, the State agency charged with oversight of the communications 
industry. However, it became accessible again on 12 September. In 2001, Mr. Kumaruddin was 
arrested for his involvement with the National Justice Party. He was responsible for editing the 
Party&#8217;s newspaper, the content of which was deemed as &#8216;seditious&#8217; by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>1590. Mr. Kamaruddin remains in detention in Bukit Aman. The exact location of his detention 
is unknown. However reports claim that he is possibly being held at the main police headquarters 
in Bukit Aman, where he was granted a visit by his wife and daughters on 16 September. He was 
due to meet with his lawyer on 18 September. 
</p>
<p>1591. At approximately 11:00 p.m. on 12 September, Ms. Teresa Kok was arrested by police 
officers while on her way home. She was taken to an unknown location in Bukit Aman. On 
15 September, Ms. Kok received a visit from her family at the Bukit Aman police headquarters. 
During the visit she apparently indicated that she was being well treated, but that she was </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 280 
 
</p>
<p>suffering from low blood pressure, according to a medical check she received while in detention. 
Ms. Kok remained in detention at an undisclosed location in Bukit Aman and the reason for her 
arrest is unclear. Ms. Teresa Kok was reportedly released on 19 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>1592. Ms. Tan Hoon Cheng was arrested at her home in Penang in the evening 
of 12 September. Her arrest was reportedly related to an article she had written citing 
comments made by Minister Ahmad Ismail, the Malay leader of the ruling United Malays 
National Organisation (UMNO), who allegedly referred to Malaysians of Chinese origin as 
&#8220;squatters&#8221;. Ms. Cheng was taken into police custody for questioning in relation to her work. She 
was released 16 hours later, without charge. 
</p>
<p>1593. During a press conference on 13 September, the Interior Minister reportedly stated that 
the he had not ordered the aforementioned arrests and that he was unable to intervene, unless a 
decision was taken in accordance with the police. Lawyers acting for Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin 
are due to file a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release. The application was expected to be 
filed at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 15 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>1594. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
prevent independent reporting in Malaysia, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>1595. In a letter dated 12 December 2008, the Government responded to the communication, 
stating that the summary of the case which had been outlined by the Experts in the 
Communication based on the information received is not entirely accurate. The Government 
confirmed that all three individuals were arrested on 12 September 2008 under subsection 73 (1) 
of the Internal Security Act 1960. It provided the following information. 
</p>
<p>1596. &#8220;Ms. Tan Hoon Cheng was detained on the grounds of publishing fabricated news 
regarding a statement made by Dato&#180;Ahmad Ismail, Division Head, Bukit Bendera 
UMNO Division, Pulau Pinang that Chinese were mere migrants and &#8220;squatters&#8221; in Malaysia. 
This raised the ire of the Chinese against the Malays. Upon further investigation by the police, 
Ms. Tan Hoon Cheng was released 13 September 2008 on the grounds that her detention under 
subsection 73(1), Act 82 was inappropriate to be continued. 
</p>
<p>1597. Ms. Teresa Kok was detained on several grounds. The first was causing uproar amongst 
the Malays Muslims by questioning the issue of Azan or the Muslim call to prayer and secondly 
by questioning the usage of the tradition Malay know as jawi. Regarding the issue azan, the 
police received three (3) separate police reports including one police report on the incidences of 
cutting electrical wires connected to the loudspeakers of a surau which broadcasted the azan as 
well as the incidence stones thrown at the said surau. On 15 September 2008, Teresa&#8217;s father, 
mother, cousin and her Special Assistant were allowed to visit Teresa. On 17 September 2008, a 
counsel of Teresa&#8217;s choice was given visitation right. 
</p>
<p>1598. Mr. Raja Petra Kamaruddin was detained on 12 September 2008 under subsection 73(1), 
Act 82 due to his involvement in publishing articles in his blog site &#8220;Malaysia Today.&#8221; These 
articles were blasphemous to Islam and were also tarnishing the country&#8217;s leadership to an extent 
that these articles had caused confusion amongst the populace and threatened to jeopardize the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>national security of Malaysia. Mr. Kamaruddin had published an article entitled &#8220;Let&#8217;s Send 
Altantuya Murderers to Hell&#8221; in his blog &#8220;Malaysia Today&#8221; which had falsely accused a 
prominent leader in the Malaysian Government to be involved in the murder of a Mongolian 
national, Altantura Saaribu. Mr. Kamaruddin had published or allowed to be published in his 
blog &#8220;Malaysia Today&#8221; articles which had tarnished the image of Islam and defamed one of the 
holiest persons in Islam, Prophet Muhammed. These articles had caused extreme anger amongst 
the Muslims, mainly of Malay race, hatred between Muslims and non-Muslims in Malaysia and 
had seriously affected national security and interest. Mr. Kamaruddin&#8217;s family and a legal 
counsel of his own choice have been allowed to see him. The lawyers acting for Mr. Kamaruddin 
have filed the write of habeas corpus and the trail of the matter began on 23 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>1599. Mr. Kamaruddin was detained under subsection 73(1), Act 82 at the Detention Centre, 
Royal Malaysian Police Headquarters from 12-22 September 2008. Upon the issuance of the 
Detention Order by the Minister of Home Affairs, he was detained at the Protective Detention 
Centre in Taiping, perak from 22 September 2008. Upon the issuance of the writ of habeas 
corpus by the High Court on 7 November 2008, Mr. Kamaruddin was released from said 
Protective Detention Centre. 
</p>
<p>1600. The Government of Malaysia supports and promotes the protection and realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms within the confines of the provisions of the Federal 
Constitution of Malaysia. In implementing acceptable human rights principles and standards, the 
Government of Malaysia reiterates that the implementation must take into consideration the 
prevalent public and national interest of the country.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1601. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Reppresentative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the arrest of family 
members of detained Hindu Rights Actions Force (HINDRAF) lawyers, and the decision to 
declare the HINDRAF an illegal organisation. Members of HINDRAF were the subject of an 
urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 27 December 2007, and another urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 21 April 2008. 
We acknowledge receipt of the responses of the Government of Your Excellency to the first 
communication sent on 8 February and 28 August 2008. A response to the second 
communication has yet to be provided. 
</p>
<p>1602. According to the information received, on 23 October 2008, Ms. P. Vwaishhnnavi, 
daughter of P. Waythamoorthy and niece of HINDRAF leader P. Uthayakumar, was arrested, 
together with her mother K. Shanti, S. Jayathas, P. Taramaraju, P. Waytha Nayagi, Poobalan, 
R. Kannan, Mary Shanti, Bala, Rajasekaran and Ravi Sundaram, on their way to the 
Prime Minister&#8217;s office in Putrajaya. The group intended to submit a Deepavali card to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 282 
 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister calling for the release of five human rights defenders from HINDRAF 
imprisoned under the Internal Security Act. The 11 detained persons are currently being held at 
the Putrajaya district police headquarters. 
</p><p>1603. On 15 October 2008, HINDRAF was declared an illegal organisation under Section 5(1) 
of the Societies Act. The decision was reportedly made as a result of monitoring and 
investigation on HINDRAF&#8217;s activities since its inception, by the Registrar of Societies (ROS) 
and Home Ministry. According to Home Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar, &#8220;if left 
unchecked, HINDRAF would continue to pose a threat to public order, the security and 
sovereignty of the country as well as the prevailing racial harmony&#8221;. On 16 October 2007, 
HINDRAF applied for registration with the ROS, but a decision had yet to be taken. 
</p>
<p>1604. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned persons and 
the decision to declare HINDRAF an illegal organisation may be linked to HINDRAF&#8217;s 
activities in the defence of the rights of the ethnic minority Indians in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1605. In a letter dated 15 January 2009, the Government replied to the communication above. 
In its reply, the Government stated that the police arrested eleven individuals who were gathered 
in front of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office under section 48 of the Societies Act 1966. The 
Government noted that the police offered to release Nagaswary a/p Karuppen on humanitarian 
grounds due to the fact that she had a daughter but she refused and chose instead to remain at the 
Police Station, even though she was not in custody. Vwaishhannavi a/p Waytha Moorthy was 
never arrested because of hear age (she was 6 years old at the time of the incident). The 
Government noted that she also remained at the Police Station under the car of her mother 
Nagaswary a/p Karuppen. Both chose to stay at the Police Station on their own volition as a 
show of support for the others that were detained. Both left the Police Station the next morning 
at 7 a.m. 
</p>
<p>1606. The Government informed that all those detained were released on 26 October 2008 
with police bail and instructed to report on 25 November 2008 to the Police Station. On 
15 October 2008, HINDRAF was declared an illegal organization under section 5(1) of the 
Societies Act 1966. The decision was made under continuous monitoring and investigation into 
its activities by the ROS and the Home Ministry, which found that its activities contravened the 
Act. The Government noted that the investigation showed that HINDRAF actively organized 
illegal assemblies and incited hatred among Indians against the Malays. 
</p>
<p>1607. The Government informed that the detention is a direct consequence of the incitement of 
hatred which in a multi-racial State like Malaysia would not only be detrimental but also very 
dangerous as it may lead to racial violence. As such, the detention was a necessary preventive act 
before the tension swelled and grew out of hand. The detention was not due to the fact that 
HINDRAF was defending ethnic Indian rights as alleged. 
</p>

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>1609. In a letter dated 28 August 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent 
appeal of 28 December 2007. The Government reported that the detainees have been accorded 
the right to counsel after their lawyers showed their appointment letters. One of the detainees, 
M. Manoharan was allowed to see their family and counsel on 14 December 2007, the day after 
the arrest. These visitation rights are also given to each Detainee to meet with family members 
and legal counsels. The Detainees have also exercised their judicial rights in that writs of habeas 
corpus were filed as provided for under section 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code challenging 
the procedural requirement of their detention order. The matter was heard on 18 February 2008 
before the High Court and the decision from the High Court was that the writ was dismissed. 
The Detainees were legally represented by lawyers of their or their family&#8217;s choice. On 
26 December 2007, all the detainees had filed their representations to the Advisory Board as 
provided under the law. The hearing of these representations has been set for 14 January 2008 
and notice of the hearing was given to the detainees and the respective lawyers. On the said 
hearing date, all detainees were present before the Advisory Board. The hearing was deferred to 
12 February 2008. The Advisory Board presided from 12-15 February and subsequently 
on 19 and 20 February 2008. At the Advisory Board the Detainees were represented by lawyers 
either of their own choice or that of their families.

<p>1619. Los el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente, se&#241;alando a la 
atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la Hermana 
Consuelo Morales Elizondo, directora de la organizaci&#243;n de derechos humanos Ciudadanos en 
Apoyo a los Derechos Humanos A.C. (CADHAC), y con otros miembros de la misma 
organizaci&#243;n. CADHAC tiene su sede en la ciudad de Monterrey en el Estado de Nuevo Le&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>1620. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, la Hermana Consuelo Morales habr&#237;a sido 
seguida, vigilada y amenazada por varios hombres desconocidos en las &#250;ltimas semanas. La 
CADHAC habr&#237;a coordinado varias actividades de protesta contra la creaci&#243;n de un complejo 
residencial y de ocio en una zona de protecci&#243;n medioambiental denominada Parque Nacional 
Cumbres de Monterrey, las cuales habr&#237;an incluido una manifestaci&#243;n el 18 de mayo de 2008, en 
la que habr&#237;an participado alrededor de 400 personas.

<p>hacia el auto de Consuelo Morales, mas al ver que no se trataba de la susodicha, se habr&#237;a 
marchado. Posteriormente en las oficinas de CADHAC se habr&#237;a recibido una llamada telef&#243;nica 
en la que se le habr&#237;a advertido a la monja que no se acercara. El 19 de mayo, Consuelo Morales 
habr&#237;a observado una furgoneta con cristales tintados aparcada delante de su domicilio, que se 
habr&#237;a marchado media hora m&#225;s tarde. 
</p>
<p>1622. Se aleg&#243; que la intimidaci&#243;n de la susodicha y las amenazas en contra de ella podr&#237;an 
estar directamente relacionadas con su trabajo en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular 
el libre ejercicio de los derechos de libertad de expresi&#243;n y de asamblea en el marco de la

gubernamental Justicia para Nuestras Hijas, quien trabaja en la defensa de los derechos de las 
mujeres en el contexto de la violencia de g&#233;nero y los femicidios en el Estado de Chihuahua. 
</p><p>1625. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 14 de mayo de 2008, la 
Sra. Luz Estela Castro habr&#237;a sido amenazada en dos ocasiones, a las 10 y luego a las 11 de la 
ma&#241;ana, mediante llamadas a su tel&#233;fono celular. Tras estas ocurrencias, la Sra. Castro habr&#237;a 
presentado una denuncia ante la Procuradur&#237;a estatal, donde habr&#237;a solicitado que se le otorgaran 
medidas de protecci&#243;n y que se realizara una investigaci&#243;n de los citados hechos. Desde 
el 14 de mayo la Sra. Lucha Castro estar&#237;a acompa&#241;ada por dos agentes.

ONG Justicia para Nuestra Hijas, con ocasi&#243;n del quinto aniversario del asesinato de la joven 
Neyra Azucena Cervantes, quien fue asesinada en 2003, cuando ten&#237;a 19 a&#241;os. Seg&#250;n se informa,

desde 1993 hasta la fecha, y que m&#225;s de 40 estaban en paradero desconocido. De acuerdo con las 
recomendaciones de la Relatora Especial sobre violencia contra la mujer tras su visita a M&#233;xico 
en 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.4), se inst&#243; al Gobierno de Su Excelencia a que investigue con la 
debida diligencia estos asesinatos y desapariciones forzadas, as&#237; como todos los supuestos actos 
de violencia contra la mujer, para poner fin a la impunidad de quienes cometen estos cr&#237;menes. 
1628. En este contexto, se aleg&#243; que las amenazas en contra de la Sra. Castro podr&#237;an estar 
directamente relacionadas con su trabajo en defensa de los derechos humanos, y podr&#237;an formar 
parte de un intento de impedir sus actividades en defensa de los derechos de las mujeres. Se

cuarenta personas - entre ellos miembros de la polic&#237;a, de las fuerzas de seguridad, y de las 
autoridades de Ixtepec - habr&#237;an entrado sin permiso en el refugio Hermanos en el Camino y 
habr&#237;an amenazado con incendiarlo en el plazo de cuarenta y ocho horas si el centro no fuera

denominada el Movimiento Ind&#237;gena Revolucionario Antizapatista, con filiaciones con el Partido 
Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). Se alega que esta organizaci&#243;n ha sido responsable de una 
serie de agresiones y fraudes electorales en contra de comunidades zapatistas y opositoras al PRI, 
las cuales presuntamente comenzaron en 2007 cuando la OPDDIC gan&#243; la presidencia municipal 
de Chil&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>1671. Con respecto al ejido de San Sebasti&#225;n Bachaj&#243;n, se informa que el 9 de marzo de 2007, 
la OPDDIC moviliz&#243; a miembros de su organizaci&#243;n provenientes de otros ejidos para que 
votaran en la Asamblea ejidal de San Sebasti&#225;n Bachaj&#243;n y as&#237; obtener la mayor&#237;a de los votos, 
con la finalidad de nombrar nuevas autoridades ejidales y as&#237; tomar control del ejido. A su vez,

junto con miembros de la OPDDIC, tomaron por medio del uso de la fuerza la caseta de entrada 
de las Cascadas de Agua Azul, dejando gravemente heridos a los ejidatarios que la custodiaban. 
</p><p>1673. Tradicionalmente, los ingresos recibidos en la caseta de entrada a las Cascadas de Agua 
Azul han sido utilizados para el pago del impuesto del ejido San Sebasti&#225;n Bachaj&#243;n y han 
estado administrados por las autoridades tradicionales ind&#237;genas del ejido. Se alega que, con la 
toma de la caseta, la OPDDIC pretend&#237;a despojar al ejido de este ingreso econ&#243;mico y controlar 
la regi&#243;n de Agua Azul y gozar de los presuntos beneficios tur&#237;sticos, como el establecimiento de 
un corredor eco-arqueo-tur&#237;stico denominado &#8220;Centro Integralmente Planificado Palenque-Agua 
Azul&#8221;, en donde diversas autoridades federales participan. El 18 de junio de 2008, los ejidatarios 
de San Sebasti&#225;n Bachaj&#243;n retomaron la caseta, desalojando a los miembros de la OPDDIC que 
la custodiaban. El 16 de julio de 2008 a las 15:00 horas, miembros de la OPDDIC intentaron a 
ocupar la caseta de acceso de Agua Azul, con fuerza, disparando al aire con pistolas calibre .22. 
Se alega que el grupo estaba acompa&#241;ado por el Sexto Regidor del Municipio de Chil&#243;n, 
Sr. Antonio Jim&#233;nez Garc&#237;a. 
</p>
<p>1674. Posteriormente, se informa que los miembros del OPDDIC repartieron un documento 
an&#243;nimo donde se acusa a los ejidatarios de &#8220;secuestradores, maleantes, pandilleros, asaltantes 
que tienen retenida la caseta de cobro de las Cascadas de Agua Azul, personas mismas que son 
miembros de la organizaci&#243;n Yomblej (partido pol&#237;tico opositor de la OPDDIC) pero se hacen 
pasar por supuestos zapatistas&#8221;. En realidad, los ejidatarios no pertenecen a ninguna de estas 
organizaciones, sino a &#8220;la Otra Campa&#241;a&#8221;. El 6 de agosto de 2008, la OPDDIC, con la 
participaci&#243;n de autoridades estatales y municipales, public&#243; una nota en el peri&#243;dico &#8220;Cuarto

<p>en actualidad rechazaron el acuerdo, dado que los ingresos de la caseta tradicionalmente son 
administradas por las autoridades ind&#237;genas a beneficio del ejido. Adem&#225;s, se teme que, con tal 
acuerdo, el gobierno del estado de Chiapas avalar&#225; a las falsas autoridades ejidales, y fortalecer&#225; 
el control pol&#237;tico de la OPDDIC en el municipio de Chil&#243;n, en particular en la regi&#243;n de las

tarde, el Presidente Municipal de Benem&#233;rito de las Am&#233;ricas habr&#237;a llamado telef&#243;nicamente a 
la Sra. Martha Contreras Estrada, dici&#233;ndole &#8220;Martha &#8230; quiero que ya le baje de huevos, sino yo 
se los voy a bajar ... porque tu eres la que esta encabezando el movimiento &#8230; Yo te puedo

derechos de la gente de Amuzgo y los pueblos ind&#237;genas de M&#233;xico. 
</p>
<p>1682. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 26 de julio de 2008, hacia la 1.00 a.m., el 
Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Guti&#233;rrez &#193;vila habr&#237;a sido asesinado mientras conduc&#237;a hacia la capital de 
Guerrero. Su cuerpo habr&#237;a sido hallado a orillas de la carretera federal Acapulco-Ometepec,

directo con la empresa minera canadiense Minefinders con el prop&#243;sito de defender los derechos 
a la tierra y a los recursos naturales de la comunidad del Ejido Huizopa. La empresa Minefinders 
ocupa supuestamente 3.498 hect&#225;reas de la tierra de esta comunidad, aunque en 2006 firm&#243; un

motivado por su trabajo para defender los derechos medioambientales de la comunidad 
Ejido Huizopa contra actividades mineras en la zona. Aunque todav&#237;a no se ha recibido una

</p>
<p>el a&#241;o 1994, situada en el municipio de Madera, Chihuahua. Al inicio de la exploraci&#243;n, la 
empresa celebr&#243; un contrato con los comuneros del ejido Huizopa, en el que se fijaron las 
condiciones para el arranque de un programa para la exploraci&#243;n y operaci&#243;n de la mina. Ante la 
factibilidad del proyecto, y a petici&#243;n de los ejidatarios de re negociar las condiciones pactadas, 
la empresa realiz&#243; en el mes de julio de 2006, un nuevo ofrecimiento economico, el cual fue 
rechazado por los ejidatarios. El ofrecimiento econ&#243;mico consisti&#243; en un pago de 6.5 millones de 
pesos a la aceptaci&#243;n de las condiciones de nuevo acuerdo; 500 mil pesos anuales por concepto 
de renta durante la construcci&#243;n y acondicionamiento del proyecto; 7.5 millones de pesos al 
iniciar la producci&#243;n de la mina e incremento del pago por concepto de renta en 250 mil pesos 
anuales durante la vida del proyecto. Los ejidatarios por su parte solicitaban el pago anual de 
un porcentaje por concepto de utilidades y su afiliaci&#243;n al Instituto Mexicano del Seguro 
Social.El 28 de septiembre de 2006, se llev&#243; a cabo una reuni&#243;n a la que asistieron 
representantes de diversas dependencias del gobierno estatal para tratar de solucionar la 
discrepancia entre la empresa y el grupo de ejidatarios, sin embargo, no se lleg&#243; a ningun 
acuerdo, posteriormente los ejidatarios tomaron las instalaciones y paralizaron los trabajos del 
proyecto durante 5 dias. El 3 de octubre de 2006, los ejidatarios permitieron que la empresa 
continuara con los trabajos, siempre y cuando no hubiera presencia de autoridades, ni medios de 
comunicacion. En los meses de abril y mayo de 2007, habitantes de la comunidad de Dolores y 
Ciudad Madera, bloquearon nuevamente el paso de todo tipo de vehiculos al proyecto minero, 
suspendiendo los trabajos por 12 dias. En noviembre de 2007, se llev&#243; una reunion con 
representantes del municipio de Madera, de la Secretaria de Obras Publicas de la Direccion 
de Gobernacion y de la Direccion de Mineria del gobierno del estado de Chihuahua. 
El 18 de diciembre de 2007, la minera comunic&#243; el cierre temporal de sus operaciones. 
</p>
<p>1693. II. La Comision Estatal de Derechos Humanos del estado de Chihuahua dio inicio a tres 
expedientes de queja 125/2008, 126/2008 y 231/2008, las cuales fueron remitidas a la Comisi&#243;n 
Nacional de los Derechos Humanos (CNDH) por ser la competente para conocer de los hechos 
denunciados, por estar involucrada una autoridad federal, como es la Secretaria de la Defensa 
Nacional. La CNDH se encuentra integrado el expediente de queja CNDH/4/2008/3032/Q con 
motivo de una queja presentada por los se&#241;ores Torres Gonzalez y Gonzalez Banda. 
</p><p>1694. III. Acerca de la base legal de las acciones emprendidas en relacion a los hechos 
suscitados el 26 de mayo de 2008, hubo una intervenci&#243;n por parte de la Secretaria de la Defensa 
Nacional, con fundamento en la Ley Federal de Armas de Fuego y Explosivos de conformidad 
con el articulo 2 fraccion III, la cual consisti&#243; exclusivamente en que elementos del Ejercito 
mexicano verificaran medidas de seguridad en el desembarque y consumo de material explosivo 
utilizado por la compa&#241;ia minera &#8220;Dolores&#8221; para trabajos propios de la empresa. Segun 
informaci&#243;n recabada por la Secretaria de Seguridad Publica del estado de Chihuahua (SSP-Chi), 
el dia de los hechos se encontraban dos unidades de la Direcci&#243;n de Operaci&#243;n Preventiva en el 
ejido Huizopa, para la salvaguardia de la integridad fisica de representantes de la Direcci&#243;n de 
Gobernaci&#243;n del estado Chihuahua, autoridad designada para sostener un dialogo con el grupo 
de ejidatarios. Los elementos de la Policia Estatal se retiraron del lugar el 28 de mayo de 2008 a 
las 10:50 a.m., elaborando el reporte de incidente 41175. 
</p>
<p>1695. IV. La Procuraduria General de Justicia del estado de Chihuahua (PGJ Chi), inform&#243; que 
despues de que sus autoridades ministeriales realizaran una busqueda exhaustiva en los libros de 
gobierno de las agencias del Ministerio Publico del estado de Chihuahua, no se hall&#243; registro 
relacionado con la detenci&#243;n de los se&#241;ores Torres Garcia y Gonzalez Banda, y agreg&#243; que </p>

</p>
<p>tampoco se han presentado para formular denuncia que tenga relaci&#243;n con la descripci&#243;n de los 
hechos referidos en el llamamiento urgente. Tomando en consideraci&#243;n que en la PGJ Chih no 
hall&#243; registro relacionado con la detenci&#243;n de los se&#241;ores Torres Garcia y Gonzalez Banda, el 
Estado mexicano por este conducto conmina a los quejosos a que, de considerar que 
efectivamente han sido victimas de algun delito, presenten su denuncia ante las instancias 
competentes para que est&#233;n en posibilidad de investigar los hechos y en su caso imponer las 
sanciones correspondientes a quien o quienes resulten responsables. 
</p>
<p>1696. V. Con la finalidad de atender y resolver el conllicto que confronta la comunidad 
Huizopa, cl 21 de mayo de 2008, dos diputados federales presentaron un punto de acuerdo 
solicitando al Pleno de la Camara de Diputados &#8220;se constituya la comision especial para 
investigar la explotaci&#243;n minera en Mexico&#8221; debido al creciente ingreso de empresas mineras 
canadienses. En el mismo punto de acuerdo exhorto a la Comision Nacional de los Derechos 
Humanos a realizar una investigaci&#243;n sobre las posibles violaciones a los derechos humanos que 
pueden estar ocurriendo en contra de los habitantes del ejido Huizopa, en el estado de 
Chihuahua. El 14 de julio de 2008, cuatro diputados federales enviaron cartas al presidente de la 
empresa Minefinders a fin de solicitarle una pronta respuesta a las tres demandas expuestas por 
ejidatarios de Huizopa durante el proceso de dialogo: integraci&#243;n de una comisi&#243;n mixta de 
cuidado del medio ambiente, la financiaci&#243;n de un plan de desarrollo comunitario y un plan de 
desarrollo econ&#243;mico.

<p><b>Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>1700. El Relator Especial lamenta no haber recibido respuesta del Gobierno a la comunicaci&#243;n 
arriba mencionada en la fecha de finalizaci&#243;n de &#233;ste informe. 
</p>
<p><b>Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 19 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1701. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent a communication concerning the state of emergency which was implemented 
by the Government on 1 July 2008, and the killings of Mr. Dorjsuren Enkhbayar, 
Mr. Munkh-Erdene Renchindagva, Mr. Batsaikhan Togtokh and Mr. Enkhbaatar Tseregjav. 
</p><p>1702. According to information received, on 1 July 2008, approximately 700 people were 
arrested and many others injured during post-election protests in Ulaanbaatar. A four-day state of 
emergency was declared by the Government when rioting erupted in the capital sparked by 
allegations of election fraud. The protests police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons 
to disperse the crowds. A number of individuals reportedly lost their sight or suffered serious eye 
injuries as a result. When the state of emergency was declared sufficient measures had not been 
taken to inform citizens of the curfew, and those individuals who were on the streets at the time 
were arrested. 
</p>
<p>1703. In the early hours of the morning of 2 July, Mr. Dorjsuren Enkhbayar, 
Mr. Munkherdene Renchindagva, Mr. Enkhbaatar Tserenjav and Mr. Batsaikhan Togtokh were 
shot dead in a central street in Ulaanbaatar, at a short distance from where the main protests were 
taking place. Reports claim that their injuries show that they had been severely beaten before 
being shot. An official police investigation has reportedly been launched into the incident. 
However the results have yet to be made public. 
</p>
<p>1704. Numerous complaints have also been made regarding alleged mistreatment of those 
detained for questioning after the protests, including women and children, many of whom were 
subjected to beatings, detained in cramped cells without food and water, and forced to sign 
statements implicating themselves in violent activities during the protests. According to the 
Mongolian Criminal Procedures Code individuals can be detained without charges for a period 
of up to 72 hours. The majority of those who were detained were released within 72 hours. 
However legal counsel was not made available during detention. Reports also claim that 
following the protests, new arrests may have been made based on the identification of 
individuals through video footage recorded during the demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>1705. Since 4 July, silent protests have been held on a daily basis in Sukhbaatar Square by 
citizens collecting signatures for the release of approximately 200 individuals who remain in 
detention. To date there are no reports of any security incidents; however, two of the organizers </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 300 
 
</p>
<p>of the protests have been summoned by the authorities to make an appearance at Sukhbaatar 
District Court. They were held in preventive detention for 14 days and face charges of disrupting 
the peace. 
</p>
<p>1706. During the state of emergency a ban was placed on all radio and television stations except 
for the Mongolian National Public Radio and television. 
</p>
<p>1707. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to 
stifle freedom of expression and opinion in Mongolia. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government

<p>1708. In a letter dated 12 October 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. 
In its response, the Government provided the following information: 
</p>
<p>1709. &#8220;While expressing our regret to the fact that some misleading information was delivered 
to the UN about the events happened in Ulaanbaatar on July 1, 2008, we would like to make 
some clarifications and provide you with factual information on the measures taken to halt the 
public disorder and the undergoing investigation. 
</p>
<p>1710. On 1 July we received a call that a group of people is organizing an unauthorized 
demonstration, and demonstrators are attacking Mongolian People&#8217;s Revolutionary Party HQ 
building, causing unrest and damaging properties. A police regiment was sent there immediately 
for the purpose of securing the safety of the people involved and enforcing the public order. 
</p>
<p>1711. Because of the violent criminal activities of some group of people the situation there 
became unstable; moreover, their activities caused an actual threat to the lives of the police 
personnel. They threw bricks, &#8220;Molotov cocktails&#8221;, iron sticks and wounded several officers. 
They vandalized property and arson the building. In order to stop this unrest and prevent the 
broadening of its scope and further damages, the President of Mongolia declared the State of 
emergency for 4 days in Ulaanbaatar city, where it authorizes the police to forcefully disperse, 
adhering to the requirements of the related laws and regulations, illegal demonstrations and 
rallies. 
</p>
<p>1712. From the very beginning, the police have had a defensive stance aiming to calm down the 
situation. It was equipped with shields and truncheons, and used tear gas and fired rubber bullets 
completely in accordance with the regulations. 
</p>
<p>1713. During these events at late night of 1 and early hours of 2 July the police 
arrested 731 persons as suspects of criminal activities, as well as persons without proper ID 
during the curfew and people possessing criminally acquired items, and detained them at the 
Metropolitan Police Department Custody Center. 
</p>
<p>1714. In order to conduct the investigation of detainees speedily and not to cause any hindrance 
to their dependents the police authority has established a special working group for their 
investigation, organized food supply and medical service for the needed. Thus, 231 people 
underwent medical check-up, first aid was delivered to 39 persons and 5 persons were 
hospitalized. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 301 
 
</p>
<p>1715. As the Custody center became overpopulated, the rooms there had been airconditioned 
every 2 hours. During this time, representatives from prosecutor&#8217;s office of the Capital city and 
Chingeltei district, Mongolian Attorney&#8217;s Association, National Human Rights Commission, 
journalists, reporters and members of State Ikh Khural (Parliament) of Mongolia 
Mr. L. Gundalai, Mr. Kh. Battulga, Mr. B. Batbaatar and Chairman of National Human Rights 
Commission have had visited the Custody center and met the detainees in person. 
</p>
<p>1716. Some serious crimes were committed during unrest, and the police authority commenced 
an investigation process according to the relative articles of the Criminal Code, i.e. article 177.2 
(banditry), article 179.1 (organization of mass disorder), Article 145.3 (theft), 153.2 
(intentionally damaging others&#8217; property), Article 230.3 (armed resistance to official). As a result 
of investigating criminal cases of these 731 persons detained in accordance with the 
administrative regulations, 157 persons were left in custody as suspects, and 574 persons were 
released on bail. During the unrest 532 police personnel were attacked and 471 of them injuries 
of various severity. However, only 5 persons among the demonstrators were found wounded by 
the forensic medical examination. This fact clearly shows who was the assaulter and who was 
the defender. 
</p>
<p>1717. Also among 1012 persons involved in criminal acts, administrative violations and curfew 
violators, 282 persons were found intoxicated with alcohol, and 96 were repeated offenders. 
</p>
<p>1718. The police, abided by the Law, in all its activities of restoring public order and after, is 
working under the strict supervision of the State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and other governmental 
organizations, as well as under control of human rights NGOs. 
</p>
<p>1719. As for the issue of death of 4 demonstrators during the unrest, the investigation Unit of 
the State Prosecutor&#8217;s office, by the instructions from the National Security Council of 
Mongolia, has interrogated 106 officers of the Patrol Unit of the General Police Authority and 
detained 10 officers as suspects. 
</p>
<p>1720. These officers are charged against article 91.2.11 of the Special section of the Criminal 
Code of Mongolia, i.e. intended homicide by an organized gang. 
</p>
<p>1721. Currently, it is vital to focus on issues of the rights of officers, who fulfilled their duties, 
and victims and business entities, who received damages during the demonstration. 
</p>
<p>1722. The police authority is now working on calculating the actual amount of loss and 
damage, occurred to the individuals and legal entities during the events of public disorder 
of 1 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>1723. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply.

</b></p>
<p>1724. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group on arbitrary detention, sent a </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>communication regarding Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal, born 11 January 1982, Mongolian citizen, 
Citizen ID No. UB0878661, economist by profession and Deputy Chairman of the Civic 
Movement Party, usually residing at Sukhbaatar District, 3 Horoo, 5 Horoolol, Bldg. 43, Apt. 39. 
</p>
<p>1725. According to the information received, Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal was 
arrested on 7 July 2008 at the National Criminal Investigation Authority&#8217;s head office by 
Senior Criminal Investigator L. Tugs-Uhaan on a warrant issued by the Capital City Prosecution 
Office, Prosecutor J. Munhjargal pursuant to sections 68.1, 68.7 and 69.1 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code. He is currently being detained at the detention centre at Gants Hudag, 
Unit 0461 of the Judicial Decision Enforcement Agency. His detention was authorized by the 
Sukhbaatar District Judge A. Munhzul&#8217;s judicial decision in order to prevent possible obstruction 
of a criminal investigation against Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal. The decision is currently on appeal 
before the Chief Judge of Chingeltei District Court. 
</p>
<p>1726. At the time of arrest Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal was still a candidate for the Parliamentary 
elections, enjoying immunity under article 35.2 of the State Great Hural Election Law. His arrest 
was carried out without the necessary notification and permission of the Songino-Khairhan 
District Election Committee. After 14 days of detention a criminal offence case in terms of 
Articles 177 (banditry - armed, intended, planned) and 179 (encouraging, guiding others to an 
unlawful act) of the Criminal Code of Mongolia was filed against Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal. The 
opening of a criminal investigation against him has been challenged before the criminal 
investigator, prosecutor in charge of this case and all appeals level prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>1727. Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal suffers from chronic bronchial asthma, a medical condition. 
Sections 68.2 and 68.9 of the Criminal Procedure Code provide that &#8220;it is prohibited to detain or 
apply restraint methods on persons with serious medical conditions&#8221; as specified in Joint 
Ministerial Order of Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs and Ministry of Health #313/316 
dated 31 December 2002. 
</p>
<p>1728. Due to the poor standard air and lighting in the cell Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal&#8217;s chronic 
bronchial asthma deteriorated to a 57 percent loss of lung breathing capacity. His lawyers, family 
and civil society activists appealed to all relevant levels of the justice system, the Human Rights 
Commission and other decision-makers without result. 
</p>
<p>1729. For several days he has not been provided with the food that he has purchased from an 
external food caterer on the pretext that the person responsible for delivering the food has too 
many people to serve and did not make it to his cell. It is reported that he has now gone on 
hunger strike. 
</p>
<p>1730. Concerns were expressed for Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal&#8217;s state of health. Further concern 
was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Magnai Otgonjargal might be linked to the 
exercise of his right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, particularly to be elected at 
genuine period elections. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1731. The Special Rapporteur regrets that to date no response has been received from the 
Government regarding the aforementioned case. </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1732. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group 
on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
sent a communication regarding Ms. Gelegiin Baasan, leader of the Free Elder&#8217;s Union and a 
human rights defender since 2000, who has been involved in the movement which developed in 
the aftermath of the events following the announcement of the State of Emergency by the 
Government on 1 July 2008, during which four people were killed and some 700 arrested. 
Ms. Baasan has participated in campaigns for the rights of those who remain in detention. 
</p>
<p>1733. Events which occurred during the aforementioned State of Emergency were the subject 
of an allegation letter sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, on 19 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>1734. According to information received, on 18 November 2008, at approximately 3.30 p.m., 
Ms. Baasan was arrested in Ulaanbaatar, while attending an &#8216;open door day&#8217; organized annually 
by the Ministry of Justice. Ms. Baasan along with a group of approximately 100 family members 
representing those who were arrested during the 1 July events (approximately 230 people remain 
in detention, some having been sentenced to between 4 and 7 years imprisonment, including 
8 minors) had gathered outside the Ministry. The family members had requested a meeting with 
the Minister. When the Minister did not appear, police officers surrounded the building and 
requested that the group leave the premises. As the gathering was peacefully dispersing, 
Ms. Baasan was reportedly approached by a police officer who told her that her days were 
numbered. Following this encounter, a heated exchange apparently ensued resulting in 
Ms. Baasan&#8217;s arrest. 
</p>
<p>1735. On that same evening, Chingeltei District Court reportedly ruled that there was no basis 
for Ms. Baasan&#8217;s arrest. However the following morning the same Court sentenced Ms. Baasan 
to 14 days preventive detention on charges of disturbing the public order. The charges apparently 
stemmed from a letter of complaint submitted by five employees of the Ministry of Justice. 
Ms. Baasan is currently being detained at Detention Center No. 111 in Ulaanbaatar. 
</p>
<p>1736. Ms. Baasan had been arrested on four separate occasions in the past, most recently in 
June 2007, when State security forces attempted to disperse a reportedly peaceful protest and, 
one of the doors of the building of the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs was damaged. 
Ms. Baasan was arrested and charged for the damage done to the door of the by the Chingeltei 
District Court, which sentenced her to 20 days imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>1737. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Baasan may be related to her 
legitimate activities in the defence of human rights in Mongolia, particularly her recent 
involvement in campaigning for the rights of those detained during the State of Emergency 
on 1 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1738. In a letter dated 4 February 2009, the Government replied to the communication above. 
In its response, the Government informed that from 27 October through 18 November 2009, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 304 
 
</p>
<p>G. Baasan had been sentence for a 20-day arrest three times and fined for 20.000 tugrugs 
one time&#8221;. The Government provided a detailed description of the events leading to her arrest as 
well as the legal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>1739. The Government also stated that the Police Department never infringed Ms. Baasan&#8217;s 
right to speech, right to freedom of opinion and expression, and right to peaceful demonstration, 
but collected the case materials and documented her illegal activities through video recording 
and submitted them to the judicial organs only for her actions such as verbal abuse, refusal of 
legal demand of police officers, disrespect to the public, minor roughing and disturbance of 
normal activity of the organization. 
</p>

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 2 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1741. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the ruling by the Higher Court 
in Podgorica against Monitor, an independent weekly magazine, and Mr. Andrej Nikolaidis, one 
of its journalists, in April 2008. 
</p><p>1742. According to the information received, the Higher Court found the Monitor magazine 
liable for the publication of a critical article about film director Emir Kusturica. The article, 
originally published in 2004, critically analysed Mr. Kusturica&#8217;s public stance concerning the 
conflicts in the Balkans, particularly his alleged public support to Slobodan Milosevic. The 
Higher Court&#8217;s verdict compels the Monitor magazine to pay 12,000 Euros in non-material 
damages to Mr. Kusturica because of the &#8220;emotional pain&#8221; and &#8220;harm to his honour and 
reputation&#8221; caused by the publication of the article. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1743. By a letter dated 2 July 2008, the Government responded to the communication and after 
having briefed about internal norms aimed at guaranteeing freedom of expression it indicated 
that &#8220;Acting upon this legal action, the Basic Court in Podgorica passed the judgment or 
January 18, 2006 in which they turned down the claimant&#8217;s request as unfounded. After the 
claimant contested the judgment thereof the Highs Court reversed the first instance judgment on 
February 15, 2006 and ordered the defendants, Andrej Nikolaidis and the Monitor weekly to 
indemnify the claimant on the grounds of damage caused in form of mental pain due to the 
damage of reputation, honour, freedom and right of person with the amount of Euros 12,000 that 
they have to pay together on the basis of solidarity. The Court took into consideration that the 
amount thereof was not compensation but a satisfaction for the plantiff. The Court found that the 
claimed amount was too big. On the basis of the facts presented hereinabove, we can conclude 
that in relation to the case all procedural and material-legal presumptions in relation to 
indemnification for non-material damage for mental pain caused by harm to reputation, honour, 
freedom and rights of person were fulfilled In addition, the court judgment was handed down by 
independent and impartial courts that are not under the influence of the Executive power&#8221;. </p>

<p>1745. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of 
Mr. Mladen Stojovic, a sports journalist in the dailies Danas (Belgrade, Serbia) and Vijesti 
(Podgorica, Montenegro). He has on numerous occasions stressed the alleged influence of 
criminal organizations on professional football. 
</p>
<p>1746. According to the information received, on 23 May 2008, Mr. Stojovic was reportedly 
assaulted at his home in Bar and later admitted to the Emergency Room of the city hospital. 
Mr. Stojovic was diagnosed with a fracture of the upper and lower jawbone, a puncture wound 
through the cheek caused by an object slightly larger than a needle, as well as a broken tooth 
root, scarring around the eyes, Adam&#8217;s apple, on the nose, elbows, shoulders and knees. 
According to a neuro-psychiatric and general examination, the wounds were not caused by a fall 
from losing consciousness. 
</p>
<p>1747. This assault reportedly occurred following the broadcast in January 2008 of a 
documentary entitled &#8220;Insajder&#8221; (Insider) on Serbian TV B92, in which Mr. Stojovic highlighted 
the alleged linkage between professional football and criminal organizations. 
</p>
<p>1748. Serious concern was expressed that the assault against Mr. Stojovic could be related to 
the exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern was expressed for 
the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Stojovic.

le commanditaire principal desdits troubles de l&#8217;ordre public. Ce dernier avait demand&#233; &#224; 
Lahcen Lafkir, Meyara Moujahid et Najem Bouba, &#224; travers Mahmoud Barkaoui, d&#8217;organiser un

</p>
<p>M. Shikhin Brahim, &#233;tudiant et membre du Comit&#233; pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme 
de Smara-Sahara Occidental (CDDH), Mme Engiya Boukhars, membre du CDDH et 
M Alnassiri Ahmed, Secr&#233;taire G&#233;n&#233;ral du CDDH et membre de l&#8217;Association marocaine des 
droits de l&#8217;homme. 
</p>
<p>1783. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 21 septembre 2008, &#224; l&#8217;occasion de la visite d&#8217;une 
organisation non-gouvernementale (ONG) internationale &#224; Smara, un groupe d&#8217;activistes des 
droits de l&#8217;homme du Sahara Occidental aurait organis&#233; une manifestation pacifique dans la ville 
pour d&#233;noncer la situation des droits de l&#8217;homme dans la r&#233;gion. A la suite de cet &#233;v&#233;nement, 
plusieurs personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es par les forces de l&#8217;ordre et des habitations auraient &#233;t&#233; 
d&#233;grad&#233;es. La plupart des personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;es par la suite, mais M. Shikhin Brahim 
serait toujours maintenu en d&#233;tention &#224; la prison de La&#226;youne. 
</p><p>1784. Le m&#234;me jour, Mme Engiya Boukhars, qui avait rencontr&#233; les membres de cette ONG 
internationale, aurait &#233;t&#233; agress&#233;e physiquement par les forces de l&#8217;ordre. Elle aurait notamment 
&#233;t&#233; bless&#233;e au visage. Par ailleurs, suite &#224; cette rencontre, son salaire ne lui aurait plus &#233;t&#233; vers&#233;. 
</p>
<p>1785. Enfin, suite &#224; une r&#233;union entre les membres de cette ONG internationale et 
M. Alnassiri Ahmed, les forces de l&#8217;ordre auraient tent&#233; d&#8217;interpeller ce dernier &#224; son domicile, 
mais celui-ci n&#8217;&#233;tait alors pas pr&#233;sent. Quelques jours plus tard, M. Alnassiri Ahmed aurait re&#231;u 
une lettre officielle lui notifiant son licenciement de son poste &#224; la municipalit&#233; de Khraibka. 
M. Alnassiri Ahmed aurait fait l&#8217;objet de cinq arrestations pr&#233;sent&#233;es comme arbitraires 
entre 2002 et 2004 et aurait &#233;t&#233; suspendu &#224; 2 reprises de son travail. 
</p>
<p>1786. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant au fait que l&#8217;arrestation et la d&#233;tention de 
M. Shikhin Brahim, l&#8217;agression de Mme Engiya Boukhars, la suspension du paiement de son 
salaire, et la tentative d&#8217;arrestation de M. Alnassiri Ahmed et son licenciement subs&#233;quent soient 
li&#233;s &#224; leurs activit&#233;s de promotion et protection des droits de l&#8217;homme au Sahara Occidental. Des 
craintes ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es pour l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale de M. Shikhin Brahim 
durant sa d&#233;tention.

</p>
<p><b>Mozambique 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 18 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1796. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning Mr. Fernando Veloso, 
Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Lu&#237;s Nhachote, sub-editor and Mr. Alvarito de Carvalho, senior reporter, 
with one of Mozambique&#8217;s largest independent weekly newspapers, Zambeze. 
</p>
<p>1797. According to information received, the three men were arrested in May 2008 on charges 
of threatening State security. The charges reportedly stem from an article in which they 
questioned whether the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Ms. Lu&#237;sa Diogo, was of Mozambican 
or Portuguese nationality. The authors of the article were called to the court to be charged 
24 hours after the issue was published. On Monday 21 July 2008, the 3rd Section of the Maputo 
Judicial Court postponed the trial of Mr. Fernando Veloso, Mr. Lu&#237;s Nhachote and Mr. Alvarito 
de Carvalho to 12 August 2008, following a request from the Prosecution Authority. 
</p>
<p>1798. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to 
prevent independent reporting in Mozambique, thus stifling freedom of expression in the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 January 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1800. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the then Special Reppresentative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human 
Rights in Myanmar sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Min Ze Ya, 
Mr. Paw U Tun (alias Min Ko Naing), Mr. Ko Ko Gyi, Mr. Pyone Cho (alias Htay Win Aung), 
Mr. Aung Thu, Mr. Kyaw Kyaw Htwe (alias Marky), Mr. Kyaw Min Yu (alias Jimmy), 
Mr. Mya Aye (alias Thu Ya), Mr. Yin Htoo Aung, and at least 9 other activists and university 
students. All are part of the 1988 Generation Students Group, known for their role in protests 
against military rule 20 years ago and active in the demonstrations against a sudden sharp rise in 
fuel prices, which began in August 2007. 
</p>
<p>1801. These persons were the subject of a joint communication sent by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar on 6 October 2006 and of a 
joint communication sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 315 
 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 28 August 2007. 
</p>
<p>1802. According to information received, on 23 January, the aforementioned persons detained 
since August 2007 were reportedly charged with breaking a security law. They are all reportedly 
being held in Yangon&#8217;s Insein Prison, where they allegedly risk being tortured or otherwise 
ill-treated. Ten people charged on 23 January reportedly face charges of breaking Section 17/20 
of Myanmar&#8217;s Printers and Publishers Registration Act, but no further information on the details 
of the charges against the activists is presently available. The charges against the ten people 
came despite a statement from Myanmar&#8217;s Police Force representative Mr. Khin Yi at a press 
conference on 3 December 2007 that protesters from the demonstrations would not be prosecuted 
if they had acted peacefully. 
</p>
<p>1803. Mr. Paw U Tun was reportedly held in a cell with a convicted prisoner and was only 
allowed to leave his cell for one hour each day. He had earlier been suffering toothaches which 
prevented him from eating and the authorities had delayed his access to medical treatment. 
Mr. Ko Ko Kyi is reportedly being held in a cell with a prisoner who has been sentenced to 
death. Mr. Pyone Cho has not yet been charged with any offence but is also being held in Insein 
Prison. The other activists and students arrested at the time of the fuel price protests were still 
believed to be in detention. 
</p>
<p>1804. Concern was expressed that the arrest, continuing detention and charges reportedly 
brought against the aforementioned may be directly related to their work in defense of human 
rights. Further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity while in 
detention.

</b></p>
<p>1806. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the then Special Reppresentative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human 
Rights in Myanmar sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. U Than Lwin, 
aged 70, a representative of the National League for Democracy at the Parliament of Mettaya 
Townsip, Mandalay Division. 
</p>
<p>1807. According to the information received, on 15 June 2007, an unidentified man assaulted 
Mr. U Than Lwin with a knuckle-duster, after he had led a group of around 35 persons to pray 
for the release of prisoners in Myanmar at pagodas in his town of Mattaya, in upper Myanmar. 
The unidentified man managed to flee into an office of the Government sponsored Union 
Solidarity and Development Association and had never been brought to justice, although 
members of the prayer group immediately reported the incident to the police. Besides, the 
criminal case lodged has not been investigated by the authorities of Myanmar. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1808. Mr. U Than Lwin was severely injured in his eyes and sustained a broken nose and 
cheek. The next day he was admitted to Mandalay General Hospital where he had to stay for 
treatment for two weeks due to dizziness and poor eyesight. After being discharged, he had 
needed to continue to receive medical treatment for the injuries he sustained. On 
1st October 2007, Mr. U Than Lwin was arrested in connection with the protests in August and 
September 2007, and he was being held at Ohbo Prison, Mandalay Division, without charge. 
Since his arrest, his eyesight has dramatically worsened: Mr. U Than Lwin had now gone 
completely blind in his left eye, and his right eye could also lose all sight. 
</p>
<p>1809. Serious concern was expressed that Mr. U Than Lwin was being denied adequate medical 
treatment for the injuries he sustained. Further concern was expressed that the arrest and 
detention of Mr. U Than Lewin may be related to his reportedly non-violent activities in defence 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1810. In a letter dated 6 March 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that U Than Lwin has been taken action under Section 5 (j) of 
the Emergency Provisions Act as he manipulated to take place the whole Sangha&#8217;s 
demonstration in Mandalay which had led to impair the security and prevalence of Law and 
order in the Country. On 13 November 2008, U Than Lwin reported a pain in his left eye to the 
warden of Mandalay prison. Thereafter, the doctor on duty and the prison in charge examined 
him and gave him the necessary treatment. On 16 January 2008, he was seen by Dr. Ko Ko Latt, 
General Physician from Mandalay General Hospital, who reported that he has lost his left eye 
sight. In addition, Dr. Aung Ko Ko, the prison doctor also examined him every week and helped 
to cure his eyes. The authorities concerned have taken action against U Than Lwin in accordance 
with existing law and he is currently fit and healthy.

the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Messrs Thet Zin and Sein Win Maung (also known as Ko Soe), editor-in-chief and 
office-manager respectively of the Myanmar Nation (Myo Myanmar) weekly newspaper. 
</p>
<p>1813. According to information received on 15 February 2008, Messrs Thet Zin and 
Sein Win Maung were arrested at their office in Yangon. According to reports, police also 
searched the office and confiscated a copy of a report by the UN Special Rapporteur on 
Myanmar, Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, on the human rights situation in the country, several books 
and CDs containing images of the street protests in August and September 2007. Police also 
confiscated mobiles phones and poems written by Sein Win Maung, which criticized the military 
junta. The Myanmar Nation newspaper is, at present, still permitted to continue publication. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1814. Reports suggest that both men are now being detained and interrogated at the 
Thin Gan Gyun Police Station. Family members, who were allowed to deliver some clothes, 
food and medicine on 16 February 2008, were reportedly told by police not to speak to foreign 
media. There are fears for the health of Mr. Thet Zin, who suffers from a heart condition and 
pulmonary diseases. 
</p>
<p>1815. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Messrs Thet Zin and 
Sein Win Maung may be directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, especially 
their exercise of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful protest. Further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of all those in detention, particularly 
Mr. Thet Zin, in view of reports of his ill-health. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>1816. In a letter dated 8 May 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that on 15 February 2008, the authorities concerned searched 
the office of the Myanmar Nation Journal and discovered the books, documents and VCDs 
which have not been registered and published in accordance with the Printers and Publishers 
Law 1962. Therefore, the authorities confiscated these books and VCDs. 
</p>
<p>1817. As Mr. Thet Zin and Mr. Sein Win Maung failed to comply to comply with the Printers 
and Publishers Law 1962, the authorities concerned instituted the proceedings against them 
under the sections 17 and 20 of the abovementioned Law after due process of law. Currently, 
Thingangyan Township Court has been hearing the witnesses.

</b></p>
<p>1819. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Mr. Htay Kywe, Ms. Mie Mie (also known as Ms. Thin Thin Aye), Mr. Aung Thu, 
Mr. Hein Htet (also known as Aung Gyi), Mr. Zaw Htet Ko Ko, and one other unidentified 
person. The aforementioned are all non-violent human rights activists and members of the 
1988 Generation Students Group, who were involved in the peaceful protests of August and 
September 2007. All were the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 17 October 2007, following their arrest on 13 October 2007. 
</p>
<p>1820. According to new information received Mr. Htay Kywe, Ms. Mie Mie, Mr. Aung Thu 
and Mr. Zaw Htet Ko Ko were charged on 23 January under Section 17/20 of the Printers and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 318 
 
</p>
<p>Publishers Registration Act, which allows the prosecution of individuals who distribute any form 
of written material without the authorization of the official censor. These charges against the 
activists came despite a statement from authorities 3 December 2007 that protesters at the 
September demonstrations would not be prosecuted if they had acted peacefully. 
</p>
<p>1821. They are all being held in Yangon&#8217;s Insein Prison, where they have been repeatedly 
interrogated and may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. Mr. Htay Kywe is reportedly being 
kept in the same cell as criminal detainees. Furthermore, Ms. Mie Mie, who is said to have a 
heart condition, has reportedly been denied proper medical treatment while in detention. 
Information is not currently available as to whether the detainees have been granted access to 
their lawyers. 
</p>
<p>1822. Mr. Hein Htet, arrested at the same time, is also believed to be detained, but his 
whereabouts are unknown, as is the case of that of the unidentified man in whose home the 
activists were in hiding. 
</p>
<p>1823. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and charges brought against 
Mr. Htay Kywe, Ms. Mie Mie, Mr. Aung Thu, and Mr. Zaw Htet Ko Ko may be directly related 
to their activities in defense of human rights. In view of reports of ill-treatment and allegations of 
torture, as well as information received concerning the ill-health of Ms. Mie Mie, serious 
concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1824. In a letter dated 9 April 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that Mr. Htay Kywe, Ms. Mie Mie, Mr. Aung Thu, and 
Mr. Zaw Htet Ko Ko have been detained in prison after due process of law for arranging to write 
and distribute seditious literature to incite and mislead the people and consequently to jeopardize 
the National Convention. The prison authorities arranged a regular medical check up for 
Mr. Htay Kywe, he has been charged and is detained in the Central Prison where his family visits 
him once a week. He is fit and healthy. 
</p>
<p>1825. Mr. Aung Thu has been visited by family members and has regular medical and 
check-ups, paid for by the prison. He is fit and healthy. Mr. Zaw Htet Ko Ko is detained in a

situation of human rights in Myanmar and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders on 21 November 2007. 
</p>
<p>1828. According to new information received Messrs U Gambira and Aung Kyaw Kyaw were 
charged at the end of January under Section 17/1 of the Unlawful Associations Act, which 
carries a maximum sentence of three years&#8217; imprisonment. A hearing scheduled for 4 February 
was postponed and the authorities have not yet given a new date. Similar charges have been 
brought against Ms. Su Su Nway, who is reportedly in poor health. All three are being held in 
Yangon&#8217;s Insein Prison, where they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. 
</p><p>1829. Mr. U Gambira has been stripped of his monk&#8217;s robes and both he and Mr. Aung Kyaw 
Kyaw have allegedly been tortured in detention. Their mother and sister have been able to visit 
them but they are not known to have been given access to their lawyers. Their father, 
Mr. Min Lwin was released from Insein Prison on 3 December 2007. He and Aung Kyaw Kyaw 
were arrested on 4 November 2007 and 17 October 2007 respectively, reportedly in an attempt to 
force U Gambira out of hiding. 
</p>
<p>1830. Ms. Su Su Nway has reportedly been charged under sections 124, 125 and 505 of the 
Penal Code, which relate to sedition and incitement to offences that damage &#8220;public tranquility&#8221;. 
She was reportedly due to stand trial on 6 February in Yangon&#8217;s Bahan Township, but no 
information is currently available regarding the judicial proceedings. Su Su Nway has not been 
allowed to meet her family or receive parcels from her family. Her health is said to be 
deteriorating as she suffers from a heart condition and, on one occasion, had to be taken to a 
hospital outside the prison for treatment. 
</p>
<p>1831. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and charges brought against 
Messrs U Gambira and Aung Kyaw Kyaw, and Ms. Su Su Nway may be directly related to their 
activities in defense of human rights. In view of reports of ill-treatment and allegations of torture, 
as well as information received concerning the ill-health of Ms. Su Su Nway, serious concern 
was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1832. In a letter dated 22 April 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication and the communication of 21 November 2007. The letter stated that in 
July 2006, U Gambira and his brother Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw illegally contacted AAPP, 
unlawful organization based in Thailand. He also led to form the All-Burma Junior Monks 
Alliance and sent 20 monks to attend the abovementioned trainings. He illegally crossed the 
border between Myanmar and Thailand. He received financial support from AAPP and FDB, 
unlawful exiled groups and then instigated civil unrest in the country. He was therefore arrested </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 320 
 
</p>
<p>on 4 November 2007, and after due process of law, he has been charged under the section 13 (1) 
of the Immigration (Emergency Provisions) Act and other Acts. He is detained in the 
Central Prison and his family visits him once a week. He is fit and healthy in the prison. 
</p>
<p>1833. Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw had illegal contact with Bo Kyi from AAPP, unlawful 
organization in Mae Sot and attended the course on Public Defiance conducted by FDB. 
On 17 October 2007, the authorities concerned arrested him while he was receiving the cash 
transferred by Bo Kyi. After due process of law, he has been charged and is detained in the 
Central Prison where his family visits him once a week. He is fit and healthy. 
</p>
<p>1834. On 11 November 2007, Su Su Nway was arrested as she was attempting to incite civil 
unrest by placing a poster written anti-government slogan at a public place. She has been 
charged and is detained in the Insein Central Prison where her family visits him once a week. 
She is fit and healthy.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1836. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the situation of Mr. Paw U Tun (alias 
Min Ko Naing). Mr. Paw U Tun was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 31 January 2008, an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 28 August 2007 and an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
on 6 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>1837. According to new information received since late March 2008, Mr. Paw U Tun has 
reportedly been suffering from a severe eye infection while in detention. Mr. Paw U Tun 
requested to visit an ophthalmologist, but the prison authorities refused this request, claiming 
that an eye doctor would not be available before May 2008. According to reports, 
Mr. Paw U Tun&#8217;s eye condition prevents him from eating and sleeping because of the acute pain. 
</p>
<p>1838. Concern was expressed that the continuing detention as well as the refusal of the prison 
authorities to allow Mr. Paw U Tun to see an ophthalmologist may be linked to his non-violent 
activities in defense of human rights. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1840. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent a letter of allegations regarding information that Ko Thiha was 
sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for sedition and upsetting public tranquillity. 
</p>
<p>1841. According to information received, on 7 September 2007, a man left four publications 
titled &#8220;The people awake! Time to take to the streets!&#8221; at a photocopy shop in Mandalay, which 
were later collected by Ko Thiha and another man. The police reportedly came to look for the 
three men, and arrested Ko Thiha on the road to his hometown of Meikhtila. According to 
reports, Ko Thiha was brought to the district court of Mandalay on 14 September 2007 where he 
was charged with sedition and upsetting public tranquillity, on the ground that the publications 
he collected were &#8220;inflammatory&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Government&#8221;. It is alleged that the trial was held at a 
special court in the Mandalay prison, and that the accused was not represented by a lawyer and 
was not able to call for witnesses. Reports further indicate that a judge testified that Ko Thiha 
made a confession, which the accused denied. On 17 September 2007, Ko Thiha was reportedly 
sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by the presiding judge, who ordered warrants for arrest for 
the other two men.

<p><b>Urgent appeal on 23 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1843. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Zarganar, a famous comedian 
in Myanmar who had been leading some of the relief efforts after the Nargis cyclone hit the 
country in early May 2008 and Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe, Chief Editor of weekly journal Sports 
Lovers and former Editor-in-chief of First Eleven Sports Journal in Rangoon. 
</p>
<p>1844. According to information received in the evening of 4 June 2008, some seven police led 
by the Yangon Western District police chief and the local council chairman came to 
Mr. Zarganar&#8217;s house and searched it. They seized personal belongings as well as USD 1,000 
collected as part of the cyclone relief effort. They then arrested Mr. Zarganar and took him to an 
undisclosed location. His whereabouts remain unknown as of today. 
</p>
<p>1845. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Zarganar had given interviews to international radio stations and 
other media about his relief work and the needs of the population and he had also criticized the 
response of the State authorities to the cyclone&#8217;s aftermath. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 322 
 
</p>
<p>1846. On 13 June 2008, Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe was arrested by special branch police officers at 
his ailing mother&#8217;s residence in the central city of Minbu, Magway Township, central Myanmar. 
Following the arrest, officers proceeded to Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe&#8217;s home where they searched the 
premises and confiscated personal belongings, including his mobile phone, computer and various 
work related documents. Reports claim that Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe&#8217;s arrest may be related to his 
involvement in organising a number of deliveries of aid to victims of Nargis cyclone, which 
devastated the Irrawaddy Delta region. He had reportedly been prohibited from writing openly 
about the disaster prior to his arrest. Mr. Zaw Thet Htew has apparently been taken to an 
interrogation camp in Rangoon. 
</p>
<p>1847. Previously in July 2003, Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe, was arrested following the publication of 
an article which questioned how authorities were spending a four-million-dollar football grant. 
Following his arrest, Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe was charged with treason and sentenced to death for 
allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. The Supreme Court commuted his sentence and 
he was released after 18 months. 
</p>
<p>1848. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zarganar and Mr. Zaw Thet 
Htwe may be linked to their non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular their 
relief work in favour of the victims of the Nargis cyclone. In view of their incommunicado 
detention, further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1849. In a letter dated 22 July 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that on 4 June 2008, Mr. Zaganar&#8217;s residence was searched by 
the authorities and witnesses. Evidence included VCDs, US dollars and other items which were 
found and confiscated. According to the interrogation, amongst other charges, Mr. Zarganar 
could be charged for reproducing and distributing VCDs without permission, for connecting and 
providing distorted information opposing the State to foreign news agencies, for providing 
support during the Sanga unrest on 24 and 25 September 2007. 
</p>
<p>1850. On 13 June 2008, a computer system-unit and hand phone was confiscated from 
Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe. He is facing charges including support for the Sanga unrest by buying 
foodstuffs for the monks and for infringing peace and law and order of the State. 
</p>
<p>1851. The letter states that the arrests of Mr. Zarganar and Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe were due to 
their violations of the law, and not on the accusation of providing donations to the cyclone 
victims. In Myanmar, numerous well-wishers and donor organizations from domestic and abroad 
are traveling to the cyclone hit areas for the purpose of donating relief supplies and no one had 
been arrested for donating and providing cash and kinds to the storm victims.

</p>
<p>the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the case of Mr. Myint Aye, leader 
of the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters group. 
</p>
<p>1854. According to the new information received, on 8 August 2008, the house of 
Mr. Myint Aye was searched by the Chief of Police of Kyi Myint Taing Township, together with 
other police and administration officers. They seized a number of documents and personal 
belongings, and proceeded to arrest him. 
</p>
<p>1855. On 9 August, the family of Mr. Myint Aye was visited by police officers who asked for 
some of his clothes and stated that he will remain in custody for an unspecified period of time 
without indicating the charges held against him. The whereabouts of Mr. Myint Aye remain 
unknown as of today. 
</p>
<p>1856. Concern was expressed that this latest arrest and detention of Mr. Myint Aye may be 
linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, and may form part of a pattern of 
harassment against him, and more generally against human rights defenders in Myanmar. In 
view of his incommunicado detention, further concern was expressed for his physical and 
psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1857. In a letter dated 23 October 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that Mr. Myint Aye was arrested for the involvement in the 
bombing which took place at the office of Shwepyitha Township Union Solidarity and 
Development Association in Yangon on 1 July 2008. According to the interrogations made by 
the authorities, he accepted a packet of explosive wrapped in black polythene bag from an 
unidentified youth aged about 20, who was sent by Sit Naing (his organization under 
investigation) on 30 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>1858. Mr. Myint Aye personally handed over the packet to Htantabin NLD youth named 
Yan Shwe who left for Shwepyitha Township to plant the bomb. After the bomb explosion, 
Yan Shwe went to Myint Aye to report their success, who then reported the information by 
telephone to Kyaw Htet, who handed over the bomb to Sit Naing to bring into the country and 
masterminded the Schwepyitha bombing. Myint Aye gave Kyat 150,000 in advance to 
Yan Shwe for planning the bomb. Furthermore, on 2 July 2008, out of the remaining 
Kyat 1.35 million, he gave Kyat 500,000 to Yan Shwe. 
</p>
<p>1859. According to further investigation, Myint Aye sent NLD youths to Maesot for the 
explosives and apolitical defiance courses conducted by anti-government groups and accepted 
illegal money to carry out anti-government activities. To this end, he was arrested at his house 
on 8 August 2008. Actions are being taken against Myint Aye under sections of the Explosive 
Act of 1908, the Immigration Act and the Lawful Association Act. The court hearing against 
Yan Shwe and Zaw Zaw Aung (Shwepyitha NLD), at the Shwepyitha Court on 8 August 2008, 
they confessed to the judge that Mr. Myint Aye accepted the bag contained the bomb and he 
personally handed over to Yan Shwe. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1861. On 9 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent an urgent appeal in relation to Mr. Win Tin, aged 78, ex-Vice President of the 
Journalist&#8217;s and Writer&#8217;s Association of Myanmar, and a former senior advisor to the National 
League for Democracy (NLD). Mr. Win Tin was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on behalf 
of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, on 27 July 2005. His case was also referred to in an 
urgent appeal sent on behalf of the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
on 27 January 2006. 
</p>
<p>1862. Mr. Win Tin was arrested in 1989 and sentenced to three years in prison on allegedly 
fabricated charges of harbouring an &#8220;offender for whom a warrant had been issued&#8221;. In 1992 he 
was sentenced to an additional 11 years in prison for a variety of offences linked to his 
opposition activities. During his time in prison Mr. Win Tin has suffered ongoing health 
problems. Mr. Win Tin is said to have consistently refused to sign a document disassociating 
himself from the NLD which would allegedly have secured his release. He remains in detention 
at Insein Prison, in Yangon. 
</p>
<p>1863. According to new information received, since June 2008, Mr. Win Tin&#8217;s health has been 
progressively deteriorating. He suffers from heart disease and spondylitis (a condition which 
causes inflammation of the joints of the spine), and in recent months Mr. Win Tin has been 
experiencing severe asthma attacks and lung problems. In late June 2008, a family member who 
visited Mr. Win Tin in prison reportedly found him thin and weak. His current health problems 
are also preventing him from eating and sleeping properly. Mr. Win Tin is allowed to see a 
doctor on a regular basis and has been prescribed medication; however the treatment he is 
receiving has apparently done little to prevent further deterioration of his condition. Since 
October 1997, Mr. Win Tin has been treated repeatedly in the prison hospital, most recently in 
January 2008 when he underwent a hernia operation. 
</p>
<p>1864. Mr. Win Tin&#8217;s poor health has been exacerbated by his alleged ill treatment in prison, 
which has included torture, inadequate access to medical treatment and detention in a cell 
designed for military dogs, with concrete floors and without bedding. He has for long periods of 
time been deprived of food and water and has spent much of his prison term in solitary 
confinement. In July 2005, Mr. Win was informed by prison authorities that he would be 
released, together with more than 100 political prisoners in Insein Prison. The majority of the 
group was freed, but Mr. Win Tin and around a dozen other detainees were returned to their 
cells. Mr. Win Tin was apparently due for early release in 2006. His release date is now 
understood to be planned for June 2009. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 325 
 
</p>
<p>1865. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Win Tin, 
particularly given the reports that he is suffering from serious health complaints and allegation of 
torture. Further concern was expressed that the ongoing detention of Mr. Win Tin may represent 
a direct attempt to undermine the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Myanmar.

</b></p>
<p>1867. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government concerning the case of Ms. Nilar Thein, aged 36, a human 
rights defender and pro-democracy activist. 
</p>
<p>1868. According to the information received, Ms. Nilar Thein, a leader of the democratic 
opposition in Myanmar, was arrested on 10 September 2008 on her way to visit the mother of 
Mr. Ant Bwe Kyaw, another detained activist, in a suburb of north eastern Yangon. She is 
currently being detained and interrogated at Aung Tha Pyay Detention Centre in Yangon. 
Mr. Ant Bwe Kyaw and Ms. Nilar Thein&#8217;s husband, Mr. Kyaw Min Yu (also known as 
Ko Jimmy), were among thirteen members of the so-called &#8220;88 Generation Students Group&#8221; who 
were arrested on 22 August 2007. The following day, Ms. Nilar Thein led around 500 people in a 
demonstration in Yangon to demand the release of fellow activists and to continue the protest 
against the sudden increase in fuel prices that had been imposed by the Government 
on 15 August 2007. Thereafter, Ms. Nilar Thein went into hiding, forced to leave her baby 
daughter in the care of her family. Ms. Nilar Thein was imprisoned twice before for her activities 
in support of democracy and the rule of law in the country. She was detained for two months 
in 1991. Following her arrest in December 1996 she was tried for participating in the students&#8217; 
demonstrations in Yangon of that year and sentenced to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. She was 
released in 2005. 
</p>
<p>1869. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Nilar Thein might be solely 
connected to her reportedly peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression and to 
assembly.

</p>
<p>1872. According to the information received, on 1 October 2008, at approximately 10:00 p.m., 
Mr. Kyaing was arrested at his home by military authorities. The reasons for the arrest and 
detention, as well as his current whereabouts are unknown. Mr. Kyaing was previously released 
from prison in 2005 after serving 15 years of a 17-year prison sentence for &#8220;writing and 
distributing seditious pamphlets&#8221;. Mr. Kyaing joined the National League for Democracy (NLD) 
after a long career in journalism and won a parliamentary seat in 1990.

</b></p>
<p>1875. On 5 November 2008, Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the case of 
Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, human rights lawyers who have participated in 
the defence of 11 youth members from Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon, of the National 
League for Democracy (NLD). 
</p>
<p>1876. According to the information received, in September 2008, 11 youth members from 
Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon, belonging to the NLD, were arrested for having reportedly 
peacefully marched towards the Shwe Dagon Pagoda on 19 June 2007, on Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi&#8217;s birthday. The 11 demonstrators were arrested during the march and released the next day 
by the authorities. One year later, they were arrested again, charged with &#8216;instigation to public 
unrest&#8217; and brought to trial before the Hlaing Thar Yar Township Court. 
</p>
<p>1877. During the trial, the 11 defendants and their two lawyers, Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and 
Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, submitted a complaint to the judge to address the violations of their 
rights, because, since the beginning of the trial, the lawyers have reportedly not been allowed to 
meet with their clients in private; the judge has not allowed them sufficient time to make counter 
questions against the prosecution witnesses; and their family members have not been allowed to 
attend the court hearings. Furthermore, it is alleged that the police and some plain-cloth persons 
have also been taking pictures and recording their voices during these hearings. 
</p>
<p>1878. During the trial, three defendants, Messrs Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and 
Aung Min Naing (aka) Mee Thwe argued that they were released in June 2007 by the authorities, 
who claimed then that the authorities considered them as &#8220;sons and daughters&#8221; and gave them 
&#8220;great forgiveness&#8221;. Therefore, these three defendants reportedly requested the judge to 
summon the Minister of Home Affairs Mr. Maj-Gen Maung Oo, and the Chief of Police 
Mr. Brig-Gen Khin Yee as their defence witnesses. The judge rejected their request and asked 
their lawyers, Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, to control their clients. The two 
lawyers responded that they were to follow instruction made by their clients. Then the Prosecutor </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 327 
 
</p>
<p>decide to sue the two lawyers along with Messrs Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min 
Naing (aka) Mee Thwe under Section 228 of the Penal Code, and issued a arrest warrant against 
Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min. 
</p>
<p>1879. On 29 October 2008, Mr. Nyi Nyi Htwe was reportedly arrested by the police, and 
on 30 October, he was sentenced by the Yangon Northern District Court to six months&#8217; 
imprisonment reportedly for &#8220;interruption and insulting the judiciary proceeding&#8221; under 
Section 228 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced along with Messrs Yan Naing Tun, 
Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min Naing (aka) Mee Thwe. None of them were reportedly allowed to 
have legal representation. When Mr. Nyi Nyi Htwe asked the judge to allow him to make his 
own defence, the judge threatened him with another lawsuit. They are all detained in Insein 
Prison. As for Mr. Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, he failed to appear on 30 October 2008 and his 
whereabouts are unknown as of today. 
</p>
<p>1880. Serious concern was expressed that the arrest warrant against Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and 
Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, and the subsequent arrest and detention of Mr. Nyi Nyi Htwe may be 
linked to their non-violent activities in defence of human rights. Further concern was expressed 
for their physical and psychological integrity while in detention. Finally, concern was expressed 
that these latest incidents may form part of a pattern of harassment against human rights 
defenders in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1881. In a letter dated 29 December 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that on 15 May 2007, at 7.30 a.m. eleven persons marched 
from Hlaing Thatyar Township to Yangon-Nyaung Done Road wearing white color tee-shirts 
imprinted red color logo &#8220;Free Aung San Suu Kyi.&#8221; The group refused to disperse, for that 
reason the chief of police took legal actions against them on 3 July 2008. The information in the 
above communication is therefore incorrect, the correct date for the march was 15 May 2007, 
not 19 June 2007 and the date of their arrest was 28 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>1882. In response to the allegation that &#8220;lawyers have not been allowed to meet with their 
clients in private,&#8221; the letter stated that permission was given to the defendants to meet freely 
with their lawyers both in Insein prison and in the detention area of Hlaing Township Court. 
Furthermore, defendants were allowed to make counter questions during the trial and their 
family members were allowed to attend the court hearings. On 30 October 2008, the court found 
that Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin, Aung Min Naing (a) Mee Thew and the lawyer U Nyi Nyi 
have violated the Section 2208 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to six months 
imprisonment without labour. Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min disappeared or went into hiding since and 
the authorities are searching for him. Legal actions against U Nyi Nyi and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min 
are not in conflict with international human rights norms and standards.

<p>1884. On 5 November 2008, Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
the case of Mr. Min Ko Naing and 34 other members of the so-called &#8220;88 Generation Students&#8221;, 
Mr. Ko Ko Gyi, Mr. Pyone Cho (aka) Htay Win Aung, Mrs. Min Zeya, Mya Aye,

</p>
<p>1885. According to the new information received, starting on 27 August 2008, after over 
one year of detention without trial in Insein Prison, Min Ko Naing and 34 other members of the 
&#8220;88 Generation Students&#8221; have been brought before courts where they face charges under 
Section 130 (B) of the Penal Code, Section 4 of the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic 
Transfer of the State Responsibility and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the 
National Convention against Disturbance and Opposition Endangering National Convention 
(SPDC Law No. 5/96), Section 17 and 20 of the Printers and Publishers Registration Act, 
Section 33 (A) of the Electronic Transactions Law, Section 17 (1) of the Unlawful Association 
Act, Section 505 (B) of the Penal Code, Section 32 (B) and 36 of the Television and Video Law 
and Section 24 (1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1947) and Section 6 of the Law 
Relating to Forming of Organizations (SLORC Law 6/88) in a total of 21 trials. 
</p>
<p>1886. Their cases were initially heard by township courts and two district courts, but 
subsequently all transferred to the Rangoon Eastern District Court, the Yangon Western District 
Court and the Rangoon Northern District Court. It is alleged that all trials are held inside the 
Insein Prison Compound. 
</p>
<p>1887. During the hearing on 27 August, the defendants requested that their family members, the 
public, and media should be allowed to attend the hearing. In addition, they demanded not to be 
handcuffed during the hearing. During the hearing on 10 September, during which they were still 
handcuffed, family members were allowed to attend the hearing; however, no access was granted 
to other people wishing to attend. 
</p>
<p>1888. During the court hearing on 29 October 2008, Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Mya Aye, 
Nyan Lin, Pyone Choe, Aung Thu, Hla Myo Naung, and Aung Naing stood up and complained 
about the lack of an independent judiciary and that their rights were not respected. The judge 
then charged them with Section 288 of the Penal Code for disturbing the court procedure and 
sentenced them to six-month imprisonment for each of them. Subsequently, the judge ordered 
security forces to remove the defendants from the court and adjourned the trial. 
</p><p>1889. On 30 October, Zaw Zaw Min was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with hard 
labor under the Section 505 (B) of the Penal Code. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1890. In a letter dated 29 December 2008, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that even though it took a year to gather information to take 
legal actions and apprehend fugitives of the 88 Generation Students, which was acted upon 
group basis, they were brought before the courts by given remands to rules and procedures of the 
law. Cases of the 35 members of 88 Generation Students were brought before the ten special 
courts on 27 August, 2008. Permission was given to family members of the defendants to attend 
the court hearings and permission was furthermore given to the defendants to hire attorneys. It 
was therefore an open court hearing for the defendants since the above-mentioned rights and 
privileges. As stipulated by the law, they were handcuffed during court hearings and were not 
entitled to get bail. 
</p>
<p>1891. Nine defendants, Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Mya Aye, Htay Kyawe, Nyan Lin, 
Pyone Choe, Aung Thu, Hla Myo Naung, and Aung Naing were given 6 months imprisonment 
for intentionally insulting the public servant sitting in judicial proceedings. Zaw Zaw Min (a 
member of the 88 Generation Students) was sentenced to a total of 65 - 60 years imprisonment. 
The court hearings of the Min Ko Naing and 34 other members of the 88 Generation Students 
were carried out according to the law and the proceedings were in line with the Article 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

</b></p>
<p>1893. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning the case of Mr. Zaw Min, a human rights defender who was reportedly 
physically and psychologically tortured during his detention in Insein Prison between August 
and October 2007. After his release, Mr. Zaw Min documented human rights abuses which he 
had witnessed in prison. 
</p>
<p>1894. According to information received, in late November 2007, Mr. Zaw Min was detained 
under section 505 of the Myanmar Penal Code for sending false information abroad. Before his 
case was brought to court, on 26 March 2008, he was reportedly detained illegally by military 
intelligence. All witnesses in the trial were Special Branch police officers whose identities are 
known to us. One of these witnesses told the court that he got information about Mr. Zaw Min&#8217;s 
activities when interrogating him. It is suspected that torture may have been used during these 
interrogations. No independent witnesses appeared in court. 
</p>
<p>1895. Concern was expressed that the detention of Mr. Zaw Min may be directly related to his 
documentation of human rights abuses in prisons. Further concern was expressed for the physical 
and psychological integrity of Mr. Zaw Min. </p>

human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the case of Mr. Aung Thein and 
Mr. Khin Maung Shein, lawyers, representing members of the National League for Democracy 
in current criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>1898. According to the information received, on 7 November 2008, Mr. Aung Thein and 
Mr. Khin Maung Shein were sentenced to four months of imprisonment by the High Court for 
contempt of court, reportedly under section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act. In October 2008, 
their clients had complained orally during judicial proceedings that they did not enjoy a fair trial. 
In order to show their distrust in the justice system, the lawyers&#8217; clients had expressed their wish 
to no longer be represented by their defense counsels. On 6 November 2008, a written complaint 
had been submitted in this regard by the two lawyers to the Hlaing Township Court which 
reported the complaint to the High Court. The judge hearing the case at the Hlaing Township 
Court had instructed the defendants to submit their complaints in writing through their legal 
counsels. 
</p>
<p>1899. In the evening of 7 November 2008, Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein were 
arrested by the police and taken to local police stations. They were subsequently transferred to 
Insein prison where they are to serve four months of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1900. In a letter dated 12 January 2009, the Government of Myanmar responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein orally 
presented to the court that they will repeal from representing as defence counsels of their clients. 
Due to their contempt against the judiciary system, Supreme Court (Yangon) heard their case 
on 6 November 2008 and sentenced them to four months imprisonment each 
on 7 November 2008. The following day they were sent to Insein Prison. 
</p>
<p>1901. During the court hearing, the defendants have not given any complaints that they did not 
enjoyed a fair trial nor give instruction to their lawyers not to be represented any longer. The two 
lawyers did not submit any written complaint to the court. They only submitted their letter of 
repeal to the Hlaing Township Court on 20 October 2008. To this end no further inquiry was 
being made since there was no complain submitted to the court.

its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning members of 
the National Alliance of Women Human Rights Defenders (NAWHRD), Ms. Bharati Singh, 
Ms. Sharda Chand, Ms. Naru Singh and Ms. Kalsa Mahara. On 16 July 2008, an urgent appeal 
was sent to the Government regarding the death of Ms. Laxmi Bohara, member of the 
NAWHRD, on 6 June 2008, and threats against other NAWHRD members. No response has yet 
been received from the Government. Members of the NAWHRD have been investigating 
Ms. Bohara&#8217;s death, in particular in connection with women rights defenders&#8217; protection 
concerns. 
</p>
<p>1908. According to information received, on 21 and 28 June 2008, Ms. Bharati Singh received 
anonymous telephone calls, threatening that she would face &#8220;bad consequences&#8221; if she continued 
with her investigations into the death of Ms. Laxmi Bohara. On 17 June Ms. Kalsa Mahara also 
received an anonymous threatening telephone call. Ms. Sharda Chand has also been the victim of 
over twelve anonymous telephone calls in which she has received death threats and has been told 
not to intervene in Ms. Laxmi Bohara&#8217;s case. On one occasion she was told that the members of 
the NAWHRD would be killed within seven days if investigations into Ms. Laxmi Bohara&#8217;s case 
continued. Furthermore, in the morning of 27 June 2008, Ms. Sharda Chand was knocked down 
by an unknown motorcyclist. She sustained minor injuries. That afternoon Ms. Naru Singh and 
Ms. Kalsa Mahara were returning from a meeting of women human rights defenders by 
motorcycle when an unknown cyclist tried to stop them twice and briefly pursued them. 
On 2 July, Ms. Sharda Chand, Ms. Kalsa Mahara and Ms. Bharati Singh filed a joint complaint 
on those incidents at the Kanchanpur District Police Office. 
</p>
<p>1909. In the afternoon of 2 July 2008, a group of twenty or thirty men reportedly led by the 
brother of the late Ms. Laxmi Bohara&#8217;s husband came to the district office of the NAWHRD and 
threatened Ms. Sharda Chand. The mother-in-law of the late Ms. Laxmi Bohara also went to the 
office with a group of women and shouted that the office should be set on fire and 
Ms. Sharda Chand should be killed. The crowd surrounded and entered her office, but was 
dispersed shortly after upon arrival of the police. Ms. Sharda Chand was also threatened by a 
similar group which had gathered outside her house. Ms. Sharda Chand filed two written 
complaints and some additional verbal complaints at the Kanchanpur District Police Office about 
these incidents. 
</p>
<p>1910. Concern was expressed that the threats and intimidation of the aforementioned members 
of the NAWHRD may be related to their legitimate work in the defense of human rights, in 
particular their investigations into the death of Ms. Laxmi Bohara. Further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the members of the NAWHRD.

legal de las ONG nacionales e internacionales en Nicaragua; y medidas para crear un mecanismo 
de &#8220;fiscalizaci&#243;n conjunta&#8221; de los financiamientos recibidos por las ONG. Estas medidas 
seguir&#237;an un proceso, introducido en septiembre de 2008, de revisi&#243;n del funcionamiento de

placed into custody and transferred to a detention facility of the State Security in Abuja, where 
they are currently held without charge. Their defence lawyer, Mr. Bello Lubebe, has been denied 
access to his clients in the detention facility. 
</p>
<p>1926. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the abovementioned persons 
might be solely connected to their reportedly lawful exercise of their right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, which includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all 
kinds. In view of their incommunicado detention, further concerns were expressed as regards 
their physical and mental integrity.

<p>1928. On 20 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of 
allegations on the situation of Mr. Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, former Chairman of the Economic and 
Financial Crimes Commission. According to the information received, on 5 August 2008, 
Mr. Mallam Nuhu Ribadu was reportedly demoted from the rank of Assistant Inspector-General 
of Police to Deputy Commissioner of Police allegedly because his &#8220;promotion was irregular and 
done without regard for the laws guiding such exercise&#8221;. Attempts were also reportedly made to 
arrest him in Kuru, Jos, for questioning. However, it is alleged that these measures were taken on 
a retaliatory basis to prevent him from investigating alleged corruption of State officials and 
politicians. 
</p>
<p>1929. Concern was expressed that the demotion of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu and the reported 
attempts to arrest him may be linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, i.e. 
his anti-corruption work.

Mr. Ibrahim Magu, a former official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission 
(EFCC). According to the information received, on 5 August 2008, Mr. Ibrahim Magu was 
reportedly arrested for possessing documents related to the EFCC&#8217;s investigations into alleged 
corruption of Government officials. Mr. Magu remains in detention and no charges have 
reportedly been brought against him.

</b></p>
<p>1934. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, sent a letter of allegations concerning the killing of Mr. Paul Abayomi 
Ogundeji, a member of the editorial board of the Lagos-based private daily newspaper Thisday. 
Mr. Ogundeji was a former Features Editor of the Punch Newspapers, one time Editor of The 
Sunday Comet and Chief Press Secretary to former Lagos state deputy governor Mr. Femi Pedro. 
We would also like to seek information regarding the killing of another journalist, 
Mr. Godwin Agbroko, in 2007, as the investigation into the case reportedly remains 
inconclusive. 
</p>
<p>1935. According to information received, on 17 August 2008 at approximately 11 p.m., 
Mr. Paul Abayomi Ogundeji was shot dead near the Dopemu bridge, in a suburb of Lagos. Police 
reports claim that Mr. Ogundeji was ambushed by armed robbers who had earlier stolen a car. 
The police allege that Mr. Ogundeji was on his way home when he was stopped by the armed 
men and ordered to get out of his car. When Mr. Ogundeji refused to comply with these demands 
he was shot by the assailants and died at the scene. No items were reportedly removed from the 
Kia Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) which Mr. Ogundeji was driving. 
</p><p>1936. According to other reports, however, eye witness accounts from local residents in the 
Dopemu area claim that Mr. Paul Abayomi Ogundeji was shot at close range by men in police 
uniforms who were manning a police checkpoint at the time. It is believed that an argument 
ensued between Mr. Paul Abayomi Ogundeji and one of the police officers when Mr. Ogundeji 
refused to step out of his car. The police officer then reportedly shot Mr. Ogundeji in the head 
before boarding the police vehicle with colleagues and leaving the scene. Mr. Ogundeji&#8217;s body 
was later taken to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), by policemen from 
Idimu Division. </p>

<p>1937. An official police investigation has been opened by the Special Investigation Unit of the 
Police Force in Abuja in relation to the killing of Mr, Paul Abayomi Ogundeji. The investigation 
is reportedly being led headed by Commissioner M. Ali Amadu.  
</p>
<p>1938. The reports received regarding the killing of Mr. Ogundeji bear a preoccupying 
resemblance to reports regarding the killing of another journalist of the same 
publication 20 months earlier: 
</p>
<p>1939. Mr. Godwin Agbroko, chairman of the editorial board of Thisday, was killed 
on 22 December 2006, in similar circumstances. He was found dead at the wheel of his car, by a 
roadside in the Isolo district in Lagos, just after he had left his office. A police investigation was 
opened into the killing of Mr. Godwin Agbroko, and police initially pursued the theory of a 
botched robbery. However, apparently none of his personal belongings had been stolen, 
including a mobile phone worth several thousand Nairas. No further evidence of an attempted 
robbery was made public, and on 15 January 2007 the police announced that he may have been 
killed by &#8220;unknown assassins.&#8221; As of today, police investigations remain inconclusive and no 
arrests have been made in connection with Mr. Godwin Agbroko&#8217;s case. Mr. Agbroko had edited 
several newspapers during the military rule of 1993 to 1999 and was reportedly detained at least 
twice during those years. 
</p>
<p>1940. While the reported police investigation into the killing of Mr. Ogundeji was welcomed, 
concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to prevent 
independent reporting in Nigeria.

<p>1942. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group

of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the situation of Mr. Andrew Berends, an 
award-winning freelance filmmaker and journalist from the United States of America and 
Mr. Samuel George, a translator from Nigeria. According to information received, in the 
afternoon of 31 August 2008, Mr. Andrew Berends along with his translator, Mr. Samuel George 
were arrested by members of the Nigerian Security Services, in the southeastern city of 
Port Harcourt. They were then transferred to the local headquarters of the State Security Service. 
Mr. Berends and Mr. George were reportedly subjected to 36 hours of questioning, with no food 
and little water. Mr. Berends was then provisionally released overnight without charge but 
ordered to return the following morning. His passport, mobile phone and film equipment were 
confiscated. Mr. Berends and Mr. George remain in detention on charges of espionage. 
</p>
<p>1943. Prior to his arrest, Mr. Berends had legally entered Nigeria in April 2008 to complete a 
documentary he had been working on called &#8220;Delta Boys&#8221;. The film is sponsored by the 
New York based Tribeca Film Institute and documents the ongoing oil conflict in the 
Niger Delta. </p>

<p>1947. According to the information received, on 6 December 2007 at around 10 p.m., 
Ms. Saima Khawaja, Ms. Erum Hassan, Mr. Ahmed Basheer, Mr. Ikhlas Ahmed, 
Mr. Amanullah Kariapper, Mr. Mohammed Afaq, Mr. Raza Mahmud, Mr. Omar Pervaiz Kausar, 
Mr. Jawaid Amin and Mr. Hassan Rehman were arrested by the police while holding a peaceful 
candlelight vigil at the residence of Justice Siddiqui located in the Judges&#8217; Colony in G.O.R. 
Lahore. At the time of arrest, they were sitting inside the said Justice&#8217;s residential premises in the 
compound. Their presence was part of a 24-hour voluntary vigil organised by the Student Action 
Committee and other social activists to prevent the police from forcefully evicting Justice 
Siddiqui and his family from his residence.  
</p>
<p>1948. The arrested were reportedly initially taken to the Race Course police station, and in the 
early morning of 7 December moved to Manawa Thana near the Wagah border. Later that day 
they were presented in front of the magistrate at the Lahore Kutchhery and were charged under 
the Maintenance of Public Order Act for allegedly disturbing local residents of G.O.R. They 
were also charged under Section 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Act by the Anti-Terrorism Court 
located near Dharampura. The men were sent to Camp Jail on Ferozepur Road under judicial 
remand while the two women were sent to the Kot Lakhpat Jail. 
</p>
<p>1949. On 9 December, Ms. Saima Khawaja and Ms. Erum Hassan were released on bail. 
On 10 December, the male detainees were transferred from the Camp Jail to house arrest at 
Mr. Kariapper&#8217;s house. On 11 December, the Government dropped all charges against the 
10 persons. While welcoming the release of all the aforementioned persons, concern was 
expressed that their arrest and detention may have been linked to their peaceful activities in 
defense of human rights. </p>

<p>1951. On 21 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a 
letter of allegation to the Government concerning Mr. Kamran Noorani, Mr. Salahuddin Ahmed, 
Mr. Naveed Noshad, Mr. Danish, Mr. Muhammad Faisal, Mr. Syed Mustafa Rizvi, 
Mr. Zafar Aslam and Mr. Asad Umar, all members of civil society organizations, who were 
arrested during the violent dispersal of a peaceful protest outside the Karachi residence of 
Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas. 
</p>
<p>1952. According to the information received, on the evening of 13 January 2008, protesters 
belonging to civil society groups reportedly gathered outside the Karachi residence of 
Justice Rana Bhagwandas and began to light candles. At this time, police arrived and allegedly 
used excessive force to disperse the protesters. The aforementioned were arrested and reportedly 
taken to Darakhshan Police Station, where they were allegedly charged with &#8216;rioting armed with 
deadly weapons&#8217;. Initially the aforementioned were allegedly held incommunicado, but family 
and lawyers were later informed of their location. Those detained were reportedly released on 
bail approximately five hours after the arrest. The police allegedly tried to force these activists to 
sign an undertaking abjuring future participation in any protest as a condition of bail; however, 
this was withdrawn upon the refusal of those detained to sign such a document. 
</p>
<p>1953. The protest reportedly arose from the placing under house arrest, on 12 January 2008, of 
Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas, who had been removed on 3 November 2007 under the 
emergency powers decreed by President Musharraf. The Justice&#8217;s house arrest reportedly came 
after he addressed the Karachi Bar Association. It is reported that no formal orders of detention 
were served on the judge; the police authorities allegedly informed him that he would not be 
allowed to leave his residence and posted police guard outside the house. 
</p>
<p>1954. Concern was expressed that the arrests of the aforementioned may have been directly 
related to their human rights activities. Further concern was expressed for the allegedly excessive 
force used by police during the dispersal of the protest as well as for the placing under house 
arrest of Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas, and the restrictions placed on his freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from Government

<p>1955. In a letter dated 23 July 2008, the Government of Pakistan responded to the above 
communication. The letter stated that, on 13 January 2008, 20 to 25 people with sticks and 
banners gathered outside a house in Karachi, blocked the road and demonstrated against the 
Government. The gathering later became an unlawful when it turned into a riot. The rioters did 
not cooperate when the police asked them to stop rioting. The six men mentioned above were 
therefore arrested while other rioters fled. No excessive force was used by the police and none of 
the human rights of the rioters were violated. All police action was carried out in accordance 
with the law. Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas was not under house arrest, nor was any restriction </p>

Clifton Police Station (FIR No. 13/08/ under section 147/148/PPC). They were held at 
Darakshan police station before being released on their personal bonds being charged on a 
bail-able offence. Their families and lawyers were informed of their arrest.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 18 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1957. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government concerning the ban of the report of the non-governmental organisation Asian Centre 
for Human Rights (ACHR), entitled &#8220;Pakistan: The Land of Religious Apartheid and Jackboot 
Justice: A report to the UN Committee Against Racial Discrimination&#8221; and dated 
of 8 August 2007, as well the situation of the members of the non-governmental organisation 
National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP). 
</p>
<p>1958. According to the information received, at its 71st session in August 2007, the Committee 
for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) intended to review the implementation of 
the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by the Government of 
Pakistan in the absence of the 15th to 19th periodic reports of the State party which were 
overdue. In conformity with the established procedure of the treaty body system enabling 
non-governmental organisations to submit information to the members of the Committee, ACHR 
submitted the above-mentioned report. The report was made later available on the website of 
ACHR. 
</p>
<p>1959. On 25 January 2008, the Secretary to the Home Department Office of the Punjab 
Province issued the notification No. So (IS-III) 1-1/2004/Pt.II banning the publication of the 
above-mentioned report. The notice reads as follows: &#8220;WHEREAS, it has come to the 
knowledge of the Government of the Punjab that Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) based 
at New Delhi, India has published a highly charged and biased report &#8220;Pakistan: The Land of 
Religious Apartheid and Jackboot Justice&#8221;. The report is being distributed in Pakistan through 
&#8220;National Commission for Justice and Peace&#8221; which is an NGO floated/registered by the 
Catholic Church of Pakistan. Now, THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers conferred by 
Section-99-A Cr. P.C-1898, the Government of the Punjab is pleased to ban the above mentioned 
report and order to confiscate to the Government all its copies wherever found in the open 
market with the immediate effect and to take necessary action against the distributors under the 
relevant law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1960. Section 99-A of Pakistan Criminal Procedure Code criminalizes matters which are 
allegedly &#8220;treasonable, a seditious, prejudicial to national integration (of Pakistan), abets riots, 
which is deliberately and maliciously intended to outrage the religious feelings of such class by 
insulting the religion or the religious beliefs&#8221;. The offences are punishable under sections 123A, 
124A, 154, section 295A, section 298A and section 298B and section 298C of the Pakistan Penal 
Code. Anyone found guilty of charges under these sections can be punished with life 
imprisonment. The notification by the Home Department of the Punjab is legally treated as a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>complaint registered against NCJP. However, NCJP had reportedly no role either in the drafting 
of ACHR&#8217;s report or its distribution. ACHR prepared the report based on standard methodology, 
including reports of various NGOs and media. 
</p>
<p>1961. On 4 March 2008, Father Emmanuel Yousaf, Mr. Mehboob Ahmed Khan and 
Mr. Peter Jacob, officers of NCJP, were summoned to appear before the Home Department 
Office of the Punjab Province on 10 March 2008. The 3 men went to the Home Department 
Office on 10 March as summoned, but the meeting did not take place since the Additional 
Secretary on Internal Security was reportedly not available. 
</p>
<p>1962. Concern was expressed that the ban imposed on the above-mentioned report of ACHR as 
well as the acts of intimidation against members of NCJP may be related to the non-violent 
activities of the two organizations in defense of human rights. Further concern was expressed 
that the ban of the ACHR report concerns a report submitted to a United Nations human rights 
treaty body.

the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
the killing of at least 14 people, including Mr. Haji Aftab Abbasi, a lawyer and 
Mr. Naeem Querashi, General Secretary of the Karachi Bar Association, and a number of others 
beaten or disappeared following recent outbursts of violence in Karachi. 
</p>
<p>1965. According to information received, on 9 April 2008, 14 people reportedly died in Karachi 
following a series of violent incidents in which six of the deceased, four lawyers, including 
Mr. Haji Aftab Abbasi and two clients, were reportedly burned alive. Reports from the Karachi 
Bar Association indicate that the whereabouts of 19 lawyers remain unknown and that they may 
have been abducted. More than 70 offices were reportedly ransacked and burned, including the 
office, residence and vehicle of Mr. Naeem Querashi. The offices of the Malir Bar Association 
were also razed. In addition, five journalists were severely beaten, with one, a female journalist 
working for a local television channel, sustaining a fractured arm in the incident. More 
than 50 vehicles were reportedly vandalized and burnt-out and the drivers of two private busses 
were shot dead. 
</p>
<p>1966. It was reported that these attacks, killings, burnings and abductions were carried out by 
members of a the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), allegedly following-up violent clashes 
between MQM members protesting outside the city court buildings and lawyers demonstrating in 
favour of the deposed Chief Justice. It was unknown whether any arrests had been made in 
connection with the aforementioned incidents. </p>

meeting between the Federal Secretary of Interior and three Supreme Court judges, including the 
Chief Justice. On 9 May, one of the judges who participated in the meeting issued a notice to 
GEO News TV and the Daily Jang asking them to answer charges of seeking to exploit the court 
and to scandalize its judges. The judge also reportedly ordered the journalists to reveal their 
sources and stated that the media should not publish any reports involving a judge without prior

the question of torture, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Abdul Wahab Baloch, Chief organiser of the Baloch Rights Council and well 
known peace activist, and Mr. Gulam Mohammad Baloch, President of the Balochistan National 
Movement. Both organisations are based in Karachi, Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>1973. According to information received, in the afternoon of 28 May 2008, Mr. Abdul Wahab 
Baloch and Mr. Gulam Mohammad Baloch were arrested while returning from a peaceful 
demonstration in Karachi. The protest had been organised by the Baloch National Front, to mark 
the tenth anniversary of nuclear tests carried out by Pakistan in the southern province of Chaghi, 
Balochistan in 1998, and to call for respect for basic human rights for the local population. Both 
Mr. Wahab Baloch and Mr. Mohammad Baloch were speakers at the event. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>1974. After the demonstration, Mr. Wahab Baloch and Mr. Mohammad Baloch went to the 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in Karachi, where they were due to attend a meeting to 
discuss the issue of disappearances in Balochistan. Before reaching the Commission they were 
arrested by a number of individuals who covered their heads before forcing them into heavy duty 
jeeps. Mr. Mohammad Baloch and Mr. Wahab Baloch were taken to the Central Crime 
Investigation unit in Karachi, where they were detained overnight. In the early hours of the 
following morning, Mr. Mohammad Baloch was relocated to the Frere Police station where he 
was detained for a number of hours before being released on bail later that day. He was charged 
with delivering a provocative speech. 
</p>
<p>1975. Mr. Wahab Baloch was beaten repeatedly with fists, boots and sticks during the night 
of 28 May, whilst being interrogated about bombings in Balochistan. On the morning of 29 May, 
Mr. Wahab Baloch was transferred to an unknown location in an unregistered vehicle linked to 
several cases of missing persons. Later that same day he was injected with an unknown drug 
which invoked feelings of numbness and he subsequently lost consciousness for a number of 
hours. On 31 May, Mr. Wahab Baloch was again transferred to another location, where he was 
interrogated about the Watan Brigade, an unknown militant organisation. During his detention 
Mr. Wahab Baloch was moved on a number of occasions, subjected to ill-treatment, held in 
solitary confinement in small dark cells and severely beaten. His whereabouts were not known 
until 2 June 2008, when he was transported by jeep to Kala Pull Bridge in Karachi and thrown 
out of the vehicle. He did not sustain any injuries on this occasion and was able to then make his 
way home. It was feared that the detention and alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Abdul Wahab Baloch 
and Mr. Gulam Mohammad Baloch might be related to their activities in defense of human 
rights. Concern was also expressed that the afore-mentioned incident may represent a direct 
attempt to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Pakistan.

on 7 September 2008 presented by Dr. Aamir Liaquat Hussain and which saw the participation 
of Maulana Muhammad Amin and Maulana Muhammad Shahidi. The programme included a

Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding ongoing threats and harassment against the Peshawar branch of Shirkit Gah and 
the Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO). Shirkit Gah is a non-governmental 
organization (NGO) based in Lahore, which works on women&#8217;s rights. The SPO is an NGO 
based in Dera Ismail Khan, which works on development and education. 
</p>
<p>1983. According to information received, on 20 December 2007, an unknown man called the 
Peshawar office of Shirkit Gah, threatening that the office would face dire consequences if it 
were not closed. The NGO immediately informed the police. On 9 August 2008, an email signed 
by signed by an individual, whose identity is known, from the extremist group Tehreeke Taliban, 
Pakistan. The email ordered Shirkit Gah to close its office in Peshawar, mentioning that the 
NGO was working on women&#8217;s rights issues and expressing the general wish to end NGO 
activities in the region. In particular objections were raised to female employees not wearing 
their veils and thereby tempting people towards sinful activities; to females coming out of the 
office and associating with people other than their relatives; to men having immoral relations 
with female employees; and to members of staff having had relations with prostitutes. The 
message claimed that there were photographs and videos to support all of these accusations. The 
Peshawar office of Shirkit Gah was then threatened that, if it did not take action based on this 
email, loss of life and of property would ensue. Shirkit Gah was also warned not to share the 
message with Government officials. 
</p>
<p>1984. On 4 November 2008, an email signed by Talib bhai (Talib brother) was sent to 
Shirkit Gah stating that the NGO mobilized women to participate in processions and warning for 
the last time that the office would have to be closed. The email threatened that, if the office was 
not closed, the consequences would be alarming: the women working for Shirkit Gah would be 
kidnapped and killed.  
</p>
<p>1985. On 8 November 2008, another email, signed by Faqat Talib Apko Sedha Rasta Dhekana 
y Wala (Talib - lead you for the right path), was sent telling Shirkit Gah that it had not acted on 
previous warnings and had thereby shown no care for the lives of its members. The email 
explained that there would be no more chances for Shirkit Gah and that the office would be </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>bombed. It blamed the Shirkit Gah for women divorcing and being able to approach the courts, 
claiming that there would be no pardon for the NGO and that it would have to face the 
consequences. 
</p>
<p>1986. Meanwhile, in May 2007, the Dera Ismail Khan office of the SPO began to receive 
threats by phone and mail. On 30 October 2007, at approximately 2.15 a.m., the staff hostel of 
the SPO in Battagram was bombed. Twelve staff members were injured with two of them being 
critically injured. Office equipment worth approximately 292,000 rupees was destroyed and the 
damage to the rented building reportedly cost 500,000 rupees. First Information Report (FIR) 
422 was lodged at Battagram police station on the same day at approximately 2.45 a.m. On 
27 September 2008, the offices of the SPO were looted, resulting in total loss of approximately 
10 million rupees. FIR 549 was lodged at Cantt police station on the same day. In the same 
region, seven other bomb attacks were directed against NGOs and other organizations in 2007, 
namely the Peshawar office of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the 
Battagram office of Save the Children, the offices of the National Rural Support Program in 
Ushu Kalam and Buner, and the office of Khwendo Kor in Karak. 
</p>
<p>1987. Concern was expressed that the threats and harassment against Shirkit Gah and the SPO 
may have been related to their work in the defense of human rights, in particular women&#8217;s rights 
in the case of Shirkit Gah. Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of the members of Shirkit Gah and the SPO. Fear was expressed that these incidents 
formed part of an ongoing trend of harassment against NGOs in the North West Frontier 
Province of Pakistan.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1989. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the 
situation of Mr. Simon Eroro, journalist with the Post Courier national daily. Mr. Eroro is the 
laureate of the 2007 Best News Story of the Year award delivered during the Papua New Guinea 
Best Medias awards. 
</p>
<p>1990. According to the information received, Mr. Simon Eroro recently received four 
threatening phone calls from unidentified people following his reporting on a bribery scandal 
allegedly involving several Papua New Guinean Government officials. In 2006, some 
US$ 30 million were reportedly offered to Papua New Guinean officials to convince them to 
recognize Taiwan as an independent State. Because of these threats, Mr. Simon Eroro has been 
forced to go into hiding. </p>

</p>
<p>1991. Concern was expressed that the threats against Mr. Simon Eroro may be related to his

</b></p>
<p>1993. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an urgent 
appeal on the situation of Mr. Jethro Tulin, an indigenous Ipili and human rights defender from 
Enga Province in Papua New Guinea. Mr. Tulin is also the Chief Executive of Akale Tange, a 
non-governmental organisation based at Porgera that has been documenting alleged human rights 
abuses associated with Barrick&#8217;s Porgera Joint Venture Gold mine. Alleged extrajudicial killings 
at Porgera Joint Venture Gold mine were the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 18 January 2008. 
</p><p>1994. According to information received, on 4 August 2008, Mr. Jethro Tulin was attacked by 
three men wielding machetes. The attack took place in Mamale village, Laiagam, about 
2 &#189; hours by road from Barrick Gold&#8217;s Porgera Joint Venture Mine. During the attack, one of 
the assailants reportedly threatened Mr. Tulin that he would not be permitted to return to Canada. 
Mr. Tulin suffered a broken arm in the attack and is reportedly seeking medical attention for his 
injuries. 
1995. Prior to the attack, Mr. Tulin, along with Mr. Anga Atalu and Mr. Mark Ekepa of the 
Porgera Landowners Association, had visited Canada in an attempt to raise awareness of alleged 
human rights violations, including killings, reportedly being perpetrated by the Barrick mine&#8217;s 
security forces on the indigenous population living near the mine site. During the visit in May, 
Mr. Tulin delivered a statement at the Barrick&#8217;s Gold Annual General Meeting in Toronto about 
the alleged killings by Barrick&#8217;s security forces. Since his return to Papua New Guinea, 
Mr. Tulin has received anonymous threats warning him that he should watch out for his own 
safety. 
</p>
<p>1996. On 17 July 2008, Mr. Tulin, along with members of the Porgera Landowners 
Association, were called to a meeting with the Community Affairs Officer of Barrick&#8217;s mine, 
reportedly in an intimidating atmosphere, who stated that various organizations that have 
provided Mr. Tulin and his colleagues with support including Minewatch Canada, Conservation 
International and the United Nations are tainting Barrick&#8217;s image abroad. 
</p>
<p>1997. Mr. Tulin has reportedly been forced to move to a secret location and his movements 
have been severely restricted. </p>

</p>
<p>1998. Concern was expressed that the acts of intimidation and harassment against Mr. Tulin 
may be linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, i.e. his denouncing of the 
human rights situation of the indigenous population living in the vicinity of the Barrick&#8217;s Porgera 
Joint Venture Gold mine.

<p>2020. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Misses Mary Ann B. Abiero, Marilyn Millares, Ria R. Amuyan, 
Jocelyn M. Lagman, Angelita Adriano and Messrs Jason I. Magtanong, Crisostomo San Juan, 
Roberto Baguio, Diomcio Sechico, Michael Amposta, JR Buensoceso, Alexanders Ligutan, 
Alan Pomido and Christopher Gandiga. The aforementioned are all members of the Kilusan para 
sa Pambansang Demokrasya (KPD), a non-governmental organization promoting democracy and 
the rule of law in the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>2021. According to information received, on 29 February 2008 members of the KPD were 
travelling in two vehicles to a peaceful demonstration organised by the KPD in Lubao, 
Pampanga, when they were stopped at Pasbul by agents of the Philippine National Police (PNP). 
The officers inquired as to the destination of the KPD members, who replied that they were 
going to Ramon Lingad Hospital in San Fernando to donate blood. The police officers then 
proceeded to escort them in that direction. When one of the KPD cars drove away the police 
ordered the other car to pull over and a van of armed and masked SWAT policemen arrived. The 
SWAT team searched the vehicles and interrogated the KPD members at gunpoint before taking 
them to the Pampanga Provincial PNP camp in San Fernando, where each of the KPD members 
was interrogated individually. 
</p>
<p>2022. At 3.30 p.m. that day, KPD leaders from Central Luzon came to inquire as to the legal 
basis for the detention. They were informed that the police were not satisfied with the 
photocopied documents of the driver of the vehicle and that the original copy was required. The 
detention of the KPD members was denied and they were released at approximately 4.00 p.m., 
without the driver&#8217;s original documents having been produced. On their release, the KPD 
members went to join an inter-faith rally in San Fernando. The same police officers were present 
and warned the KPD members that they would be detained again if they did not leave 
immediately. </p>

<p><b>Observations

<p>2024. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 14 March 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 23 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2025. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to 
the Government concerning the alleged termination of contract of three workers, including a 
union leader, and the suspension of 36 others, for holding a protest demanding the distribution of 
overdue benefits. 
</p>
<p>2026. It is reported that in December 2005, the Nagkahiusang Mamumuo sa Davao City Water 
District (NAMADACWAD) union and the Davao City Water district (DCWD), a government 
owned and controlled corporation, came up with a Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA), 
which became final and executory on 26 May 2006; the agreement provided that Php 99 millions 
(approximately USD 2.3 millions) savings of the firm would be given as financial incentives to 
all the workers. On 16 May 2007, while the benefits had not yet been distributed, union leaders 
and workers held a picket in front of the DCWD offices. 
</p>
<p>2027. Pickets resumed in November 2007, during which, some protestors were wearing t-shirts 
calling for the release of the benefits and the resignation of the board&#8217;s vice-chairperson, who 
supposedly opposes the implementation of the CNA. On 13 December 2007, the union sent a 
letter to the DCWD requesting that talks be resumed for the implementation of the CNA, to 
which no response was allegedly received. Further reports indicate that DCWD management 
threatened contract-based employees not to renew their contracts in 2008 if they remained 
members of the union, reportedly leading to the non-renewal of nine contracts and the 
resignation of 80 workers from the union. 
</p>
<p>2028. According to information received, on 19 March 2008, the general manager of DCWD 
issued a Memorandum informing of the dismissal of Rodrigo Aranjuez, president of the 
NAMADACWAD, Gregorio Cagola and Celestino Bondoc, as well as the suspension of 36 other 
workers for a period of two months, for committing &#8220;administrative offenses&#8221;, such as wearing 
t-shirts containing messages demanding the provision of benefits and the resignation of one 
member of the board of the DCWD. 
</p>
<p>2029. Concern was expressed that the dismissal of Mr. Arajuez, Mr. Cagola and Mr. Bondoc as 
well as the suspension of the 36 workers may be a form of retaliation linked to their non-violent 
activities in defense of human rights, in particular their work to promote workers&#8217; rights in the 
Philippines. Further concern was expressed that these measures may form part of a pattern of 
harassment against trade unionists in the Philippines. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2030. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 23 April 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 30 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2031. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning the reported 
violent dispersal of a demonstration held on 6 March 2008 in Manila. 
</p>
<p>2032. According to information received, on 6 March 2008 at about 3 p.m., 
approximately 500 protestors from the region of Southern Tagalog, arrived in front of the 
Department of Labour and Employment (DOLE) in Intramuros in Manila, after a four-day 
march. The march was organized by a group of labour organisations, the Pagkakaisa ng 
Manggagawa sa Timog Katagalugan-Kilusang Mayo Uno (PAMANTIK-KMU), the Anakpawis 
(Toiling Masses) and the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN-Southern Tagalog), in order 
to protest against delays by the DOLE in addressing pending labour cases. The Labour Secretary 
refused to meet with representatives of the protestors, so they decided to stay in front of the 
building and voice their grievances. At around 7 p.m., two fire trucks from the Manila Fire 
Station were positioned close to the protestors, while forces from the Manila Police District 
(MPD) were stationed in front of the DOLE building. The protestors requested Colonel Viray 
from the MPD and Chief Superintendant Rogelio Rosales, district director of the MPD Station 5, 
to be allowed to stay until the next day. At 8:45 p.m., Chief Superintendant Rogelio Rosales 
ordered his policemen to disperse the protest. 
</p>
<p>2033. Subsequently the police used water cannons, truncheons, clubs, and bladed weapons 
against the protesters injuring 37 people (please refer to list below). Six persons - 
Marlon V. Torres, Nestor A. Villanueva, Philip S. Nardo, Jason A. Hega, Emmanuel J. Dioneda 
and Jay D. Aban, were arrested by the police, taken to the Manila Hospital and then to the 
Manila Police District at the United Nations Avenue. On 7 March they were transferred to the 
Regional Trial Court in Manila, where they were charged with &#8220;tumults and other disturbance of 
public order&#8221; and &#8220;direct assaults to persons in authority&#8221; under Batas Pambansa (BP 880) or the 
Public Assembly Act of 1985 and the Revised Penal Code. They were then released &#8220;for further 
investigation&#8221; by the prosecutor.

form part of a pattern of harassment against human rights defenders advocating for the respect of 
labour rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2036. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 30 April 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal on 20 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2037. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Mr. Kelly Mu&#241;ez Delgado, Secretary-General of the KARAPATAN 
Alliance for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights in the Southern Mindanao Region of the 
Philippines. Mr. Mu&#241;ez Delgado&#8217;s works includes response to reports of human rights violations, 
in particular those allegedly perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against 
indigenous peoples and farmers. 
</p>
<p>2038. According to information received, at approximately 10 a.m. on 16 May 2008, 
death threats, in the form of three text messages to Charm Radio, were made against 
Mr. Kelly Mu&#241;ez Delgado following an interview he had given at the station regarding the 
assassination of human rights defender Mr. Celso Pojas (addressed in letter of allegation 
PHL 7/2008, sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 356 
 
</p>
<p>on 23 May 2008). One of the messages contained the threat &#8220;Ikaw nmn ang sunod jn mr. Kelly n 
iligpid. Siz fet below d ground kn Kelly (You are the next one to be eliminated, Mr. Kelly. 
You&#8217;re already six feet below the ground)&#8221;. Charm Radio forwarded the messages to 
Mr. Kelly Mu&#241;ez Delgado without disclosing the number of the phone from which the threats 
had been sent in accordance with the station&#8217;s policy on preservation of listener confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>2039. Reports also indicated that Mr. Kelly Mu&#241;ez Delgado had been under surveillance by 
unidentified armed men since the interview and that armed motorcyclists had been observed in 
front of the KARAPATAN offices in F Torres Street, Davao City. 
</p>
<p>2040. Concern was expressed that the threats made against Mr. Kelly Mu&#241;ez Delgado may be 
directly related to his work in defense of human rights and his publicizing of the killing of 
Mr. Celso Pojas. Following Mr. Pojas&#8217; death, serious concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Mu&#241;ez Delgado. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2041. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 20 June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal on 9 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2042. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Mr. Raul S Quiboyen, Mr. Brendo D Morales and Mr. Joey S Ling of the 
Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHRP). The CHRP investigates and reports 
on human rights violations in the Philippines before making recommendations to the Filipino 
government. 
</p>
<p>2043. According to information received, on 20 June 2008, Mr. Quiboyenm, Mr. Morales and 
Mr. Ling were shot at when returning by boat from the island of Limaong after exhuming and 
carrying out an autopsy on the body of Madal Barorong, allegedly a victim of murder. They had 
been accompanied to the island by two policemen and two boat operators. Relatives of Madal 
Barorong followed on a second boat. The two parties were separated for an hour after the 
shooting began. When the relatives of Madal Barorong came to collect the members of the 
CHRP, they told them that their boat had been confiscated and presented four spent cartridges 
from an M16 rifle, three spent cartridges from a Garand, and three spent cartridges from an M14 
rifle. Madal Barorong&#8217;s relatives reported that the attack had been carried out by a Sergeant 
whose identity was known to the Special Rapporteur and who was accompanied by the alleged 
murderer of Madal Barorong. 
</p>
<p>2044. The members of the CHRP immediately reported what had happened and handed in the 
cartridges at Vitali Police Station. On 23 June 2008, Atty. Jose Manuel S Mamauag, Regional 
Director of the CHRP, filed charges against the Sergeant, who is supposedly responsible for the 
attack against the members of the CHRP, for attempted murder. These charges were filed to the 
Sergeant&#8217;s Battalion Commander, to his Division Commanding General and to the Zamboanga 
City Police Office. So far there has been no response from the Battalion Commander or the 
Division Commanding General. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 357 
 
</p>
<p>2045. Concern was expressed that the attack against the members of the CHRP may be directly 
related to their non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular their work to 
expose human rights violations in the Philippines. In view of the incident outlined above, serious 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the members of the CHRP. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2046. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 9 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations on 9 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2047. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning in 
relation to Mr. Robert Sison, host of the local radio programme Harana, and correspondent for 
the weekly newspaper Regional Bulletin, based in Lucena, Quezon province. 
</p>
<p>2048. According to information received, on 30 June 2008, Mr. Robert Sison was shot dead by 
two unknown individuals in the town of Sariaya, Quezon province. Mr. Sison was reportedly 
driving home with his two daughters, Ms. Liwayway Sison and Ms. Amirah Sison (also 
journalists with the Regional Bulletin), when two men on a motorcycle approached the car and 
opened fire. Mr. Sison was struck nine times and died at the scene. Ms. Liwayway Sison 
sustained a gunshot wound to the hand, while Ms. Amirah Sison escaped injury by reportedly 
playing dead. Prior to his death Mr. Robert Sison was involved in investigating crime and other 
local stories, some of which were reportedly critical of local officials. 
</p>
<p>2049. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could be related to 
Mr. Robert Sison&#8217;s work as a journalist, and could represent a direct attempt to stifle independent 
reporting in the Philippines, thus restricting the right to freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>2050. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 9 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 15 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2051. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the Government concerning in 
relation to the killing of Mr. Martin Roxas, program director with dyKR-Radio Mindanao 
Network (RMN) in Roxas City and of Mr. Denis Cuesta, radio broadcaster and programme 
director with dxMD-Radio Mindanao Network (RMN), in General Santos, Mindanao. 
</p>
<p>2052. According to information received, on 7 August 2008, Mr. Martin Roxas was shot dead 
in Roxas City, Capiz as he travelled home from work by motorcycle. Two unidentified 
individuals, who were also travelling by motorcycle, reportedly followed Mr. Roxas when one of 
them fired a shot fatally injuring him in the neck. Mr. Roxas was pronounced dead an hour after 
he was brought to the Capiz Emmanuel Hospital. Reports claim that Mr. Roxas had been 
harassed by three unidentified men in the same area a short time before the shooting and that the 
incident had been reported to the local police. Earlier the same day, Mr. Roxas had reportedly 
interviewed Mr. Antonio del Rosario, First District Representative in Capiz, regarding an alleged </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 358 
 
</p>
<p>anomaly in the financial aid given to destitute hospital patients during Mr. del Rosario&#8217;s term as 
Mayor of Roxas City. Fictitious names had reportedly been identified on the list of recipients of 
the financial aid, and the alleged anomalous transaction had been discussed on Mr. Roxas&#8217; radio 
programme over a period of two weeks. 
</p>
<p>2053. On 4 August 2008, at approximately 4.30 p.m. Mr. Denis Cuesta was shot by a gunman 
riding pillion on a motorcycle. The incident happened as Mr. Cuesta was walking along a public 
street in General Santos City, South Cotabato. Mr. Cuesta sustained serious injuries to his head 
and spinal column. He never recovered consciousness after the attack and passed away in 
intensive care at a local hospital on 9 August 2008. 
</p>
<p>2054. A month prior to the attack, Mr. Cuesta had addressed a complaint in his radio program 
Sumbong at Aksiyon (Grievance Desk), by an individual whose village water supply had 
allegedly been contaminated. Following the broadcast, Mr. Cuesta reportedly received a 
telephone call from the secretary of the association believed to be responsible for the 
contamination, who expressed anger over Mr. Cuesta&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>2055. Following the broadcast, Mr. Cuesta reportedly received a number of death threats and 
suspicious individuals were seen in the vicinity of the radio station. A police investigation has 
reportedly been launched into the two killings with arrests having been made in relation to the 
death of Mr. Roxas. 
</p>
<p>2056. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could form part of an ongoing 
campaign to prevent independent reporting in the Philippines, thus stifling freedom of expression 
in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2057. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 15 August 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal on 29 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2058. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
the human rights defenders and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances, sent an urgent appeal regarding threats against Fr Romeo Tagud, 
a priest in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI - Philippine Independent Church); and the 
harassment of members of Karapatan-Central Visayas, namely Mr. Dennis Michael J. 
Abarrientos, Secretary-General; Ms. Vimarie Arcilla, Public Information Officer; 
Mr. Jean H Suarez, Research-documentation Officer; and Ms. Concordia Oyoa, Direct-services 
Officer. Karapatan-Central Visayas is a member organization of the KARAPATAN Alliance for 
the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights. 
</p>
<p>2059. Previous threats against Fr Romeo Tagud were mentioned in an urgent appeal sent by the 
then Special Representative of the then Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders to your Government on 13 October 2006. The Government&#8217;s responses to this urgent 
appeal were received on 23 October 2006 and 27 November 2006. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 359 
 
</p>
<p>2060. According to new information received, Fr Romeo Tagud reportedly joined a delegation 
of Filipino Americans from the California-Nevada Annual Conference of the United Methodist 
Church, based in the United States of America, which visited the Philippines from 30 June 
to 2 July 2008. After Fr Romeo Tagud exposed human rights abuses allegedly committed by the 
military in certain villages, and the deterioration of respect for human rights on the island of 
Negros, particularly in areas of heavy military presence, the delegation decided to support a 
campaign against extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations in Negros. This raised 
the profile of human rights issues in Negros and attracted international attention. The military 
subsequently criticized the delegation in the local press for having supposedly violated the 
human rights of the residents of Linantuyan. 
</p>
<p>2061. On 1 August 2008, Fr Romeo Tagud took part in a press conference in Bacolod City. 
There he expressed the views of the IFI on poverty, corruption, extrajudicial killings, the 
implications of mining in Guihulngan City and Hinobaan, and other alleged human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>2062. On 3 August 2008, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Fr Romeo Tagud was given an envelope 
containing a bullet from an M16 armalite rifle by a girl of approximately five or six years of age 
whose identity is unknown. Fr Romeo Tagud had just participated in Sunday mass and was 
walking towards the parish house at the time. The girl told him that the envelope was an offering 
for the church. 
</p>
<p>2063. Meanwhile, since 18 June 2008, members of Karapatan-Central Visayas have been 
investigating the disappearance of a man who was allegedly abducted by members of the 
military in Negros on 11 June 2008. In response, the military reportedly publicly accused 
Ms. Vimarie Arcilla of working for the Maoist New People&#8217;s Army rebels and declared that it 
planned to file charges against her for the kidnapping of a witness in the disappearance case. 
These charges are now lodged at the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Dumaguete Central, Negros Oriental. 
They are allegedly unfounded and have been filed by the military as part of a smear campaign 
against those who speak out against them. The military had previously filed charges of multiple 
murders against Ms. Vimarie Arcilla in April 2006 after she had investigated other human rights 
violations supposedly committed by military members. These charges were dismissed by the 
Regional Trial Court 7, Branch 29 in Toledo City for &#8220;lack of probable cause&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2064. Since then threats have been sent sporadically to members of Karapatan-Central Visayas. 
On 21 August 2008, threats were sent simultaneously to Mr. Dennis Michael J Abarrientos, 
Mr. Jean H Suarez, Ms. Concordia Oyoa, and Ms. Vimarie Arcilla while they were in a meeting. 
On 24 August 2008, between 10.30 a.m. and 11.00 a.m., the four members of Karapatan-Central 
Visayas again received threats by text. Among the threats against the members of 
Karapatan-Central Visayas were the following messages: &#8220;I know what you are doing HR. Your 
time is up!!!&#8221; and &#8220;Stop your Fault-Finding Missions ... or suffer the consequences!!!&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2065. Serious concern was expressed that Fr Romeo Tagud could have been threatened for 
speaking out about human rights violations on the island of Negros. Serious concern was also 
expressed that the threats against members of Karapatan-Central Visayas and the accusations 
against Ms. Vimarie Arcilla could have may be directly related to their investigation of alleged 
human rights violations in Negros. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Fr Romeo Tagud, as well as that of all members of Karapatan-Central </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>Visayas. It was feared that the threats against Fr Romeo Tagud and the members of 
Karapatan-Central Visayas may form part of an ongoing pattern of harassment against members 
of the IFI and other human rights defenders in the Philippines after the murders of 
Bishop Alberto Ramento and Fr Diniosio Ging-Ging, and the death threats against 
Fr Antonio Ablon, Fr Terry Revollido, Fr Sonny Teleron and Fr Marco Sulayao in 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 3 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2067. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations 
regarding the failure to recognize the Bleustar Workers Labor Union (BWLU) as a trade union. 
According to information received: 
</p>
<p>2068. On 24 July 2008, over 40 members of the BWLU were dismissed from their jobs with the 
Bleustar Manufacturing and Marketing Corporation (BMMC) without receiving an adequate 
explanation. On 25 July 2008, there was a certification election to establish whether the trade 
union would be legally recognized. Although according to the Philippine Labor Code only 
laborers rather than employees in management positions have the right to vote in such elections, 
28 BMMC employees in management positions were allowed vote in the certification election. 
Because the votes of the members of the BWLU who had lost their jobs were not counted, and 
because the votes of the BMMC employees in management positions were counted, the result of 
the Certification Election was not to legally recognize of the BWLU as a trade union. 
Consequently the BWLU is unable to defend the rights of its members as employees of the 
BMMC. Most notably the BWLU is unable to defend the rights of many female BWLU 
members who have reportedly been the victims of regular acts of sexual harassment, perpetrated 
by an employer whose identity is known, but who have remained silent about such acts out of 
fear of losing their jobs. 
2069. Concern was expressed that the dismissal of the members of the Bleustar Workers Labor 
Union may be related to their legitimate activities in defense of its members&#8217; rights. Further 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the members of the 
Bleustar Workers Labor Union who have reportedly been subjected to sexual harassment. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2070. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 3 September 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>2071. In a letter dated 29 January 2008, the Government responded to an allegation letter sent 
on 1 November 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;For two days, workers held 
demonstrations although they did not have the requisite permit that the law requires. While 
workers were staging their demonstration outside the building, DOLE officials held conciliation </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 361 
 
</p>
<p>talks with representatives of PLDT workers, with the management of the company being present 
on 10 October 2007. In the spirit of tolerance and conciliation, workers were allowed to hold 
demonstrations totally unhampered, except that the police had to warn them on the second day to 
break-up before nightfall. Police authorities also held dialogue with the demonstrators and it was 
agreed that the group would be given until 5:00 p.m. on 10 October 2008 to air their grievances. 
However, until 5:40 p.m. that day the group showed no sign of terminating their activity. The 
police only moved in to arrest some of the demonstration leaders after they resisted act police 
efforts to get them to disperse peacefully on their own. The arrested individuals were brought to 
OSMA for medical check-up and were turned over to the General Assignment Section 
ORGASM for filing of appropriate charges. 
</p>
<p>2072. The above individuals were apprehended for Violation of Batas Pambansa (BP) 880, 
Breach of Peace, Obstruction and Disobedience to Lawful Order&#8221;.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2074. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the candlelight protests and pro-democracy non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs): the People&#8217;s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD), the Korea 
Alliance for Progressive Movement (KAPM), and the People&#8217;s Solidarity for Korean Progress 
(PSKP). 
</p>
<p>2075. According to information received, on 24 May 2008, candlelight vigils began against the 
Government&#8217;s decision to resume beef imports from the United States of America, amid public 
concerns related to health and food-safety. After this date up to 993 demonstrators were arrested 
or taken to police stations, whilst certain NGOs involved in the protests had their offices raided, 
their property confiscated and some of their members arrested. Charges against detainees 
reportedly included violations of the Law on Assembly and Demonstration, as well as in relation 
to obstruction of the police, and defamation and physical assault. 
</p>
<p>2076. The protests took place every night in major cities across the Republic of Korea. They 
started as a way of demanding renegotiations with the United States of America on importing 
beef to the Republic of Korea. However, concerns were also expressed about the privatization of 
public services and healthcare, as well as the ban on assembly and the overuse of force by the 
riot police. There were several complaints on the use of violence by riot police and violations of 
the right to assemble during the candlelight vigil. Members of the National Human Rights 
Commission of Korea (NHRCK), who were on monitoring duty during the vigils, were 
reportedly attacked by military police. Approximately 400 demonstrators were injured in the 
protests, and police stated that any future protests would be blocked. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>2077. On 30 June 2008, the offices of the PSPD, the KAPM and the PSKP were raided by the 
Seoul Metropolitan Police. The PSPD is host to the secretariat of the People&#8217;s Conference 
against Mad Cow Disease. The KAPM offices were raided by 50 police investigators who 
confiscated three computers as well as fire extinguishers and other protest equipment. The PSKP 
had 23 computers, documents and rally placards confiscated. Police arrested PSKP director 
Mr. Hwang Sun-won, as well as members Mr. Ahn Jin-geoul and Ms. Yoon Hee-suk. They were 
detained on charges of leading the illegal protests and violating the Law on Assembly and 
Demonstration.  
</p>
<p>2078. Concern was expressed that the arrests and the use of police violence against 
demonstrators in the candlelight protests, the raids on the offices of the PSPD, the KAPM and 
the PSKP, and the arrests of Mr. Hwang Sun-won, Mr. Ahn Jin-geoul and Ms. Yoon Hee-suk 
may be directly related to their non-violent activities in the defense of human rights. In view of 
the events outlined above, concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
demonstrators in the candlelit protests as well as members of the PSPD, the KAPM and the 
PSKP. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2079. In a letter dated 15 October 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
sent on 10 July 2008. The Government indicated that the four NGOs mentioned in the letter 
alleged that the Government restricted their right to freedom of opinion and expression and to 
freedom of assembly and demonstration during the candlelight demonstrations. Their allegations 
are based on incorrect and misleading facts. The Government protects the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the right to freedom of lawful and peaceful assembly and 
demonstration. In order to protect public order and the rights of other citizens, however, a 
minimum of measures against unlawful violent demonstrations as well as abusive exercise of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression are necessary in accordance with international human 
rights laws and domestic laws. Articles 19(3) and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights prescribe that the exercise of rights may be subject to certain restriction for 
respect of the rights or reputation of others and for the protection of public order.

</b></p>
<p>2081. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning the candlelit 
protests and the following human rights defenders and lawyers: Ms. Jae-Jung Lee, 
Ms. Young-Gu Kang, Mr. Joon-Hyeong, Ms. Jae-Jeong Lee and Mr. Gwang-Joong Kim, all 
members of Lawyers for a Democratic Society (MINBYUN); Mr. Jin-Geol Ahn, a member of 
People&#8217;s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and a team manager with the People&#8217;s 
Association for Measures against Mad Cow Disease (an organization made up of 1,700 south 
Korean NGOs); Ms. Hee Sook Yoon, Vice-Chairperson of the Korea Youth Movement Council 
and Ms. Nae Rae Lee, a 21 year old student. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>2082. The candlelit protests, along with human rights organisations People&#8217;s Solidarity for 
Participatory Democracy (PSPD), the Korea Alliance for Progressive Movement (KAPM) and 
the People&#8217;s Solidarity for Korean Progress (PSKP) were the subject of an allegation letter sent 
by the Special Representative on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
on 10 July 2008. 
</p>
<p>2083. In May 2008, candlelit vigils began against the Government&#8217;s decision to resume US 
beef imports, amid public concerns related to health and food-safety. Since they began, the 
protests have taken place every night in major cities across South Korea. The protest movement, 
which started as a way of demanding renegotiations with the US on importing beef to the 
Republic of South Korea, has since become a stage for a broad range of political grievances, 
from high fuel prices to health care privatisation and the cost of education. 
</p>
<p>2084. According to new information received, on 4 May 2008, after the first two candlelit 
protests took place, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency reportedly announced that those 
involved in posting articles on websites related to the protests would be summoned for 
questioning and that countermeasures would be taken to prevent future demonstrations. 
On 22 July, Justice Minister Kim Kyung-han proposed a plan to introduce a &#8216;Cyber Defamation 
Law&#8217;. The plan was announced by the Korean Communications Commission (KCC) which 
reportedly stated that online networks and Internet portals would be punished if they did not 
comply with its order to remove content which is deemed to be defamatory. 
</p>
<p>2085. Since 4 May, over 1,000 protesters have reportedly been arrested and there have been 
numerous complaints related to the excessive use of force by riot police and violations of the 
right to assemble during the candlelight vigil. Reports claim that on 31 May and 1 June, police 
used fire extinguishers and water cannons fired at close range against largely peaceful 
demonstrators, causing serious injuries such as blindness, broken bones and concussions. 
On 17 July 2008, riot police reportedly dispersed thousands of citizens who were participating in 
candlelit protests, with water canons containing florescent material, apparently to identify 
protesters for arrest. 
</p>
<p>2086. Furthermore, in the morning of 26 June 2008, Mr. Joon-Hyeong Lee was monitoring one 
of the protests on behalf of MINBYUN&#8217;s Human Rights Infringement Monitoring Team in 
Seoul. At the time, Mr. Lee was reportedly wearing a jacket which clearly indicated that he was 
attending the protest in his capacity as a monitor. At approximately 1 a.m., police officers 
reportedly attempted to disperse the crowd with water canons and a short time later used their 
shields to force an end to the protest. One of the police officers reportedly struck Mr. Lee on the 
head with his shield, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. Mr. Lee was transferred to 
Seoul National University Hospital where he was treated for a fractured skull and internal 
bleeding. 
</p>
<p>2087. In the evening of 25 June 2008, Ms. Jae-Jung Lee and Ms. Young-Gu Kang were 
involved in monitoring one of the candlelit protests when they intercepted police reportedly 
arresting individuals who had failed to comply with demands to disperse. Ms. Lee and Ms. Kang 
were subsequently arrested by the police and taken to Ganbug Police Station in Seoul where they 
were detained for 24 hours. Earlier the same day, at approximately 4 p.m. Mr. Jin Geol Ahn and 
Ms. Hee Sook Yun were arrested for allegedly &#8216;obstructing police in the course of duty&#8217;. At the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 364 
 
</p>
<p>time, Mr. Jin Geol Ahn and Ms. Hee Sook Yun were participating in a demonstration outside 
Kyong-bok Palace in Seoul when police reportedly began to arrest protesters on the spot. When 
Mr. Jin Geol Ahn attempted to prevent the arrest of a minor, a number of police officers 
reportedly seized him from behind, while one of them forced him to the ground by the neck. 
Mr. Geol Ahn reportedly suffered bruising as a result of the incident and was taken to Jong-ro 
police Station along with 30 others. 
</p>
<p>2088. According to reports, MINBYUN lawyers Ms. Jae-Jeong Lee and Mr. Gwang-Joong Kim 
were arrested on 1 June 2008 and detained for 6 hours by police officers. Mr. Kim&#8217;s arm was 
reportedly twisted during the interrogation, while Ms. Lee was apparently struck in the chest 
with a shield. On the same day, Ms. Na Rae Lee, who was participating in a candlelit protest, fell 
in front of a police convoy vehicle. A riot police officer who was close to Ms. Lee at the time 
reportedly began to kick Ms. Lee in the head while she was still on the ground. Ms. Lee managed 
to seek temporary cover under the vehicle, but was forced to roll out again because of the engine. 
She was reportedly treated for concussion in the local hospital. The assault on Ms. Lee was 
captured on video and has been aired on Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), one of 
South Korea&#8217;s main TV stations. 
</p>
<p>2089. Concern was expressed that the alleged arrests and the use of police violence against 
demonstrators during the candlelit protests, as well as the banning of protest related websites 
may represent a direct attempt to stifle freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2090. In a letter dated 15 October 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
sent on 28 July 2008. The Government indicated that the four NGOs mentioned in the letter 
alleged that the Government restricted their right to freedom of opinion and expression and to

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 3 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2092. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning the deaths of 
Mr. Ilyas Shurpayev, a correspondent for the Russian state television&#8217;s Channel One and 
Mr. Gadzhi Abashilov, head of the state radio and television company in Dagestan. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 365 
 
</p>
<p>2093. According to the information received, on 21 March 2008, Mr. Shurpayev was found 
dead in his apartment in Moscow. He had reportedly been strangled and stabbed, and his 
apartment was subsequently set on fire. Shortly before his death, Mr. Shurpayev reported in his 
blog that a newspaper in his native Dagestan had banned a column he had written and instructed 
the staff not to mention his name in the publication. The Investigative Committee within the 
Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office reportedly opened an investigation on this case. 
</p>
<p>2094. On the same day, in a separate case, Mr. Abashilov was shot dead in his car in 
Makhachkala, Dagestan, by at least one unknown gunman. Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika 
reportedly opened an investigation and signalled that he attached a high priority to the case. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2095. The Government responded to the above mentioned communication by informing that: 
&#8220;1. On 21 March 2008, in Makhachkala in the Republic of Dagestan, unidentified criminals fired 
an automatic weapon at the official car of Mr. A.M. Abashilov, Director-General of the Dagestan 
State Television and Radio Company. He died on the spot. The investigative department of the 
investigative committee attached to the office of the procurator of the Russian Federation for the 
Republic of Dagestan instituted criminal proceedings on the basis of evidence of an offence 
contrary to article 105 (Murder), paragraph 2, and article 222 (Unlawful arms trafficking), 
paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A task force composed of the most 
experienced officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Dagestan was created 
to solve the crime. In order to provide practical assistance in solving Mr. Abashilov&#8217;s murder, 
two officers of the criminal investigation department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation were sent to Dagestan. A number of possible motives for the crime, 
including the possibility that it was related to Mr. Abashilov&#8217;s professional activities, have been 
put forward and are being investigated. The investigation is being monitored by the Office of the 
Procurator General and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>2096. 2. On 21 March 2008, in Moscow, during efforts to extinguish a fire in apartment 198 
located at 2 Veshnie Vody St., block 2, the body of Mr. I.I. Shurpaev, a correspondent for Pervy 
kanal (Channel One) was discovered with signs of strangulation and a knife wound. It was 
established that the following items had been stolen from the victim&#8217;s apartment: a Samsung 
mobile telephone, a laptop computer, a wristwatch and 150,000 roubles. As a result of the 
measures taken to solve Mr. Shurpaev&#8217;s murder, it was established that two unknown men, later 
identified as Tajik citizens with whom Mr. Shurpaev was acquainted, had visited his apartment. 
On the day of the murder, the aforementioned persons took a plane from Moscow to Dushanbe. 
</p>
<p>2097. In cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan, under the international 
treaty of 29 March 2008 concerning legal assistance, the persons suspected of murdering 
Mr. Shurpaev were identified and arrested in Dushanbe. The victim&#8217;s mobile telephone and 
wristwatch were found on their persons and confiscated. The motive for this crime was 
mercenary: the crime was committed with a view to gaining possession of the valuables in 
Mr. Shurpaev&#8217;s apartment. At present, the outcome of an investigation indicates that the murders 
of these two journalists were not related. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 27 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2099. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to 
the Government concerning the prosecution of Mr. Yuri Samodurov, director of the 
Andrei Sakharov Museum and Human Rights Center. The Sakharov Center houses the only 
museum in Russia dedicated to human rights and has hosted exhibitions of photographs, 
children&#8217;s drawings and other material illustrating past and present human rights abuses and 
violations. 
</p>
<p>2100. According to the information received, in March 2007, the Andrei Sakharov Museum and 
Human Rights Center hosted an exhibition showing provocative artwork that had been banned 
from several art galleries in Russia. The artwork reportedly depicts images that were considered 
by the prosecutor&#8217;s office as being denigrating of Christianity. On 13 May 2008, following an 
investigation, Mr. Samodurov was charged with &#8220;inciting religious hatred&#8221; under Article 282 of 
the criminal code for hosting the exhibition. On the basis of article 15 of the Law on the Fight 
against Extremist Activities, if Mr. Samodurov is found guilty on the current charges, the 
Sakharov Center would have to issue a public statement distancing within five days from the 
court ruling from Mr. Samodurov&#8217;s alleged extremist activities. Failure to do so could result in 
the dissolution of the Sakharov Center. On the basis of article 19 of the Law on NGOs; if 
Mr. Samodurov was found guilty he would have to resign from the organization&#8217;s membership. 
</p>
<p>2101. The Special Rapporteurs were concerned that the Law on the Fight against Extremist 
Activities and NGO legislation can be used to silence human rights defenders. A similar situation 
already occurred with the closure of the Russian Chechen Friendship Society (RCFS), whose 
case had been brought to the attention of the Government in a letter sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 8 February 2007, to which a response from the Government was had not been 
received (A/HRC/7/28/Add.1 paras. 1669-1672). 
</p>
<p>2102. Concern was expressed that the charges against Mr. Samodurov represented an undue 
limitation on his right to freedom of opinion and expression, including in the form of art, and 
might be linked to his legitimate human rights activities. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2103. In a letter dated 18 July 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 27 May 2008. In its response, the Government informed that &#8220;on 23 May 2007, the Tagansky 
Interdistrict Procurator&#8217;s Office in Moscow initiated criminal case No. 402588 on the grounds 
that the crime established by article 282 (1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation had 
been committed through the holding of the exhibition &#8220;Forbidden Art 2006&#8221; on the premises of 
the A. Sakharov Museum and Civic Centre, Building 6, Zemlyanoy Val 57, Moscow. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 367 
 
</p>
<p>2104. The preliminary investigation established that during the organization and holding of the 
above-mentioned exhibition from 7 March to 31 March 2007 acts were committed in public such 
as to incite hatred and enmity and to humiliate citizens on account of their attitude to religion. 
</p>
<p>2105. Y.V. Samodurov, the Executive Director of the international public organization, the 
Andrei Sakharov Fund - Public Commission to Preserve the Legacy of Academician Sakharov, 
and Director of the independent non-profit-making cultural organization the Andrei Sakharov 
Museum and Civic Centre for Peace, Progress and Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the 
Museum&#8221;) and A.V. Erofeev, Head of the Latest Trends Department of the State Tretyakov 
Gallery, were accused of committing the crime established by article 282 (2) (b) of the Russian 
Criminal Code (commission of acts designed to incite hatred and enmity and humiliate a group 
of persons on account of their attitude to religion, perpetrated publicly and by prior agreement by 
a group of persons with the use of their official position). 
</p>
<p>2106. The inquiry into this crime by the investigative unit for the Tagansky district of the 
investigative office of the investigative committee at the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the 
Russian Federation in Moscow established that Y.V Samodurov and A.V. Erofeev selected for 
the publicly accessible exhibition &#8220;Forbidden art 2006&#8221; exhibits which visibly, demonstratively 
and publicly expressed a humiliating and insulting attitude to the Christian religion as a whole 
and to Orthodox Christianity in particular, as well as to religious symbols revered by believers 
and which aroused hatred and enmity. After this, Y.V. Samodurov gave permission to present 
the exhibition on the premises. 
</p>
<p>2107. The inquiry found that A.V. Erofeev and Y.V. Samodurov chose the collection of 
exhibits making up the exhibition not on the basis of their artistic value, but exclusively with a 
view to using them to convey more powerfully an unfavourable, emotional assessment and 
intolerance of citizens professing the Orthodox faith, and to offer a targeted, conscious and 
intentional presentation of blasphemous works. This fact is borne out by Y.V. Samodurov&#8217;s 
attempt in his public statements to underpin his action with ideological and legal arguments that 
perverted the content of Russian legislation. 
</p>
<p>2108. A study conducted by a fine art expert in the course of the inquiry came to the conclusion 
that the exhibits presented in the exhibition contained aberrant language and that the positioning 
of elements of the exhibition near to religious symbols offended religious feelings and 
humiliated Orthodox believers. A psychologist&#8217;s expert report concluded that the exhibits 
constituted an extremely cynical, sardonic insult to and a caricature of the religious convictions 
and feelings of Orthodox believers and that the exhibits undermined their human dignity on 
account of their attitude to religion. Hence the principles of the constitutional order of the 
Russian Federation, as established in articles 13 (5), 14 and 28 of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation, which safeguard the principles of religious tolerance as the guarantee of 
civil peace and democratic society, were crudely breached. 
</p>
<p>2109. The investigation has now been completed and the accused are acquainting themselves 
with the case file. No complaint has been received from the accused or from any other 
participants in the criminal proceedings. In accordance with article 49 (1) of the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation everyone accused of committing a crime is considered innocent until his 
guilt is proved according to the rules established by federal law and confirmed by a court 
sentence which has come into legal force.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 24 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2111. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to 
the Government concerning Ms. Ksenia Ludan, an activist with the Other Russia coalition, an 
umbrella group of human rights organizations and a wide range of other civil society 
movements. 
</p>
<p>2112. According to information received, on 13 June 2008, Ms. Ludan was detained as she left 
the temporary isolation facility in Guilyarovskiy Street, Moscow, where she had served four days 
of administrative custody following her sentencing under Article 20.1 (minor offence) of the 
Administrative Procedural Code for her participation in a protest on the premises of the Russian 
Railways company on 9 June 2008. The protest was organized to call for the respect of workers&#8217; 
rights of the employees of the Russian Railways company. As Ms. Ludan was leaving the 
temporary isolation facility, plainclothes police agents of the UBOP organized crime unit, one of 
whom was identified as senior lieutenant Sergey Prikazchikov, stopped her and forced her into 
the vehicle. 
</p>
<p>2113. The police confiscated Ms. Ludan&#8217;s mobile phone and brought her to the prosecutor&#8217;s 
office of the North-Eastern administrative district of Moscow for interrogation. Reports indicated 
that Ms. Ludan was subjected to threats that she would be regarded as a suspect, not a witness, if 
she refused to answer their questions regarding two criminal cases of alleged extremism and 
vandalism and that she was forced to sign detention forms although she had not received any 
summons. Ms. Ludan was released on Friday evening. 
</p>
<p>2114. Concern was expressed that the detention, interrogation and intimidation of 
Ms. Ksenia Ludan may be directly related to her activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular workers&#8217; rights. In view of the nature of her detention, concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Ludan. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2115. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 24 June 2008. The Government reported that on 7 November 2007, the investigative authority 
of the investigative committee for Moscow attached to the Office of the Procurator of the 
Russian Federation instituted criminal proceedings (case No. 405127) on the basis of evidence of 
an offence contrary to article 214 (Vandalism), paragraph 2, and article 282 1 (Organization of 
an extremist association), paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. On the 
night of 6/7 November 2007, unidentified individuals defiled the buildings of the area and 
district executive committees of the political party United Russia. 
</p>
<p>2116. In the course of the investigation, it was established that the unidentified persons, 
motivated by political hatred and enmity, sprayed paint on the walls of the buildings of the area 
and district executive committees of the political party United Russia; the buildings are situated </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 369 
 
</p>
<p>on Kominterna, Shirokaya and Polyarnaya streets in Moscow. The individuals scattered leaflets 
(signed on behalf of the National Bolshevik and Other Russia organizations) containing 
information about disagreement with the policy being conducted by the country&#8217;s leaders and 
expressing political hatred towards members of the United Russia party. The persons who 
committed the aforementioned acts are members of the National Bolshevik Party, an extremist 
organization that has been dissolved pursuant to an enforceable court decision owing to that 
organization&#8217;s engagement in extremist activities. 
</p>
<p>2117. During the investigation of the criminal case, information was received that Ms. Ludan 
might have information about the persons who took part in the commission of aforementioned 
offences. In this connection, the investigator decided to question Ms. Ludan as a witness in the 
criminal case. In accordance with article 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the 
Russian Federation, the investigator instructed officers of the internal affairs authority of the 
Department for Combating Organized Crime for the North Eastern Administrative Area of 
Moscow to establish the whereabouts of Ms. Ludan, and summon her to appear before the body 
conducting the pretrial investigation. 
</p>
<p>2118. On 13 June 2008, officers of the internal affairs authority of the Department for 
Combating Organized Crime for the North Eastern Administrative Area of Moscow established 
the whereabouts of Ms. Ludan: on 9 June 2008, Ms. Ludan had been arrested for participating in 
an unauthorized action and brought to the internal affairs office for the Kransoselsk internal 
affairs authority for Moscow&#8217;s Central Administrative Area. Pursuant to article 20, paragraph 1 
(Disorderly conduct), of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, 
administrative proceedings were brought against Ms. Ludan for her participation in the 
aforementioned action. 
</p>
<p>2119. On 10 June 2008, the Meshchansky district court of Moscow sentenced Ms. Ludan to 
administrative arrest for a period of four days in a special holding centre for persons arrested for 
administrative offences by the Moscow Central Internal Affairs Authority. 
</p>
<p>2120. On 13 June 2008, Ms. Ludan was released from the special holding centre. Officers of 
the internal affairs authority of the Department for Combating Organized Crime for the 
North Eastern Administrative Area of Moscow arranged for Ms. Ludan&#8217;s appearance in the 
investigative department, where from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. she was questioned as a witness by 
Mr. K.V. Karasev, the investigator of the investigative department for the North Eastern 
Administrative Area of the investigative authority of the investigative committee for Moscow 
attached to the Office of the Procurator of the Russian Federation. The officers of the internal 
affairs authority of the Department for Combating Organized Crime for the North Eastern 
Administrative Area of Moscow did not take part in the questioning and were not present during 
the investigation; they did not exert any psychological or physical pressure on Ms. Ludan. A 
personal search of Ms. Ludan was not conducted, and objects and documents belonging to her 
were not confiscated. 
</p>
<p>2121. After questioning, Ms. Ludan left the building of the investigative department. She was 
not detained pursuant to articles 91 and 92 (Grounds and procedure for arresting a suspect) of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 370 
 
</p>
<p>2122. The employees of the internal affairs office have no information concerning the 
whereabouts of Ms. Ludan. Subsequently and up until the present, Ms. Ludan has not been 
subjected to any measures, including arrest, on the part of internal affairs officers. There is no 
information about the receipt by law enforcement agencies of complaints from Ms. Ludan 
concerning unlawful arrest, militia officers&#8217; use of psychological and physical pressure, threats 
of criminal prosecution, or the unlawful confiscation of property. The case file does not contain 
any information concerning Ms. Ludan&#8217;s arrest by officers of the Department for Combating 
Organized Crime or by other individuals after she was questioned. 
</p>
<p>2123. At present, the director of the investigative authority of the investigative committee for 
Moscow attached to the Office of the Procurator of the Russian Federation has been instructed to 
organize an investigation, in accordance with article 144 (Procedure for investigating reports of 
offences) and article 145 (Decisions to be taken on the basis of the investigation of the report of 
an offence) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, into the reports 
concerning unlawful acts committed against Ms. Ludan by militia officers. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2124. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 2 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2125. On 2 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations 
concerning Mr. Anton Pavlovich Turin, a correspondent for the Samara Human Rights 
Information Agency Svoboda in the city of Samara in the Samarskaya Oblast. Mr. Turin 
participates in the monitoring of polling stations and voting commissions. He has also attended 
demonstrations and public actions in opposition to the use of torture by the authorities and 
military service. 
</p>
<p>2126. According to the information received, on the afternoon of 14 February 2008, two 
officers of the Organized Crime Department for the Samarskaya Oblast (UBOP) came to 
Mr. Turin&#8217;s home and asked that he return with them to the police station. Only one of the 
officers identified himself as field officer of UBOP by giving a name which is known to us. 
Turin asked what the reason for their request was and if they had a summons. Reports indicate 
that the officers then became aggressive toward Mr. Turin and his mother and threatened to lodge 
an administrative complaint against the former if he did not accompany them to the station. 
</p>
<p>2127. While Mr. Turin believed they were returning to the District Internal Affairs Department, 
he was in fact brought to office 212 at the UBOP station, where his personal belongings were 
examined by an officer, whose name is also known to us. Another officer took Mr. Turin&#8217;s 
mobile phone and left the room. Mr. Turin was verbally and then physically assaulted by the first 
officer, who hit him twice on the right side of his face, and threatened him with further physical 
violence. Mr. Turin screamed for help and the physical assault ended. 
</p>
<p>2128. The second officer returned and both began to question Mr. Turin about his activities in 
Russia and his family and friends. The first officer again reportedly threatened Mr. Turin, this 
time with planting narcotics on him and with preventative arrest, if he didn&#8217;t calm down, stop </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 371 
 
</p>
<p>taking part in mass actions, and stop monitoring polling stations and voting commissions as a 
correspondent for Svoboda. Mr. Turin was then coerced into acknowledging in writing that he 
had been warned about the consequences of his &#8220;participation in mass actions&#8221; before being 
released. 
</p>
<p>2129. It was alleged that the detention and harassment of Anton Pavlovich Turin may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights in the Russian Federation, in 
particular through his exercise of the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>2130. Following these reports, serious concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Turin. Further concern was expressed for measures which may 
seek to curtail the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2131. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 2 July 2008. The Government reported that in accordance with article 5 of the Federal Act 
No. 114-FZ of 25 July 2002 on measures to counter extremist activities, in February 2008 
preventive measures were carried out in Samara with a view to identifying members of informal 
youth associations with extremist tendencies. 
</p>
<p>2132. In the course of the aforementioned measures it was established that Anton Pavlovich 
Tyurin, a correspondent for the non-governmental organization Samara Human Rights 
Information Agency &#8220;Svoboda&#8221;, took an active part in unauthorized actions of the National 
Bolshevik Party, the activities of which have been prohibited in the Russian Federation; the party 
itself has been declared extremist. 
</p>
<p>2133. On 14 February 2008, officers of the Department for Combating Organized Crime 
attached to the Central Internal Affairs Administration for Samara province came to 
Mr. Tyurin&#8217;s apartment in order to hold a preventive talk with him. They showed Mr. Tyurin 
their service identification cards and suggested that he go with them to the Department for 
Combating Organized Crime attached to the Central Internal Affairs Administration for Samara 
province. 
</p>
<p>2134. Mr. Tyurin voluntarily went to the Department for Combating Organized Crime attached 
to the Central Internal Affairs Administration for Samara province, where a preventive talk was 
held with him. Mr. Tyurin was warned that, if he took part in unlawful actions, rallies, 
demonstrations or picketing, he might be arrested for an administrative offence. Mr. Tyurin&#8217;s 
personal affairs were not examined and were not confiscated. The members of the Department 
for Combating Organized Crime did not exert any psychological or physical pressure on him. 
After the talk, Mr. Tyurin left the building of the Department for Combating Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p>2135. It subsequently became known that provocative information concerning officers of the 
Department for Combating Organized Crime had been placed on the information resource 
www.svobodanews.ru. 
</p>
<p>2136. On 17 April 2008, the Sovetsky interdistrict investigative department of the investigative 
administration of the investigative committee attached to the office of the Procurator-General for </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 372 
 
</p>
<p>Samara province received a communication from Mr. A.V. Loshmankin, the founder of the non 
governmental organization Samara Human Rights Information Agency &#8220;Svoboda&#8221;, concerning 
the unlawful actions of officers of the Department for Combating Organized Crime attached to 
the Central Internal Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation for Samara province, who had arrested Mr. Tyurin and exerted physical and 
psychological pressure on him. 
</p>
<p>2137. In the course of the investigation conducted pursuant to article 144 (Procedure for 
investigating reports of offences) and article 145 (Decisions to be taken on the basis of the 
investigation of the report of an offence) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the 
Russian Federation, the information concerning the unlawful detention of Mr. Tyurin and the use 
of force against him by officers of the Department for Combating Organized Crime attached to 
the Central Internal Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Russian Federation for Samara province was not confirmed. 
</p>
<p>2138. A critical attitude must be taken to Mr. Tyurin&#8217;s claim that he suffered physical injury as 
a result of the use of force against him by officers of the Department for Combating Organized 
Crime, since Mr. Tyurin&#8217;s allegations were not confirmed during the investigation that was 
conducted. 
</p>
<p>2139. In light of the aforementioned circumstances, the fact that Mr. Tyurin was brought to the 
Department for Combating Organized Crime attached to the Central Internal Affairs 
Administration for Samara province and that a talk was held with him cannot be linked with his 
human rights activities. 
</p>
<p>2140. On 30 July 2008, on the basis of the results of the investigation by the Sovetsky 
interdistrict investigative department of the investigative administration of the investigative 
committee attached to the Office of the Procurator-General for Samara province, the decision 
was taken not to institute criminal proceedings against the officers of the Department for 
Combating Organized Crime attached to the Central Internal Affairs Administration for Samara 
province in accordance with article 24, paragraph 1 (2), of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation, since their actions did not reveal any evidence of an offence contrary to 
article 286 (Exceeding of official authority), paragraph 3 (a), or to article 127 (Unlawful 
deprivation of liberty), paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>2141. The Samara province procurator&#8217;s office reviewed the legality of the aforementioned 
procedural decision on several occasions. The Office of the Procurator-General of the 
Russian Federation is currently verifying the legality and justification of the decision. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2142. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 8 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2143. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Viktor Shmakov, 
Editor-in-Chief and Mr. Airat Dilmukhametov, journalist, with the newspaper 
Provintsialnye Vesti, in the Bashkortostan Republic. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 373 
 
</p>
<p>2144. According to information received, on 25 June 2008, the Kirov District Court in the 
regional capital of Ufa, Republic of Bashkortostan, issued Mr. Viktor Shmakov and 
Mr. Airat Dilmukhametov with a two year suspended sentence for allegedly violating laws on 
media and extremism, as contained in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. 
Mr. Viktor Shmakov and Mr. Airat Dilmukhametov were also reportedly banned from working 
as journalists for a year. Furthermore, earlier in June 2008, the Kirov District Court ordered the 
closure of Provintsialnye Vesti, on the request of local prosecutors, amidst allegations that the 
newspaper had violated media and extremism legislation, including the alleged publication of 
extremist materials. 
</p>
<p>2145. According to reports, previously in 2006 a criminal case was initiated against 
Mr. Viktor Shmakov and Mr. Airat Dilmukhametov for their alleged involvement in extremist 
activities. On 28 April 2006, Mr. Viktor Shmakov was arrested by agents from the Federal 
Security Service (FSB), and sentenced to two months imprisonment while the FSB and Interior 
Ministry conducted a joint investigation into allegations of extremist activities. On 16 May 2006, 
the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan ordered Mr. Smakov&#8217;s release, stating that the authorities 
did not have enough evidence to hold him. Reports claim that Mr. Smarkov was not released for 
another 48 hours following the Court&#8217;s decision. 
</p>
<p>2146. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events could represent a direct attempt to 
prevent independent reporting in Russia, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2147. In a letter dated 30 November 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 8 July 2008. At the time of the finalization of the current report, a translation of the reply was 
not available. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2148. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2149. On 29 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur a on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev, member of the &#8220;Mashr&#8221; 
human rights group, an organization which provides support for relatives of people who have 
suffered involuntary disappearances and ill-treatment at the hands of unidentified security 
servicemen in Ingushetia. 
</p>
<p>2150. According to information received, on 25 July 2008, at approximately 6 a.m., several 
vehicles, including three &#8220;Gazelle&#8221; minibuses and three vehicles for armed troops, stopped 
before Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev&#8217;s house. Around 50 security officers approached the gate. When 
Mr. Tsetchoev opened the door, they held him at gunpoint and forced him to lay face-down on 
the ground. Some servicemen went into the house without showing any identification or search 
warrant. They searched the house, confiscated one computer and two mobile phones and drove 
Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev away in one of the minibuses. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 374 
 
</p>
<p>2151. Subsequently, Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev was interrogated for about five hours. He was 
accused of sending lists containing the personal addresses of law enforcers to the website 
Ingushetiya Ru. When he denied sending these lists, he was beaten and asked to give the names 
of who had sent them. At approximately 12.10 p.m., Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev was left on a road in 
Ingushetia. He was picked up by colleagues and taken to hospital where he was treated for a 
broken leg, as well as bruising to both of his kidneys and both of his arms. 
</p>
<p>2152. During Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev&#8217;s detention, his whereabouts were not known. The Ministry 
of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office denied any knowledge about 
Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev&#8217;s detention or the grounds on which he had been detained. 
</p>
<p>2153. Concern was expressed that the detention and ill-treatment of Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev may 
have been directly related to his legitimate activities in the defence of human rights, in particular 
his work to provide support for victims of torture at the hands of security servicemen. 
</p>
<p>2154. In view of the events described above, concern was also expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Zurab Tsetchoev. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2155. In a letter dated 7 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 29 July 2008. At the time of the finalization of the present report, a translation of the reply 
was not yet available. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2156. On 15 August 2008, the Special rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur a on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
Ms. Gulnara Rustamova, the representative of Mothers of Dagestan for Human Rights, an NGO 
based in Makhachkali, Republic of Dagestan, Russian Federation. The NGO deals with cases of 
young men who have disappeared since 2007. 
</p>
<p>2157. According to the information received, on 23 May 2008, in an interview published in the 
weekly &#8216;Novoe Delo&#8217;, Ms. Rustamova and other members of the NGO Mothers of Dagestan 
were accused by an anonymous officer of the Investigative Committee of the General Prosecutor 
of the Southern Federal District of Dagestan of supporting fighters living in the forest. 
</p>
<p>2158. On 6 June 2008 the daily &#8216;Chernovik&#8217; published the proceedings of a meeting which was 
chaired by the President of Dagestan, Mr. Mukhy Aliev. According to the newspaper, when the 
President asked &#8216;What does Rustamova need?&#8217;, someone from among the participants replied: &#8216;a 
bullet in the head&#8217;. The reply was allegedly attributed to Mr. Adilgirey Magomedtagirov, the 
Minister of Internal Affairs of Dagestan. 
</p>
<p>2159. On 4 July 2008, in yet another article in the weekly &#8216;Novoe Delo&#8217;, Ms. Rustamova was 
accused of cooperating directly with an insurgent killed in Makhachkaly.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 375 
 
</p>
<p>2160. Concern was expressed that the harassment of, the threats against, and the slander 
campaign against Ms. Gulnara Rustamova and members of her family may be directly related to 
her activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2161. Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Ms. Rustamova. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2162. In a letter dated 31 December 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 15 August 2008. In its reply, the Government provided the following information: &#8220;The 
Office of the Procurator of the Republic of Dagestan has checked on the allegations that 
slanderous information about Ms. G.L. Rustamova has been published in the Dagestan media in 
connection with her human rights activities. Ms. Rustamova is one of the leaders of Mothers of 
Dagestan for Human Rights, an organization whose main activity is assisting people in 
determining the whereabouts of disappeared and abducted relatives. The law enforcement 
agencies of the Republic of Dagestan do nothing to hinder this organization in its work. 
</p>
<p>2163. All queries about abductions and other questions raised by Ms. Rustamova are considered 
in accordance with the established procedure. Where there are grounds for doing so, any 
necessary checks are carried out and appropriate action is taken in response. The federal 
watchdog body for communications and the media in the Republic of Dagestan has investigated 
the material published on 23 May and 4 July 2008 in Novoe Delo and on 6 July 2008 in 
Chernovik, with assistance from the management board of the Argument Linguistic Experts&#8217; 
Association, based in the Republic of Adygeya. 
</p>
<p>2164. An analysis of the material published in these newspapers has found no assertions that 
Ms. Rustamova and other staff of Mothers of Dagestan for Human Rights have aided or abetted 
military groups or been in contact with an insurgent, nor any insults or threats. The editorial 
boards of Novoe Delo and Chernovik have not been shown to have violated article 4 of the Mass 
Media Act. 
</p>
<p>2165. According to information from the Office of the President and the Government of the 
Republic of Dagestan, the dig at Ms. Rustamova reported in the Chernovik article &#8220;The Mass 
Media, Gimry and Balakhani ...&#8221;, published on 6 July 2008, was not made by anyone attending 
the meeting between the President of Dagestan and the heads of the Republic&#8217;s ministries and 
departments on 2 June 2008. It has also been established that staff at the main investigation 
department of the investigation committee in the Office of the Procurator of the 
Russian Federation for the Southern Federal District have never been interviewed by the media 
about Ms. Rustamova&#8217;s activities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2166. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations on 4 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2167. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur a on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 376 
 
</p>
<p>sent a letter of allegations regarding Mr. Magomed Yevloyev, a well known journalist and 
founder of the independent news website ingushetiya.ru. The website is known as the main 
non-governmental source of information in the Republic of Ingushetia, and reports on alleged 
governmental corruption and human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>2168. According to information received, on 31 August 2008, at approximately 1.30 p.m., 
Mr. Magomed Yevloyev was arrested as he disembarked from a plane at Nazran airport in 
Magas, Republic of Ingushetia. Mr. Yevloyev was then escorted to a waiting police vehicle. A 
short time later, Mr. Yevloyev sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was taken by police 
officers to hospital, where he died later that day. 
</p>
<p>2169. The Interior Ministry of Ingushetia stated that Mr. Yevloyev was killed &#8220;accidentally&#8221; 
while resisting arrest. An Investigative Committee spokesman in Moscow also issued a statement 
which indicated that Mr. Yevloyev was detained by police and died in an &#8220;incident&#8221; while being 
taken to police headquarters for interrogation. The office of the Prosecutor General of the 
Russian Federation has reportedly indicated that it will investigate the incident. 
</p>
<p>2170. Prior to his death, Mr. Yevloyev had been a vocal critic of the government, and 
particularly of the Regional President of Ingushetia, Murat Zyazikov. Mr. Zyazikov had 
reportedly threatened to shut down the website ingushetiya.ru on a number of occasions. In early 
August 2008, the Moscow City Court upheld a district court&#8217;s decision to shut down the website 
for allegedly &#8220;carrying extremist content&#8221;. Charges of &#8220;inciting ethnic hatred&#8221; were also being 
pursued by prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>2171. In October 2007, Mr. Yevloyev had accused the President of the Republic of Ingushetia, 
Mr. Zyazikov, on the ingushetiya.ru website of hiring hit-men to kill him. His family had also 
received threats from Ingush politicians. The current editor of ingushetiya.ru, 
Ms. Roza Malsagova, recently left the Russian Federation and has sought political asylum in 
France, alleging severe pressure on her by authorities, including through a number of criminal 
cases brought against her, in connection with her editing of the website. 
</p>
<p>2172. While the reported investigation by the Public Prosecutor into the killing of 
Mr. Magomed Yevloyev was welcomed, concern was expressed that the aforementioned events 
may represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting in Russia. This concern was 
reinforced by the fact that the killing of Mr. Yevloyev is one in a long series of murders of 
journalists in the Russian Federation, as reflected inter alia in the communication to the 
Government by the Special Rapporteur on summary executions of 30 October 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2173. In a letter dated 29 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 4 September 2008. The Government informed that on 31 August 2008, officers of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Ingushetia, acting on the instructions of the 
investigator of the Nazran internal affairs office to bring the witness M.Y. Evloev in for 
questioning, arrested Mr. Evloev at Nazran airport. It was necessary to take Mr. Evloev into 
custody by force because he had ignored the summons issued by the investigator. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 377 
 
</p>
<p>2174. At approximately 2 p.m., in a motor vehicle on his way to the Nazran internal affairs 
office, Mr. Evloev received a bullet wound to the head and, despite the medical treatment 
provided by one of the Republic&#8217;s hospitals, died. The militia officer who fired the shot testified 
that he had accidently pulled the trigger of his pistol. He was looking out of the window of the 
vehicle, since he believed that the vehicle might be attacked. He held the pistol cocked, ready to 
fire. Suddenly he heard the other militia officer cry out and he turned in his direction. At this 
time, Mr. Evloev moved forward and his head came in contact with the pistol. It was at that 
moment that the pistol went off. 
</p>
<p>2175. Proceedings were instituted under article 109, paragraph 2 (negligent homicide owing to 
the improper discharge by a person of his professional duties), of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation. The final classification of the offence will be provided at the concluding 
stage, once all the facts of the case have been investigated. 
</p>
<p>2176. The investigators are also considering several other possibilities, including the possibility 
that Mr. Evloev&#8217;s death was connected with his public activities and that it occurred as a result of 
sudden personal animosity. The investigation is being conducted by the central investigative 
department of the investigative committee attached to the Office of the Procurator of the 
Russian Federation for the Southern Federal District. 
</p>
<p>2177. Mr. Evloev was a staunch critic of M.M. Zyazikov, President of the Republic of 
Ingushetia, and in general of the federal centre policy being conducted in the Republic. He 
openly propagated his views on the Internet site www.ingushetia.ru, which he owned. The 
Internet resource made active use of various Russian and foreign opposition - and often openly 
extremist - organizations. 
</p>
<p>2178. In connection with the repeated publication of extremist materials on the aforementioned 
website, on 6 June 2008 the Kuntsevo district court of Moscow decided to grant the request 
made by the procurator of Ingushetia for the closure of the website. 
</p>
<p>2179. On 12 August 2008, the Moscow city court upheld the decision of the Kuntsevo district 
court of Moscow to close the website www.ingushetia.ru. In August 2008, the Office of the 
Procurator for the Republic of Ingushetia instituted criminal proceedings against Mr. Evloev in 
connection with an explosion near the home of Zalimkhan Khautiev, the director of the 
monitoring department of the administration of the President of Ingushetia. It was precisely for 
the purpose of the initial inquiry into this criminal case that, on 31 August 2008, Mr. Evloev was 
being escorted by militia officers from the airport to the Nazran internal affairs office.

<p>2181. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations regarding Mr. Dariusz Bohatkiewicz, a 
reporter and Mr. Marcin Wesolowski, a cameraman with polish television station, 
Telewizja Polska (TVP), and Mr. Levan Guliashvili, a Georgian national and TVP driver. </p>

</p>
<p>2182. According to information received, on 8 September 2008, at approximately 4 p.m., 
Mr. Dariusz Bohatkiewicz, Mr. Marcin Wesolowski, and their driver Mr. Levan Guliashvili were 
arrested by members of a unit claiming to be from the South Ossetian police. The incident took 
place near the village of Karaleti, located in the buffer zone between South Ossetia and Georgia, 
when the crew had tried to enter the region to cover an expected Russian troop withdrawal. 
Reports claim that Mr. Bohatkiewicz, Mr. Wesolowski and Mr. Guliashvili were prevented from 
entering the village by Russian troops stationed at a checkpoint when they failed to produce 
press accreditation issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry. When the Telewizja Polska (TVP) 
crew tried an alternate route into Karaleti, they were then arrested and taken by car to an 
unknown location, where they were questioned for approximately 3 hours. The crew was 
subsequently transferred to the South Ossetian regional capital, Tskhinvali, where they were 
detained overnight. Their equipment and cell phones were confiscated. One of the crew members 
reportedly managed to send a text message to TVP&#8217;s Tbilisi office before his phone was seized, 
saying that they had been detained and that they were not being mistreated. 
</p>
<p>2183. On 9 September, the crew members were released from detention and transferred to the 
custody of Russian peacekeepers who subsequently turned them over to Georgian authorities and 
Polish diplomats. Their equipment and car was returned to them undamaged. 
</p>
<p>2184. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt by 
authorities operating in South Ossetia to prevent independent reporting in the region, following 
the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation.

<p>2186. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, sent a letter of allegations regarding Mr. Alishayev. He was the host of a 
popular religious television programme, Peace to Your Home, which is broadcast on Islamic 
television station, TV Chirkei. On 2 September 2008, at approximately 6.30 p.m., two unknown 
individuals attacked Mr. Abdulla Alishayev while in his car in the village of Separatorny, near 
Makhachkala, the capital of the Republic of Dagestan. He sustained gunshot wounds to his 
shoulder and head. A short time later Mr. Alishayev underwent emergency surgery at 
Makhachkala&#8217;s Central Hospital. He succumbed to his injuries the following day. The Dagestan 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has announced the launching of a criminal investigation and the 
identification of a suspect. 
</p>
<p>2187. Mr. Miloslav Bitokov is the editor-in-chief of the independent weekly Gazeta Yuga in 
Kabardino-Balkariya. Gazeta Yuga is one of the few news outlets in Kabardino-Balkariya to 
openly criticize local authorities. On 2 September 2008 at 7.30 p.m., Miloslav Bitokov was 
attacked by unknown aggressors at the entrance of his apartment building in Nalchik, the capital 
of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkariya. His son Artur Bitokov found his father lying on the </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2189. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination 
in this context, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights defenders, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding Ms. Carine Cl&#233;ment, Mr. Mikhail Beketov and Mr. Sergei Fedotov. 
Ms. Carine Cl&#233;ment is a Moscow-based French sociologist, and the director of the Institute 
of Collective Action. Ms. Cl&#233;ment is very active on housing rights and trade unions. 
Mr. Mikhail Beketov is a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Kimkinskaia Pravda newspaper, 
and is involved in the protection of environmental rights. Mr. Serguei Fedotov is the leader of a 
group supporting disenfranchised small landowners in the suburbs of Moscow. 
</p>
<p>2190. According to the information received, on 13 November 2008 Ms. Carine Cl&#233;ment was 
attacked near the Bilingua Club in downtown Moscow, on her way to a roundtable. Two 
unidentified man ran up to her from behind, and stabbed her in the thigh with a syringe 
containing an unidentified substance. On 12 November 2008, another assailant attacked 
Mrs. Carine Cl&#233;ment near her house. He insulted her and spat on her. Mrs. Cl&#233;ment filed a 
complaint with the police and went to the hospital for medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>2191. On 13 November 2008, Mr. Mikhail Beketov was found by a neighbour in his courtyard 
of his home in the Khimki district of Moscow. Mr. Beketov was severely beaten and was 
unconscious when he was taken to the hospital. He sustained a head injury, multiple broken 
bones, and other serious injuries. 
</p><p>2192. On 13 November 2008, Mr. Sergei Fedotov was attacked by two young men with 
baseball bats and pepper spray. 
</p>
<p>2193. Concern was expressed that the attacks on these human rights defenders working on 
economic and social rights, including on the right to adequate housing, in the Russian Federation 
may form part of a broader intimidation campaign. Further concern was expressed that the 
assaults on these defenders may be solely connected to their activities in the defence of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2194. In a letter dated 10 February 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
of 21 November 2008. In its reply, the Government provided the following information: 
&#8220;On 14 November 2008, the investigative authority of the Internal Affairs Department of the 
Khimki district in Moscow Province instituted criminal proceedings on the basis of evidence of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 380 
 
</p>
<p>an offence contrary to article 111, paragraph 1 (intentional causing of serious harm to health, 
endangering a person&#8217;s life), of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation in connection with 
the bodily harm inflicted on Mr. Beketov, the editor-in-chief of the Khimkinskaia Pravda 
newspaper. 
</p>
<p>2195. Mr. Beketov was found unconscious with multiple injuries on the premises of his 
domicile at 28, Gorky Street, Starbeevo housing block, Khimki, Moscow Province, at 7.50 a.m. 
on 13 November 2008. As the actions of the assailant are regarded as constituent elements of an 
offence contrary to article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code 
(attempted homicide), the criminal case was referred for further examination to the investigation 
department of the investigative committee under the Office of the Procurator of the 
Russian Federation for Moscow Province. 
</p>
<p>2196. Subsequently, several theories concerning the commission of the crime were put forward 
and are being checked, including in connection with Mr. Beketov&#8217;s professional activities, 
critical publications in the newspaper and hostile personal relations. An investigation is currently 
being conducted and a task force is working on the case. Given the serious nature of the crime, 
the case is being monitored by the head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
</p>
<p>2197. On 13 November 2008, the Lotoshinsk municipal district Department of Internal Affairs 
in Moscow Province received a communication from Ms. Fedotov concerning an assault on her 
husband, Mr. Fedotov. On the same day, Mr. Fedotov also contacted the Department of Internal 
Affairs to report the assault. Following verification by the investigation office of the Lotoshinsk 
municipal district Department of Internal Affairs, on 19 November 2008 criminal proceedings 
were instituted on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 116, paragraph 2 (a), of 
the Criminal Code (battery with criminal intent) in connection with the bodily harm inflicted on 
Mr. Fedotov by unknown individuals. 
</p>
<p>2198. According to the forensic expertise, a hematoma was found on Mr. Fedotov&#8217;s left foot 
that did not constitute a risk to his health. The investigative authorities are checking several 
theories, including in connection with the public activities of the victim as head of the council of 
a pressure group of defrauded landowners in Moscow Province and the possibility of an assault 
having been committed with criminal intent. The investigation is continuing. 
</p>
<p>2199. Following Ms. Cl&#233;ment&#8217;s statement that she had been assaulted on 13 November 2008 
and that she had been stabbed in the thigh with a syringe on 10 December 2008, the investigation 
office in the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basmanny municipal district in Moscow 
instituted criminal proceedings on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 213, 
paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (criminal mischief with objects employed as weapons). 
The investigation has not been concluded and is continuing. Moscow&#8217;s Basmanny interregional 
procurator&#8217;s office has ordered an investigation of the case&#8221;.

<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2201. On 9 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights defenders and the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the offices of 
the Memorial Research Centre, a non-governmental organization working on alleged 
disappearances in Saint Petersburg. 
</p>
<p>2202. According to the information received, on 4 December 2008, a group of seven 
unidentified men, some of them masked and armed with batons, broke into the offices of the 
Memorial Research Centre in Saint Petersburg. The group allegedly included two police officers, 
two members of the special reaction unit (SOBR), and an investigator assigned by the 
Saint Petersburg Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The men produced a search warrant from the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office of Saint Petersburg and showed it to the three staff members who were already present in 
the offices. The search warrant was issued in connection with an investigation against the 
newspaper &#8220;New Petersburg&#8221;, regarding an article titled &#8220;Here is the new candidate&#8221;. The search 
warrant was allegedly based on Article 282 of the Criminal Code (&#8220;Incitement to racial and 
religious hatred&#8221;). The Court of St Petersburg ruled earlier, on 21 October 2008, that the article 
in question did not contain extremist content. 
</p>
<p>2203. The premises of the Memorial Research Centre were blocked during the entire day 
of 4 December 2008, and the telephone lines were cut. The lawyer of the Memorial Research 
Center was prevented from being present during the search of the office. As a result of the 
search, the digital archives and other documents were seized and removed from the office, 
including hard drives and USB keys, computer processors and certain documents. Among the 
materials seized were 20 years of archives on Soviet Gulags and repression. 
</p>
<p>2204. According to its staff members, the Memorial Research Center does not have any 
connection either with the newspaper &#8220;New Petersburg&#8221; or with the article in question. 
</p>
<p>2205. Concern was expressed that the break-in and search of the offices of the Memorial 
Research Centre-Saint Petersburg, as well as the confiscation of digital data and archives, may 
have been solely in connection with the human rights activities of the non-governmental 
organization. Further concern was expressed with regard to the potential loss of data and its 
misuse. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2206. In a letter dated 21 January 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
of 9 December 2008. In its response, the Government provided the following information: 
&#8220;On 9 September 2008, the investigative branch of the central district investigative arm of the 
investigations committee attached to the Russian Federation procuracy in Saint Petersburg 
instituted criminal proceedings against Mr. A.V. Andreev, editor-in-chief of the newspaper 
Novy Petersburg, under article 282, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation 
(Incitement to hatred or enmity and violation of human dignity). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 382 
 
</p>
<p>2207. It had been established that on 21 June 2007 an article by Mr. K. Chernyaev entitled 
&#8220;Here is a real candidate&#8221; was published in the Novy Petersburg No. 27 (841). According to the 
findings of a psycholinguistic expert report, the text of the article contained statements that 
violated the dignity of individuals or groups on the basis of nationality or origin and excited 
national hatred or enmity.  
</p>
<p>2208. In the course of the investigation, information was received connecting Mr. Andreev with 
the activities of the Memorial Research Centre. Pursuant to a decision of 3 December 2008, 
between 12.21 p.m. and 5.20 p.m. on 4 December 2008 the investigator Mr. M.G. Kalganov, 
with the assistance of officers from the principal division of the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs for the north-western federal area, conducted a search of the premises of the organization 
in question and confiscated computer hard disks, diskettes, compact discs, photocopies of 
particular issues of the newspaper Novy Petersburg and other materials. In accordance with the 
requirements of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, these items were bagged in the 
presence of witnesses. 
</p>
<p>2209. The question whether the confiscated documents are substantive evidence and whether 
they are to be returned will be decided during the pretrial investigation. The staff members of the 
organization who were present during the search tried to prevent the investigator and the police 
officers from carrying it out. Despite the investigating officer&#8217;s lawful demand, in reading out 
article 182, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that nobody should leave the 
premises until the search was finished and that the persons present must not communicate with 
one another or with anyone else, they tried to let outsiders into the premises. The Saint 
Petersburg law enforcement authorities have not received any complaints from representatives of 
the Memorial Research Centre that human rights violations were committed during the search. 
</p>
<p>2210. A check by the Saint Petersburg procuracy did not identify any breaches of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure in the course of the search. The organization&#8217;s lawyers have lodged a 
complaint alleging that the actions of the investigator Mr. M.G. Kalganov were unlawful. 
This complaint is due to be considered by a judge of the Dzerzhinsky district court in 
Saint Petersburg. The court hearing is scheduled for 16 January 2009. 
</p>
<p>2211. The municipal courts have not dealt with the question whether the article &#8220;Here is a real 
candidate&#8221; constitutes extremist material. As matters stand, there are no grounds for the 
procuracy to act. The criminal investigation is being conducted under the supervision of the 
Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation.

preliminary investigation, on 24 November 2007, Moscow residents Oleg Petrovich Orlov, born 
in 1953, Artem Dmitrievich Vysotsky, born in 1974, Karen Edvardovich Sakhinov, born 
in 1982, and Stanislav Valerevich Goryachikh, born in 1986, were abducted from the Hotel Assa </p>

</p>
<p>in the town of Nazran by unidentified armed individuals and driven away in a white Gazel car 
with no registration plates. They were subsequently released near the village of Nesterovskaya. 
All four citizens had been assaulted by the criminals. In connection with this incident, 
on 24 November 2007, the Nazran unit of the investigative office of the Investigative Committee 
within the Office of the Procurator of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Ingushetia 
opened criminal case No. 200707560126 on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to 
article 139, paragraphs 1 and 2 (Unlawful entry into a residence involving the use or threat of 
force), article 144, paragraph 1 (Obstruction of the lawful professional activities of journalists 
through coercion to disseminate or refrain from disseminating information), and article 161, 
paragraphs 2 (a) and 2 (d) (Robbery committed by a group of persons by prior conspiracy and 
involving the use of force such as not to endanger life or health or the threat of such force), of the 
Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. A temporary response unit of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Republic of Ingushetia is conducting complex inquiries 
with a view to identifying and apprehending the individuals involved in committing the crime. 
The investigation of the case is continuing under the supervision of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of the Russian Federation and the Office of the Procurator-General of the 
Russian Federation.

<p>2215. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding Mr. Fouad Ahmad al-Farhan, married with two children, owner of a small IT 
company with the name of &#8220;Smart Info&#8221; and Internet &#8220;blogger&#8221;. On his Internet site he has 
reportedly, amongst other things, been critical of Your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s handling of 
the cases of Mr. Sulieman al-Rushudi, Mr. Essam al-Basrawi, Dr. Saud al-Hashimi, 
Mr. Al-Sharif Saif al-Ghalib, Dr. Musa al-Qirni, Dr. Abdel Rahman al-Shumayri, 
Mr. &#8217;Abdelaziz al-Khariji and at least three other persons. They have been in detention 
since 3 February 2007 and were the subject matter of a joint urgent appeal addressed to Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism, the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 8 February 2007, which has, unfortunately, remained without a reply by Your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to date. According to the information received, Mr. Fouad Ahmad al-Farhan was 
arrested by security agents at his office on 10 December 2007 and taken to his home, which was 
subsequently searched. It is believed that Mr. Fouad Ahmad al-Farhan is held in connection with 
his reportedly peaceful criticism of Government policies. The Ministry of Interior acknowledged 
his detention on 31 December 2007, but the exact reasons for his arrest have not been specified. 
Mr. Fouad Ahmad al-Farhan is currently being held in incommunicado detention at Dhaban 
Prison in the city of Jeddah. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>2216. Prior to his arrest Mr. Fouad Ahmad al-Farhan had been warned by an official from the 
Ministry of the Interior that he was at risk of being interrogated. He believed that this would be 
in connection with his writings on prisoners in his web journal. In view of Mr. Fouad Ahmad 
al-Farhan&#8217;s alleged incommunicado detention concern was expressed for his physical and mental 
integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>2218. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal concerning the reported arrest and detention of 
Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh, an academic and human rights defender in Saudi Arabia. 
Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh was the subject of three previous communications sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
30 May 2005; by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders on 26 April 2004; and by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the then Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights defenders on 19 March 2004. While the receipt of the 
replies of the Government dated 18 August 2005 and 18 December 2004 was acknowledged, the 
mandate holders wished to seek clarification on new information received. 
</p>
<p>2219. According to the new information received, on 19 May 2008, officers from the secret 
police arrested Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh on the premises of King Saud University in Riyadh, 
where he teaches. Whereas his family was informed of his arrest later that same day, 
Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh has not been given access to a lawyer or allowed any visit since then. 
Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh&#8217;s family has not been informed of the reasons for his detention or what the 
charges are, and his whereabouts are currently unknown. 
</p>
<p>2220. Two days before his arrest, on 17 May 2008, Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh had publicly 
criticized the harsh prison conditions in the overcrowded Buraida General Prison, where two 
other Saudi human rights defenders, Mr. Abdullah al-Hamid and Mr. &#8216;Isa al-Hamid, are serving 
prison sentences. Mr. Abdullah al-Hamid and Mr. &#8216;Isa al-Hamid were found guilty of 
&#8220;incitement to protest&#8221;, charges that were brought against them after they had supported and 
taken part in a reportedly peaceful demonstration outside the Buraida General Prison. The 
demonstrators called for their relatives&#8217; rights to being promptly informed about the charges 
brought against them and to a fair trial to be respected or, alternatively, to release them. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 385 
 
</p>
<p>2221. Mr. Al-Faleh&#8217;s statement criticized the restrictive procedures in relation to visits, the 
unhygienic conditions, the overcrowding, and the bad quality of medical services in the prison. 
His statement was later reproduced on http://www.menber-alhewar.info, a Saudi website. 
According to the information received, on 19 May 2008, this site was blocked for persons in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>2222. Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh had previously been arrested in March 2004 after calling for 
political reform, and was sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment in May 2005 on charges that 
included &#8220;sowing dissent and disobeying the ruler.&#8221; He was released after having been granted a 
royal pardon by His Majesty King Abdullah on 8 August 2005. Since his release he has 
reportedly not been permitted to travel abroad. 
</p>
<p>2223. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh might be 
solely connected to his reportedly peaceful activities in defending human rights and exercise of 
his right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>2224. In view of the alleged incommunicado detention of Mr. Matrouk al-Faleh at an unknown 
place of detention, further concerns were expressed that he might be at risk of ill-treatment.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 13 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2226. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of the 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
sent a letter of allegations concerning Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem, a human rights lawyer who 
has been active in defending the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>2227. According to information received, since 2004, a travel banned has been imposed on 
Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem, banning him from foreign travel. Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem 
recently received the International Human Rights Lawyer Award from the American Bar 
Association, but due to the travel ban he was unable to collect the award in person. 
Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem has allegedly attempted to challenge the travel ban in an 
administrative court, but the case was refused by the court. In November 2007, 
Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s license was revoked because he objected to the 
sentencing of a nineteen-year old female victim of rape. He has also previously been imprisoned 
for publicly speaking out against human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia as well as for defending 
three pro-democracy activists. 
</p>
<p>2228. Concern was expressed that the imposition of the travel ban on Mr. Abdul Rahman 
Al Lahem may directly be related to his peaceful professional activities in defending human 
rights and in particular women&#8217;s rights. Concern was further expressed that the travel ban may 
be imposed to prevent the views of Mr. Abdul Rahman Al Lahem from reaching a foreign 
audience. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2229. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 13 June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2230. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding Mr. Saleh Awad Saleh Al Hweiti, aged 62, born in Riyad, where he studied and lived, 
stateless and therefore without any identity documents, a poet critical of the Government, who 
denounced poverty and the marginalisation of &#8220;Bidune&#8221;. His poems have been published and 
broadcast on several Saudi and international web-sites and radio programmes. 
</p>
<p>2231. According to the information received, Mr. Saleh Al Hweiti was arrested 
on 27 October 2004. For one month his whereabouts were unknown. Then it turned out that, 
following an allegedly unfair trial he had been sentenced to 21 months of imprisonment for 
defamation of Government officials and was held in Al Alicha prison not far from Riyad. During 
the interrogations leading to the verdict, he had repeatedly been beaten. 
</p>
<p>2232. Mr. Saleh Al Hweiti was then transferred to Al Hayr, where he should have been released 
on 27 September 2005. Although his family intervened on his behalf, he was released 
only 18 months later, on 5 April 2007 in Tabuk. Since he has no identity documents, the secret 
service ordered him to stay in the city and wait for clarification of his administrative situation. 
</p>
<p>2233. Six days later he was called in by the security services who arrested him again. He was 
then held secretly in different prisons until 20 January 2008, when he was allowed to make a 
phone call from Ta&#8217;ef prison. On 1 July 2008, he was again allowed to call from a prison in 
Jeddah.  
</p>
<p>2234. He has not yet been brought before a judicial authority and has routinely been subjected 
to beatings and other forms of ill-treatment during interrogations. As a result several of his face 
bones are fractured. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2235. In a letter dated 25 November 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal 
of 22 July 2008, stating that the said person was detained on 30 April 2003 on the basis of a 
security-related charge (relevant to terrorist activities) and subsequently released 
on 23 April 2007. New accusations made against him then necessitated his detention once again 
on 29 April 2007 for purposes of questioning. Since his detention he has been treated in 
accordance with the judicial regulations in the Kingdom, which respect human rights and comply 
with the International Covenants and other conventions. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 15 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2236. On 15 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, sent a letter of allegations concerning the arrest of Sheikh Tawfiq 
al-Amer from the Shi&#8217;a community in Ahsa district, Eastern province. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 387 
 
</p>
<p>2237. According to the allegations, on 22 June 2008, Sheikh Tawfiq al-Amer was arrested and 
detained for a week without charge. The arrest of Sheikh al-Amer was reportedly linked to his 
criticism of an anti-Shi&#8217;a declaration made by 22 Wahhabi clerics, who had stated that Shi&#8217;as 
were &#8220;infidels&#8221; and &#8220;traitors&#8221; and a &#8220;great threat&#8221; to the Sunni majority in Saudi Arabia. In the 
mosque where he is Imam, Sheikh al-Amer argued on 14 June 2008 that such statements were 
dangerous to the community and asked the Government to prevent incitement to hatred and 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>2238. Furthermore, it has been reported that members of the Shi&#8217;a community in Ahsa district 
face discrimination, for example that they do not get licenses to operate a private school or a 
kindergarten. In addition, some categories of jobs are allegedly forbidden for Shi&#8217;as, such as 
becoming a minister, government adviser, president of a public company, municipality president, 
diplomat or official in an Islamic organization financed by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p><b>Serbia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2240. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of the 
Human Rights Defenders, sent an allegation letter regarding the intimidation and harassment 
against Ms. Sonja Biserko, Chairperson of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia 
(HCHRS). In 2008, Ms. Sonja Biserko published the Annual Report of the HCHRS for 2007. 
The report addressed crimes against humanity during the 1990s for which the Serbian 
administration in the Balkan region was allegedly responsible. 
</p>
<p>2241. According to new information received, in 2005 and 2006, Ms. Sonja Biserko suffered 
repeated break-ins at her home and physical attacks. These acts of intimidation were allegedly 
linked to a campaign which was launched by government officials and mainly targeted female 
leaders of Serbian human rights non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>2242. Since 22 September 2008, the HCHRS has received many threatening letters, some 
of which have included death threats aimed specifically at Ms. Sonja Biserko. 
On 30 September 2008, approximately 100 to 130 members of ultra right-wing organizations in 
Serbia such as Movement 1389 and Protest stood outside the offices of the HCHRS 
for 15 minutes shouting threats against members of the organization and, in particular, 
Ms. Sonja Biserko. A large cardboard swastika was left outside the offices after the group had 
gone. Movement 1389 has been protesting against the arrest of Mr. Radovan Karadzic, who is 
mentioned in the Annual Report of the HCHRS for 2007, for over 70 days. Movement 1389 is 
also reportedly responsible for vandalizing HCHRS property. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 388 
 
</p>
<p>2243. On 2 October 2008, Ms. Sonja Biserko&#8217;s address and private details about her family 
were published by the newspaper Tabloid in an article about her. Further private information 
about her has been published on Tabloid&#8217;s website and the newspaper has referred to her as a 
&#8220;traitor of the homogeneous Serbianhood&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2244. Concern was expressed that the intimidation and harassment against Ms. Sonja Biserko 
and the HCHRS may be related to their legitimate activities in investigating and exposing 
violations of human rights in Serbia. Serious concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Sonja Biserko, as well all other members of the HCHRS. 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2245. On 15 December 2008, the Government replied to the letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteurs. In its response, the Government provided the following information: 
</p>
<p>2246. &#8220;Ms. Sonja Biserko filed, through her lawyer, to the District Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 
Belgrade criminal charges against Ms. Milica Grabez, journalist of the &#8220;Tabloid&#8221; daily 
newspaper. The charges were filed for criminal endangerment of safety punishable under 
Article 67, paragraph 2, in conjunction with paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of 
Serbia and instigation of ethnic, racial or religious hatred punishable under Article 134, 
paragraph 1, of the Basic Criminal Law. Regarding this case, a decision was brought that there 
were no grounds for initiating proceedings. This information was communicated to 
Ms. Biserko&#8217;s lawyer on 14 December 2005. After the criminal charges had been 
dismissed by the District Public Prosecutor, her lawyer was able to take on criminal 
prosecution and institute criminal proceedings before the District Court and the Municipal 
Court in Belgrade. 
</p>
<p>2247. According to the report made by the Police Department of the City of Belgrade, with 
regard to the case No. Ktr 2305/07 of the Fourth Municipal Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 
Belgrade, an unknown person broke opened the letter-box at the entrance to the building where 
Ms. Biserko lives and a sticker with the English text saying &#8220;a safe house for Ratko Mbdic&#8221; was 
affixed on the door to her flat. An extensive photographic documentation was submitted together 
with the report on CS investigation. However, by the date of submission of the report the 
Republic Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, no perpetrators had been identified. Representatives of the 
Helsinki Committee also filed criminal charges to the same Prosecutor&#8217;s Office regarding this 
case. 
</p>
<p>2248. Criminal charges were filed to the First Municipal Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office under 
No. Ktr.281/2008 against unknown persons (Yugoslav Liberation Resistance Movement), which 
were referred, on 12 February 2007, to the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Serbia, 
Department of Public Peace and Order, for the purpose of collection of relevant information. In 
the case No. Ktn.2900/06, the charges brought against unknown persons (&#8220;Liberators of Serbia&#8221; 
were referred to the Serbian Ministry of Interior for the purpose of collection of necessary 
information. In the case No. Ktr.1867/07. Criminal charges were filed against unknown persons 
on 15 March 2007. In this case, Ms. Biserko was summoned on two occasions, 
on 12 October 2007 and 24 September 2008. In the case No. Ktr.20S8/08, a communication on 
criminal charges was received on 21 October 2008 and the person the charges were filed against 
was Dr. Mihailo Popovic. </p>

<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 28 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2250. The Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation regarding the reported arrest of four 
journalists and a technician during a raid carried out in the premises of a radio station 
on 17 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>2251. According to information received, in the morning of 17 April heavily armed police 
raided privately-owned FM radio-station &#8220;Radio voice of Peace&#8221; in Mogadishu; they reportedly 
ordered the evacuation of its premises and closed down the station. It is further reported that 
during the raid, four journalists, Shafi&#8217;i Muhidin Islow, editor-in-chief; Abdikamil Yusuf 
Mohamud, reporter; Mohammed Ali Boston, reporter; and Mohammed Kafi Ali, reporter, and a 
technician, Ibrahim Abdi Hassan, were arrested and detained by the Criminal Investigation 
Department (CID) until the evening of 17 April. Although the reasons for the raid and the arrests 
were not officially disclosed, reports indicate that they may be linked to the radio station&#8217;s 
coverage on 16 April of an attack by insurgents in the K4 area in Mogadishu. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>2252. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 28 April 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2253. On 29 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding 
Mr. Abdifatah Mohamed Elmi a Somali photojournalist and freelance journalist, 
Ms. Amanda Lindhout, a journalist from Canada and Mr. Nigel Brennan, a journalist from 
Australia. 
</p>
<p>2254. According to information received, on 23 August 2008, Mr. Abdifatah Mohamed Elmi, 
Ms. Amanda Lindhout and Mr. Nigel Brennan were abducted by unknown gunmen while 
travelling with their driver, identified as Mahad, along the Afgoye-Mogadishu road, located 
approximately 17 kilometres north of Mogadishu. The group had been on their way back from 
visiting a refugee camp at Afgoye, not far from the capital, where they interviewed individuals 
living in the camp. The alarm was raised when the group did not return to their hotel in 
Mogadishu that afternoon. The current whereabouts of Mr. Abdifatah Mohamed Elmi, 
Ms. Amanda Lindhout, Mr. Nigel Brennan and their driver are unknown. However, it is believed 
that they may have been held in the north eastern village of Suqa Holaha, before being moved to 
Jowhar, a town 90 kilometres north of the capital. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 390 
 
</p>
<p>2255. The reasons for the abduction of these journalists are still unclear and no demands have 
apparently been made. However reports claim that their abduction appears to have been a 
well-planned operation. To date no group has admitted responsibility for the kidnapping. 
Mogadishu&#8217;s interim mayor, Mr. Mohamed Osman Ali, has reportedly condemned the abduction 
and has initiated an investigation into the incident. 
</p>
<p>2256. While the reported investigation into the abovementioned events was welcomed, serious 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdifatah Mohamed 
Elmi, Ms. Amanda Lindhout, Mr. Nigel Brennan and their driver. Further concern is expressed 
that the abovementioned incident may represent a direct attempt to prevent independent 
reporting in Somalia.

</b></p>
<p>2258. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering 
terrorism, sent a communication concerning the case of Mr. N. Jasikaren, a former journalist 
with the Tamil language bi-monthly &#8220;Sariniher&#8221; and journalist with the web news service 
&#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221; and owner of the Outreach Multimedia and E-Kwality Graphics, a printing 
press; Ms. Valarmathi Jasikaren, his wife; Mr. J.S. Tissanaygam, journalist with the &#8220;Sunday 
Times&#8221; and the &#8220;Daily Mirror&#8221; and chief editor of the &#8220;Northeastern - Herald&#8221; an 
English-language regional newspaper and &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; Mr. K. Wijayasinghe, a freelance 
journalist, who writes for the weekly newspaper &#8220;Ravaya&#8221;, the daily &#8220;Mawbima&#8221; and 
&#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; Mr. Udayen, a video editor for &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;; and Mr. A.G. Lasantha 
Ranga, a video journalist for &#8220;Outreachsl.com&#8221;. 
</p><p>2259. According to information received, Mr. N. Jasikaren was arrested by the Terrorist 
Investigation Department (TID) (a special police division that reports directly to the Secretary of 
the Ministry of Defence) at his office on the evening of 6 March 2008; during his arrest, his 
laptop and printed materials were seized by the TID. Mr. Jasikaren is being held at the TID 
offices in Colombo. Mr. Jasikaren&#8217;s wife, Valarmathi Jasikaren, a marketing officer with 
Maharaja Broadcasting, was arrested on 6 March at their home on the same day. Mr. Jasikaren 
was assaulted by TID officers. Valarmathi Jasikaren suffers from a liver disease and underwent 
surgery a few weeks ago, and there is no indication that she has access to her medication in 
custody. 
</p>
<p>2260. J.S. Tissanaygam and K. Wijayasinghe were arrested by TID officers on 7 March 
at 11:30 a.m. when they went to TID offices to inquire about the arrests of Mr. Jasikaren and his </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 391 
 
</p>
<p>wife. Mr. Tissanaygam was detained incommunicado until late in the evening of 7 March, when 
his family was informed of his whereabouts. Both men are being detained at the TID offices in 
Colombo. Mr. Tissanaygam and Mr. Wijayasinghe&#8217;s wives were allowed to visit them. 
</p><p>2261. Udayen was arrested at his home on 7 March. He was detained incommunicado until 
midnight and he is being held at the TID offices in Colombo. 
</p>
<p>2262. A.G. Lasantha Ranga was requested to report to the TID offices before 3 p.m. 
on 8 March. He has been detained since then at the TID offices in Colombo. Mr. Ranga&#8217;s wife 
visited him on 10 March. Mr. Ranga was threatened by TID officers in front of her, stating that if 
Mr. Ranga had seen how Jasikaren and Tissanayagam were tortured &#8220;he would die on the spot&#8221;. 
TID officers told her that she should not visit her husband with a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>2263. A seventh person, Mr. Siva Sivakumar, journalist and spokesperson for the Free Media 
Movement and chief editor of the Tamil-language newspapers &#8220;Sarinher&#8221; and &#8220;Adhavan&#8221;, was 
also arrested on 8 March 2008. He was, however, released after a detention period of 12 hours 
during which a statement was taken from him. TID officers had gone to his home on the evening 
of 7 March to arrest him, but took his cousin into custody instead as he was absent. TID officers 
informed Mr. Sivakumar&#8217;s relatives that his cousin would be released when he presents himself 
to TID offices, which he did in the morning of 8 March. 
</p>
<p>2264. With regard to the above persons who have been arrested, detention orders have 
reportedly been prepared pursuant to Regulation 21 of the Emergency (Prevention and 
Prohibition of Terrorism and Specified Terrorist Activities) Regulations No. 7 of 2006. 
However, to date none of the accused have seen the detention order. It is also not clear if it was 
the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence or a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the police who 
issued detention orders in this case. If detention orders have been issued, the detainees must be 
brought before a magistrate at least once every 30 days, but this is only to verify that the person 
is still being detained. Magistrates have no power to question, cancel or renew a detention order. 
Only the person issuing the detention order - the Secretary of Defence or the DIG - can renew, 
amend or cancel it. 
</p>
<p>2265. With regard to the cases of Mr. Jasikaren and his wife, TID officials have issued receipts 
acknowledging their arrests and citing as a reason aiding and abetting terrorist activities. No 
information has yet been given concerning the reason for the detention of the remaining persons 
and their arrests and detention have not yet been acknowledged by the TID. However, a few 
weeks before the arrests, authorities proclaimed that some websites reporting on human rights 
violations were a hindrance to the ongoing war. 
</p>
<p>2266. All meetings with relatives were held in the presence of TID officers. None of the above 
cited persons were allowed access to legal counsel. With a view to the allegations of ill-treatment 
and threats of ill-treatment in detention, serious concerns were expressed as regards the physical 
and mental integrity of the above-mentioned persons. Further concern was expressed that the 
arrest and detention of the above-mentioned persons might be solely connected to their 
reportedly peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression. </p>

</b></p>
<p>2268. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the interrogation of staff of the Right to Life Centre, 
Law and Society Trust, Civil Monitoring Commission and Janasansadaya. 
</p>
<p>2269. According to the information received, on 12 July 2008, three persons from the Colombo 
Crime Division (CCD) went to the office of the Right to Life Centre and questioned two staff 
members about the history, objectives and details of their work. The questioning came as a 
result of the printing and distribution of two leaflets during a public demonstration on 
10 December 2007. The CCD officers requested the two staff members to go to the CCD office 
situated in Colombo 9 (Dematagoda), where they were questioned further. Information about the 
staff members and their families was also recorded. They were instructed to ensure that the 
leaders of all four organisations present themselves at the CCD office the next day. On 
13 July 2008, four representatives from the Right to Life Centre and Law and Society Trust went 
to the CCD office, where they were questioned for several hours on the information contained in 
the leaflet, details of the organisations and family information. 
</p>
<p>2270. Concern was expressed that the questioning of staff of the above mentioned organizations 
may be a form of harassment to discourage them from carrying out their legitimate work in 
defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2271. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
above. The Government reported that investigations were launched based on information 
received to the effect that the occupants of a vehicle were engaged in distributing pamphlets 
attempting to excite feelings of disaffection amongst the public in contempt of the administration 
of justice. The vehicle in question was searched by the security forces and police personnel, and 
a bundle of pamphlets, incriminating in nature, has been recovered. The owner of the vehicle 
stated that a person gave him the pamphlets when he stopped at a traffic light. The material in the 
pamphlet was provocative in nature, which would have aroused feelings of hatred towards 
security forces and the police. 
</p>
<p>2272. According to the details denoted in the pamphlet in its concluding page, readers were 
directed to the NGOs Right to Life; Law and Society Trust; Civil Monitoring Commission and 
Janasansadaya for inquiries. In terms of Regulation 29 of the Emergency Regulations, it would 
be an offence to publish any false statement likely to cause public alarm or disorder, creating 
communal tension. In the pamphlet in question certain statements have been made against the 
armed forces and the police and the activities in the performance of their duties. Therefore it was 
necessary to investigate the nature of the publication and to seek legal advice from the 
Attorney General. In the course of the police investigations no arrests or detention were made </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 393 
 
</p>
<p>and the investigators merely recorded statements. At no stage of the investigations were any 
threats or intimidations leveled on those who were subjected to questioning. The investigators 
conducted themselves within the law and had only performed their legitimate duties, which 
cannot be construed as harassment. The pamphlet, along with the statements, has been referred to 
the Attorney General for advice, which is awaited.

</b></p>
<p>2274. On 18 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning 
Mr. Namal Perera, a freelance Sinhala language journalist and deputy head of the advocacy 
section of the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI), a media rights advocacy group. 
</p>
<p>2275. According to information received, on 30 June 2008, at approximately 6.30 p.m., 
Mr. Namal Perera, was attacked by a group of unknown individuals as he travelled by car, along 
with an official from the British High Commission, between Narahenpita and Kirulapone. 
Reports claim that the car in which Mr. Namal Perera and his colleague were travelling was 
followed by men on two motorbikes, before being intercepted by a white van. Four individuals 
wielding iron bars reportedly stepped out of the van and proceeded to attack Mr. Namal Perera&#8217;s 
car, breaking the windows. The men attempted to drag Mr. Namal Perera from the car shouting 
that it was he that they were looking for. Mr. Perera managed to resist a potential abduction, 
however both he and his colleague were repeatedly beaten with metal bars before the attackers 
fled the scene. Mr. Namal Perera and his colleague were brought to Apollo hospital in Colombo 
where they were treated for their injuries. The aforementioned attack on Mr. Perera is allegedly 
linked to his work as a journalist, in particular recent articles he had written which criticised the 
government&#8217;s actions in its campaign against secessionist Tamil rebels. 
</p>
<p>2276. According to reports a cabinet sub-committee, to be chaired by 
Minister Sarath Amunugamato, has been appointed by the Government to address ongoing 
attacks against journalists and the police are reportedly investigating Mr. Perera&#8217;s case. While 
the establishment of the aforementioned sub-committee is welcomed concern is expressed that 
the attack on Mr. Perera may represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting in 
Sri Lanka, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country.

people. It was said that this campaign seeks to raise awareness of the abuses faced by people 
affected by ongoing military operations, particularly the lack of security, food, medicine and 
shelter. The CSM provides reportedly independent information on these matters. 
</p>
<p>2283. According to information received, on 12 October 2008, Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda was 
accused of distributing materials against the Government and the Armed Forces by the Deputy 
Minister of Ports and Aviation, a Member of Parliament from Negombo. The Deputy Minister of 
Ports and Aviation asked Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda to cease these activities in Negombo, because 
&#8220;his group&#8221; was misleading innocent people. According to the Deputy Minister of Ports and 
Aviation, such campaigns should not be carried out without previous consultation with him. 
These comments were later reported in a Sinhalese newspaper. 
</p>
<p>2284. On 13 October 2008, the Deputy Minister of Ports and Aviation condemned the CSM&#8217;s 
campaign at a public meeting in Negombo, referring specifically to Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda. The 
Deputy Minister stated that the Presidential Advisor, a Member of Parliament, as well as the 
Church authorities, had been informed of this condemnation. He asked the CSM to stop its 
campaign, claiming that Catholic priests would no longer be respected if they involved 
themselves in such campaigns. 
</p>
<p>2285. The same day the Deputy Minister of Ports and Aviations&#8217; statement was televised on the 
news by Independent Television Network (ITN), a State-owned television channel, as well as on 
two other television channels, Rupavahini and Eye TV. On 16 October 2008, at approximately 
7 p.m., the ITN news again condemned the CSM campaign. The news item and related video 
clips were also featured on the ITN webpage. No channel contacted the CSM for comments 
despite the contact details being made available by the leaflets which had given rise to the 
accusation against the CSM. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>2286. Concern was expressed that the accusation against Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda and the CSM 
may be directly related to their activities in raising awareness of human rights violations in 
Vanni. Given that four human rights groups were reportedly questioned, on 12 July 2008, about 
leaflets which they had distributed, further concern was expressed that the events described 
above may form part of an ongoing trend of restriction of freedom of expression in Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2287. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 22 October 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>2288. In a letter dated 28 July 2008, the Government responded to an urgent appeal 
of 4 May 2006. The Government reported that &#8220;the journalist, Ms. Sivaramaya Sivanathan, was 
arrested at the UNESCO World Press Freedom Day Conference. According to the Police, 
Ms. Sivaramaya Sivanathan had been arrested by the security officers when she had tried to enter 
the UNESCO World Press Freedom Day Conference held at the Bandaranayake Memorial 
International Conference Hall on 01.05.2006, without an invitation. Since only the invitees were 
allowed to participate in the conference, and she could not give a satisfactory explanation for her 
presence at the function, she was arrested and taken to the Cinnamon Gardens Police. 
Subsequently she was produced before the Magistrate&#8217;s court at Aluthkade and remained 
till 05.05.2006, pending completion of inquiry. After completion of inquiry, court has released 
her on 2 June 2006&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2289. In a letter dated 2 September 2008, the Government responded to a letter of allegations 
of 8 December 2006. The Government reported that &#8220;based on the reports received from the 
Brigade and the unit concerned, the contents of the leaflets were full of malice against the army, 
written with the aim of agitating the people and disrupting the government&#8217;s efforts at bringing 
normality to the area. The persons mentioned in the communication acknowledged that they used 
the young male and the female in question to distribute these leaflets. None of the suspects had 
been detained in an Army Camp as alleged in the communication nor is information recorded 
about a complaint made by the alleged victims to the Police seeking redress of their grievances. 
</p>

<p>2291. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
sent a communication regarding Mr. Afandy Farah Mohamed Issa, 41 years old, Ethiopian 
national, who has lived in Sudan since 2006 and is a member of a registered political party in 
Ethiopia called &#8220;Benishangul People&#8217;s Liberation Movement&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 396 
 
</p>
<p>2292. According to the information received, Mr. Afandy Farah Mohamed Issa was arrested 
on 22 September 2007 by members of the Sudanese Security Services in el-Showak in the 
eastern part of the country and detained in the prison of Dabak, in the north of Khartoum. Before 
entering the Sudan Mr. Issa spent two months in Asosa prison in Ethiopia for reasons of his 
political activities in the country. 
</p>
<p>2293. Since Mr. Issa was transferred to the custody of the immigration police in Khartoum 
on 4 February 2008 there are strong indications that his deportation to Ethiopia is imminent. Up 
to this date he has not been granted access to legal representation. 
</p>
<p>2294. Concerns were expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Issa should he be 
returned to Ethiopia and re-arrested and detained in connection with his reportedly peaceful 
political activities. 
</p>

<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 28 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2296. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning restrictions imposed on the 
Sudanese press. 
</p>
<p>2297. According to the information received, on 16 April 2008, Sudanese authorities prohibited 
the circulation of the following private newspapers: Al-Sudani, al-Ahdath, Ajras al-Huriya, 
al-Rai al-Shaab and the English language The Citizen. According to information received, the 
circulation of these newspapers was forbidden due to the publication of critical articles, 
including about censorship of the media by State authorities. 
</p>
<p>2298. The ban on the circulation of these newspapers is reportedly part of comprehensive 
restrictions on the media imposed on 6 February 2008. Since this date, agents of the National 
Security Service have been regularly visiting newspaper offices to review the contents of each 
edition prior to printing and distribution, removing articles that are deemed critical of State 
policies. This practice has reportedly contributed to removing references in the press concerning 
sensitive domestic and international events, including recent developments in Darfur and Chad. 
</p>
<p>2299. In a recent case, after several Arabic-language dailies reported the deaths of two 
detainees in police custody in Haj Yusif on 23 March, the Prosecutor for Press and Printed 
Material issued a public information ban on the incident. According to this prohibition, only 
information issued by the Office of the Police Spokesperson concerning this case is to be 
reported.

<p>2301. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a communication regarding the situation of 
Mr. Daoud Ahmed Altahier (chairperson of the Wadey Hauer University Students&#8217; Association, 
graduated from al-Ahlia University); Mr. Mohmed Ali Hmado (graduated from al-Nilen 
University); Mr. Esmail Ebaid Abakr (graduated from al-Nilen University); Mr. Adem Babkr

Mr. Mubark Bakhiet Ebrahim (student at al-Delng University); Mr. Mahmud Naiel Mohamed 
(graduated from al-Delng University); Mr. Khalid Ahmed Mansor (aged 16, high school student 
in al-Delng). 
</p>
<p>2302. According to information received, these nine Darfuri students, all members of the Sudan 
Liberation Movement, were arrested in a house in the Hay al-Buga area of the town of el-Obeid 
in Northern Kordofan state on 23 February 2008. The arrests took place in the context of the 
elections for the Kordofan University Students Union, after violence erupted between Darfuri 
students, who claimed that the elections were rigged, and students affiliated with the ruling 
National Congress Party. The nine were initially kept in the custody of the Security Agents 
Office for approximately 35 hours, and were then transferred to the Shortat al-Qism al-Awsat 
police station. The nine men were ill-treated while in the custody of the security services: in 
particular, Esmail Ebaid Abakr lost his eyesight for several days following severe beatings and 
Daoud Ahmed Altahier bore marks where he had been hung by a rope. 
</p>
<p>2303. Alfadel Omer Shamo, Mubark Bakhiet Ebrahim, Mahmud Naiel Mohamed and 
Khalid Ahmed Mansor were released without charges on 26 February, while the other five men 
were released on 4 March and charged with illegal possession of weapons, rioting and penalty of 
rioting under articles 67 and 68 of the 1991 Criminal Act. The court dismissed the first charge at 
a hearing on 14 March, and a second hearing scheduled to take place on 24 April to decide on 
the second charges was postponed to 22 May. If found guilty under articles 67 and 68 of the 
Criminal Act, they face imprisonment of up to six months or a fine or up to 20 lashes.

<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 18 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2305. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding the reinstatement of the practice 
of censorship of newspapers. 
</p>
<p>2306. According to the information received, in early February 2008, the practice of regular 
censorship of newspapers by officials of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) 
was reinstated, although there is no basis in Sudanese statutory law for such a measure.  
</p>
<p>2307. In May, June and July 2008, there were several reported incidents of censorship and 
intimidation of journalists in Khartoum, in particular with regard to coverage of the 10 May </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 398 
 
</p>
<p>attack on Ombudsman by the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the 14 July decision of 
the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to request an arrest warrant against  
President Omar Hassen Al Bashir on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>2308. According to reports, National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) censors have 
been visiting newspaper offices late in the evening - in some cases less than an hour before the 
paper would go to press - at a point when, if censored, newspaper publishers are unable to 
salvage the next day&#8217;s edition of the newspaper. The Arabic-language daily Ajrass Al Huriya, 
was reportedly prevented from printing and publishing on at least five occasions 
between 10 May and 10 June. When the NISS censors visited the paper on 16 May 2008, editors 
were reportedly told that the newspaper should stick to the &#8220;official line.&#8221; On 19 June 2008, 
Ajrass Al Huriya&#8217;s editors initiated a four-day publishing strike in protest over the censorship. 
Publication of the newspaper resumed on 24 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>2309. On 14 May 2008, the premises of the Arabic-language daily Alwan were searched by the 
NISS. The newspaper&#8217;s assets and materials were confiscated and its publication was suspended 
indefinitely on NISS orders. The measure was imposed on the same day that Alwan had 
published an article stating that a Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) aircraft had been allegedly shot 
down by JEM during the attack. 
</p>
<p>2310. On 18 May, Mr. Abdelmoniem Suleiman, a journalist from Ajrass Al Huriya, was 
summoned by NISS after the paper&#8217;s censored articles accompanied by criticism of NISS press 
censorship had been published on an internet news site. He was held at an NISS office 
from 18 May, 1.00 p.m. until 2.15 a.m. on the following day and interrogated at length about his 
personal life and political views, subjected to humiliation and ridicule, and told that he should 
stop writing for Sudanese newspapers. Prior to his release, he was told to sign a paper stating that 
he would not publicly report about the NISS or any of its officers. He was also told, under the 
threat of being killed, that he should not tell anyone what happened to him in detention. 
</p>
<p>2311. Mr. Attaf Mohamed Mukhtar Taha, a journalist who works for the Arabic-language daily 
Al Sudani, was detained by the NISS for four hours in the late evening of 26 May, because he 
defended an article which NISS officers had decided to censor. He was taken to an NISS office 
at 9.30 p.m. and was reportedly forced to stand for nearly four hours. The journalist was insulted 
as being &#8220;dirty&#8221; and in need of a washing. He was then reportedly forced to stand facing a wall 
with his hands raised while cold water and later sewage water were poured over his head. Before 
being released, he was required to provide the NISS with extensive personal information and his 
contact details.

of 74 journalists and ongoing censorship and intimidation of the media. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 399 
 
</p>
<p>2314. According to information received, on 17 November 2008, 74 journalists were arrested 
on the steps of the National Assembly in Omdurman. At approximately 10.30 a.m. 107 
journalists had reportedly gathered peacefully outside the National Assembly with the intention 
of delivering a petition in protest of ongoing censorship of the media. Shortly after their arrival, 
two large police trucks arrived at the scene. Reports claim that there was a police presence of 
approximately 200-400 police officers. Approximately 45 minutes later police officers reportedly 
began arresting the journalists by loading them onto the police trucks. The journalists were then 
taken to Al Genobi police station in the south of Omdurman, where the majority remained in 
detention until 4.30 p.m. 
</p>
<p>2315. Previously, in the early morning of 11 November 2008, approximately 200 police and 
security forces reportedly surrounded and blocked access to the Khartoum offices of 
Ajrass Al Huriya where a group of journalists from multiple Sudanese newspapers were planning 
to assemble later that day. During the course of the morning, a group of approximately 
100 journalists assembled peacefully inside the offices of the newspaper in preparation for a joint 
procession to the National Press Council to deliver a petition voicing the journalists&#8217; opposition 
to ongoing press censorship. The journalists decided not to go as a group but rather send a 
delegation of 20 of the most prominent journalists, who successfully departed the newspaper 
offices at 12.00 p.m. and reached the National Press Council without incident. A petition was 
submitted to the Constitutional Court on the same day by legal representatives for 
Ajrass Al Huriya. The remaining police and security departed the area at approximately 
6.15 p.m. No arrests are known to have been made and there was no mention of the day&#8217;s 
activities in any of the following day&#8217;s newspapers. 
</p>
<p>2316. On 18 November, ten Sudanese newspapers suspended publication following the incident 
the previous day, as part of a growing protest against state censorship. 
</p>
<p>2317. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events and reports of ongoing suspension 
of daily newspapers, printed newspaper editions and the confiscation of equipment, in addition to 
allegations of increased harassment, arrest, detention and interrogation of journalists may 
represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting in Sudan, thus stifling freedom of 
expression in the country.

rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
sent a communication regarding the situation of three human rights defenders, Messrs Amir 
Mohamed Suliman, Chairperson of the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights and Environmental 
Development (KCHRED), Abdel Monim Elgak, Regional Program Coordinator for the Strategic </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1

</p>
<p>Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), and Osman Ali Hummaida, human rights 
researcher and member of the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) Assembly of 
Delegates. Osman Ali Hummaida is also the former director of the London-based Sudanese 
Organization against Torture and a UK citizen. 
</p>
<p>2320. According to the information received, on 24 November 2008 at around noon, 
Abdel Monim Elgak and Osman Ali Hummaida were arrested by officers of the National 
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) outside the offices of the Sudanese non-governmental 
organization SIHA in Khartoum 3. On the same day, Amir Mohamed Suliman was also arrested 
by NISS officers. All three men were taken to the political department of the NISS in Bahri 
(Khartoum North) for interrogation and were reportedly questioned on their human rights 
activities, in particular suspected cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which 
is currently investigating a request by the prosecutor for an arrest warrant against the Sudanese 
President on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. 
</p>
<p>2321. Messrs Amir Mohamed Suliman and Abdel Monim Elgak were released without charge 
in the evening of 24 November and early hours of 25 November respectively. On 25 November, 
Abdel Monim Elgak made a statement to a Sudanese online news outlet in which he criticized 
the arrests as a means to seek to intimidate Sudanese human rights defenders. That day, the NISS 
summoned him once more and detained him until the early hours of 26 November. About two 
hours after his release he was again arrested and detained until the early hours of the following 
day. Amir Mohamed Suliman and Abdel Monim Elgak were both summoned to return to the 
NISS office on 27 November at 11 a.m. to hand over bags and computers which NISS officers 
said they needed to examine. Amir Mohamed Suliman turned in the equipment and was allowed 
to leave. 
</p>
<p>2322. Mr. Osman Ali Hummaida remained in detention without charge and without contact 
with the outside world until 1 a.m. on 28 November, at which point he was released without 
charge. On the day after his arrest members of his family brought clothes and medicine for his 
asthma and high blood pressure to the office of the NISS but were not allowed to see him. 
</p>
<p>2323. On 25 and 26 November, both Abdel Monim Elgak and Osman Ali Hummaida were 
reportedly subjected to different forms of torture and other ill-treatment in order to force them to 
hand over their computers and other belongings which the NISS officers sought to confiscate. 
They were asked repeatedly whether they had cooperated with the ICC prosecutor and told to 
disclose details of information passed on to the prosecutor&#8217;s office. Abdel Monim Elgak was 
reportedly so severely beaten on various parts of his body, including his head, and subjected to 
other forms of ill-treatment that he required medical treatment following his release. In an 
apparent effort to force Osman Ali Hummaida to turn over his electronic equipment, he was 
reportedly made to witness Abdel Monim El Gak being beaten and ill-treated so severely that he 
vomited. 
</p>
<p>2324. Osman Ali Hummaida was reportedly also subjected to beatings with black plastic pipes 
on his shins and feet, humiliated and subjected to serious threats, such as the threat of rape. He 
was detained in different detention facilities of the NISS in Khartoum, blindfolded during 
transports between detention facilities and subjected to sleep deprivation and 18-hour long </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 401 
 
</p>
<p>interrogations. During the fourth day of his detention he was reportedly twice hospitalized in the 
Amal hospital belonging to the NISS because his blood pressure had increased so severely that it 
required to be treated. Doctors in the hospital reportedly did not respond to his complaints that he 
had been subjected to beatings and sleep deprivation in NISS detention. 
</p><p>2325. In view of the reports of torture used on Mr. Osman Ali Hummaida and 
Mr. Abdel Monim Elgak and the medical condition of the latter, grave concern was expressed 
for the physical and mental integrity of the three human rights defenders. Further concern was 
expressed that the arrest and interrogation of Messrs Amir Mohamed Suliman, Abdel Monim 
Elgak and Osman Ali Hummaida may be linked to their non-violent activities in defence of 
human rights.

also a member of the network called &#8220;Committees for the Revival of the Civil Society (CRCS)&#8221;, 
which engages in human rights related and political discussions. 
</p>
<p>2328. According to the information received, on 3 January 2008, Mr. Sara was arrested by the 
security forces after appearing in response to a summons. His detention is believed to be related 
to his participation in a meeting of the National Council of the network &#8220;Damascus Declaration 
for Democratic National Change&#8221; held on 1 December 2007, which called for democratic change 
and political openness in Syria, and statements related thereto made by Mr. Sara during a TV 
programme on 1 January 2008. Moreover, Mr. Sara is the eighth signatory of the &#8220;Damascus 
Declaration&#8221; who are being detained by the authorities without any specific reasons given. He is 
being held incommunicado without charge and access to legal counsel or his family at the 
detention facilities of the State Security Branch in Damascus. Mr. Sara is suffering from a 
malfunctioning thyroid gland which requires constant observation and medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>2329. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Sara may be related to his

the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 8 January 2008 - following a series of arrests, 
on 9 December 2007, of over forty human rights defenders and political activists on the part of 
the Syrian State Security Services. 
</p>
<p>2332. According to information received, the arrests allegedly took place following a meeting 
of 163 activists in Damascus on 1 December 2007. The meeting was reportedly organised by the 
Damascus Declaration for Democratic and National Change to address the issue of political 
reform in Syria, and resulted in the creation of the National Council of the Damascus 
Declaration, a collective movement of political activists and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>2333. On 2 January 2008, Syrian security forces allegedly arrested Mr. Rashid Satouf, who was 
released on 5 January. Subsequently, on January 7, 2008, the security forces summoned 
Mr. Mohammed Haj Darwish, member of the Human Rights Association in Syria and a founding 
member of the Committees for Revitalizing Civil Society in Syria, to the state security offices in 
Damascus, and later arrested him. To date, no charges have been made against any of the nine 
men detained, nor have they appeared before a court.

The Government noted that the persons mentioned in the communication were engage in 
activities prohibited in the Syrian Arab Republic under ordinary law, which was established 
in 1949. The interviews with these persons confirmed that they had violated the regulations and 
laws in force in the Syrian Arab Republic. The facts were confirmed in writing in their 
confessions, during the police inquiry and also during the examination conducted by the 
investigating judge in the presence of their defence lawyers. The Damascus Public Prosecutor 
instituted proceedings against them under ordinary law. </p>

offence of membership of an unauthorized association, the object of which is to alter the 
character of the State, and that they had issued a statement which aimed to incite sectarian and 
racial conflict and spread false information. They did so under the cover of disseminating 
democratic ideas, whereas in fact they violated articles 206, 285, 286 and 327 of the Criminal 
Code of 1949, as amended. On the basis of the above, the investigating judge in Damascus took 
the decision to refer the case to the judge to indict them for the aforementioned crimes. The 
indictment division judge referred the case to the Damascus Criminal Court for trial. Since the 
decision of the judge is subject to appeal, their defence counsel appealed it and the case is under 
consideration before the Trial Division of the Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p>2337. The legal basis for their continued detention is the aforementioned indictment decision. 
Syrian law provides, in such cases, that they must be remanded in custody and brought for trial 
before the criminal court in the first instance. That court then considers whether to release them 
at its discretion. Consequently, they are not in arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>2338. In conclusion, the Government confirmed that all the prosecution, investigation and 
judicial procedures relating to these persons have been conducted in accordance with the 
regulations and general laws in force in the Syrian Arab Republic, which are in accordance with 
international standards and norms.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 4 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2340. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture, sent an 
urgent appeal concerning Mr. Marwan al-&#8217;Ush, geology engineer, Mr. Riad Seif, former member 
of the Syrian parliament and &#8216;Damascus Spring&#8217; figurehead, Mr. Mohammed Haj Darwish, a 
member of the Human Rights Association in Syria and a founding member of the Committees 
for Revitalizing Civil Society in Syria, Dr. Ahmad Tohme, dentist, Mr. Fayez Sarah, a journalist 
and founding member of the Committees for Revitalising Civil Society in Syria, 
Dr. Walid al-Bunni, Mr. Jaber al-Shoufi, member of the executive board of the Committees for 
the Defence of Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, Mr. Akram al-Bunni, a member and 
founder of the Committee for the Revitalization of Civil Society in Syria and 
Mr. Ali al-Abdullah, founder-member and member respectively of the Committee for the 
Revitalisation of Civil Society in Syria, Dr. Fida al-Hurani, recently elected President of the 
National Council of the Damascus Declaration, and Dr, Yasser Tayser Aleiti, an intellectual. The 
latter nine individuals had been the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression on 11 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>2341. According to information received, on 15 January 2007, Mr. Marwan al-&#8217;Ush was 
arrested by State Security officials. Since then, Mr. Riad Seif has also been detained. Both men, 
along with all the aforementioned persons, attended a meeting of 163 activists in Damascus </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 404 
 
</p>
<p>on 1 December 2007, reportedly organized by the Damascus Declaration for Democratic and 
National Change to address the issue of political reform in Syria. The meeting resulted in the 
creation of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration, a collective movement of political 
activists and human rights defenders calling for establishing a democratic system that respects 
citizens&#8217; rights, ensures freedom of speech and association, and ends discrimination based on 
religious or political beliefs. 
</p>
<p>2342. On 27 January 2008, Mr. Walid al-Bunni, Mr. Yasser al-&#8217;Eiti, Dr. Fida&#8217; al-Horani, 
Mr. Akram al-Bunni, Mr. Ahmad To&#8217;meh, Mr. Jabr al-Shoufi, Mr. Ali al-&#8217;Abdullah, 
Fayez Sarah, and Mr. Marwan al-&#8217;Ush were all reportedly transferred to &#8216;Adra prison in 
Damascus. Dr. Fida&#8217;a al-Horani was then transferred to the women&#8217;s prison in Douma, on the 
outskirts of Damascus. Mr. Riad Seif was also transferred to &#8216;Adra prison following his 
appearance before the investigating judge on 29 January 2008. The detainees have reportedly 
been detained on charges including &#8220;weakening national sentiments&#8221; &#8220;broadcasting false or 
exaggerated news which would affect the morale of the country&#8221;, and joining an &#8220;organization 
formed with the purpose of changing the financial or social status of the state&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2343. All those detained are reported to have been ill-treated while in the custody of State 
Security officials at their base in Damascus; Mr. Ali al-&#8217;Abdullah is alleged to have been so 
severely beaten that he sustained a serious injury to his oesophagus and it is not known if he has 
received medical treatment. Furthermore, Mr. Riad Seif is reported to be suffering from 
advanced prostate cancer and urgently requires specialist treatment only available outside Syria. 
</p>
<p>2344. Serious concern was expressed that the latest arrest and detention of Mr. Marwan al-&#8217;Ush 
and Mr. Riad Seif, as well as the charges brought against all the detainees, may be directly 
related to their activities in defence of human rights, particularly the exercise of their right to 
freedom of expression and association. In view of reports of ill-treatment and the ill-health of 
Mr. Riad Seif, further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity while 
in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2345. In a letter dated 1 July 2008, the Government responded to the communication above as 
well as the communication sent on 11 January 2008. The content of the reply is summarized 
above.

<p>2347. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a communication regarding 
Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi, aged 48, and Ms. Kawthar Taifour, aged 50, both members of the Kurdish 
minority in the Syrian Arab Republic. According to the information received, Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 405 
 
</p>
<p>and Ms. Kawthar Taifour were arrested by members of State Security Services on 
28 November 2007. Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi was arrested at 4 a.m. at her home in &#8216;Ein al-&#8217;Arab 
(Qoubani); the place and exact time of the arrest of Ms. Kawthar Taifour is not known. Both 
women are believed to be currently held in incommunicado detention at the women&#8217;s wing of 
al-Maslamieh Prison in Aleppo without charge or trial. Both do not have access to legal counsel 
or contact with their families. They are being held together with convicted criminals and pre-trial 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>2348. Syrian authorities have not yet disclosed any reason for their arrest and detention. It is 
believed that these measures might be linked to non-violent demonstrations by members of the 
Kurdish minority of Syria on 2 November 2007 in the cities of Qamishli and &#8216;Ein al-&#8217;Arab 
(Qoubani). 
</p>
<p>2349. Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour are members of an organisation calling itself 
&#8220;Democratic Union Party (PYD)&#8221;, which is not authorised in Syria. Ms. Aisha Afandi&#8217;s husband, 
Mr. Saleh Muslim, is a leading member of the &#8220;PYD&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2350. Ms. Afandi suffers from a brain cyst which affects blood flow to the brain and which can 
cause a loss of consciousness, especially in stressful situations. 
</p>
<p>2351. In view of their reported incommunicado detention, concern was expressed with respect 
to the physical and mental integrity of Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour. Further 
concern was expressed as regards Ms. Afandi&#8217;s state of health in detention. Finally, concern was 
raised that Ms. Afandi&#8217;s and Ms. Taifour&#8217;s arrest and detention might be solely connected to 
their reportedly peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression and their 
right to association, in defence of human rights of Kurds in Syria. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2352. In a letter dated 3 April 2009, the Government replied to the communication above. In its 
response, the Government provided the following information: 
</p>
<p>2353. These two women were arrested for stirring up unrest in the town of Ayn al-Arab in the 
Aleppo governorate. They were detained in Aleppo Central Prison, in women&#8217;s ward 4, where 
women accused of the same class of offences are held. Contrary to the allegation transmitted to 
the Office of the High Commissioner, the women were not held in incommunicado detention and 
were neither of them subjected to ill-treatment; the law safeguards their rights and deals severely 
with persons who violate the rights of women, even if they are in prison and on trial for various 
offences. 
</p>
<p>2354. The two women appeared before an Aleppo court on 20 August 2008 following an 
inquiry that was conducted in accordance with the due process norms laid down in the 
Constitution and Syrian law. The case and investigation files were deposited with the military 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, which is the legal authority with jurisdiction for the offences with which the 
women were charged, namely, stirring up sectarian strife and unrest. The two women were 
brought to the military prosecutor&#8217;s office on 21 August 2008 and were charged with the 
aforementioned offences. The case was filed with the chief judge of the lower military court in 
Aleppo before whom the two women appeared for examination on 22 August 2008. At the end </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 406 
 
</p>
<p>of the hearing, the judge decided to discharge the women and the decision was carried out that 
very day. The judge continues to review the rest of the case against the two women. If the 
proceedings had not been conducted fairly and transparently and the two women had received no 
assistance, the judge would not have released them at the first hearing. Thus, there is no truth to 
any of the allegations transmitted to the Office of the High Commissioner, including those 
concerning arbitrary detention and denial of freedom of expression and the exercise of rights. 
</p>
<p>2355. The Syrian authorities, furthermore, verified the legality of the arrest procedures and 
found no evidence that the rights and freedoms of the two women had been infringed or that the 
women had been placed in arbitrary detention or subjected to mental or physical torture or any 
other serious violation. The two women are Syrian nationals, who were given a legal hearing 
consistent with the international standards and norms laid down in the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Neither the families 
nor the legal representatives of the two women filed any complaints with the Syrian authorities 
before or after the letter from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights arrived. 
</p>
<p>2356. As for the health of the two women, we should point out that the laws on prisons in the 
Syrian Arab Republic stipulate that health and medical care must be provided for all persons in 
detention. All prisoners receive free medical attention as soon as they enter prison. When 
Ms. Afandi arrived at the prison, the doctor of the prisoners&#8217; welfare association diagnosed her 
as suffering from an inflamed right ear, and treated her regularly throughout her time in 
detention. This was treatment that she had not received beforehand. Ms. Tayfur was diagnosed as 
suffering from diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis pain and chest pains. She also had a condition 
known as &#8220;Aleppo boil&#8221; (leishmaniasis of the skin) and received free treatment for these 
conditions throughout the time that she spent in prison. Contrary to the information given to the 
Office of the High Commissioner, she did not complain of suffering from psychological trauma 
or epilepsy. 
</p>
<p>2357. We also refer to the information at the beginning of the letter from the Office of the 
High Commissioner stating that Ms. Afandi and Ms. Tayfur are members of the Kurdish 
minority. There is no such designation in the Syrian Arab Republic; these two women are Syrian 
nationals and there is no reference in their identity cards or other papers, or those of any Syrian 
citizen, to membership of a minority or a majority. Everyone is equal before the law and no 
reference is ever made to a person&#8217;s race, religion or confessional group&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>2359. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent a communication concerning Mr. Mazen Darwish, head of the Syrian 
Centre for Media Freedom and Freedom of Expression. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 407 
 
</p>
<p>2360. According to the information received, on 12 January 2008, Mr. Darwish was detained 
for three days after publishing a report on riots that occurred in Damascus, criticizing the alleged 
failure of security agencies to protect civilians killed on that occasion. After his detention, 
Mr. Darwish was accused of &#8220;libelling and defaming the states&#8217; bodies&#8221;, following a complaint 
made by the police station in the Damascus suburb of Adra. He appeared before a military 
tribunal on 17 March, when it was decided that his trial before a military court would take place 
on 15 April. 
</p>
<p>2361. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Darwish and the charges 
against him may be related to his non-violent activities in defence of human rights, in particular 
the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

</b></p>
<p>2363. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent a communication regarding Karam Ibrahim Yousef. Mr. Karam Ibrahim Yousef 
is a writer and human rights defender active in defence of the human rights of the Kurdish 
community in Syria. 
</p>
<p>2364. According to information received, on 20 March 2008, Karam Ibrahim Yousef was shot 
in the head by Syrian Security Forces whilst he was photographing the national Kurdish 
celebrations of their traditional new year in the city of Qamishli. Due to his injuries he had to be 
hospitalized. His health condition remains critical. 
</p>
<p>2365. Karam Ibrahim Yousef has been interrogated repeatedly by the authorities, but no 
charges have been brought against him. 
</p>
<p>2366. Concern was expressed that the attack against Mr. Karam Ibrahim Yousef may be related 
to his peaceful human rights activities, in particular his work to defend the rights of the Syrian 
Kurdish community. Further concern was expressed that this attack may constitute part of a trend 
of escalating intimidation and acts of hostility against human rights defenders in Syria.

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a communication regarding 
Mohammed Badih al-Bab, a member of the National Organisation for Human Rights in Syria, a 
non-governmental organization which promotes human rights. 
</p>
<p>2369. According to the information received, on 2 March 2008 Mohammed Badih al-Bab 
received a summons and was subsequently arrested by military security forces in Damascus. 
Mohammed Badih al-Bab is currently in detention, but his exact whereabouts are unknown. He 
has been denied access to a lawyer and is not allowed any visitors. No charges have yet been 
brought against him. 
</p>
<p>2370. The reasons for his arrest remain unclear, but it appears that he received the summons 
following articles he has recently written, in which he criticised the Minister for Information, 
Mr. Mohsen Bilal. In 2000, Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab was sentenced to 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment. He was released in 2005 following a presidential amnesty. 
</p>
<p>2371. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab 
might be solely connected to his peaceful activities in defending human rights and the exercise of 
his right to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the reported incommunicado detention 
of Mohammed Badih al-Bab at an unknown place of detention, further concerns were expressed 
that he might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>2373. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a communication concerning 
Mr. Ahmed Al Haji Al Khalaf, a member of the Syrian branch of the Arab Organisation for 
Human Rights (AOHR). 
</p>
<p>2374. According to information received, on 22 April 2008, Mr. Ahmed Al Haji Al Khalaf was 
sentenced to 5 days imprisonment by the Military Tribunal of Raka (the North-east of the Syrian 
Arab Republic) for &#8220;defamation&#8221; and &#8220;weakening the moral of the State&#8221;. Mr. Ahmed Al Haji 
Al Khalaf was sentenced after having published an article criticizing the lack of transparency and 
democracy in the functioning and the decision-making process of the Department of Education 
in Raka. Mr. Al Khalaf was released after the five days. 
</p>
<p>2375. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Ahmed Al Haji Al Khalaf may be 
directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2376. In a letter dated 29 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 8 May 2008. The Government reported that Mr. al-Khalaf was sentenced to 10 days&#8217; 
imprisonment for defaming a public authority. The sentence was commuted to 5 days&#8217; 
imprisonment after mitigating factors had been taken into account. Mr. al-Khalaf was released 
after serving his sentence. 
</p>
<p>2377. The sentence handed down to Mr. al-Khalaf was delivered according to the procedures 
and laws pertaining to trials and offences, and the defendant&#8217;s right to freedom of opinion and 
expression was not infringed. Articles 378 and 244 of the General Criminal Code reflect 
provisions found in French law and many other laws throughout the world; they are not 
incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p>2379. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
sent a communication concerning Mr. Habib Salih, a writer and pro-democracy campaigner. 
Mr. Habib Salih was the subject of a communication sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture on the 8 June 2005 which to date regrettably remains without a reply from Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p>2380. According to the information received, on 9 May 2008, Mr. Habib Salih was arrested at 
the market in Tartus. No reason was given for his arrest, but it is believed that it is related to 
articles he wrote that were published on websites, among them the website Elaph 
(www.elaph.com), which is currently censored. On 25 July 2007, Telecommunications Minister 
Amr Salen reportedly ordered website owners to keep personal details of all writers publishing 
articles on their sites. 
</p>
<p>2381. Mr. Habib Salih has been arrested twice before in relation to his human rights activities. 
In 2002, he was sentenced to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment and was released on 9 September 2004. 
On 15 August 2006, he was sentenced to another 3 years&#8217; imprisonment under article 286 of the 
criminal code for &#8220;publishing false news&#8221; after accusing the Government of corruption and a 
lack of respect for human rights. He was then released on 12 September 2007. 
</p>
<p>2382. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention might be solely connected to 
Mr. Habib Salih&#8217;s peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular his work in 
promoting democracy and freedom of expression in the country. In view of the reported 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Habib Salih at an unknown place of detention, further concerns 
were expressed for his physical and psychological integrity while in detention. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2383. In a letter dated 20 October 2008, the Government responded to the above 
communication. The Government informed that Mr. Salih used the media to disseminate false 
information and incite sectarian strife, thus provoking chaos and unrest. These acts are 
punishable under the Syrian Criminal Code. Mr. Salih admitted the charges, which were based 
on solid facts and evidence, and was duly brought before the courts. The Office of the Public 
Prosecutor brought a public interest case against him under articles 285, 298, 307 and 377 of the 
Criminal Code for crimes punishable by law, including disseminating false information likely to 
provoke chaos and unrest. 
</p>
<p>2384. The investigating judge interviewed Mr. Salih in the presence of his defence lawyers. The 
case remains before the Syrian courts, which are the final authority in the matter, no party has a 
right to intervene in their work. The proceedings against Mr. Salih were taken in accordance with 
the law and international norms and criteria. Mr. Salih was arrested not because of his human 
rights activities, as Al-Sadr claims, but because he committed criminal acts. Moreover, his 
detention is not arbitrary but lawful. He is in excellent health and undergoes periodic free 
medical examinations. He has the right to periodic visits, receives excellent food and care and is 
provided with all services free of charge. Any complaints or grievances that Mr. Salih might 
have would be investigated by the relevant authorities.

the National Organisation for Human Rights in Syria. 
</p>
<p>2387. According to information received, on 29 June 2008, Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab 
received a sentence of six months&#8217; imprisonment after having been charged for potentially 
harming the state by &#8220;broadcasting false news&#8221; under article 287 of the Syrian Penal Code. 
On 2 March 2008, he was arrested after having written articles which criticised the Minister for 
Information. In 2000, Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab had previously been sentenced to fifteen 
years&#8217; imprisonment but was released in 2005 after a presidential amnesty. 
</p>
<p>2388. Concern was expressed that the imprisonment of Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab may be

the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent a communication concerning 
Mr. Hammam Haddad, a university student, author of a magazine and writer of Internet articles. 
</p>
<p>2391. According to information received, on 5 May 2008 Mr. Hammam Haddad was arrested at 
his home in Damascus by state security forces. Although no reason was given for his arrest it is 
believed that it was carried out to prevent him from further giving publicity to cases of human 
rights violations in the Syrian Arab Republic in his publications. Mr. Haddad&#8217;s current 
whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>2392. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Hammam Haddad may be 
related to his work in the defense of human rights, in particular his work to expose human rights 
violations in the Syrian Arab Republic. In view of his reported incommunicado detention at an 
unknown location, concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of

<p>2394. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning restrictions imposed on the 
Syrian newspapers Al-Hayat and Al Moujtama&#8217;a Al-Iktisadi. 
</p><p>2395. According to information received, on 15 July 2008, Syrian authorities prohibited the 
distribution of the London-based daily Al Hayat. The distribution of this newspaper was 
reportedly forbidden due to the publication of an article written by Saudi journalist 
Mr. Daoud Al-Sharayan. The aforementioned article allegedly criticised the position taken by 
President Bashar el-Assad during his recent trip to France for the launch of the Union for the 
Mediterranean. Furthermore, in February 2008 the government had banned circulation of the 
magazine Al Moujtama&#8217;a Al-Iktisadi for reporting that several Syrian leaders had dual 
citizenship, with their second passport often being either American or Canadian. 
</p>
<p>2396. The ban on the circulation of these newspapers is reportedly part of comprehensive 
restrictions on the media imposed by the Government. Agents of the National Security Service 
have reportedly been visiting newspaper offices on a regular basis to review the contents of each 
edition prior to printing and distribution, removing articles that are deemed critical of State

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>2399. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
sent a communication concerning Mr. Hammam Haddad, a human rights defender, author of a 
magazine and writer. Mr. Hammam Haddad had been the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
on 16 July 2008 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>2400. According to the new information received, on 7 September 2008 Mr. Hammam Haddad 
was reportedly arrested by state security forces without an arrest warrant. The reason for his 
arrest is unknown, and he is held in an unknown location. On 5 May 2008 Mr. Hammam Haddad 
was arrested at his home in Damascus by state security forces. He was released on 28 July 2008 
without charges. 
</p>
<p>2401. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Hammam Haddad may be 
related to his work in the defense of human rights, in particular his work to expose human rights 
violations in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>

<p>2403. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent a 
communication regarding the travel ban imposed against Mr. Akhtam Naisse, a lawyer, a 
founding member of the Committee for the Defense of Democratic Liberties and Human Rights 
in Syria (CDF), Director of the Cham Centre for Democratic and Human Rights Studies in Syria, 
and winner of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2005. 
</p>
<p>2404. Communications were sent in relation to Mr. Akhtam Naisse by various mandate-holders 
on 15 November 2001, 16 February 2004, 9 March 2004, 11 June 2004, and 6 August 2004. A 
response from your Government was received on 20 September 2004. 
</p>
<p>2405. According to new information received, on 14 October 2008, Mr. Akhtam Naisse 
attempted to travel to the United Arab Emirates but was prevented from boarding the plane at 
Damascus Airport. He was detained for over two and a half hours by security forces at the 
airport. In the United Arab Emirates he was scheduled to participate in a regional human rights 
forum in conjunction with the fifth session of the Forum for the Future, an annual meeting which </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 413 
 
</p>
<p>focuses on political reform and sustainable development and is organized by the Group of Eight 
(G8) nations as well as Middle East and North African nations. The authorities reportedly told 
Mr. Akhtam Naisse that the travel ban had been imposed against him because various security 
forces are looking for him. 
</p>
<p>2406. Earlier in 2008, travel bans were imposed against various human rights defenders in 
Syria. For instance, between 16 and 19 April 2008, Messrs. Rasim Al Atasy, Mahmoud Maree 
and Ahmed Manjonah were prevented from traveling and subsequently could not attend the 
general meeting of the Arab Organisation for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2407. Concern was expressed that the imposition of the travel ban against Mr. Akhtam Naisse 
may be directly related to his activities in the defense of human rights. Further concern is 
expressed that this may form part of an ongoing trend of harassment against human rights 
defenders in Syria. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2408. In a letter dated 8 April 2009, the Government replied to the above communication. At

<p>2409. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent a communication concerning the sentencing of Dr. Fida al-Hurani, 
President of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for Democratic and National 
Change; Mr. Ali al-Abdullah, a member of the Committee for the Revitalization of Civil Society 
in Syria; Mr. Akram al-Bunni, a founding member of the Committee for the Revitalization of 
Civil Society in Syria; Mr. Riad Seif; Mr. Fayez Sarah, a journalist and founding member of the

member of the executive board of the Committee for the Defense of Freedoms and Human 
Rights in Syria; Dr. Walid al-Bunni; Dr. Yasser Tayser Aleiti; Mr. Mohammed Haj Darwish, a 
member of the Human Rights Association in Syria and a founding member of the Committee for 
Revitalizing Civil Society in Syria; Mr. Marwan Al-Aach; and Mr. Tala Abu-Dan. All of these 
human rights defenders are members of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for 
Democratic and National Change. The Damascus Declaration for Democratic and National 
Change was signed in October 2005 and calls for political freedom, respect for ethnic and 
religions minorities, and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>2410. Dr. Fida al-Hurani, Mr. Ali al-Abdullah, Mr. Akram al-Bunni, Mr. Riad Seif, 
Mr. Fayez Sarah, a journalist and founding member of the Committees for Revitalising 
Civil Society in Syria; Dr. Ahmad Tohme, Mr. Jaber al-Shoufi, Dr. Walid al-Bunni; 
Dr. Yasser Tayser Aleiti, and Mr. Mohammed Haj Darwish, were the subjects of urgent appeals 
sent on 11 January 2008 and 4 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>2411. According to new information received, on 29 October 2008, the president of Damascus&#8217; 
Assize Court sentenced the 12 members of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for 
Democratic and National Change to 36 months&#8217; imprisonment. They had been charged with 
&#8220;publishing false information with the aim of harming the State&#8221;, &#8220;membership in a secret </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 414 
 
</p>
<p>organization designed to destabilize the State&#8221;, and &#8220;inciting ethnic and racial tensions&#8221;. Those 
who have been sentenced have 30 days to appeal. 40 members of the Damascus Declaration for 
Democratic and National Change have been arrested since 1 December 2007, when 163 of its 
members met in Damascus to discuss democratic reform in Syria. 
</p>
<p>2412. Concern was expressed that the 12 members of the National Council of the Damascus 
Declaration for Democratic and National Change are unable to continue their activities in the 
defense of democracy while in prison. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of the 12 members of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration 
for Democratic and National Change during their imprisonment. It was feared that the sentencing 
of the 12 members of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for Democratic and 
National Change may form part of an ongoing trend of harassment against pro-democracy 
activists in Syria.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 22 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p>2414. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government in 
relation to a group of human rights defenders and civil society activists, including 
Mr. Jon Ungphakorn, Chairperson of the NGO Coordinating Committee on Development 
(NGO-COD) Mr. Pairoj Polpetch, Secretary-General of the Union for Civil Liberty (UCL), 
Mr. Sirichai Mai-ngarm, member of the Labour Union of Electricity Generating Authority of 
Thailand, Mr. Sawit Kaewwan, leader of the Confederation of State Enterprise Labour Union, 
Ms. Supinya Klang-narong, Secretary-General of the Media Reform Campaign, 
Ms. Saree Ongsomwang, member of the Customer&#8217;s Network, Mr. Amnat Palamee, leader of the 
Confederation of State Enterprise Labour Union, Mr. Nutzer Yeehama, a member of the NGO 
Friend of People, Mr. Anirut Chaosanit, member of the Council of People&#8217;s Organizations 
Network in Thailand, and Mr. Pichit Chaimongkol. 
</p>
<p>2415. According to information received, on 22 January 2008, the aforementioned were 
reportedly summoned to the Metropolitan Police Bureau, where they were questioned for over 
four hours, before the presentation of charges, including: &#8220;trespass by using force or joining with 
more than two persons associating together to intrude forcefully or to cause harm&#8221;, &#8220;illegal 
gathering and using force with ten or more persons to cause damage or to give rise to public 
disorder&#8221;, &#8220;failing to disperse when ordered to by the police&#8221;, &#8220;collaborating with five or more 
persons to incite others to violence in one form or another to threaten the lives and safety of 
others&#8221;, and &#8220;collaborating to detain or restrict other persons.&#8221; The ten men requested 15 days to 
respond to the charges and submit more information to investigators. This was granted, as was 
their request for bail. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 415 
 
</p>
<p>2416. These charges were reportedly brought after a complaint made by the Secretary-General 
of the National Legislative Assembly, in relation to a series of demonstrations which took place 
on 12 and 19-21 December 2007 in protest against attempts to pass eight bills with consequences 
for civil liberties in Thailand, particularly an Internal Security Bill, reportedly seen by many as 
an attempt to tighten government control prior to the general election on 23 December. 
</p>
<p>2417. In the course of the demonstration a number of those gathered, including 
Messrs. Jon Ungphakorn and Pairoj Polpetch reportedly entered the parliamentary building and 
discussed the Internal Security Bill with members of parliament. These exchanges were 
reportedly peaceful and the protesters dispersed following an announcement that debate of the 
Bill was suspended for the day. This subsequently proved to be untrue and the Internal Security 
Law was passed that evening. 
</p>
<p>2418. Concern was expressed that the charges brought against the aforementioned may have 
been directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, particularly their exercising of 
the right to freedom of expression and assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2419. In a letter dated 11 July 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations. The 
letter communicated that on 12 December 2007, around 100 demonstrators, led by 
Mr. Jon Ungphakorn in demonstrations outside the National Legislative Assembly (NLA), 
managed to get into the Parliament building during a meeting of the NLA. According to 
eyewitness and photographic evidence, forceful means were used by the demonstrators to disrupt 
the NLA meeting. They used 10 wooden ladders to climb across the fence into the Parliament 
grounds. 30 entered the lobby area while approximately 60 to 70 demonstrated just outside the 
meeting room building. Mr. Jon Ungphakorn admitted in his article published in the Bangkok 
Post on 19 December 2007, that the objective of his group was to put &#8220;great pressure&#8221; on the 
NLA to stop considering the eight bills &#8220;by non-violent but by more forceful means than usual&#8221;. 
Mr. Jon Ungphakorn admitted that he was well aware that the action of his group &#8220;did not meet 
with the approval of the majority of the media and probably the majority of society&#8221;. He also 
knew well that such forceful action was against the law. He further admitted that serious charges 
against him and his group could be expected. All the charges against him and the other nine 
activists were based on the situation on the ground that involved the use of force. Since their 
actions were against the law, all persons involved had to bear the legal consequences, regardless 
of the objective they may have had in conducting the protest. On 18 March 2008 the 
Metropolitan Police Bureau sent the investigation file to the Office of the Attorney General 
(OAG). After having considered the file the OAG requested further inquiries of the defendant&#8217;s 
witnesses to ensure justice for all alleged persons before making a decision on prosecution. The 
OAG scheduled its decision as to whether to proceed with the prosecution for 21 August 2008.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 20 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2421. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the situation of the situation 
of Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit, wife of human rights lawyer Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, who 
disappeared four years ago. Ms. Neelaphaijit is currently part of the witness protection 
programme in Thailand. Ms. Neelaphaijit was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 7 September 2005 and of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairman-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 28 March 2006 Most recently 
Ms. Neelaphaijit was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolutions on 16 March 2007, and another urgent appeal sent by 
the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 26 February 2008. According to new information received. 
</p>
<p>2422. On 12 March 2008, Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit delivered a statement to the Human 
Rights Council to report on the latest developments and obstacles in the investigation of the 
disappearance of Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit&#8217;s husband, Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, which 
occurred four years ago. Ms. Neelaphaijit made the following appeal to the Thai Government 
and the Department of Special Investigation: &#8220;1. To request the Thai government and the DSI to 
be sincere in bringing justice to this case and prosecuting the wrong doers including high ranking 
police officers as it is my believe that enforced disappearance is a heinous crime against 
humanity. 2. To request the DSI to be courageous and to call Pol Lt Col Thaksin Shinawatra, 
former Prime Minister of Thailand to give testimony as a witness in this case. Information has 
been received that a close colleague of Pol Lt Col Thaksin Shinawatra went to search for 
information and a picture of Mr. Somchai Neelapaichit at the Government Identification 
Information Center. In addition, Pol Lt Col Thaksin, himself, stated in an interview to all media 
on January 13, 2006, the day after the verdict of the First Court, that &#8220;he knows that Somchai has 
passed away because evidence suggests so ...&#8221; As Thaksin was Prime Minister at that time, this 
interview must be credible and he must have had enough evidence before saying this. 
</p><p>3. Contained in the verdict of the First Court testimony of a plaintiff witness reveals that 
&#8220;&#8230; Pol Maj Gen Krisada Phankongchuen received information from Pol Lt Col Wannaphong 
Kotcharath that Pol Lt Col Charnchai Likhitkhanthasorn had met with known group of people in 
front of the Crime Suppression Unit and who informed him that they are going to abduct a 
corrupted lawyer. Later, Pol Lt Col Charnchai informed Pol Col Tawee Sodsong about this 
information ...&#8221; Therefore, Pol Col Tawee Sodsong, who is now the Acting Director of the DSI 
has the responsibility to clarify whether he knew of Somchai Neelapaichit&#8217;s disappearance. 4. To 
request the DSI to be very careful in this case and to try to compile strong evidence so that the 
wrong doers would be prosecuted. The DSI should not hurry to pursue the case in court without 
relevant and strong evidence. A lack of strong evidence means that real culprits will not be 
prosecuted or innocent people are being punished for crimes they did not commit. 5. To request </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 417 
 
</p>
<p>the Thai government to ratify International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in order to guarantee the safety and protection everyone from enforced 
disappearance. I strongly believe that the success of Somchai Neelaphaijit case is determined by 
the sincerity of the Government and the effectiveness of the DSI. Of particular concern is the fact 
that Pol Gen Sombat Amornwiwat, who was the former supervisor of the five accused persons 
standing trial in the case before, is now an advisor of the Ministry of Justice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2423. Concern was expressed that Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit may fear reprisals when 
returning to Thailand, after reading the above statement in her capacity as human rights 
defender. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2424. By a letter dated 2 April 2008, the Government responded to the communication, 
indicating that it has continually cooperated with the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances by providing relevant information on the cases of the disappearance of 
Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit and the safety of his wife, Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit, which are 
under the consideration of the Working Group. In November 2007, representatives from the 
Government agencies concerned met with the Working Group at its 83rd session in Geneva to 
provide an update on the latest developments in some outstanding cases, including that of 
Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit. The Government states that it attaches great importance to the case of 
Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, which is currently under the investigation of the Department of 
Special Investigation (DSI), Ministry of Justice. To be more specific, certain progress and 
developments have been made and have helped the investigators to move forward. The 
Government believes that more information should be forthcoming as the investigation proceeds. 
The Government is determined to do its utmost and will leave no stone unturned in order to bring 
justice to the case of Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit. 
</p><p>2425. With regard to the information regarding that Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit delivered a 
statement to the 7th session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) on 12 March 2008 to report on 
the latest developments in the investigation of the disappearance of Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, 
the Government points out that actually Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit made such remarks at the 
side-event of the 7th session of the HRC on 11 March 2008, organized by the Permanent Mission 
of France, in collaboration with a group of friends and the International Coalition against 
Enforced Disappearances. His Excellency Mr. Sihasak Phuangketkeow, Ambassador and 
Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of Thailand to the United Nations in Geneva, 
attended the said event and made an intervention responding to her concerns and reassuring her 
that the Royal Thai Government is seriously addressing this case and legal actions will be taken 
in accordance with gathered evidence and due process of law. The Government adds that what 
had transpired during that event was reported back to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand 
as a matter of urgency. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has subsequently conveyed this matter to 
the authorities concerned in Thailand for their consideration and further action. 
</p>
<p>2426. As for the concern on the safety of Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit and the transfer of her 
protection to police officers, the Government wants to clarify that the DSI has restructured the 
witness protection team, but the unit which provides protection for Ms. Angkhana Neelaphaijit is </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 418 
 
</p>
<p>still under the DSI, not the police authorities. Moreover, Angkhana Neelaphaijit continues to 
receive protection from the same team that she received in the past. In any case, the Thai 
authorities concerned stand ready to offer any necessary protection, if needed, to ensure her 
safety in accordance with the Thai law and Constitution.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 18 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2428. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal on the situation of 
Mr. Ismael Tae, aged 22 and a 4th year student at the Faculty of Science, Major Communication, 
Yala Rajabhat University; Mr. Amisi Manak, aged 22 and a 4th year student at the Faculty of 
Management Sciences, Major Finance, Yala Rajabhat University; Mr. Romlee Latae, aged 21 
and a second year student at the Faculty of Science, Major Biology, Yala Rajabhat University; 
Mr. Ruslan Tuyong and Mr. Waerosalee Latae, aged 23 and 4th year students at the Faculty of 
Education, Management Program, Yala Rajabhat University. All five students belong to the 
Student Federation of Yala, a student organization involved in organizing human rights activities 
in Yala Province. 
</p>
<p>2429. Messrs Ismael Tae and Amisi Manak were the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 15 February 2008. No response 
of the Government of your Excellency has been received as of today. According to the 
information received: 
</p>
<p>2430. On 15 August 2008, Messrs Ismael Tae, Amisi Manak, Romlee Latae, Ruslan Tuyong 
and Waerosalee Latae were reportedly arrested by law enforcement authorities, and are 
reportedly held since then in Special Task force 11 in Yala. Prior to their arrest and detention, the 
five students were involved in fundraising activities in support of the forthcoming holding of 
their student camp. 
</p>
<p>2431. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Messrs Ismael Tae, Amisi Manak, 
Romlee Latae, Ruslan Tuyong and Waerosalee Latae may be linked to their non-violent 
activities in promoting human rights in Yala province. In view of the previous reports of 
ill-treatment against Messrs Ismael Tae and Amisi Manak while in detention in Special 
Taskforce 11 in Yala which triggered the sending of the aforementioned urgent appeal in 
February 2008, further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the 
five students while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 419 
 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2008, following a tip-off from a reliable source, the police authorities conducted a 
search of a private dormitory in Yala and found certain evidence with links to known 
perpetrators of violence in the Southern Border Provinces of Thailand. The authorities therefore 
invited the 5 students named in the communication, from Rajabhat University Yala, occupants of 
the dormitory, to provide information and clarification regarding the said evidence. They were 
not charged, and were released on 27 August 2008. The whole process was carried out in 
accordance with the Thai law and Constitution. The Vice-Rector and lecturers from Rajabhat 
University Yala were invited to witness the search and subsequent invitation to the students to 
provide information. The police authorities reported the results of the search to the Yala 
Provincial Court, in accordance with the established procedure. At no time were the students at 
risk of maltreatment by the authorities, as some have alleged. The Vice-Rector of Rajabhat 
University Yala, their lecturers as well as friends and families were allowed to visit the said 
students. A representative from the Cross Culture Foundation, an independent NGO, was also 
informed and aware of the whole process.

<p>2434. The Special Rapporteur, along with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, sent a communication concerning Mr. Harry Nicolaides, an author from 
Melbourne, Australia. 
</p>
<p>2435. According to information received, on 31 August 2008, Mr. Harry Nicolaides was 
arrested at Bangkok airport where he was preparing to fly back to his native Australia. He was 
arrested on charges of l&#232;se-majest&#233; in accordance with Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code. 
The aforementioned Article stipulates that anyone who is found to have defamed, insulted or 
threatened a member of the Monarchy, shall be punished with between three to fifteen years 
imprisonment. The charges are reportedly related to a passage which appears in a novel, written 
by Mr. Nicolaides in 2005, entitled &#8216;Verisimilitude&#8217;. The passage reportedly criticises the King&#8217;s 
eldest son, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej. Only 50 copies of the novel were reportedly published 
and 5 copies were ever sold. 
</p>
<p>2436. Mr. Nicolaides is reportedly being detained in a prison in Bangkok. He has received 
visits from his brother and his partner and foreign journalists have been permitted to interview 
him. On 2 September, Mr. Nicolaides submitted a request to be released on bail however the 
request was rejected on the grounds that he may attempt to leave the country. His passport is 
currently with the authorities. According to reports Mr. Nicolaides has issued a public apology 
and plans to submit another request for release on bail. If his case goes to trial Mr. Nicolaides 
could potentially face up to 15 years in prison. 
</p>

In its response, the Government offered some preliminary information and responses on the 
allegations. It affirmed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Nicolaides was not an arbitrary 
detention and did not involve any attempt to restrain freedom of expression in Thailand. It was 
undertaken under the rule of law and by the Court&#8217;s order in compliance with Thai law and the 
applicable human rights norms and standards as stipulated in Article 9 of both the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>2439. The Government informed that on 31 August 2008, Mr. Harry Nicolaides was arrested 
under a warrant issued by the Criminal Court stating that he had committed an offence under 
Section 112 of the Criminal Code, which states that &#8220;whoever defames, insults or threatens the 
King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three 
to fifteen years&#8221;. As with Thai citizens, Mr. Nicolaides will be tried under due process of law in 
accordance with the Thai Criminal Procedure Code with transparency and justice. He was 
informed of his rights to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel. He was 
allowed visits by his family members, his partner and consular staff from the Australian 
Embassy in Bangkok since the first day he was arrested. In addition, he was allowed to give 
interviews to foreign journalists.

</b></p>
<p>2441. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication containing the following allegation. 
On 9 April 2008, the Government placed restrictions on the Tonga Broadcasting Commission, 
compelling it to stop broadcasting pre-recorded campaign speeches of candidates in order to 
allow a newly appointed editorial committee to edit these speeches. This editorial committee is 
composed of professionals with no prior experience in the media and includes the Chief 
Secretary to the Cabinet. According to sources, any reference to the pro-democracy protests of 
November 2006 is required to be deleted from campaign speeches. Furthermore, the editing 
process is reportedly slow, which may prevent some campaign speeches from being aired before 
the elections. 
</p>
<p>2442. Concern was expressed that the restrictions placed upon the Tonga Broadcasting 
Commission could prevent candidates from exercising their right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2443. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 28 April 2008. </p>

Vice-Pr&#233;sidente du Groupe de Travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire, a envoy&#233; un appel urgent sur la 
situation de MM. Adnane Haji, secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du Syndicat de l&#8217;enseignement de base de 
Redeyef, Foued Khenaissi, membre de l&#8217;Union locale du travail de Redeyef, Tae&#239;b Ben 
Othmane, membre du Syndicat de l&#8217;enseignement de base de Redeyef, et Boujom&#226;a Chra&#239;ti, 
secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du Syndicat de la sant&#233; de Redeyef. Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p>2445. Le 7 avril 2008, MM. Haji, Khenaissi, Ben Othmane et Chra&#239;ti auraient &#233;t&#233; violemment 
interpell&#233;s par la police, au lendemain de leur participation &#224; une r&#233;union, &#224; Tunis, portant sur la 
question du ch&#244;mage des travailleurs du bassin minier de Gafsa, dans le sud-ouest de la Tunisie. 
Cette r&#233;union serait intervenue dans un contexte o&#249;, depuis le d&#233;but du mois de janvier 2008, un 
mouvement de protestation aurait vu le jour dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa et environ 30 syndicalistes, 
&#233;tudiants et ch&#244;meurs auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s depuis le 6 avril 2008. 
</p>
<p>2446. M. Haji, qui souffre d&#8217;une insuffisance r&#233;nale, ainsi que MM. Khenaissi, Ben Othmane et 
Chra&#239;ti auraient &#233;t&#233; frapp&#233;s avant d&#8217;&#234;tre arr&#234;t&#233;s. Ils auraient ensuite &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233;s au

</p>
<p>2447. Des craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que l&#8217;arrestation de MM. Haji, Khenaissi, 
Ben Othmane et Chra&#239;ti et les mauvais traitements dont ils auraient fait l&#8217;objet soient li&#233;s &#224; leurs 
activit&#233;s de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme, et en particulier &#224; leurs activit&#233;s syndicalistes. 
D&#8217;autres craintes sont exprim&#233;es au sujet de l&#8217;arrestation des manifestants lors du mouvement de

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>2448. Le 4 f&#233;vrier 2009, le Gouvernement de la Tunisie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent 
du 10 avril 2008, indiquant qu&#8217;aucune personne portant l&#8217;identit&#233; de &#171; Foued Khenaissi &#187;, vis&#233;e 
dans la communication, ne fait l&#8217;objet de poursuites judiciaires. La consultation des actes de 
proc&#233;dure, dress&#233;s suite aux troubles enregistr&#233;s dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa, d&#233;montre que l&#8217;identit&#233; 
susvis&#233;e ne correspond &#224; aucune des personnes impliqu&#233;es dans ladite proc&#233;dure. S&#8217;agissant des 
pr&#233;venus Adnane Haji, Taieb Ben Othmane et Boujhemaa Chra&#239;ti, il convient de pr&#233;ciser que 
selon les &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire diligent&#233;e par le Procureur de la R&#233;publique de 
Gafsa, une entente s&#8217;est constitu&#233;e entre lesdits pr&#233;venus et autres, sur fond de certains troubles 
enregistr&#233;s dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa, sud de la Tunisie, afin d&#8217;appeler &#224; la d&#233;sob&#233;issance publique 
transformant ainsi le mouvement de contestation pacifique en une v&#233;ritable r&#233;bellion comme 
l&#8217;indique la diffusion de tracts d&#8217;incitation &#224; la commission d&#8217;acte d&#8217;agression et des voies de fait 
contre les agents de l&#8217;ordre, la fabrication et l&#8217;utilisation de cocktails Molotov, de barres de fer et 
de b&#226;tons ainsi que de l&#8217;installation de barricades sur les voies publiques aussi bien que routi&#232;res 
et ferroviaires. Les pr&#233;venus avaient effectivement mis leur plan &#224; ex&#233;cution se mettant &#224; la t&#234;te 
d&#8217;une manifestation de plusieurs dizaines de personnes au cours de laquelle les agentes de 
l&#8217;ordre public &#233;taient la cible de cocktails Molotov et de jets de pierre provoquant ainsi des </p>

</p>
<p>l&#233;sions corporelles &#224; plusieurs d&#8217;entre eux. Les &#233;difices, aussi bien publics que priv&#233;s, les 
voitures et les vitrines de commerce n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; &#233;pargn&#233;s subissant &#233;galement des d&#233;g&#226;ts 
graves. Il s&#8217;en est suivi un &#233;tat de panique parmi les populations de la r&#233;gion de Gafsa dont la 
s&#233;curit&#233; &#233;tait bel et bien gravement menac&#233;e. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est all&#233;gu&#233;, les pr&#233;venus 
n&#8217;ont subi en aucune mani&#232;re de mauvais traitements aussi bien lors de leur arrestation que 
pendant leur interrogatoire, par la police judiciaire, sur les faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Le 
Procureur de la R&#233;publique a &#233;t&#233;, imm&#233;diatement, avis&#233; de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire en cours et de 
la mesure de garde &#224; vue d&#233;cid&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;encontre des pr&#233;venus poru une premi&#232;re p&#233;riode de 3 jours 
et ce, conform&#233;ment aux articles 11 et 13 bis du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Une prolongation 
de 3 jours suppl&#233;mentaires a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233;e par ordonnance &#233;crite et motiv&#233;e du Procureur de la 
R&#233;publique, pour certains des pr&#233;venus, dict&#233;e par les besoins de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. L&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par la police judiciaire s&#8217;est donc effectu&#233;e en toute l&#233;galit&#233; sous le contr&#244;le 
de la justice. La garde &#224; vue des pr&#233;venus lors de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par les officiers 
de police judiciaire est une mesure entour&#233;e, en droit tunisien, par toutes les garanties consacr&#233;es 
par l&#8217;article 9 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques. 
</p>
<p>2449. D&#232;s cl&#244;ture de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire, le proc&#232;s verbal a &#233;t&#233; transmis au minist&#232;re public

un magistrat constitue une garantie suppl&#233;mentaire pour les pr&#233;venus, eu &#233;gard, d&#8217;une part, &#224; son

leurs avocats et des membres de leurs familles conform&#233;ment &#224; la r&#233;glementation en vigeur et

d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture et l&#8217;ancienne Repr&#233;sentante 
sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme 
le 19 octobre 2005. Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p>2460. Le 27 juillet 2008, Mme Zakia Dhifaoui, MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, 
Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil auraient particip&#233; &#224; 
Redeyef &#224; une manifestation pr&#233;sent&#233;e comme pacifique dont le but &#233;tait de d&#233;noncer des actes 
de r&#233;pression, notamment des arrestations, de la part des forces de l&#8217;ordre &#224; l&#8217;encontre des 
habitants du bassin minier de Redeyev. Mme Zakia Dhifaoui aurait pris la parole au cours de 
cette manifestation. 
</p>
<p>2461. Le 14 ao&#251;t 2008, Mme Zakia Dhifaoui aurait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; par le Tribunal de premi&#232;re 
instance de Gafsa &#224; huit mois de prison ferme pour &#171; insubordination, troubles de l&#8217;ordre public, 
entraves &#224; un fonctionnaire dans l&#8217;exercice de ses fonctions, d&#233;t&#233;rioration des biens d&#8217;autrui et 
atteinte aux bonnes m&#339;urs &#187;. MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, 
Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil auraient, quant &#224; eux, &#233;t&#233; 
condamn&#233;s pour les m&#234;mes charges &#224; six mois de prison ferme. 
</p>
<p>2462. Des accusations de harc&#232;lement sexuel et de menace de viol auraient &#233;t&#233; formul&#233;es au 
cours du proc&#232;s par Mme Zakia Dhifaoui &#224; l&#8217;encontre du chef du district policier de Gafsa, mais 
celles-ci n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; retenues. De m&#234;me, MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, 
Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebi auraient accus&#233; ce 
m&#234;me chef de leur avoir extorqu&#233;s des aveux sous la torture, ce qui n&#8217;aurait &#233;galement pas &#233;t&#233; 
pris en compte par le tribunal. 
</p>
<p>2463. Des craintes sont exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les condamnations de Mme Zakia Dhifaoui 
et MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben 
Othmane et Nizar Chebil soient li&#233;es &#224; leurs activit&#233;s non-violentes de protection et promotion 
des droits de l&#8217;homme, et ce dans l&#8217;exercice de leur droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression 
ainsi que le droit de se rassembler pacifiquement.

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>2464. Par une lettre dat&#233;e du 26 janvier 2009, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que les pr&#233;venus 
Zakia Dhifaoui, Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhafaoui, 
Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil on tent&#233;, sur le fond de certains troubles enregistr&#233;s dans la 
r&#233;gion de Gafsa, de transformer le mouvement de contestation pacifique en une v&#233;ritable 
r&#233;bellion comme l&#8217;indique les actes d&#8217;agression et de voies de fait contre les agents de l&#8217;ordre 
ainsi que l&#8217;installation de barricades sur les voies publiques. Il est &#233;tabli que les pr&#233;venus 
susvis&#233;s avaient pris, dans ce cadre, le 27 juillet 2008, la t&#234;te d&#8217;une manifestation au cours de 
laquelle ils ont proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;obstruction de la voie publique devant toute circulation en y dressant 
des barricades par l&#8217;utilisation de pneus, de vide-ordures et de grosses pierres. Les forces de 
l&#8217;ordre, intervenant pour rouvrir la voie publique &#224; la circulation et assurer la s&#233;curit&#233; des 
personnes et des biens, avaient essuy&#233; des jets de pierres et des coups de b&#226;tons. Une voiture de </p>

s&#233;curit&#233; publique s&#8217;&#233;tait trouv&#233;e de ce fait gravement menac&#233;e. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est 
all&#233;gu&#233;, les suspects, appr&#233;hend&#233;s en flagrant d&#233;lit, n&#8217;ont subi aucune forme de mauvais 
traitement lors de leur arrestation. Ils ont &#233;t&#233; conduits au si&#232;ge de la police judiciaire o&#249; ils ont 
&#233;t&#233; interrog&#233;s sur les faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Le procureur de la R&#233;publique a &#233;t&#233; 
imm&#233;diatement avis&#233; de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te ainsi que de la mise des pr&#233;venus en garde &#224; vue 
conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 13 bis du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Apr&#232;s cl&#244;ture de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
pr&#233;liminaire, les pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s au parquet qui a d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;&#233;mettre des mandats de d&#233;p&#244;t 
&#224; leur encontre et de les renvoyer devant la chambre correctionnelle pour r&#233;pondre des chefs 
d&#8217;inculpation qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Il est &#224; noter que les pr&#233;venus ont avou&#233; lors de leurs 
interrogatoires avoir proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;obstruction de la voie publique devant la circulation et jet&#233; des 
pierres sur une voiture des forces de l&#8217;ordre. Le proc&#232;s s&#8217;est tenu publiquement devant le tribunal 
de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa. Il a &#233;t&#233; proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;interrogatoire d&#8217;usage des pr&#233;venus en 
pr&#233;sence de leurs avocats. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est all&#233;gu&#233;, le tribunal n&#8217;a nullement refus&#233; de 
consigner les all&#233;gations de mauvais traitement des pr&#233;venus dans les proc&#232;s verbaux 
d&#8217;audience, ceux-ci font &#233;tat d&#8217;all&#233;gations se rapportant &#224; des aveux extorqu&#233;s sous la contrainte, 
outre des soi-disant menaces de viol qui auraient &#233;t&#233; prof&#233;r&#233;es contre Zakia Dhifaoui. Le tribunal 
a ensuite recueilli les plaidoiries des avocats. Apr&#232;s d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;, le tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de 
Gafsa a d&#233;clar&#233; les pr&#233;venus coupables des faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Zakia Dhifaoui a &#233;t&#233; 
condamn&#233; &#224; huit mois d&#8217;emprisonnement ; Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mamar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, 
Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil ont &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;s quant &#224; eux &#224; 
six mois d&#8217;emprisonnement. Sur exercice de leur droit d&#8217;appel, les pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; de nouveau 
jug&#233;s par la Cour d&#8217;appel de Gafsa qui a d&#233;cid&#233; un non-lieu pour l&#8217;ensemble des pr&#233;venus des 
chefs d&#8217;inculpation de r&#233;bellion commise par plus de dix personnes non arm&#233;es, outrage &#224; 
fonctionnaire public &#224; l&#8217;occasion de l&#8217;exercice des ses fonctions et atteinte publique aux bonnes 
m&#339;urs. S&#8217;agissant des autres chefs d&#8217;inculpation, la Cour d&#8217;appel a d&#233;cid&#233; de ramener la peine 
de Zakia Dhifaoui de 8 mois &#224; 4 mois et demi d&#8217;emprisonnement. Quant aux autres pr&#233;venus, ils 
ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de r&#233;duction de peine. Fawzi Al Mas, Mammar Amidi et Abdessalem Dhaouadi ont 
vu leur peine r&#233;duite &#224; 3 mois d&#8217;emprisonnement ; Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et 
Nizar Chebil ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;un sursis &#224; l&#8217;ex&#233;cution. Les pr&#233;venus ont attaqu&#233; par voie de 
cassation le jugement de condamnation rendu &#224; leur encontre. Le pourvoi a &#233;t&#233; rejet&#233; en la forme 
; les avocats des pr&#233;venus s&#8217;&#233;tant limit&#233;s &#224; pr&#233;senter leurs pourvois sans les accompagner des 
m&#233;moires indiquant les moyens du pourvoi et les griefs &#224; l&#8217;encontre de la d&#233;cision attaqu&#233;e 
comme l&#8217;exige l&#8217;article 263 bis du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Le jugement de condamnation est 
ainsi pass&#233; en force de chose jug&#233;e. Le 5 novembre 2008, Zakia Dhifaoui a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;une 
lib&#233;ration conditionnelle d&#233;cid&#233;e par le juge d&#8217;application des peines. Les autres pr&#233;venus ont 
&#233;galement &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;s, soit apr&#232;s avoir purg&#233; leurs peines, soit en vertu du sursis &#224; l&#8217;ex&#233;cution

</p>
<p>2467. Le 27 ao&#251;t 2008, une dizaine de policiers en civil auraient interpell&#233; M. Soussi &#224; son

</p><p>2472. Le 27 octobre 2008, Mme Naziha Rjiba aurait comparu devant le procureur de la

attaque dont aurait fait l&#8217;objet le serveur qui h&#233;bergeait Kalima et serait revenue sur le fait que 
Kalima soit censur&#233; depuis sa cr&#233;ation.

l&#8217;imputation &#224; l&#8217;Etat de la pr&#233;tendue attaque, qui aurait vise le site de &#8220;Kalima&#8221;, est une

qu&#8217;elle ne s&#8217;appuie sur aucun &#233;l&#233;ment de preuve. La diffusion par voie de presse de telles 
all&#233;gations mensong&#232;res est un acte totalement inadmissible de nature &#224; troubler l&#8217;ordre public. 
La cr&#233;dibilit&#233; qui doit cornmander &#224; toute activit&#233; de presse s&#8217;oppose fondamentalement &#224; la

not&#233; que l&#8217;usage d&#8217;expressions calomnieuses est manifestement attentatoires aux autorit&#233;s du

deux agents de police et prof&#233;r&#233; des propos obsc&#232;nes a leur &#233;gard alors qui regagnaient Tunis a 
bord d&#8217;une voiture de transport collectif prive. Il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;un contr&#244;le de routine auquel tous 
les autres passagers ont accept&#233; de se soumettre. Le proc&#232;s verbal constatant l&#8217;infraction et

<p>2478. Le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu l&#8217;appel urgent de 12 mai 2006 avec une carte envoy&#233; 
le 1 f&#233;vrier 2008. En retour, le Gouvernement voulait informer que &#8220; Il ressort des v&#233;rifications 
entreprises au sujet de la pr&#233;tendue agression de plusieurs avocats, le 11 mai 2006, devant la 
Maison du Barreau &#224; Tunis, que certains avocats, dont Messieurs Abderraouf Ayadi et 
Abderrazak Kilani, ont tente de s&#8217;attrouper sur la voie publique en y bloquant la circulation. 
L&#8217;intervention des agents de l&#8217;ordre pour les disperser d&#8217;une mani&#232;re pacifique et dans le cadre 
de la l&#233;galit&#233; s&#8217;est confront&#233;e &#224; un refus d&#8217;obtemp&#233;rer de la part de certains avocats. Pour ce qui 
est de la cr&#233;ation de l&#8217;Institut Sup&#233;rieur de la profession d&#8217;avocat, il y a lieu de souligner que la 
loi n&#176; 2006-30 du 15 mai 2006 modifiant et compl&#233;tant la loi n&#176; 89-87 du 7 septembre 1989, 
portant organisation de la profession d&#8217;avocat, et relative a la cr&#233;ation de l&#8217;institut sup&#233;rieur de la 
profession d&#8217;avocat, constitue une reforme r&#233;pondant a l&#8217;une des principales revendications des 
avocats. Elle s&#8217;inscrit dans le cadre des reformes entam&#233;es depuis quelques ann&#233;es en vue de 
promouvoir le syst&#232;me judiciaire et renforcer davantage les droits des justiciables. Il est d&#8217;autant 
plus surprenant que l&#8217;on rejette la structure propos&#233;e en arguant qu&#8217;elle va faire perdre &#224; la 
profession d&#8217;avocat son ind&#233;pendance du fait de son contr&#244;le par le pouvoir ex&#233;cutif. Faut-il 
rappeler que la nouvelle loi n&#8217;a pas mis en cause l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de cette profession. En effet, 
l&#8217;article premier de la loi du 7 septembre 1989 qui dispose que &#171;la profession d&#8217;avocat est une 
profession lib&#233;rale et ind&#233;pendante ayant pour but d&#8217;aider a l&#8217;instauration de la Justice &#187; n&#8217;a subi 
aucun amendement. D&#8217;ailleurs, la composition tripartite du conseil scientifique de l&#8217;Institut et sa 
direction qui sera confi&#233;e a un avocat et non plus au procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral, directeur des services 
judiciaires du Minist&#232;re de la justice et des droits de &#8216;Homme comme c&#8217;&#233;tait le cas auparavant, 
confirment l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de ce conseil. Les dispositions de cette nouvelle l&#233;gislation ne 
diminuent en rien les pr&#233;rogatives de l&#8217;ordre des avocats, &#233;tant donne que celui-ci maintiendra 
son droit de regard sur les stages et l&#8217;inscription au barreau&#8221;.

infond&#233;s et qu&#8217;aucune plainte n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e a ce sujet. Pour ce qui est des pr&#233;tendus 
emp&#234;chements d&#8217;acc&#232;s au local du &#171;Conseil national pour les libert&#233;s en Tunisie, CNLT, il 
importe de souligner que le CNLT est une formation n&#8217;ayant pas d&#8217;existence l&#233;gal en Tunisie, 
dans la mesure ou un arr&#234;te du Ministre de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur avait fait opposition a sa constitution en 
raison du non-respect par ses fondateurs des conditions l&#233;gales requises pour sa cr&#233;ation. Un

</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 19 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2481. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning 
Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a lawyer, human rights defender and newspaper columnist, who is </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 431 
 
</p>
<p>currently working on the case of three men killed at the Zirve Christian publishing house 
on 18 April 2007. The mandate-holders also drew the Government&#8217;s attention to information 
they had received in relation to the killing of Mr. Hrant Dink, who was a Turkish journalist of 
Armenian origin and an activist for democratic reform. 
</p>
<p>2482. According to information received, in November 2007, an article published in a local 
newspaper in the province of Malatya reportedly included details that could only have been 
learnt through the interception of Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz&#8217;s telephone calls and e-mails 
concerning the aforementioned case. He later learned that a letter had been sent to the Malatya 
prosecutor accusing him of involvement in the murders. The letter also contained other false and 
defamatory information, the intention of which was reportedly to make him a target. In 
January 2008, Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz received a letter which contained both veiled and direct 
threats to his safety, which may have had the same origin as the letter to the Malatya prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>2483. Reports inform that Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz had requested that authorities provide a 
bodyguard to protect him, but that this request has not yet been granted. He had reportedly been 
threatened and intimidated on a number of occasions, intensifying since November 2007, when 
the trial of those accused of killing the three men at the Zirve publishing house in Malatya began. 
</p>
<p>2484. The mandate-holders further referred to the case of the killing of Mr. Hrant Dink, who 
was shot dead on the street in front of his office in Istanbul on 19 January 2007. Mr. Dink had 
also reported death threats to the police on numerous occasions, who had allegedly been aware 
of a plan to assassinate him for some months prior to his death. 
</p>
<p>2485. Concern was expressed that the intimidation of and threats made against Mr. Oran Kemal 
Cengiz may be directly related to his work in defence of human rights, particularly on behalf of 
the three men killed in the aforementioned case. Serious concern was further expressed for 
Mr. Oran Kemal Cengiz&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2486. In letters dated 27 February, 25 March and 24 April 2008, the Government responded to 
the above urgent appeal. These letters confirmed that Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz lodged a 
complaint with the authorities, claiming that his telephone calls and emails were intercepted in 
order to influence the judiciary through misinformation on the case concerning the murder of the 
three employees of Zirve Publishing House in Malatya. The complaint was referred to the 
relevant for investigation, along with the request for security measures to be taken, as deemed 
appropriate to prevent any act of reprisal or retaliation. The investigation into threats against 
Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz had begun. Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz was provided with close 
protection whereby a law enforcement official was instructed to ensure his personal security in 
accordance with the Regulation on Protection Services. 
</p>
<p>2487. The first letter communicated that the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Malatya 
received an anonymous letter accusing Mr. Orhan Kemal Cengiz of involvement in the murder. 
However, the second letter confirmed that the trial of eighteen persons accused of murdering 
Hrant Dink had begun before the 14th Heavy Penal Court of Istanbul. Eight people had been 
arrested pending trial. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 11 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2489. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding reports that Serkis Seropyan and 
Aris Nalci, respectively owner and editor of the Turkish-Armenian &#8220;Agos&#8221; newspaper, are on 
trial before the Sisli 2nd Criminal Court of First Instance following an article published in 
&#8220;Agos&#8221; newspaper, and that two judges of the Court are allegedly biased as they were involved 
in the previous sentencing of Serkis Seropyan and &#8220;Agos&#8221; editor-in-chief Arat Dink. 
</p>
<p>2490. According to information received, Serkis Seropyan and Aris Nalci are on trial for having 
published on 9 November 2007 an article entitled &#8220;Intelligent Wood&#8221; criticising the sentencing 
of Arat Dink and Serkis Seropyan on 11 July 2007 under Article 301 of the Penal Code, which 
penalises &#8220;humiliating turkishness, the Republic and the organs and institutions of the State&#8221;, for 
republishing Hrant Dink&#8217;s comments about an &#8220;Armenian genocide&#8221;. Serkis Seropyan and Aris 
Nalci were charged under article 288 of the Penal Code for &#8220;attempt to influence the judiciary&#8221;, 
which provides a maximum sentence of four-and-a-half years imprisonment. Information 
received also indicates that two of the judges who sat in the first trial, judges Metin Aydin and 
Hakki Yalcinkaya, are sitting in the Sisli 2nd Criminal Court of First Instance, and that on this 
basis the defendants&#8217; lawyers have requested that the current case be heard by another court. It is 
reported that the court refused to withdraw from the case, and that the Chief Public Prosecutor 
decided to send the file to the Istanbul Duty Heavy Penal Court for a decision. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2491. In a letter dated 16 April 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. In 
its response, the Government noted that an investigation against Serkis Seropyan and Aris Nalci 
had been initiated. The article was about a court decision on the conviction of these two 
individuals, therefore the investigation was based on the charge of attempting to influence the 
judiciary. During the investigation, a notification was sent to Seropyan and Nalci for prepayment 
of a fine, according to a provision stipulating such penalty for persons who publish comments or 
articles on an ongoing case or court proceedings which have not yet resulted with a final court 
decision. The fine was not paid by the two individuals within the prescribed time limit. 
Following the investigation, a case was initiated under Article 288/1 and Article 19/2 of the 
Press Law &#8220;attempting to influence the judiciary&#8221; at the 2nd Criminal Court of First Instance.

<p>2492. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 11 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2493. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the 
Government concerning the situation of human rights defenders in Turkey, including 
Ms. Nalam Erkem, a lawyer and human rights defender, and formerly an active member of the 
&#8220;Torture Prevention Group&#8221; of the Izmir Bar Association, Messrs Kiraz Bicici and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 433 
 
</p>
<p>Ridvan Kizgin, vice president and board member respectively of the Human Rights Association 
and Ms. T&#252;rkiye Bozkurt and Ms. Behiye Duman, both members of the Peace Mothers, an 
organization which opposes the conflict between Turkish Armed Forces and the Kurdistan 
Workers&#8217; Party (PKK). 
</p>
<p>2494. According to information received, Ms. Nalem Erkem is currently being tried for 
&#8220;misconduct in Office,&#8221; reportedly as a result of her public disclosure of torture and 
mistreatment of children detained at the local Buca prison, while a member of the now defunct 
Torture Prevention Group. 
</p>
<p>2495. An Appeal Court in Bingol had recently upheld a Criminal Court verdict sentencing 
Mr. Ridvan Kizgin to 2 years and 6 months in prison. Mr. Kizgin had been convicted of offences 
under Article 281/1, &#8216;hiding criminal evidence&#8217;. The charges had reportedly been brought in 
connection with of a report regarding the killing of 5 villagers in a village in Bingol. 
On 3 March 2008, Mr. Kizgin was transferred to Bingol (M Type) Closed Prison to begin his 
custodial sentence. Two other cases against Mr. Kizgin were reportedly pending appeal. 
Mr. Kiraz Bicici was also appealing a 5 month suspended prison sentence and fine of 1.350 lira 
handed down by Bingol Criminal Court to both he and Ridvan Kizgin on 14 November 2006. 
</p>
<p>2496. Both of the aforementioned men were convicted of offenses under article 301 of the 
Turkish Penal Code (article 159/1 of the former Penal Code) which stipulates that (i) public 
denigration of Turkishness, the Republic or the Grand National Assembly of Turkey shall be 
punishable by imprisonment of between six months and three years, and that (ii) public 
denigration of the Government, the judicial institutions, the military or security structures shall 
be punishable by imprisonment of between six months and two years. 
</p>
<p>2497. On 14 February 2008, Ms. T&#252;rkiye Bozkurt and Ms. Behiye Duman were remanded to 
police custody after attempting to make a press statement in Taksim, central Istanbul. The two 
women were detained for six hours before being released. It is not known whether any charges 
were brought against them. 
</p>
<p>2498. Concern was expressed that these arrests, trials and convictions may be directly related to 
the activities of the aforementioned individuals in defense of human rights, particularly their 
exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed for legislation 
which may seek to curb freedom of assembly and expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2499. In a letter dated 2 April 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 11 March 2008. The Government stated that in the communication Turkey&#8217;s legitimate fight 
against terrorism is, regretfully, referred to as &#8220;the conflict between Turkish Armed Forces and 
the Kurdistan Worker&#8217;s Party&#8221;. The Government stated that such a terminology is erroneous and 
unacceptable. Firstly, PKK-KONGRA-GEL is a terrorist organization, not a political party. It is 
included in the list of foreign terrorist organizations of many countries and inter-governmental 
organizations such as the EU and NATO. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 434 
 
</p>
<p>2500. The Government also noted that it was also difficult to understand why the legitimate 
struggle by the security forces of a State against terrorists in order to protect the very basic 
human right, the right to life of its citizens had been defined as a &#8220;conflict&#8221;. The Government 
further informed that it would be only possible for the authorities to consider the letter after the 
above-mentioned references had been duly corrected.

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 17 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2502. The Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding the detention of Vedat Kursun, 
editor of the newspaper &#8220;Azadiya Welat&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2503. According to information received, Mr. Kursun was taken into custody 
on 5 February 2008, after the Diyarbakir Public Prosecutor charged him with having 
&#8220;continuously spread propaganda for the Kurdistan&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party (PKK)&#8221;, quoting the 
newspaper as referring to Abdullah &#214;calan as &#8220;the leader of the Kurdish people&#8221;, &#8220;the leader of 
the Kurdish Democratic Confederation (KCK)&#8221;, &#8220;Honourable &#214;calan&#8221; and &#8220;Leader Apo&#8221;, and 
members of the People&#8217;s Self-Defence Forces (HPG), an armed group associated with the PKK, 
as &#8220;HPG guerrillas&#8221;. The Prosecutor charged Mr. Kursun under articles 220/6 and 314/2 of the 
Penal Code and article 7/2 of the Anti-Terrorism Law. Two hearings were held on 4 
and 25 March. The Diyarbakir Sixth Serious Crimes Court refused to release Mr. Kursun 
pending his trial. The next hearing was scheduled to take place on 15 April. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2504. In a letter dated 29 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication above. 
In its response, the Government informed that Mr. Jursun has continuously been involved in the 
propaganda activities of an illegal organization. 31 incidents were brought before the Heavy 
Criminal Court of Diyarbakir between 22 January 2007 and 24 February 2008. He was tried 
under the charges of &#8220;propaganda for illegal organization, terrorist propaganda via media, 
praising crime and criminal as well as committing crime on behalf of an illegal organization 
without being a member&#8221;. On 6 November 2007, an indictment was issued against Mr. Kursun in 
connection with the articles published in a total of twelve editions of the newspaper &#8220;Azadiya 
Welat&#8221;. The charges against hi, were &#8220;committing crime on behalf of an illegal organization 
without being a member and terrorist propaganda via media&#8221;. Following the indictment, a case 
was commenced against Mr. Kursun before the 6th Heavy Penal Court of Diyarbakir. 
On 5 February 2008, Mr. Kursun was arrested on the basis of a warrant issued by the Court 
according to Article 100/3 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He was released on 29 April 2008 
and the trial is under way. The Government also outlined relevant provisions of the Turkish legal 
system, including Article 220/6 of the Penal Code, Article 7/2 of the Anti-Terror Act and 
Article 100/3 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 19 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2506. On 19 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning 
excessive use of force by police officers against Mr. Ethem A&#231;ikalin and Mr. H&#252;seyin Beyaz. 
Mr. Ethem A&#231;ikalin is the President of the Insan Haklari Dernegi (IHD - Human Rights 
Association) and Mr. H&#252;seyin Beyaz is an administrator for the IHD. 
</p>
<p>2507. Messrs Etherm A&#231;ikalin and H&#252;seyin Beyaz were the subject of a letter of allegations 
sent by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression on 11 September 2007. A response from your Government 
was received on 8 January 2008.  
</p>
<p>2508. According to new information received, on 14 August 2008, Messrs Ethem A&#231;ikalin and 
H&#252;seyin Beyaz went to the offices of the Democratic Society Party (DTP) in Andana to observe 
potential human rights violations. The IHD had received a telephone call about the detention of 
several DTP administrators that morning and raids that were expected to be carried out on the 
DTP offices. When asked what they were doing there by members of the police, the IHD 
members responded that they were preparing a public report about the detentions. An argument 
ensued and the police officers attacked the IHD members, pushing them down the stairs of the 
building and thereby breaking the arm of Mr. H&#252;seyin Beyaz. A medical report later confirmed 
that Mr. H&#252;seyin Beyaz&#8217;s arm had been broken. 
</p>
<p>2509. Afterwards, the Andana Police filed a complaint against the IHD members for failing to 
cooperate with police officers. The Andana Branch of the IHD has also filed a criminal 
complaint against the police officers. 
</p>
<p>2510. Concern was expressed that the members of the IHD were prevented from carrying out 
their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights through excessive use of force on the 
part of police officers. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2511. In letters dated 22 September 2008 and 5 January 2009, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 19 August 2008.  
</p>
<p>2512. The Government reported that on 13 August 2008, the Heavy Penal Court No. 8 in Adana 
issued a warrant, authorizing the officials of the Directorate for Security to conduct a search in 
the premises of the Provincial Office of the &#8220;Democratic Society Party&#8221; (DTP). 
</p>
<p>2513. On 14 August 2008, the law enforcement officials arrived at the premises of the DTP and 
waited for the lawyer of the DTP and mukthar in order to carry out the search. The officials 
asked Ethem Acikalin, who was then at the entrance of the building with another person, as to 
which capacity they would be present during the search. They responded that they would observe 
the &#8220;raid&#8221;. The officials explained that there would not be any &#8220;raid&#8221; in the premises and that 
they were there to execute a search warrant issued by the Court. The officials asked the President 
of DTP Provincial Office, Mehmet Zeki Karatas whether Ethem Acikalin in any way represented </p>

</p>
<p>the DTP in this proceeding. He confirmed that Ethiem Acikalin did not have any connections 
with the DTP. Therefore the officials requested him to leave the premises. Ethem Acikalin 
refused to leave and was forced to leave the building by the officials. 
</p>
<p>2514. The law enforcement officials immediately informed the prosecutor on duty about the 
events that took place on 14 August 2008. In accordance with the instructions of the prosecutor, 
an investigation was initiated against Ethem Acikalin. Husein Beyaz lodged a complaint with the 
Office of the Chief Prosecutor of Adana, alleging that his arm was broken by the law 
enforcement officials during the events. An investigation was initiated by the Prosecutor in 
connection with this complaint. 
</p>
<p>2515. Subsequently, a case was initiated against three law enforcement officials upon the 
indictment issued by the Chief Public Prosecutor in Adana on 25 November 2008 on the charge 
of causing Husein Beyaz to sustain injuries by negligence. This trial is underway in the First 
Penal Court of Peace in Adana.

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>2517. In a letter dated 21 January 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
of 21 November 2007. The Government reported that on 25 July 2007, an indictment was, 
indeed, issued by the Chief Public Prosecutor of Bagcilar, against Faruk Faker, the 
editor-in-chief of the &#8220;Yeni Asya&#8221; newspaper, on the charge of &#8220;violating publicly the secrecy of 
investigations&#8221; under Article 285 (paragraphs 1-3) of the Turkish Penal Code. Without prejudice 
to the defence rights arid the exceptions prescribed by other laws, the proceedings in the 
investigation stage of criminal cases are confidential. This principle is stipulated in Article 157 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In line with this principle, Article 285 of the Turkish Penal 
Code prohibits breaching the confidentiality of criminal investigations, publicly or through 
media. According to the indictment, the news articles published under the headlines &#8220;The case 
on the Council of State will be expanded&#8221; and &#8220;The investigation on the Council of State is 
expanding&#8221; on 23 June 2007 in the Yeni Asya newspaper, included references to the 
investigation file of the attacks carried out against the Council of State in May 2006. The Chief 
Public Prosecutor was of the view that these references amounted to the violation of Article 285 
of the Turkish Penal Code. Faruk Faker refused to provide information on the identity of the 
correspondents who reported the abovementioned news. Therefore, the indictment was issued 
against Faruk Faker, as the editor-in-chief of the newspaper in question, under Article 11 of the 
Press Law, which stipulates the criminal responsibility of press officials for periodical and 
non-periodical publications, when the original reporter cannot be established in cases of offences 
committed via press. Upon the indictment, a case was initiated against Faruk Faker in the Second 
Criminal Court of First Instance of Bagcilar. The case is still underway.

<p>2519. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an urgent 
appeal concerning Mr. Sazak Durdymuradov, a contributing reporter for the Turkmen Service 
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), in Bakhaden. 
</p>
<p>2520. According to information received, on 20 June 2008, Mr. Sazak Durdymuradov was 
forcibly removed from his home in Bakhaden by members of the National Security Ministry 
(MNB). He was then transferred to a local psychiatric hospital located between the cities of 
Bakhaden and Ashgabat, before being taken to an MNB station in Bakhaden where he was 
severely beaten with a pipe, subjected to electroshocks and forced to sign a letter which stated 
that he agreed to stop reporting for RFE/RL. 
</p>
<p>2521. Mr. Durdamuradov&#8217;s wife managed to see him at the MNB station on 24 June 2008. He 
told her that he had been diagnosed with mental instability at the psychiatric hospital. 
Mr. Durdymuradov is reportedly in good health and had never previously suffered from a mental 
disease. 
</p>
<p>2522. Mr. Sazak Durdymuradov may then have been relocated to a psychiatric hospital in the 
Lebap region, where critics of the Government are alleged to be forcibly abducted. However, 
Mr. Durdymuradov&#8217;s whereabouts have not been confirmed. When contacted by RFE/RL staff 
MNB authorities denied knowledge of the case. 
</p>
<p>2523. With a view to his reported custody at an unconfirmed location, concern was expressed 
for Mr. Durdymuradov&#8217;s physical and mental integrity. Further concern was expressed that the 
afore-mentioned events may represent a direct attempt to stifle independent reporting in 
Turkmenistan, thus restricting the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the country.

on 24 September 2008. 
</p>
<p>2527. Concern was expressed about the arrest and detention without charges of George Oundo 
and Kiiza Brendah. Concern was also expressed with regard to their physical and psychological 
integrity. Further concerns were expressed that the arrests and detention of George Oundo and

</p>
<p>2530. According to the information received, on 5 January 2008, Messrs. Saed and 
Tegambwage were attacked by three assailants with machetes in their office in Kinondoni, 
Dar es Salaam. They were allegedly beaten by the attackers, who also poured acid on their faces. 
Mr. Kubenea lost his sight and will need to undergo medical treatment abroad, whereas 
Mr. Tegambwage suffered severe head injuries. The two journalists, who reportedly received a 
series of death threats in the past, are well-known for the investigation of corruption scandals 
involving state authorities. The three attackers have yet to be identified. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2531. In a letter dated 22 February 2008, the Government replied to the communication above. 
In its reply, the Government informed that Mssrs Kubenea and Tegambwage were attacked by 
three unidentified persons armed with machetes on 5 January 2008 in their office. After 
physically attacking Mssers Kubenea and Tegambwage, the three attackers left without taking 
anything. The two journalists were sent immediately to the hospital; Mr. Kubenea was flown to 
India for treatment at Government&#8217;s costs. Both journalists are now conducting business as 
usual. Police investigations started immediately after the assault and give suspects were arrested 
and arraigned in court with conspiracy to commit an offence and causing grievous harm to the 
two journalists. Mr. Kubenea rules out the possibility of the involvement of State organs in the 
assault. He believes the attack was organized by a group of disgruntled individuals who have 
been or are being affected by his mighty pen. The Government informed that it recognizes and 
respects the right to freedom of opinion and expression as enshrined in the Constitution and </p>

</p>
<p>2534. According to information received, on 30 June 2008, Mr. Athemay Sterling arrived in the 
United States of America. His visa was cancelled upon arrival and he was held in administrative 
detention at the Krome detention centre in Miami Florida. For 48 hours, no food was provided

undergone intensive interrogation in particular about presumed links with a former guerrilla 
group known as M-19. 
</p>
<p>2535. Mr. Athemay Sterling had been on his way to Washington to provide information to the 
Inter-American Commission for Human Rights regarding environmental and health rights 
violations in Colombia about which he had communicated with the commission. He had planned 
to stay in the United States of America until 22 July 2008. However, he currently remains in

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>2539. In a letter dated 17 July 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
of 16 September 2005. The Government reported that &#8220;on August 28, 2005, Waleed Khaled, a 
reporter from Reuters news agency, and his cameraman, Haider Khadem, were reporting on an 
attack against an Iraqi police envoy in the Hay-al-Adil district of west Baghdad. U.S. military 
units were dispatched to Hay-al-Adil in response to the attacks against the Iraqi police, and, as 
described below, fired at the reporters car, killing Mr. Khaled and wounding the cameraman 
Mr. Khadem. The U.S. Government conducted a comprehensive investigation into the shooting 
of Mr. Whaled and concluded that no disciplinary action against military personnel was required. 
The U.S. Government Army investigation determined that the shooting followed the applicable 
rules of engagement, under which military personnel are authorized to use force if they feel 
someone poses an immediate threat or threatens the integrity of the operation. The investigation 
indicated that Mr. Whaled failed to use appropriate precaution upon entering a hostile 
environment; the investigation found that Mr. Khadem was hanging out of the car window, 
holding what appeared to be a potential explosive device or a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. 
The investigation later confirmed that this piece of equipment, which U.S. forces believed at the 
time to be a deadly weapon, was the video camera Mr. Khadem used to investigate the original 
attacks against the Iraqi police. The military officers perceived the failure of Misters Khaled and 
cameraman to slow their vehicle down as a potential threat, because of previous experiences by 
military personnel web suicide car bombers. Under these circumstances, U.S. military personnel 
used force against what appeared to be an immediate threat to their unit and civilian and military 
personnel nearby. The U.S. military rules of engagement promote the physical protection of 
journalists, as well as of over civilian The U.S. Government strongly supports freedom of the 
press and freedom of opinion, and tries to equip journalists with the tools and protection that will 
allow them to conduct their jobs in a safe and effective manner. Specifically, the U.S. military 
guidelines and protocols detail how journalists should conduct themselves when reporting from a 
conflict area. The codes of conduct and procedures pertaining to the proper conduct and 
engagement by journalists operating in hostile areas are put in place for the safety of the 
journalists. The responsibility to abide by these rules, however ultimately rests with the 
journalists, who must exercise discretion and caution in dangerous situations. The U.S. 
Government deeply regrets the loss of life and fully recognizes the important role played by the 
news media in Iraq and other hostile environments. 
</p>
<p>2540. In a letter dated 29 December 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations 
of 30 September 2005. The Government reported on those programs that have sought to advance 
the empowerment of women around the world. This was said to be a top priority for the 
United States, as the promotion and protection of the human rights of women. As described in 
the response, these priorities were said to be of particular impotence to the United States in Iraq 
where the United States has worked closely with the Iraqi Government and the international 
community and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to address gender-based violence and 
related issues. In cooperation with multiple stakeholders in Iraq, the United States implements 
women&#8217;s empowerment programming with focuses on security trainings, education and 
awareness building, and economic, politics and legislative reforms, stressing the importance of 
strengthening respect for the rights of women as a key element of democracy. The letter provides 
full description of those programs as above referred to. </p>

<p>2541. In a letter dated 17 July 2008, the Government responded to an urgent appeal 
of 24 August 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;Mr. El-Haj was transferred from 
Guantanamo Bay to his home country of Sudan in May, 2008, and future questions regarding 
this individual should be referred to the Government of Sudan. Prior to his transfer, Mr. El-Haj 
was detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay because he was determined to 
be an enemy combatant. Under the law of war, countries may lawfully detain enemy combatants 
until the cessation of active hostilities. We would like to emphasize that Mr. El-Haj was not 
detained because he worked as a cameraman for Al Jazeera. Members of the media are not 
targeted as such by the U.S. or allied forces. With respect to the allegations described in your 
letter, we have no evidence to substantiate claims that Mr. El-Haj was mistreated at Guantanamo. 
The United States investigates claims of abuse and, where those allegations are deemed credible, 
we hold those responsible accountable. U.S. officials from all government agencies are 
prohibited from engaging in torture, at any times, in all places. All U.S. officials, wherever they 
may be, are also prohibited from engaging in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
punishment against any person in U.S. custody, as defined by our obligations under the 
Convention against Torture. Further, as you may be aware, the United States Supreme Court has 
held that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies in our armed conflict with 
Al-Qaeda. The United States applies these protections to all detained unlawful enemy 
combatants&#8221;.

Mr. Yusuf Juma and his son Mr. Bobur Juma. Mr. Yusuf Juma is a prominent writer and 
pro-democracy activist in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2544. According to information received, on 22 December 2007, Messrs Yusuf and Bobur 
Juma were arrested in the Tashkent region and were reportedly being held in the Otbozor Prison 
in the Bukhara region. According to reports from their lawyer, Mr. Ruhiddin Kamilov, who had 
visited them, Messrs Yusuf and Bobur Juma were being subjected to physical abuse by 
authorities, in the form of beatings, and verbal abuse on a daily basis. Mr. Samad Shukurov, the

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2547. In a letter dated 22 April 2008, the Permanent Mission of Uzbekistan in Geneva 
responded to the above communication. The letter stated that, on 10 December 2007, the 
procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara Province, initiated criminal 
proceedings under articles 219, part 2, and 140, part 3, of the Uzbek Criminal Code against 
Mr. Y. Zhumaev and his son, B. Zhumaev. 
</p>
<p>2548. The basis for prosecution was that they had publicly insulted, resisted the authority of and 
inflicted moderate bodily harm on a law enforcement officer of the Karakul municipal district, 
Bukhara Province, Mr. T. Itokov, who was attempting to stop illegal actions of Mr. Y. Zhumaev 
and his son, Mr. B. Zhumaev, which took the form of an unauthorized march with placards 
containing anti-constitutional material. 
</p>
<p>2549. According to the information available to the law enforcement agencies: Yusufzhon 
Ollokulovich Zhumaev (Yusuf Juma) was taken into custody on 17 December 2007 by the 
procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara Province, on charges of having 
committed offences listed in articles 140, part 3, paragraph (a) (&#8220;Insults&#8221;) and 219, part 2 
(&#8220;Resistance to authority or a person fulfilling a civic duty&#8221;) of the Uzbek Criminal Code. He 
entered Bukhara municipal correctional institution UYa-64/IZ-3 on 22 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>2550. A medical examination showed him to be free of bodily harm; he did not visit the 
Bukhara forensic medical institute for an examination. His state of health was satisfactory. The 
letter further contended that, during his time at the correctional institution, he did not make any 
complaints to the medical service, nor any complaints or representations about unlawful acts by 
the institution&#8217;s administration. 
</p>
<p>2551. Yusufzhon ugli Bobur (Bobur Juma) was taken into custody on 17 December 2007 by the 
procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara Province, on charges of having 
committed offences listed in articles 140, part 3, paragraph (a) (&#8220;Insults&#8221;) and 219, part 2 
(&#8220;Resistance to authority or a person fulfilling a civic duty&#8221;) of the Uzbek Criminal Code. He 
entered Bukhara municipal correctional institution UYa-64/IZ-3 on 22 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>2552. A medical examination showed him to be free of bodily harm. During his time at the 
correctional institution, he did not make any complaints to the medical service and his state of 
health was satisfactory. During the time he was held in custody, he made no complaints or 
representations about unlawful acts by the institution&#8217;s administration. 
</p>
<p>2553. The government stated that the detention conditions of Mr. Zhumaev and 
Mr. Yusufzhon ugli were entirely in accordance with the standards established by the Penal 
Enforcement Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Since their arrest, Mr. Zhumaev and 
Mr. Yusufzhon ugli had had one meeting with their counsel, Mr. R. Kamilov, who visited them </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 443 
 
</p>
<p>once on 2 February 2008. On 7 March 2008, Mr. Zhumaev and Mr. Yusufzhon ugli submitted a 
written dismissal of their counsel Mr. Kamilov to the procurator&#8217;s office of Karakul municipal 
district. During Mr. Kamilov&#8217;s meeting with his client Mr. Zhumaev, the prison administration 
uncovered a breach of security, i.e. counsel Kamilov gave the prisoner some papers, which the 
latter attempted to conceal surreptitiously on his person. 
</p>
<p>2554. In response to this, the prison staff stopped their meeting and invited Mr. Zhumaev to 
present the hidden papers for inspection. When Mr. Zhumaev was searched, photographs of a 
group of people picketing near the headquarters of the Office of the Procurator-General of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan were found upon him and confiscated, together with telephone numbers 
on a slip of paper, including some of telephone service subscribers in the Russian Federation. 
Counsel Kamilov was then asked to explain his actions, to which he cynically responded that 
&#8220;the prison administration is acting unlawfully&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2555. Counsel Kamilov was invited into the office of the prison governor, Lieutenant-Colonel 
S.U. Shukurov, for an explanation of the incident and in observance of legal standards. The latter 
explained to him the need to ensure respect for the rules in pretrial detention and remand 
facilities, in order to prevent collusion by persons in custody, and also explained that the papers 
and items confiscated from the prisoner could have been used for agitation and provoked 
unpredictable reactions among the prison population.  
</p>
<p>2556. In addition, he was told that in fulfilling their duties in accordance with their professional 
responsibilities, the prison staff had the task of imposing security measures and, in the specific 
case of remand facilities, preventing remand prisoners from having outside contacts. At the end 
of the discussion counsel Kamilov, in an inappropriate response to the administration&#8217;s demands 
and having failed to draw the appropriate conclusions, left the premises of the institution, 
warning the administrator that he would complain about him and his staff. 
</p>
<p>2557. On the basis of the complaint by counsel Kamilov concerning unlawful actions by the 
staff of Bukhara municipal correctional institution UYa-64/IZ-3, an official investigation was 
carried out by the Bukhara procurator&#8217;s office and an internal investigation was conducted by the 
Central Penal Correction Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which established that 
the information about the use of physical force and psychological pressure against the detainees 
Y.O. Zhumaev and B. Yusufzhon ugli and threats to counsel Kamilov by the prison governor, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Z. Shukurov, was groundless and had been invented by counsel Kamilov 
himself. 
</p>
<p>2558. Yusufzhon ugli Mashrab was taken into custody on 5 December 2007 by the procurator&#8217;s 
office of Karakul municipal district, Bukhara Province, on charges of having committed offences 
listed in article 104, part 1 (&#8220;Intentional infliction of serious bodily injury&#8221;) of the Uzbek 
Criminal Code. On 11 March 2008, he was sentenced under article 104, part 1 (&#8220;Intentional 
infliction of serious bodily injury&#8221;) of the Uzbek Criminal Code by Jondor municipal court, 
Bukhara Province, to four years&#8217; deprivation of liberty in a prison colony and was currently 
serving his sentence in correctional institution UYa-64/70, Qashqadaryo Province.

prohibits one person from holding the office for more that two consecutive terms. 
</p>
<p>2562. A group of women assaulted the protestors, injuring one protestor so badly that an 
ambulance had to be called. The police, who were reportedly observing the attack from the 
grounds of a nearby maternity hospital, arrived to inform the protestors that one of the women 
who had confronted them had died. Attacks by groups of women against protestors are said to be 
part of a campaign of the Uzbek secret services to intimidate human rights defenders and 
dissuade them from continuing with their work. These women are thought to be women from 
vulnerable groups in society who have committed minor offences. They are allegedly used by the 
Uzbek secret services to stage attacks such as this one, and in return the charges against them are 
dropped by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>2563. The mandate-holders expressed their fear that these human rights defenders had been 
targeted as a result of their human rights activities, in particular their work to campaign for 
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2564. In a letter dated 26 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 27 March 2008. The Government reported that according to information from the Office of 
the Prosecutor-General and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, at 11 a.m. on 13 March 2008, 
representatives of informal human rights organizations engaged in unauthorized picketing near 
the building of the Office of the Prosecutor-general of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2565. The picketers were invited into the Office of the Prosecutor-General for a talk. However, 
they declined the invitation and dispersed after 1 pm. It has not been established that women 
assaulted the picketers. The representatives of the informal human rights organizations did not 
apply to Uzbek law enforcement bodies in this connection. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 31 March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2566. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning Mr. Yusuf Juma, a prominent writer and pro-democracy activist, his two 
sons, Mr. Bobur and Mr. Mashrab Juma, and Mr. Ruhiddin Kamilov, their lawyer. 
Mr. Yusuf Juma was the subject of a communication sent on 19 February 2008 by the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 445 
 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. 
</p>
<p>2567. According to allegations received, Yusuf, Bobur and Mashrab Juma were being detained 
in Otbozor Prison in the Bukhara region. They had been subject to verbal abuse and beatings on 
a daily basis by prison authorities since their arrest in mid-December 2007. Yusuf Juma had been 
recently examined at Bukhara&#8217;s Medical Law Centre after he fainted from the torture he was 
subjected to. He was found to be suffering from heart and respiratory problems and had injuries 
from the beatings. Yusuf and Bobur Juma were being denied access to food and prevented from 
writing letters and meeting with their lawyer, Mr. Kamilov. 
</p>
<p>2568. Mashrab Juma was detained on allegedly fabricated charges in the run-up to the 
re-election of President Karimov, and was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment. Yusuf and 
Bobur Juma have been charged under two articles of the Criminal Code with &#8220;insulting&#8221; and 
&#8220;resisting representatives of power&#8221;. Yusuf Juma has been openly critical of President Islam 
Karimov in his writings. Mr. Kamilov was threatened by the prison governor, whose name is 
known to the mandate-holders, that he would soon be killed because he and Yusuf Juma were 
serving the interests of US imperialism. 
</p>
<p>2569. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Yusuf, Bobur and 
Mashrab Juma, and in relation to acts of intimidation against their lawyer, Mr. Kamilov. Further 
concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the three men may be directly related to 
the activities of Yusuf Juma for the promotion of democracy and freedom of expression in 
Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2570. The response from the Uzbek government, dated 22 April 2008, is summarized above as 
a response to the urgent appeal of 19 February 2008 which addressed the same case. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2571. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 24 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2572. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal in relation to Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov, a founding 
member and leading journalist with Uznews.net, a member of the Real Union of Journalists of 
Uzbekistan, and a member of the Committee to Protect Individuals&#8217; Rights in Karakalpakstan. 
Mr. Abdurahmanov has also worked for Radio Liberty and the Institute for War and Peace 
Reporting, and has spoken out against human rights violations in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2573. Mr. Abdurahmanov was the subject of a letter of allegations sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders on 22 January 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 446 
 
</p>
<p>2574. According to information received, on 7 June 2008, Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov was 
detained and charged under Article 276, Clause 2A of the Uzbek Criminal Code for the illegal 
production, purchase and storage of drugs without intent to sell. Salijon Abdurahmanov was 
stopped in his car by a traffic police officer accompanied by a drug enforcement officer with two 
sniffer dogs. The officers claimed that they had smelled something suspicious and subsequently 
searched the car, in which 114.8g of marijuana and 5.89g of opium were allegedly found. 
</p><p>2575. Following the arrest, Mr. Abdurahmanov&#8217;s home was searched and his computer, books, 
documents and papers were confiscated. It was later reported on uzmetronom.com that 
Salijon Abdurahmanov admitted to using drugs, although reports indicate that he tested negative 
in a drug test. Salijon Abdurahmanov had expressed fears that he could be arrested for his 
outspokenness in defence of human rights and had been warned against writing in case it resulted 
in his detention. 
</p>
<p>2576. Concern was expressed that the arrest and charges against Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov 
may have been directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in particular through 
his exercise of the right to freedom of expression, and that the accusations of drug use may form 
part of a campaign to discredit him. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Abdurahmanov. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2577. In a letter dated 19 July 2008, the Government responded to the above urgent appeal. The 
letter confirmed that a car driven by S.A. Abdurakhmonov was stopped by officers of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. It was found that 
Mr. Abdurakhmonov had no driving license or document of ownership of the vehicle. The 
vehicle was inspected and substances with a sharp odor were found under the petrol tank 
wrapped in cellophane and paper. The substances were confiscated in the presence of witnesses 
and were sent for forensic chemical analysis. According to the analysis, the confiscated 
substances were 114.18 grams of marijuana and 5.98 grams of opium. 
</p><p>2578. On 7 June 2008, criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Abdurakhmonov by the 
investigative department of the Nukus city internal affairs office under article 276, 
paragraph 2 (a) of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan (Unlawful production, storage, purchase, 
carriage or transmission of narcotic or psychotropic substances in large quantities, without the 
purpose of sale). On 8 June 2008, he was arrested in accordance with article 221 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure of Uzbekistan. On 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdurakhmonov was indicted in the 
criminal case under article 276, paragraph 2 (a) of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. On 
10 June 2008, the Nukus municipal court chose the preventive measure of remand in custody for 
Mr. Abdurakhmonov. 
</p>
<p>2579. During the investigation, a search of Mr. Abdurakhmonov&#8217;s home was authorized. A 
computer, a Dictaphone, a camera, and several documents were confiscated and sent for 
examination. 
</p>
<p>2580. According to forensic chemical analysis carried out on 17 June 2008, traces of hashish 
were found in wipe samples taken from Mr. Abdurakhmonov&#8217;s hands and lips. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 447 
 
</p>
<p>2581. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan has not received any complaints or 
communications concerning the use against Mr. Abdurakhmonov of unauthorized methods 
during the conduct of the initial inquiry and the investigation. The arrest of Mr. Abdurakhmonov 
and the criminal proceedings against him are not connected with his human rights activities. The 
pretrial investigation of the case is continuing. 
</p>
<p>2582. In a letter dated 10 November 2008, the Government further replied to this 
communication. The Government informed that on 7 June 2008, the investigative department of 
the internal affairs office in the town of Nukus, Republic of Karakalpakstan, instituted criminal 
proceedings against Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov on the basis of evidence of an 
offence contrary to article 276, part 2, paragraph (a), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The 
grounds were as follows: on 7 June 2008, at approximately 7 p.m., on Dosnazarov Street in 
Nukus, a Zhiguli VAZ-2106 car with licence plate number 30 Y 3346 was stopped for a 
document check by officers of the traffic police and canine patrol squad of the Republic&#8217;s 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, who were carrying out an operation to prevent and suppress illicit 
trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, known as Black Poppy 2008. During 
the check, it was ascertained that the car in question was being driven by Mr. Salijon 
Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov, who was unable to produce a driver&#8217;s licence. In addition, 
Mr. Abdurahmanov was not the owner of the car. With his permission, a canine patrol officer 
and a police dog inspected the vehicle. As a result, substances with a specific odour were 
discovered hidden in the boot of the car, wrapped in a paper and cellophane package. In the 
presence of witnesses, these substances were confiscated for forensic analysis and sealed, and the 
appropriate documentation was completed. 
</p>
<p>2583. The results of the chemical analysis performed on 7 June 2008 showed that the 
substances found and confiscated from Mr. Abdurahmanov&#8217;s car included 114.18 grams of 
marijuana and 5.98 grams of opium, which was wrapped in paper. On 9 June 2008, Mr. 
Abdurahmanov, defended by Mr. B. Abdurahmanov, was charged under article 276, part 2, 
paragraph (a), of the Criminal Code and remanded in custody by a criminal judge. On the basis 
of all the evidence gathered, it was decided that Mr. Abdurahmanov had intended to attempt the 
sale of a large quantity of narcotics. Accordingly, on 5 August 2008, pursuant to article 362 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, the charges previously brought against Mr. Abdurahmanov 
were amended, and he was charged under articles 25 and 273, part 5, of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>2584. On 6 August 2008, the pretrial investigation was completed, and the criminal case was 
referred for trial, in accordance with the established procedure, to the Takhtakupyr District 
Criminal Court of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The Takhtakupyr District Criminal Court 
found the accused, Mr. Abdurahmanov, guilty and sentenced him to 10 years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty. It should also be noted that the Criminal charges brought against Mr. Akzam Olimovich 
Turgunov and Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov are in no way related to their human 
rights work. No complaints or statements from Mr. Turgunov regarding the use of unlawful 
investigation methods have been received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2585. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva, Chairperson of the human rights organization </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 448 
 
</p>
<p>Plammenoe Serdtse (Ardent Hearts Club), co-founder of the national movement Civil Society, 
nominee for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize, and winner of the 2008 Martin Ennals Award for 
Human Rights Defenders. Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva was the subject of numerous urgent appeals 
sent by Special Procedures mandates. Most recently she was the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 19 December 2007. A response from the Government was received 
on 29 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>2586. According to information received, on 2 June 2008, Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva was 
released after serving two years of an eight-year prison sentence relating to 17 charges including 
slander of government bodies and membership of an illegal organization. A condition of her 
release was a three-year suspended sentence. While in prison she was required to sleep on 
wooden planks despite suffering from a condition of high blood pressure which could have been 
worsened by this situation. Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva stated that her health deteriorated 
significantly while in prison. During this time she was allegedly subjected to unnecessary 
surgery. She said that she was not given medical records or results of the surgery, nor an 
explanation why it was necessary. 
</p>
<p>2587. On 4 July 2008, Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva issued a statement claiming that her health 
remains under threat because she has not been allowed by the authorities to leave Margilan, the 
city where she lives, to seek the necessary post-surgery medical care. 
</p>
<p>2588. The release of Ms. Mutabar Tadjibaeva was welcomed. However, concern was expressed 
that the restriction of her movement and the three-year suspended prison sentence imposed on 
her may be linked to her legitimate human rights activities. Concern was also expressed for her 
physical and psychological integrity and the Government was urged to adopt the measures 
needed to ensure her access to appropriate medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2589. In a letter dated 19 July 2008, the Government responded to the above urgent appeal. The 
letter gave details of Mutabar Ibrgimova Tadjibaeva&#8217;s original sentencing by the Tashkent 
provincial criminal court on 6 March 2003; the upholding of this sentence by the appeals 
chamber of this court on 30 May 2006; and the eventual commuting of the sentence to a 
three-year sentence which saw MI Tadjibaeva released from custody on 2 June 2008. It was also 
stated that, if a person serving a suspended sentence does not comply with the obligations 
specified by the court, the suspension may be revoked and the original penalty enforced. Finally, 
the letter stated that whether a citizen may travel abroad is decided by the internal affairs 
agencies at his or her place of residence. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 19 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2590. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government in relation to 
Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva, human rights defender and pathologist from Andijan. 
Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva was the subject of a letter of allegation sent by the then </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 449 
 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers on 9 May 2007, regarding a six-year prison sentence given 
to her. A response from the Government was received on 3 July 2007. 
</p>
<p>2591. According to information received, on 8 April 2008, Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva and her 
mother-in-law were forced by an agent of the National Security Department of Andijan, whose 
identity is known to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, to criticize journalists from Ozodlik in an interview. Ozodlik is a radio station which 
has defended the legitimate work of Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva in defense of human rights. 
On 12 June 2008, a six-year prison sentence against Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva was changed to a 
suspended sentence with a three-year probation period. Under the conditions of her sentence 
Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva was forbidden from having any contact with human rights organizations. 
Her landline and mobile telephones were disconnected, under orders from the National Security 
Department and threats were made to stop her or her husband from using the internet. 
</p>
<p>2592. On 7 July 2008, the Press Center of the Initiative Group of Independent Human Rights 
Defenders published a complaint about the treatment of Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva during her 
probation period. On 9 July 2008, despite having offered to help Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva and her 
husband to find work the previous day, the same agent of the National Security Department who 
had forced Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva to criticize Ozodlik journalists began to threaten 
Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva&#8217;s husband with imprisonment for having provided information to human 
rights organizations. Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva&#8217;s husband was later summoned to the National 
Security Department. 
</p>
<p>2593. Concern was expressed that the actions taken against Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva and her 
husband may be related to their work in defense of human rights. Concern was also expressed for 
the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva and her family, especially 
given that Ms. Gulbahor Turayeva has recently given birth to her fifth child. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2594. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 19 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2595. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. Utkir Pardaev, 
Chairperson of the Independent Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan in Dzhizhak district; 
Mr. Mamir Azimov, Chairperson of the HRSU in Dzhizhak district; Mr. Ihtiyor Hamroev, 
member of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU); Ms. Saida Kurbanova, 
Chairperson of the HRSU in Pakhtakor district; and Mr. Zuyadullo Razakov, Chairperson of the 
International Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan in Dzhizhak district. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 450 
 
</p>
<p>2596. Mr. Ihtiyor Hamroev has been the subject of three communications sent to your 
Government, on 11 August 2006, 23 January 2007, and 10 December 2007, in which concern 
was expressed that his detention and the subsequent extension of this detention may have been 
related to his and his father&#8217;s legitimate human rights activity. We acknowledge receipt of your 
Government&#8217;s response to the second of these communications on 6 February 2007. 
Ms. Saida Kurbanova was the subject of two communications to your Government, sent 
on 4 April 2006 and 13 March 2008, regarding harassment and intimidation against her for her 
human rights activities. We acknowledge receipt of your Government&#8217;s responses to both 
communications on 13 February 2007 and 22 April 2008 respectively. Communications have 
been sent regarding Mr. Utkir Pardaev on 26 May 2005 and 22 May 2006. We acknowledge 
receipt of your Government&#8217;s response to the first of these communications on 29 June 2005. 
</p>
<p>2597. According to information received, Visa requests take 21 days to process according to the 
visa application system. However, the aforementioned human rights defenders have all waited 
longer than that amount of time for their visas to be processed and the process has yet to be 
completed. 
</p>
<p>2598. On 6 February 2008, Mr. Utkir Pardaev applied for an exit visa but has not yet received a 
reply. He complained in writing to the head of the Otdel vizy&#8217; i registratsiy (OVIR - Department 
of Visa and Registration) but received no reply. He has since complained in writing to the office 
of the Dzhizhak Municipal Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>2599. On 4 March 2008, Mr. Mamir Azimov applied for an extension to his exit visa and on 
each of the four occasions when he has approached the OVIR has been told that no response has 
been received from Tashkent. 
</p>
<p>2600. On 16 March 2008, Mr. Ihtiyor Hamroev applied for an exit visa and paid 9,700 sums. 
He has asked for an explanation from the head of the OVIR six times and has been told that his 
application was refused under orders from the Uzbekistan National Security Service because of 
he was recently released from prison, having been granted an amnesty on 2 February 2008. He is 
currently seeking asylum in Kyrgyzstan because of fears that he will be arrested again. 
</p>
<p>2601. On 12 April 2008, Ms. Saida Kurbonova applied for an exit visa. She has approached the 
head of the OVIR eight times and has consistently been told that permission for her exit visa has 
not been granted in Tashkent. In April 2008 Mr. Ziyadullo Razakov also applied for an extension 
to his exit visa but has still not received a response. 
</p>
<p>2602. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned human rights defenders have not been 
granted exit visas because of their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights. Further 
concern was expressed that, without being able to leave Uzbekistan, they will not be able to 
carry out their work effectively. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2603. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 29 July 2008. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 5 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2604. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government concerning Mr. Igor Vorontsov, 
Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Uzbekistan. At the time that the letter was sent 
Mr. Igor Vorontsov was reportedly waiting for the approval of his application for accreditation to 
work with HRW in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2605. Since 2004, various HRW employees in Uzbekistan have allegedly been restricted from 
doing their work. Former Director of the HRW office in Tashkent, Ms. Allison Gill, was forced 
to work outside Uzbekistan for several months between 2004 and 2005 when the Uzbek 
authorities refused to renew her visa. In spring 2005, Mr. Carlo Boehm, HRW&#8217;s Tashkent 
associate at the time, was denied accreditation. So too was his successor, Ms. Mihra Rittmann, 
in 2007. Mr. Igor Vorontsov&#8217;s predecessor as Director of HRW in Uzbekistan, Ms. Andrea Berg, 
was also denied accreditation in April 2007 before that decision was reversed. 
</p>
<p>2606. According to information received, in early February 2008, Mr. Igor Vorontsov began 
work as a representative for HRW in Uzbekistan and applied for accreditation with the 
authorities. His application was rejected on the grounds that he was not suitably qualified for the 
position, in a letter dated 8 May 2008 and signed by the Deputy Minister for Justice. HRW 
appealed this decision in writing on 12 June 2008, and in meetings with the Uzbek authorities 
between 2 and 4 July 2008. During these meetings the authorities affirmed that their problem 
was not with HRW but with the unsuitability of Mr. Igor Vorontsov as a candidate for the 
position. On 16 July 2008, the Uzbek authorities informed HRW by telephone that they would 
not be willing to reconsider their decision regarding Mr. Igor Vorontsov, although a non-Russian 
candidate would be considered. 
</p>
<p>2607. On 19 July 2008, Mr. Igor Vorontsov received a report from the HRW office in Tashkent 
which informed him that officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs had been looking for him 
and that they had left a message to say that &#8220;it would not be advisable for the HRW 
representative to attempt returning to Uzbekistan&#8221;. Soon afterwards, he received a telephone call 
from a man who claimed to be calling from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The caller did not 
give his name but told Mr. Igor Vorontsov that he had been banned from entering Uzbekistan 
under regulation number 408. No further details were given about the content of the regulation or 
the reasons for the decision. Mr. Igor Vorontsov was told to make a request in writing if he 
wished for any further information. 
</p>
<p>2608. Concern was expressed that, being unable to re-enter Uzbekistan, Mr. Igor Vorontsov 
would be unable to carry out his peaceful and legitimate activities in defense of human rights as 
a representative of HRW. Further concern was expressed that the reluctance to approve 
Mr. Igor Vorontsov&#8217;s accreditation might form part of an ongoing trend of harassment against 
human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, in particular those associated with HRW. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2610. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Akzam Turgunov and Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov. 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov is the executive director of Mazlum, a non-governmental organization 
dedicated to the defense of human rights. He has also worked as a public defender in cases 
involving human rights violations. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov is a founding member and leading 
journalist with Uznews.net, a member of the Real Union of Journalists of Uzbekistan, and a 
member of the Committee to Protect Individuals&#8217; Rights in Karakalpakstan. He has also worked 
for Radio Liberty and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, and has spoken out against 
human rights violations in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2611. According to new information received, on 11 July 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov was 
arrested in Manget, Karakalpakstan, on charges of extortion. While being held at a police 
detention centre in Nukus, he was taken to an investigator&#8217;s office on 14 July 2008, where 
boiling water was poured on his back. On 4 September 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov&#8217;s trial began 
at the Amudarya District Court in Nukus. It was resumed on 16 September 2008. 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov may face up to 15 years imprisonment on charges of extortion under 
Article 165, Part 3 of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The next hearing will be scheduled once 
a medical report on the alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Akzam Turgunov is available. 
</p>
<p>2612. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov was arrested on 7 June 2008, after drugs had reportedly 
been planted in his car. His trial before the Tahtakupir District Court commenced 
on 12 September 2008. The hearing was not open to the public. The police officers and the 
sniffer-dog specialist who had reported finding illegal drugs in Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov&#8217;s car 
were not present at the trial. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov has now been charged with &#8220;selling 
drugs in large consignment&#8221; under Article 25-273 (5) of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The 
new charges against Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov could result in a sentence of up to 20 years 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>2613. According to the Government&#8217;s response to Special Procedures mandate holders, 
received on 19 July 2008: &#8220;on 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdurakhmonov was indicted [&#8230;] under 
article 276, paragraph 2 (a) (Unlawful production, storage, purchase, carriage or transmission of 
narcotic or psychotropic substances in large quantities, without the purpose of sale) [italics 
added] of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2614. In view of the above allegations of ill-treatment of Mr. Akzam Turgunov, concern was 
expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. Further concern was expressed that the 
above described arrests, detention and trials may have been related to the activities of 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov and Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov in the defense of human rights. It is feared 
that the above incidents may form part of an ongoing pattern to restrict the work of members of 
Mazlum and other human rights defenders in Karakalpakstan. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2615. In a letter dated 10 November 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 23 September 2008. In its response, the Government informed that on 7 June 2008, the 
investigative department of the internal affairs office in the town of Nukus, Republic of 
Karakalpakstan, instituted criminal proceedings against Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich 
Abdurahmanov on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 276, part 2, 
paragraph (a), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The grounds were as follows: on 
7 June 2008, at approximately 7 p.m., on Dosnazarov Street in Nukus, a Zhiguli VAZ-2106 car 
with licence plate number 30 Y 3346 was stopped for a document check by officers of the traffic 
police and canine patrol squad of the Republic&#8217;s Ministry of Internal Affairs, who were carrying 
out an operation to prevent and suppress illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances, known as Black Poppy 2008. 
</p>
<p>2616. During the check, it was ascertained that the car in question was being driven by 
Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov, who was unable to produce a driver&#8217;s licence. In 
addition, Mr. Abdurahmanov was not the owner of the car. With his permission, a canine patrol 
officer and a police dog inspected the vehicle. As a result, substances with a specific odour were 
discovered hidden in the boot of the car, wrapped in a paper and cellophane package. In the 
presence of witnesses, these substances were confiscated for forensic analysis and sealed, and the 
appropriate documentation was completed. 
</p>
<p>2617. The results of the chemical analysis performed on 7 June 2008 showed that the 
substances found and confiscated from Mr. Abdurahmanov&#8217;s car included 114.18 grams of 
marijuana and 5.98 grams of opium, which was wrapped in paper. 
</p><p>2618. On 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdurahmanov, defended by Mr. B. Abdurahmanov, was charged 
under article 276, part 2, paragraph (a), of the Criminal Code and remanded in custody by a 
criminal judge. On the basis of all the evidence gathered, it was decided that Mr. Abdurahmanov 
had intended to attempt the sale of a large quantity of narcotics. Accordingly, on 5 August 2008, 
pursuant to article 362 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the charges previously brought 
against Mr. Abdurahmanov were amended, and he was charged under articles 25 and 273, part 5, 
of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>2619. On 6 August 2008, the pretrial investigation was completed, and the criminal case was 
referred for trial, in accordance with the established procedure, to the Takhtakupyr District 
Criminal Court of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The Takhtakupyr District Criminal Court 
found the accused, Mr. Abdurahmanov, guilty and sentenced him to 10 years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty. It should also be noted that the Criminal charges brought against Mr. Akzam Olimovich 
Turgunov and Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov are in no way related to their human 
rights work. No complaints or statements from Mr. Turgunov regarding the use of unlawful 
investigation methods have been received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2621. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov and 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov is a founding member and leading journalist 
with Uznews.net, a member of the Real Union of Journalists of Uzbekistan, and a member of the 
Committee to Protect Individuals&#8217; Rights in Karakalpakstan. He has also worked for Radio 
Liberty and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, and has spoken out against human rights 
violations in Uzbekistan. Mr. Akzam Turgunov has worked as a public defender in cases 
involving human rights violations and is the executive director of Mazlum, a non-governmental 
organization dedicated to the defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2622. According to new information received, on 10 October 2008, Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov 
was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment by Nukus Court under charges of &#8220;selling drugs in 
large consignment&#8221; (Article 25-273, Part 5 of the Uzbek Criminal Code). These charges were 
different from the original charges brought against Mr. Salijon Abdurahmonov according to your 
Government&#8217;s response to the communication sent by mandate-holders, received on 
19 July 2008. In this response it was stated that &#8220;on 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdurakhmonov was 
indicted [&#8230;] under article 276, paragraph 2 (a) (Unlawful production, storage, purchase, carriage 
or transmission of narcotic or psychotropic substances in large quantities, without the purpose of 
sale) [italics added] of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan&#8221;. It is believed that the charges brought 
against Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov may have been fabricated and that the evidence used against 
him may be based on the discovery of drugs which were planted in his car. The place where 
Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov is currently detained is unknown. 
</p><p>2623. On 23 October 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment by 
a court in Manget, Karakalpakstan, on charges of extortion (Article 165, Part 3 of the Criminal 
Code of Uzbekistan). He is currently in detention in colony 64/9, Nukus. Mr. Akzam Turgunov 
has reportedly been subjected to ill-treatment while in detention since n 11 July 2008. 
2624. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov and 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov may be related to their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights. 
Further concern was expressed that this may form part of an ongoing pattern to restrict the work 
of members of Mazlum and other human rights defenders in Karakalpakstan. In view of the 
allegations of the secret detention of Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov and the ill-treatment of 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2625. In letters dated 10 November 2008 and 23 January 2009, the Government responded to 
the communication of 28 October 2008. The Government reported that, in accordance with the 
judgement handed down on 23 October 2008 by the Amudarin District Criminal Court of the 
Republic of Karakalpakstan, Mr. Akzam Olimovich Turgunov was found guilty of 
extorting 00,000 sum from Mr. O. Khuzhabaev and sentenced, under article 165, part 3, 
paragraph (a), of the Uzbek Criminal Code, to 10 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, the punishment to 
be served in an ordinary-regime colony. </p>

</p><p>2627. By a judgement of the Takhtakupyr District Criminal Court of the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan of 10 October 2008, Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov was found

5.98 grams of opium - and sentenced, under articles 25 and 273, part 5, of the Uzbek Criminal 
Code, to 10 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, the punishment to be served in an ordinary-regime 
colony. 
</p>
<p>2628. In criminal appellate proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan on 19 November 2008, the judgement concerning Mr. Abdurahmanov was 
upheld. 
</p>
<p>2629. The commission by Mr. Turgunov and Mr. Abdurahmanov of particularly serious crimes 
was proved by the case files, and the sentence imposed was commensurate with their crimes.

</b></p>
<p>2630. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2631. On 12 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur  
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Mr. Abdurasul Khudoynazarov, a member of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) 
&#8220;Ezgulik&#8221;. He has worked to combat corruption within the Uzbek law enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>2632. According to new information received, on 26 June 2005, Mr. Abdurasul Khudoynazarov 
was arrested. He was then condemned to nine years&#8217; imprisonment by the Criminal Court of 
Tashkent under Articles 165 and 168 of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan on charges of extortion 
and fraud, respectively. He is currently detained in prison N64/1, where he is reportedly tortured 
and humiliated by prison guards on a daily basis. He informed his colleagues at HRSU about the 
conditions of detention in the prison and attempted to bring these conditions to the attention of 
the special prosecutor, but was subsequently placed in solitary confinement. From 12 
to 24 June 008, he again attempted to protest against the conditions of detention but was 
given 15 more days of solitary confinement. On 1 September 2008, he attempted to hang himself 
to death but was stopped by the prison guards. 
</p>
<p>2633. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention, and ill-treatment of 
Mr. Abdurasul Khudoynazarov may be related to his legitimate activities in the defense of 
human rights, in particular his work to expose corruption by the Uzbek law enforcement 
authorities and attempts to expose the poor conditions of detention in prison N64/1. Serious 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdurasul 
Khudoynazarov. Further concern was expressed that the ill-treatment of Mr. Abdurasul 
Khudoynazarov may form part of an ongoing trend of harassment against members of HRSU. </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2634. In a letter dated 29 December 2008, the Government responded to the communication 
of 12 November 2008. In its response, the Government informed that the convicted criminal 
Rasul hudoynazarov was born on 13 August 1956 in the town of Angren, in Tashkent province. 
He had previously been sentenced on 5 June 2001 by the Angren municipal court to six years&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty under articles 210 (2), 205 (1) and 209 (2). On 22 August 2001 he was 
released under a presidential amnesty decree. 
</p>
<p>2635. In the current case, on 12 January 2006 he was sentenced to nine years and six months&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty by the Angren municipal criminal court, under articles 227 (2), 168 (1), 
165 (2), 59 and 61 of the Criminal Code. According to the judgement, in June 2005, 
Mr. Khudoynazarov, while working as a defence and emergency response instructor at the 
Uzbekkumir Joint Stock Company and presiding over the Ezgulik human rights association in 
Angren, accused the son of Ms. M. Eshonkulova, Mr. M. Eshonkulov, of theft and filed a 
slanderous statement with the law enforcement authorities. He forced Mr. Eshonkulov to hand 
over his property, and in July 2005 was arrested in his office upon receiving US$ 300. He is 
serving his sentence at the UY 64/21 penitentiary. He has been diagnosed by the prison medical 
unit as having chronic bronchitis, and has on several occasions been treated as an out-patient 
under this diagnosis. 
</p>
<p>2636. Since beginning his sentence, he has been subjected four times to disciplinary measures 
for violating prison regulations; he has been confined in the disciplinary section twice, each time 
for five days. He has been granted seven long and seven short visits. In August 2007 he was 
allowed a visit by a lawyer, Ms. V.A. Inoyatova. On checking, it has been established that 
Mr. Khudoynazarov has not attempted suicide during his sentence, and has not reported or 
complained to the prison governor about being subjected to torture or degrading treatment. On 
31 August 2008 the administrative board refused Mr. Khudoynazarov&#8217;s transfer to an open 
prison because of his breaches of prison regulations. Uzbek criminal law contains no articles 
punishing human rights activities. So-called &#8220;human rights defenders&#8221; who are in places of 
detention have committed specific crimes, violating the country&#8217;s laws. How can criminals, 
offenders against law and order, be called &#8220;human rights defenders&#8221;? The enforcement of prison 
regulations under current national law is not an infringement of convicts&#8217; rights and legitimate 
interests.

<p>2648. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 23 de noviembre de 2008, se celebraron en 
Venezuela las elecciones regionales. En horas de la madrugada del d&#237;a siguiente 
GLOBOVISI&#211;N habr&#237;a transmitido en vivo el bolet&#237;n oficial de resultados de la autoridad

resultados electos en casi todas las Gobernaciones del pa&#237;s, salvo en los estados Carabobo y 
T&#225;chira, los cuales fueron dados pocas horas despu&#233;s. GLOBOVISI&#211;N y otros medios de

GLOBOVISI&#211;N que hab&#237;a iniciado un nuevo procedimiento sancionatorio en su contra por 
considerar que la misma habr&#237;a difundido, durante la cobertura de dichos comicios regionales y

<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 29 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2655. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an allegation letter concerning several 
incidents of allegedly arbitrary killings of indigenous Degar individuals by your Government&#8217;s 
security forces. </p>

</p>
<p>2656. According to the information received, on 14 April 2008, Y-Cung Nie, born in 1982, 
from the village of Buon Cuor Hdang, district of Cu Mgar in Daklak province, took part in a 
demonstration at the commune of Ia Knuec to demand the release of three Degars arrested on 
9 April. Not long after he arrived home on the same day, security police from the district of 
Cu Mgar arrested him in his home and took him into a nearby wooded area. Soon thereafter, the 
security police returned to the village and told Y-Cung Nie&#8217;s parents and family that they had 
killed him and wanted the family to go pick up his corpse and bury it. 
</p>
<p>2657. The security police threatened the family not to tell anyone about Y-Cung Nie&#8217;s death, 
particularly not Degars living in the United States. They said that they would come back and kill 
them all if they did. When the family went to pick up the corpse, they saw that he had been 
beaten beyond recognition. His face and body were covered with blood, his skull was fractured 
and his entire body was bruised. The security police watched the family while they cleaned and 
dressed the corpse and stayed until the burial had taken place on 16 April 2008 to prevent 
pictures of the corpse from being taken. 
</p>
<p>2658. Y-Song Nie, a 24-year-old man from Buon Pok village, commune Ea Ken, district 
Krong Pac in Daklak province, married with children, and Y-Huang Nie, aged 23, from 
Buon Kreh village, commune Ea Ken, district Krong Pac in Daklak province, married with 
children, also took part in the same demonstration on 14 April 2008. They were on their way 
back to their villages from Ia Knuec when they were detained by security police. The security 
police broke both men&#8217;s legs, both their hands and cracked their skulls. The security police then 
returned the remains to the families and ordered them to bury the corpses. They gave each of the 
families one 100 kg bag of rice and one million dong (corresponding to 66 USD). The security 
police also told the families: &#8220;If anyone of you reports this incident to the international 
community or to Kok Ksor [President of the Montagnard Foundation, Inc.], we will come and 
kill all of you.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2659. On 22 June 2008, A Lat, aged 61, and A Brin, aged 46, two men from Plei Kuk Gyer 
village, commune of An Thanh, Dak Bo district in Gialai province, were among a group of 
approximately 35 Degar Catholics trying to cross a lake in canoes to reach a sacred place near 
Ploi Hamong Katu village, as they would do twice a month. When they approached the other 
side of the lake security police ambushed them and began throwing heavy rocks at the canoes. A 
Lat and A Brin were hit by rocks on their heads, fell into the lake and drowned. The families 
wished to bury their dead at the sacred site, but the security forces forced them to carry the 
corpses back to their village for burial. 
</p>
<p>2660. On 9 August 2008, Y-Phit Kbuor and his two sons encountered soldiers on the road back 
to their village Buon Tri after fishing at the river of Ea Kin about 20 km from the village. The 
soldiers stopped them and ordered them to raise their hands. However, while they were raising 
their hands, the soldiers opened fire at them. Y-Phit Kbuor died on the spot, while his two sons 
escaped and returned home to their village. Many villagers accompanied the family to pick up 
the corpse of Y-Phit Kbuor. At the site of the incident, they found the soldiers still there. The 
soldiers apologized, said that they had made a mistake, and paid the family ten million dong 
(approximately $660 USD) for the coffin and the cost of the burial ceremony. </p>

<p><b>Responses from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2661. By a letter dated 29 October 2008, the Government responded to the communication, 
indicating that: 
</p>
<p>2662. &#8220;When receiving your above said letters the professional agencies of Viet Nam carried 
out an investigation on the alleged cases mentioned in your letter. They found out that in Gia Lai 
province, there is no village named after Plei Kuk Dyers, no district named after Dak Bo, but 
there is a district named after Dak Po. They also found out that there were no men named after A 
Lat and A Brin who were drowned in a lake on 22 Merle 2008. They found a report saying that 
two persons were drowned on 25 June 2008. These two persons were Dinh Lak, born in 1948 
and Dinh Prin, born in 1961. They together with eight persons of ethnic minority are residing at 
Kuk Kon village, An Thanh commune, Dak Po district, Gia Lai Province. When hearing the 
news that Virgin Mary would appear at Dak Mon commune, Dak Ha district, Kon Tum province, 
they went to this place (Dak Mon commune) to participate in their religious activity 
on 25 June 2008. On the way back, their boat was upturned, causing the drowned death of 
Dinh Lak and Dish Prig. 
</p>
<p>2663. Therefore, the information mentioned in your letter that A Lat. aged 61 and A Brin, 
aged 46, from Plei Kuk Gyer village, An thanh commune, Dac Bo district, Gia Lai province, 
were drowned by the security forces, was untrue. 
</p>
<p>2664. The results of the investigation showed that all alleged cases mentioned in your letter 
were wrong, thus causing great difficulties for and took the investigators much time to verify the 
cases. Moreover, investigations of wrong cases waste a lot of resources while Viet Nam is still 
poor and needs scarce resources for her socio-economic development programmes in general and 
for the development of the ethnic communities in particular.&#8221;

<p><b>Letter of allegation sent on 3 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2666. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the banning of the 
monthly publication Abwab, the weekly Al-Sabbah, and the website aleshteraki.net 
as well as the prosecution of Mr. Nayef Hassan, editor of the daily Al-Sharea and 
Mr. Abdulkarim Al-Khaiwani, a freelance journalist. 
</p><p>2667. According to the information received, on 14 March 2008, the first issue of the monthly 
Abwab, which is printed in Dubai, was seized by the authorities upon arrival in Sanaa airport. It 
is reported that the main reason for this confiscation was that its cover was considered to be 
disrespectful to the President. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 462 
 
</p>
<p>2668. On the same day, distribution of the weekly Al-Sabbah, which takes a critical stance 
regarding the Government, was prohibited by the Ministry of Information due to an alleged 
&#8220;failure to respect legal procedures&#8221; when it was created. 
</p>
<p>2669. Reportedly, access to the website aleshteraki.net, which voices the opinions and views of 
the main opposition party, has also been blocked since 12 March. 
</p>
<p>2670. Mr. Hassan and Mr. Al-Khaiwani are currently being prosecuted for disseminating 
reports that are &#8220;liable to undermine army morale&#8221;, for which it is reported they could be 
sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>2671. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 3 April 2008.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 10 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2672. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding Mr. Yahya Ghaleb Ahmed, Mr. Ali Dahmas, Mr. Abdelhameed Taleb 
Muthana, all three members of the Yemeni Socialist Party Central Committee in Dhaleh, 
Mr. Hassan Baa&#8217;um, member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party, his son,

Mr. Muhamad Al-Shamiri, Mr. Abdu Muhamad Al-Rasani, Mr. Amin Abdu Ali, 
Mr. Bashir Al-Raymi, and Dr. Omar Al-Murshidi. According to the information received, the 
persons mentioned above and others, whose identity could not yet be ascertained, have been 
arrested by Yemeni security forces on 31 March and 1 April 2008 in the cities of Aden, 
al-Dhali&#8217;, Abyan, and Taez, as well as in the region of Radfan, the main city of which is 
Habilayn. A number of the detainees are held incommunicado at unknown places of detention. A 
number of the arrests took place with unnecessary violence in the middle of the night at some of 
these persons&#8217; homes. 
</p>
<p>2673. The reasons for their arrests remain unclear. However, it is reported that the 
above-mentioned persons support the protests and activities of retired soldiers and would-be 
recruits from the Southern Governorates of Yemen who have raised concern about 
discrimination when seeking employment and with respect to salaries and pensions in 
comparison to retired soldiers from the North of the country. </p>

<p>2674. Mr. Akram Al-Qubbati, Mr. Najeeb Al-Mikhlafi, Mr. Mansour Abdelmula, 
Mr. Ahmed Al-Tamimi, Mr. Amin Ali Farhan, Mr. Fahd Al-Yusufi, Mr. Muhamad Al-Shamiri, 
Mr. Abdu Muhamad Al-Rasani, Mr. Amin Abdu Ali, Mr. Bashir Al-Raymi, and 
Dr. Omar Al-Murshidi were arrested on 1 April in Taez after a demonstration of solidarity with 
the arrests carried out on the previous day. They reportedly remain in detention. 
</p>
<p>2675. Some of the persons had been previously arrested in the months of August and 
September 2007 for taking part in protests at Liberty Square, Aden, and in al-Mukalla.  
</p>
<p>2676. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of the above mentioned individuals 
might be solely connected to their reportedly peaceful activities in favour of retired soldiers and 
to their protest against perceived discrimination. In view of the reported incommunicado 
detention at unknown places of detention of some of the detainees, further concerns are 
expressed that they might be at risk of ill-treatment. The situation of retired soldiers has already 
been the subject matter of a joint urgent appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 15 August 2007, 
which has regrettably remained without a reply from Your Excellency&#8217;s Government to date. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2677. By a letter dated 6 May 2008, the Government responded to the communication, 
indicating that: &#8220;The persons in the question raised in your above mentioned communication 
were arrested based on instructions from the Office of the Attorney General, and cases filed 
against them have been forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for legal action&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 16 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2679. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations 
concerning Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni. 
</p>
<p>2680. According to the information received, on 5 April 2008, Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni was arrested 
by agents of the Political Security Organization of Taiz on his way to a festival in Aden. He was 
charged with inciting an armed overthrow of the government and insulting the President. 
</p>
<p>2681. The Office of the Attorney General issued a detention order against Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni 
for a period of seven days, but he is allegedly being detained until he submits a written apology 
for publicly expressing his opinions regarding the alleged corruption of the President and the 
government. Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni has reportedly been ill-treated by security agents while in 
detention. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 464 
 
</p>
<p>2682. Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni has previously been arrested and imprisoned for recording songs 
critical of government policies, in July 2006. If Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni is found guilty he could be 
sentenced to up to six years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>2683. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Fahad Al-Qarni might solely 
be connected to his reportedly peaceful activities in defending human rights, in particular the 
exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concerns were expressed for 
his physical and psychological integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2684. In a letter dated 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the communication. 
The Government reported that a review by the competent court had been conducted on 
Mr. al-Oarni&#8217;s case and he was sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment, and fined to 
500.000 Yemeni Riyals for instigating an armed mutiny during his participation in a public 
political rally.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 16 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2686. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the sentencing to six years&#8217; imprisonment of journalist and human rights defender 
Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani. Mr. al-Khaiwani is former Editor-in-Chief of the pro-democracy 
online newspaper Al-Shoura, and he is also a well known pro-democracy activist and a 
campaigner for the right to freedom of expression in Yemen. 
</p>
<p>2687. According to information received, on 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani was 
sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment by a state security court in Sana&#8217;a for allegedly conspiring 
with anti-government rebels. He has been charged with insulting the President and &#8220;demoralising 
the military&#8221;, as well as having alleged links with an al-Houthi terrorist cell, based on articles 
written about the Sa&#8217;ada war in Yemen. 
</p>
<p>2688. According to reports, the newspaper for which Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani works has 
been closed and his website has been blocked. His family has also been subjected to physical 
abuse and threats. In 2004, Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani was sentenced to one year of 
imprisonment for allegedly supporting the late Hussain Badr al-Din al-Huthi, a cleric from the 
Zaidi community. On 20 June 2007, he was arrested at his home by plain clothed members of the 
National Security who reportedly dragged him from his bed and assaulted him. His arrest was 
linked to allegations of association with an al-Houthi terrorist cell, accusations which are 
claimed to have been fabricated. 
</p>
<p>2689. Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani has previously reported on human rights violations against 
the Zaidi community and those suspected of having links to al-Houthi. On 27 August 2007, after 
having been released from prison on bail, Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani was abducted and 
tortured by a gang of armed men. It is believed that this attack was linked to a report he was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 465 
 
</p>
<p>about to publish on conditions in Yemeni prisons. On 17 June 2008, Mr. Abdul-Karim 
al-Khaiwani was due to travel to London to accept Amnesty International&#8217;s &#8220;Special Award for 
Human Rights Journalism under Threat.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2690. Concern was expressed that Mr. Abdul-Karim al-Khaiwani sentencing to six years&#8217; 
imprisonment is linked to his legitimate work to provide information about the 4-year old 
conflict in Sa&#8217;ada, promote democracy and the right to freedom of expression in Yemen. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2691. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 16 June 2008.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 14 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2692. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning Mr. Louay Abdulwahab Ali Al- Mouayyad, aged 24, residing at Freedom Avenue, 
journalist and human rights defender, member of the &#171; Organisation for democratic rights and 
liberties &#187;, executive director of the portal &#8216;Free Y&#233;men&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>2693. According to the information received, Mr. Louay Abdulwahab Ali Al-Mouayyad was 
arrested at his home on 20 June 2008 by several security services (Al Amn Assiyassi) officers in 
civil clothes accompanied by some militaries. They did not present any arrest warrant and did 
not explain the reasons for arrest. They then took him to an unknown place. That evening the 
family was advised to prepare his laptop and the medicine he needs. The family was also able to 
speak to Mr. Al-Mouayyad. Since then the family has not had any information about his 
whereabouts in spite of many attempts to find out where he is with the security services and the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>2694. With a view to the alleged secret detention of Mr. Al-Mouayyad, concern was expressed 
for his physical and mental integrity, in particular since he might not have access to the 
medication he needs. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2695. In a letter dated 22 October 2008, the Government informed that Mr. Louay Abdulwahab 
Ali Al-Mouayyad had been released.

<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>2697. In a letter dated 31 October 2008, the Government responded to a joint urgent appeal 
of 31 August 2007. The Government reported that &#8220;The Napha Society for the Defense of 
Prisoners and Human Rights substituted and continued the work of the &#8216;Friends of the Prisoner </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 466 
 
</p>
<p>Society&#8217; also know as &#8216;Ansar El-Sageen&#8217;. On 31 August 2006, the Minister of Defense declared 
the &#8216;Friends of the Prisoner Society&#8217; to be an unlawful organization based on its connections 
with the Hamas terrorist organization. This decision stated that the declaration is also valid for 
any other name in which the organization shall be named in the future, including any section, 
branch, group or faction of it. As a result, though the organization changed its name, according 
to the Minister&#8217;s decision it remains an unlawful organization. Furthermore, according to 
information presented to the Minister of Defense and the Commander of the IDF Forces in the 
West Bank, the Napha Society continues to maintain various connections with the Hamas 
terrorist organization. Due to all of the above and the threat posed by the Napha Society for 
public safety and the security of the state of Israel, the decision remains firm&#8221;.

<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 26 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2699. The Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of the human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, sent a letter of allegations regarding a group of teachers and members of the 
Progressive Teachers&#8217; Union (PTUZ), including Messrs Takavafira Zhou (president), 
Raymond Majongwe (secretary general), Harrison Mudzuri, Landistoun Zunde, Oswald 
Mudziva, Bernard Shoko, Charles Mubwandarika, and Ms. Linda Simande, currently involved in 
a campaign entitled &#8220;Save our Education&#8221; which highlights shortcomings in the education 
system in Zimbabwe. According to information received: 
</p>
<p>2700. On 19 February 2008, the aforementioned members of the Progressive Teachers&#8217; Union 
(PTUZ) were reportedly engaged in a peaceful protest, distributing leaflets in Harare as part of 
the &#8220;Save our Education&#8221; campaign. 
</p>
<p>2701. While on Fourth St, the protesters were accosted by a number of unidentified youths, 
who reportedly brought them to a building used by the ruling political party, the Zimbabwe 
African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), where they assaulted them. 
</p>
<p>2702. The assailants reportedly hit and kicked the protesters with clenched feet, open palms, 
booted feet and iron rods. One female teacher was reportedly stripped naked in front of her male 
colleagues and assailants, and had her genital area repeatedly stepped upon. During the assaults, 
the victims were accused of being activists from the opposition party Movement for Democratic 
Change. 
</p>
<p>2703. Reports indicate that police officers arrived and took the teachers to Harare central police 
station where it is believed they may also have been subjected to ill-treatment. Lawyers were 
reportedly initially denied access to the teachers by one Detective Chief Inspector Manjengwa; 
with one lawyer being forcibly escorted from the police station. Offers to transfer the teachers to 
hospital were rejected by police despite their need of medical attention. They were eventually </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 467 
 
</p>
<p>transferred to Harare Central Hospital in a pick-up truck, from where, after several hours delay 
awaiting medical attention, they were transferred to the Avenues Clinic, where they were 
admitted for treatment. 
</p>
<p>2704. Concern was expressed that the assault and ill-treatment of the aforementioned persons 
may be directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, particularly their exercising 
of the right to freedom of expression and assembly. In view of reports of their ill-treatment, 
further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2705. By a letter dated 2 April 2008 (resent on 13 May and 1 July 2008), the Government 
responded to the communication, indicating that the persons named in the communication are all 
facing police investigations. On 19 February 2008, the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe 
members went to ZANU PF Harare Provincial Headquarters where they threw fliers within the 
party premises. The fliers contained MDC political messages. This did not go down well with the 
ZANU PF supporters who where at the party headquarters. Subsequently a skirmish ensued 
between the ZANU PF supporters and members of the teachers association who were led by 
Raymond Majongwe. The police got wind of the disturbances and upon arrival at the party 
headquarters, arrested nine members of the teachers association and two ZANU PF youths. 
Observations made by the police at the time of arrest were that indeed some of the members of 
the Progressive Teacher&#8217;s Association had sustained injuries as a result of the scuffle. All the 
suspects were taken to the police station where initial documentation was done and arrangements 
made for the injured to be taken to hospital. At no time were the suspects subjected to any form 
of ill-treatment by the police as alleged in the communication. It was important for suspects to be 
taken to a government hospital first, to facilitate for the obtaining of a medical report that would 
be acceptable in court since the injuries were as a result of an assault that was subject of 
investigation. It is not true that they were assaulted by unidentified youths. Two ZANU PF 
youths Trymore Chikupala (33) and Cleopas Gutsa (26) are being charged for assaulting them. 
At no stage did the police assault or ill-treat them. It is also not true that the injured were denied 
access to medical attention, as it is the police who ferried the suspects in a police vehicle to a 
government hospital. It is unfair to suggest that the delay in attending to the suspects at the 
hospital can be apportioned to the police. The police do not run hospitals but police stations. The 
Government indicated that it did its part by taking them to the hospital. In Zimbabwe most of the 
operation vehicles are pick-ups and to infer that we should have used a more comfortable vehicle 
is also misplaced. It is a blatant lie that the accused were released without any charge. Members 
of the PTUZ were charged for contravening Chapter 46 of the Criminal Codification Reform Act 
Chapter 9.23, &#8216;Criminal nuisance&#8217;. After their discharge from the Avenues Clinic, they appeared 
in court on 5 March 2008 and were released on $50 million bail each while the two ZANU PF 
youth were also released under the same bail conditions. They will appear before a court 
on 19 March 2008.

</b></p>
<p>2707. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Barry Bearak, a Johannesburg-based 
journalist with the New York Times, and another journalist, whose identity has not yet been 
disclosed by Your Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p>2708. According to information received, on 3 April 2008 the police raided the York Lodge in 
Harare, a hotel where many foreign journalists have been staying to cover the 29 March 2008 
elections, and arrested five foreign journalists, including Mr. Bearak. Three of the arrested 
journalists were later released. Mr. Bearak is reported to be maintained in detention, for allegedly 
practising journalism without accreditation in violation of the Access to Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act. The identity of the second detained journalist has not been disclosed 
by police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena, who confirmed the arrests. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2709. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 7 April 2008.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2710. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Frank Chikowore, freelance 
journalist accredited with the Media and Information Commission and the Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission. Mr. Chikowore was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
sent on 24 May 2005, which has regrettably remained without a reply by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to date. 
</p>
<p>2711. According to the information received, on 15 April 2008 at 11 a.m., Mr. Chikowore was 
arrested by four policemen wearing anti-riot gear and three plain-clothes police officers. The 
policemen took Mr. Chikowore to his home, where they seized a computer, a recorder and a 
camera, before arresting him. He is currently being held in an unknown location. His lawyer has 
tried to obtain information about his whereabouts with the Harare police headquarters, which 
denies that Mr. Chikowore is being held.

<p>2712. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 16 April 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2713. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent an urgent appeal regarding reports of 
intimidation, violence and torture as a form of retribution or victimization in the aftermath of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 469 
 
</p>
<p>recent elections. According to the information received, between 29 March and 14 April 2008, 
160 cases of injury resulting from organized violence and torture have been treated by various 
doctors with many of the patients still remaining in hospital. One third of the patients were 
women. A fifth of the victims were members of the opposition Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) and another 20 per cent were involved in the elections for the Zimbabwe 
Electoral Commission (ZEC). Nine patients sustained fractures (broken bones), reportedly 
typical of &#8220;defence injuries&#8221;, resulting from the victim raising his or her hands and arms to 
protect the face and upper body from assault.  
</p>
<p>2714. At least two politically motivated murders, 15 abductions of women, 288 cases of homes 
destroyed through politically motivated arson subjecting 175 families and 14 persons to 
displacement, and 48 cases of assault took place during this period. The majority of persons 
displaced are said to be women and children. About 70 MDC members have been arrested in the 
last few days. 
</p>
<p>2715. The above-described violence has been perpetrated by police officers, soldiers and 
members of the ruling Zanu PF party as part of a retributive and reprisal campaign mainly in 
rural areas, where people have voted for opposition candidates. In many instances victims were 
told that they were being victimized because they support the opposition; they were accused of 
&#8220;celebrating the MDC victory&#8221;,&#8221; of selling the country to the whites&#8221; and/or &#8220;of being 
responsible for the rigging of elections in favour of the MDC&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2716. Reports also indicate that the authorities are targeting the independent local and foreign 
media, attempting to impede reporting on the current situation and the aftermath of the election, 
by resorting increasingly to police harassment and the arrest and detention of journalists; the 
deportation of one foreign journalist has been reported. 
</p><p>2717. In parallel, the State-controlled media is reportedly airing programmes and songs 
encouraging violence, such as &#8220;Mr. Government&#8221; by Man Soul Jah, which celebrates the 
Government&#8217;s land seizures and calls for the decimation of perceived political sell-outs (the song 
says: &#8220;We are living like squatters in the land of our heritage ... give me my spear so that I can 
kill the many sell-outs in my forefathers&#8217; country.&#8221;) and a well known song encouraging people 
to take up arms and fight for their freedom aired by ZTV. Moreover, reports have appeared that 
there are plans to entrust the distribution of food aid to the military in order to control the 
population through the politicization of food distribution. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2718. By a letter dated 11 June 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that, among other things, &#8220;it is indeed true that some isolated and localised cases of 
violence have occurred in the country during the post-election period, but nothing to the scale 
painted by the MDC-T in its current diplomatic and information offensive. 
</p>
<p>2719. There is overwhelming evidence which points to the fact that the MDC-T premeditated 
and planned this violence well ahead of the March 29th 2008 Harmonised Elections as part of its 
grand strategy aimed at inviting foreign intervention. By contrast, without attempting to diminish 
its culpability where warranted, the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU-PF)&#8217;s 
actions have largely tended to be reactive, self-defensive and retaliatory. Government wishes to </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 470 
 
</p>
<p>reassure the esteemed Council that there is no rule of law or governance deficit in Zimbabwe. 
The overall security situation is under control and not in decline. The ZRP, acting alone under its 
constitutional mandate and without recourse to the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF), has been 
able to contain this violence. Government is in firm control and exercising its legitimate mandate 
to protect all its citizens, without discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations

<p>2720. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 30 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2721. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Frank Chikowore, freelance 
journalist accredited with the Media and Information Commission and the Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission, on behalf of whom an urgent appeal was sent on 16 April 2008 by the 
vice-Chairperson of the working Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>2722. On 15 April 2008, Mr. Chikowore was arrested by police officers. His lawyer tried to 
obtain information about his whereabouts with the Harare police headquarters, which at first 
denied that Mr. Chikowore was being held.  
</p>
<p>2723. According to additional information received, Mr. Chikowore has been detained from the 
time of his arrest on 15 April to 21 April at the Harare Central Police Station, and then 
transferred to a remand prison in Harare. It is reported that although the police made numerous 
accusations against Mr. Chikowore, no charges have yet been brought against him. It is further 
reported that on 17 April, Mr. Chikowore&#8217;s lawyer filed an urgent High Court application 
requesting that his client be hospitalized for abdominal and chest pains, but that to date, 
Mr. Chikowore has not received any medical treatment. 
</p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2725. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal concerning the situation of Mr. Dzimbabwe Chimbga, lawyer and member of 
the non-governmental organization Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). 
Mr. Chimbga was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders on 28 March 2007.  
</p>
<p>2726. According to the information received, on 2 May 2008, on his way to Swaziland to attend 
the 43rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
Mr. Dzimbabwe Chimbga was approached by security agents before the immigration desk at </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 471 
 
</p>
<p>Harare International Airport. A total of nine confidential sets of documents were reportedly 
seized. These documents were case files of communications and complaints set to be argued by a 
ZLHR legal team against the Government of Zimbabwe. Also taken were copies of pre- and 
post-elections reports. The security agents recorded the personal and professional details of 
Mr. Chimbga, and warned him that they were going to &#8220;deal with [him] when [he] return[s] to 
Zimbabwe&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2727. Concern was expressed that these acts of intimidation against Mr. Chimbga and the 
seizure of the aforementioned documents may be solely related to his non-violent activities in 
defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2728. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 8 May 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 16 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2729. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding Mr. Lovemore Matombo and Mr. Wellington Chibebe (or Chibhebhe), respectively 
President and Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), and 
Mr. Raymond Majongwe, General Secretary of the Progressive Teachers&#8217; Union of Zimbabwe 
(PTUZ). 
</p>
<p>2730. Both Mr. Matombo and Mr. Chibebe were the subject of an urgent appeal jointly sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 15 September 2006. In 
addition, Mr. Chibebe was the subject of two joint urgent appeals by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
dated 15 February 2005 and 21 August 2006. Mr. Majongwe was the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 25 February 2008. While we 
appreciate the reply of your Government to the communication sent on 21 August 2006 
and 25 February 2008, we regret that responses to the communications of 15 February 2005 
and 15 September 2006 have not yet been received. 
</p>
<p>2731. According to new information received, on 8 May 2008, Mr. Lovemore Motombo and 
Mr. Wellington Chibebe were both arrested allegedly in connection with May Day speeches, 
during which they spoke about the political crisis due to the postponement of the announcement 
of the election results, and the ensuing wave of violent intimidation of opposition supporters. 
They were charged with &#8220;inciting people to rise against the Government and reporting 
falsehoods about people being killed&#8221;. On 6 May, heavily armed police personnel had come to </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
page 472 
 
</p>
<p>their homes to search them. On 7 May, they voluntarily reported to the police station, but were 
not taken in before 8 May 2008. They are currently held at the Harare Remand Prison. They have 
applied for release on bail, but the High Court of Zimbabwe will not deliver its judgment on this 
application until 19 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>2732. On 16 May 2008, Mr. Raymond Majongwe was arrested by the police at the High Court 
of Zimbabwe in Harare while he was attending the bail hearing of Mr. Lovemore Matombo and 
Mr. Wellington Chibebe. This arrest was allegedly in connection with the work of PTUZ in 
documenting the harassment of teachers at their workplace within the context of the current 
political violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>2733. Concern was expressed that the arrests of Mr. Lovemore Matombo, 
Mr. Wellington Chibebe and Mr. Raymond Majongwe may have been related to their work in 
defence of human rights, and in particular, to their reportedly peaceful exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological 
integrity while in detention, especially because both Mr. Lovemore Matombo and 
Mr. Wellington Chibebe were reportedly severely tortured in police custody in September 2006. 
Finally, concern was expressed that these latest incidents may have formed part of a continuous 
pattern of harassment and repression of Zimbabwe&#8217;s human rights defenders, including trade 
union leaders. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2734. By a letter dated 1 Juillet 2008, the Government responded to the letter of allegations, 
indicating that: &#8220;The correct facts are that Raymond Majongwe, Bwandarika (39),  
Rabat Hoary (35), Takavarika Zhou (40), Benard Zhou (52), Leviciuos Ziunde (38), 
Harrison Mudzuri (36), Oswald Madziva (38) Linda Fumaphanda (31) are indeed members of 
the Progressive Teachers Association of Zimbabwe.(PTUZ). On 19 February 2008 the 
Progressive Teachers Association of Zimbabwe members went to ZANU PF Harare Provincial 
Headquarters where upon they threw flyers within the party premises. The flyers contained 
abusive political messages and this did not go down well with the ZANU PF youths who where 
at the party headquarters. Subsequently a skirmish ensued between the ZANU PF youths and 
members of the teachers association who were led by Raymond Majongwe. The Police got wind 
of the disturbances and upon arrival at the party headquarters, arrested nine members of the 
teachers association and two ZANU -PF youths. 
</p>
<p>2735. Observations made by the Police during the time of arrest were that indeed some of the 
members of the Progressive Teacher&#8217;s Association had sustained injuries as a result of the 
scuffle. All the suspects were taken to the Police station where initial documentation was done 
and arrangements made for the injured to be taken to hospital. At no time were the suspects 
subjected to any form of ill treatment. It was important for suspects to be taken to a Government 
hospital first, to facilitate for the obtaining of a medical report that would be acceptable in covert 
since the injuries were as a result of an assault that was subject to investigation. 
</p><p>2736. It is therefore not true that they were assaulted by unidentified youths. Two ZANU PF 
youths Trymore Chjkupula (33) and Cleopas Gutsa (26) are facing assault charges. It is also not 
true that the injured were denied access to medical attention, as it is the Police who ferried the 
suspects in a Police Vehicle to a Government hospital. It is unfair to suggest that the delay in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 473 
 
</p>
<p>attending to the suspects at the hospital is attributable to the Police. We did our part by taking 
them to the hospitals. In Zimbabwe most of our operational vehicles are pick-ups and to infer 
that we should have used a more comfortable vehicle is also misplaced. It is a blatant lie that the 
accused were released without any charge. All were discharged from the Avenues Clinic and 
appeared in court on the 5th of March 2008. Members of the Progressive Teachers Association 
were charged for contravening Chapter 46 of the Criminal Codification Reform Act 
Chapter 9.23, Criminal nuisance and were released on 50 million Zimbabwe dollars bail each 
while the 2 ZANU PF youth were also released on the same bail conditions. The matter is still 
pending at Court. Harare Central Crime Register number 387/02/08 refers&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>2738. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Messrs 
Bernet Hasani Sono, Resemate Boy Chauke and Simon Maodi alias Musimani, employed by the 
television network Sky News, Mr. Craig Markram Edy, Mr. Sidney Saize, freelance journalist, 
Mr. Mathew Takaona, President of the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists, and 
Mr. Frank Chikowore, freelance journalist. 
</p><p>2739. According to the information received, on 23 May 2008, Messrs Bernet Hasani Sono, 
Resemate Boy Chauke and Simon Maodi were arrested and detained by police officers in 
Esigodini, Matabeleland South province, for possessing broadcasting equipment reportedly 
belonging to Sky News. Mr. Craig Markram Edy was also arrested as the material of the 
journalists was reportedly found in his home. On 30 May, they were convicted by Matabeleland 
provincial magistrate for violation of Section 33 of the Post and Telecommunications Act. 
However, they have not been sentenced yet because of a number of legal issues which need to be 
solved before a sentence can be passed. 
</p>
<p>2740. On 16 May 2008, Mr. Sidney Saize was assaulted by unknown assailants in Mutare on 
his way home, accusing him of &#8220;selling the country&#8221;. They offered him a lift home in an 
unmarked car, and after few miles, they kicked him with booted feet and punched him. They 
later left him on the roadside. 
</p>
<p>2741. On 17 April 2008, Mr. Mathew Takaona was assaulted and robbed by individuals 
reportedly wearing military uniforms. 
</p>
<p>2742. On 15 April 2008, Mr. Frank Chikowore was arrested on arson charges during an 
opposition strike. He was later released on bail pending trial. The trial dates are yet to be 
determined. 
</p>
<p>2743. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Messrs Bernet Hasani 
Sono, Resemate Boy Chauke and Simon Maodi and Frank Chikowore, and the assault against 
Messrs Sidney Saize and Mathew Takaona could be linked to their exercise of their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. </p>

urgent appeal regarding the situation of Mr. Philimon Sajeni, member of the human rights 
non-governmental organisation Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (CZC) and another member whose

responses of your Government received on 19 June and 4 September 2007. According to new 
information received: 
</p>
<p>2756. On 30 May 2008, Mr. Philimon Sajeni was arrested, together with another member, at the 
premises of the CZC by law enforcement officers and alleged Central Intelligence Organisation 
(CIO) agents. After searching the premises for broadcasting equipment, the authorities drove 
the 2 CZC members around for some time before releasing them with no charges. On 2 June 
2008, four men allegedly belonging to the CIO urged the guard of the CZC office to inform them 
about the activities of the Coalition. The guard refused to open the gate, and the four men warned 
him that they would come back. 
</p>
<p>2757. On 28 May 2008, Ms. Jenni Williams, Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu and 12 other WOZA 
members were arrested in Harare during a reportedly non-violent demonstration. The police 
reportedly used force to apprehend the demonstrators. They are all charged with distributing 
materials likely to cause a breach of the peace under Section 37 of the Criminal Law 
(Codification and Reform) Act. Ms. Jenni Williams is further charged for publishing or 
communicating false statements prejudicial to the State under Section 31 of the same Act. On 30 
and 31 May 2008, some WOZA members appeared in court and were granted bail. However, the 
State prosecutor appealed the decision and the 14 WOZA have since remained in custody: the 
13 female WOZA members are being held at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison; the male 
WOZA member is being held at Harare Central Remand Prison. Conditions of detention in both 
facilities are reportedly difficult. The 14 WOZA members are due to appear in court again 
on 6 June 2008. In mid-May 2008, three ZESN members were reportedly assaulted by members 
of the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front militia in Mt Darwin East, </p>

fractured arms, fractured fingers, deep cuts and bruises. However, admission to the hospital was 
reportedly denied to them.  
</p>
<p>2758. On 21 April 2008, the car of Mr. Musaiona Shortgame, parked outside his home in 
Mupandawana Growth Point, was set on fire by three unidentified individuals who ran away 
when Mr. Shortgame came out. Mr. Shortgame reportedly received a series of death threats prior 
to this incident. 
</p>
<p>2759. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest of Mr. Philimon Sajeni and his CZC 
colleague, the arrest and detention of Ms. Jenni Williams, Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu and 
12 other WOZA members, the assault against the three ZESN members and the threats and act of 
harassment against Mr. Musaiona Shortgame may be related to their reportedly non-violent 
activities in defense of human rights, in particular for some of them in the exercise of their right 
to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern was expressed that these incidents may 
form part of a pattern of harassment against human rights defenders in the aftermath of 
the 29 March elections.

</p>
<p>2763. In view of credible reports by numerous sources on the escalating level of violence in the 
wake of the second round of the presidential elections, we wished to express our strongest 
concern that the above mentioned cases appeared to be part of a systematic and widespread 
campaign of violence against citizens seeking to express their democratic opinions and elect the 
Government of their choice. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2764. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 27 June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 30 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2765. The Special Rappporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal regarding the situation of lawyers, judges and human rights defenders in 
Zimbabwe, in particular Mr. Mawadza, Bindura Provincial Magistrate; Ernest Jena, lawyer; and 
Mr. Trust Maanda, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights Regional Project Manager. According 
to the information received, on 23 June, Magistrate Mawadza was attacked and assaulted by 
Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) youths as he left a supermarket 
in Bindura. He had previously granted bail to detained Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC) activists. Mr. Mawadza continues to live in fear as no protection has been provided by 
the state.  
</p>
<p>2766. On 24 June 2008, around 9:00 a.m., Mr. Ernest Jena was abducted from his office by 
ZANU-PF youths who forced him into a green car. Some of the youths came back to his office 
looking for his assistant, Mr. Mashayamombe. They told Mr. Mashayamombe that Mr. Jena was 
at a base in Bindura. There are three ZANU-PF bases in Bindura, i.e. in Chiwaridzo, Chipadza 
and another. Mr. Jena was scheduled to appear before Magistrate Mr. Mawadza to argue matters 
of other detained activists. Reports from Mashonaland Central province suggest that Mr. Jena is 
being taken around to ZANU-PF militia bases across the province and being &#8216;taught a lesson&#8217;. It 
is reported that he was last seen or heard of at a base in Chiweshe. However, his concrete 
whereabouts continue to remain unknown. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 479 
 
</p>
<p>2767. On 23 June 2008, between 10.00 p.m. and 12.00 a.m., the police attempted to search the 
house of Mr. Trust Maanda without a warrant. When Mr. Maanda refused to open the door, they 
forced the gardener to open the gate. The police then searched the gardener&#8217;s lodgings, but could 
not find anything of interest. They interrogated and threatened the gardener and then requested 
him to appear at the police station at 9:00 a.m. the following day. 
</p>
<p>2768. On 24 June 2008, just before midnight, Mr. Trust Maanda returned home after working 
late when his way was blocked by several ZANU-PF militias waving placards. When he stopped 
the car, three or four of the militia forced him to turn the car and drive back to town. He called 
Mr. Tinoziva Bere, Law Society of Zimbabwe Counselor, who drove to meet him. The two met 
and had to wait at a roadblock at Mutare Teachers college gate where they asked the police 
officers for help. However, they refused to assist and referred the two to Mutare Central Police. 
They were required to wait at that police station until they received reports that the militias had 
moved away from Mr. Maanda&#8217;s house. Mr. Bere then escorted Mr. Maanda to his house 
around 1.15 a.m. and left only after Mr. Maanda had entered his house. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2769. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 30 June 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Letter of allegations sent on 3 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2770. The Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the arrest and detention of 
freelance journalists, Mr. Frank Chikowore and Mr. Edgar Mwandiambira in Harare. 
Mr. Frank Chikwore was previously the subject of an allegation letter on 24 May 2005 and of an 
urgent appeal on 3 June 2008, by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>2771. According to new information received, in the morning of 27 June 2008, at 
approximately 09.30 a.m., Mr. Frank Chikowore and Mr. Edgar Mwandiambira were arrested by 
police officers at Mhofu Primary School, in the suburb of Highfield, Harare. The journalists had 
reportedly approached the presiding officer at the polling station to request permission to cover 
election proceedings which were taking place at the school, at the opening of the run-off 
presidential elections. As Mr. Frank Chikowore and Mr. Edgar Mwandiambira were leaving the 
polling station, they were reportedly stopped by a police official, and were subsequently arrested 
and taken to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Law and Order section in Harare. 
Reports claim that both Mr. Frank Chikowore and Mr. Edgar Mwandiambira were detained 
overnight at Machipisa police station, before being released the following day. 
</p>
<p>2772. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned incident could represent a direct attempt 
to stifle independent reporting in Zimbabwe thus restricting the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2773. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communication of 3 July 2008. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 8 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2774. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Ms. Jenni Williams and 
Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, National Coordinator and Co-leader of Women of Zimbabwe Arise 
(WOZA) respectively. WOZA is a grassroots organization which works to promote and protect 
women&#8217;s activism. 
</p>
<p>2775. Since 2004, nine other communications were sent regarding Ms. Jenni Williams, 
Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu and several other WOZA members. The most recent one was sent 
on 6 June 2008, by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women. No response from the 
Government was received. 
</p>
<p>2776. According to new information received, on 3 July 2008, Ms. Jenni Williams and 
Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu were released on bail after over one month&#8217;s detention in Chikurubi 
Maximum Prison in Harare. They were scheduled to stand trial on 17 July 2008 on charges of 
&#8220;distributing material likely to cause a breach of the peace&#8221; under Section 37 of the Criminal 
Law (Codification and Reform) Act. 
</p>
<p>2777. Ms. Jenni Williams was also charged with &#8220;causing disaffection among defence forces&#8221; 
under Section 30, and &#8220;publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to the State&#8221; 
under Section 31 of the Criminal Law Act. She faced a maximum of 20 years&#8217; imprisonment 
whilst Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu faced a maximum of 5 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>2778. The two human rights defenders were previously arrested on 28 May 2008 in Harare at a 
peaceful demonstration against violence perpetrated by the state. 12 other members of WOZA 
were also arrested. They too were charged under Section 37 of the Criminal Law Act, were 
scheduled to stand trial on 17 July 2008, and faced a maximum of 5 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>2779. Serious concerns were expressed that the charges brought against Ms. Jenni Williams, 
Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu and the 12 other members of WOZA may have been related to their 
non-violent activities in the defense of human rights, in particular their work against 
state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe. Further concern was expressed that these incidents may 
have formed part of a pattern of harassment against human rights defenders in the aftermath of 
the 29 March elections. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2780. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to their communication of 8 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 27 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>2781. The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/4/Add.1 
  page 481 
 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the right to education and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal in relation to 
demonstrations organised by the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) and Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA). 
</p>
<p>2782. Previous communications were sent to your Government by various mandate-holders 
regarding ZINASU on 15 May 2006, 19 February 2007, 20 March 2007 and 20 July 2007. 
Responses from your Government were received on 21 May 2004, 5 August 2004, and 
12 October 2007. Several communications have been sent regarding WOZA. Most recently, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a communication regarding 
Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu of WOZA on 8 July 2008. No response has 
yet been received from your Government. 
</p>
<p>2783. According to information received, on 14 October 2008, at approximately 2.15 p.m., 
over 500 demonstrators gathered outside August House to present a petition to the Government 
of Zimbabwe in defence of their right to education. The petition reportedly addressed sanitation 
problems in colleges, uninhabitable student residences, educational materials, access to 
education and quality of education, academic freedom and institutional autonomy, and the 
closures of schools in Zimbabwe. The demonstrations included a march which was disrupted 
four times by armed riot police from the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). 
</p>
<p>2784. The President of the ZINASU, Mr. Clever Bere; the Secretary-General, 
Mr. Lovemore Chinoputsa; the Legal and Social Affairs Secretary, Mr. Courage Ngwarai; a 
General Councillor, Ms. Edwina Burira; and a Youth Forum member, Mr. (or Ms. ??) Tawanda 
Mutema, were all arrested. 
</p>
<p>2785. Some demonstrators were also hospitalised because of police violence. The Gender and 
Human Rights Secretary, Ms. Priviledge Mutanga was assaulted, sustaining head injuries and a 
swollen arm. Mr. or Ms. Obert Masaraura, a General Councillor from Midlands State University, 
also sustained serious head injuries. 
</p><p>2786. On 16 October 2008, a different peaceful demonstration was organised by WOZA to call 
for food to be provided for all Zimbabweans. Police reportedly used force against demonstrators, 
including the Co-leader of WOZA, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, with batons breaking one 
woman&#8217;s finger and causing bruises to another two women. Nine arrests were made in total. 
Seven demonstrators who had been arrested before the demonstrations began were released on 
the same day without charge after the intervention of a lawyer. However, on 17 October, 
Ms. Jenni Williams, the National Coordinator of WOZA, and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu were 
remanded in custody until 21 October 2008. They are reportedly denied the right to access a 
lawyer, and it is not clear what charges were brought against them. 
</p>
<p>2787. Serious concern was expressed that the action taken against the demonstrators mentioned 
above may be directly related to their legitimate activities in the defence of human rights. Further 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of both groups of 
demonstrators. It is feared that these incidents form part of an ongoing pattern of harassments 
against demonstrators petitioning to defend human rights in Zimbabwe. </p>

</b></p>
<p>2789. The Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, director of the 
non-governmental organization Zimbabwe Peace Project, and members of the non-governmental 
organization Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) as well as Mr. Wellington Chibebe, 
Secretary-General, and other members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), 
including Mr. Zansi Mabunda, Mr. Charles Chikonzo, Mr. Denzel Mushayi and 
Mr. Ngoni Nyanhete. Mr. Chibebe was the subject of an urgent appeal jointly sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the then Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 16 May 2008; an urgent appeal jointly sent by the then Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 15 September 2006; and two 
joint urgent appeals by the then Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, dated 15 February 2005 
and 21 August 2006. 
</p>
<p>2790. According to the information received, in the early hours of 3 December 2008, 
Ms. Mukoko was reportedly arrested at her home in Harare by a group of approximately 
15 armed men, allegedly belonging to the Central Intelligence Organisation. She was then taken 
to an unknown location and her whereabouts are currently unknown. 
</p>
<p>2791. On 3 December 2008, at approximately 10.00 a.m., Messrs Mabunda, Chikonzo, 
Mushayi, Nyanhete and 28 other members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) 
were arrested in the town of Gweru. The ZCTU members had gathered in order to present a 
petition to the Regional Governor to protest against the limits placed on the daily amount of cash 
that can be withdrawn from banks. The group was prevented from presenting the submission to 
the Governor and was taken to Gweru Central Police Station. A further 10 members of ZCTU, 
including the Union&#8217;s Secretary-General, Mr. Chibebe, were arrested in the Central Business 
District of Harare. The demonstration had been organized in order to present a similar petition to 
that prepared by their colleagues in Gweru, to Mr. Gideon Gono, the Governor of the Reserve 
Bank of Zimbabwe. Reports claim that prior to the arrests, police and armoured vehicles had 
cordoned off Samora Machel Avenue in Harare and that at least five people were beaten by 
police officers. On the same day, the premises of ZLHR in the southern city of Bulawayo were 
raided by the police. Members of ZLHR were reportedly accused by the police of supporting the 
petition of the ZCTU. No arrest was undertaken. </p>

Mr. Wellington Chibebe, Mr. Zansi Mabunda, Mr. Charles Chikonzo, Mr. Denzel Mushayi, 
Mr. Ngoni Nyanhete and other members of the ZCTU, as well as the police raid on the premises

the physical and mental integrity of Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Mr. Wellington Chibebe, 
Mr. Zansi Mabunda, Mr. Charles Chikonzo, Mr. Denzel Mushayi, Mr. Ngoni Nyanhete and

brother of the human rights lawyer Mr. Harrison Nkomo; Mr. Broderick Takawira, provincial 
coordinator of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP); and Mr. Pascal Gonzo, ZPP driver. 
</p><p>2795. Ms. Jestina Mukoko, Director of the ZPP and Board Member of the Zimbabwe Human 
Rights NGO Forum, was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 4 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>2796. According to the information received, on 5 December 2008, Mr. Zacharia Nkomo was 
reportedly abducted by four unidentified men at his home in Masvingo. The whereabouts of 
Mr. Nkomo were unknown at the time when the urgent appeal was sent. 
</p>
<p>2797. On 8 December 2008, at the ZPP premises in Harare, a group of five unidentified men, 
after luring the ZPP security guard, abducted Messrs Broderick Takawira and Pascal Gonzo. The 
whereabouts of Messrs Takawira and Gonzo are currently unknown. A complaint was filed with 
the police by the non-governmental organization Zimbabwe Human Rights Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>2798. Grave concern was expressed that the abductions of Messrs Zacharia Nkomo, 
Broderick Takawira and Pascal Gonzo may have been linked to their non-violent activities in 
defence of human rights or to the human rights activities of their relatives, and may have formed 
part of a renewed pattern of harassment against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe. Further
