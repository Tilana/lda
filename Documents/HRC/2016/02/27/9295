<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>This report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion 
</p>
<p>and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. This is 
</p>
<p>the last annual report that will be submitted by the current mandate-holder, whose term 
</p>
<p>expires in August 2008. This report presents a review of the main trends and issues tackled 
</p>
<p>during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s tenure. In particular, it highlights the most important patterns 
</p>
<p>and challenges that emerge for the implementation of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression. 
</p>
<p>Chapter I summarizes the main activities of the Special Rapporteur undertaken in 
</p>
<p>2007, including an analysis of communication trends in the period. Chapter II presents an 
</p>
<p>overall review of the main issues addressed by the Special Rapporteur throughout his 
</p>
<p>mandate, specifically in the realms of the right of access to information, safety and protection 
</p>
<p>of media professionals, legal restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression as well as the 
</p>
<p>impact of freedom of expression on the realization of other human rights. Section III presents 
</p>
<p>the general conclusions and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>This report contains as an addendum the summary of communications sent by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur from 1 January  to 4 December 2007 and replies received thereto from 
</p>
<p>Governments by 21 January 2008. Addenda 2 and 3 are the reports of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s country visits to Ukraine and Azerbaijan, respectively. 
</p>
<p>The main conclusions and recommendations presented by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>include: 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to conduct an in-depth assessment of 
</p>
<p>existing national legislation as well as judicial practices related to all forms of freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression and to commence, whenever necessary, reform processes in order 
</p>
<p>to guarantee conformity with international human rights norms and standards. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also recommends that Governments focus on the protection and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of media independence as a priority, in order to ensure a constant advancement 
</p>
<p>in the field of freedom of opinion and expression; </p>

 <p>    
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments adopt legislation that 
</p>
<p>unambiguously prohibits all forms of censorship in media outlets, both in the traditional 
</p>
<p>media and the Internet. Defamation, libel and insult charges, particularly when stemming 
</p>
<p>from public figures and specifically State authorities, do not justify any form of prior 
</p>
<p>censorship; 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to extend the measures to protect freedom 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression to the Internet, in particular to website contributors and 
</p>
<p>bloggers, who should be granted with the same level of protection as any other type of 
</p>
<p>media; 
</p>
<p> - The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call to the Human Rights Council to pay increased 
</p>
<p>attention to the issue of the safety and protection of journalists, in particular in situations of 
</p>
<p>armed conflicts. The Council may wish to consider the opportunity, as previously suggested, 
</p>
<p>of entrusting the Rapporteur with the preparation of a study on the causes of violence against 
</p>
<p>media professionals, based, inter alia, on information from and the experiences of 
</p>
<p>Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and including a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive set of conclusions and recommendations and the drafting of guidelines for the 
</p>
<p>protection of journalists and other media professionals. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur urges media professionals, as well as the public at large, to be 
</p>
<p>conscious of the potential impact that the ideas they express may have in raising cultural and 
</p>
<p>religious sensitivities. The dissemination of intolerant and discriminatory opinions ultimately 
</p>
<p>promotes discord and conflict and is not conducive to the promotion of human rights. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur further emphasizes that, although limitations to the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression are foreseen in international instruments to prevent war propaganda 
</p>
<p>and incitement of national, racial or religious hatred, these limitations were designed in order 
</p>
<p>to protect individuals against direct violations of their rights. These limitations are not 
</p>
<p>intended to suppress the expression of critical views, controversial opinions or politically 
</p>
<p>incorrect statements.  </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion 
</p>
<p>and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, pursuant Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. This is the 
</p>
<p>last annual report that will be submitted by the present mandate-holder, whose term expires in 
</p>
<p>August 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. Chapter I summarizes the main activities of the Special Rapporteur undertaken in 
</p>
<p>2007, including an analysis of communication trends in the period. Chapter II presents an 
</p>
<p>overall review of the main issues addressed by the Special Rapporteur throughout his tenure. 
</p>
<p>It thus intends to highlight the different trends observed by the Special Rapporteur over the 
</p>
<p>past six years, pointing to the main challenges for the effective implementation of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression. Chapter III presents the general conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. This report contains as its addendum 1 the summary of communications sent by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur from 1 January to 4 December 2007 and replies received thereto from 
</p>
<p>Governments by 21 January 2008. Addenda 2 and 3 are the reports of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s country visits to Ukraine and Azerbaijan, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Analysis of information, communications and trends 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur relies on communications received from various sources as a 
</p>
<p>means to identify trends, reiterate issues already discussed in previous reports and bring to 
</p>
<p>the attention of the international community a number of policies, practices and measures 
</p>
<p>having an impact on the respect for freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>5. To effectively implement his mandate, the Special Rapporteur focuses on information 
</p>
<p>received from a variety of sources, including Governments; local, national, regional or 
</p>
<p>international governmental and non-governmental organizations; associations of media 
</p>
<p>professionals and writers; trade unions; etc. The quality and the quantity of information 
</p>
<p>received are essential to the discharge of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>they are a significant indicator of the degree of implementation of the right to freedom of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>opinion and expression in a given country. The Special Rapporteur may also decide to take 
</p>
<p>initiative <i>motu proprio</i> on issues of general concern that he considers relevant to his mandate.  
</p>
<p>6. The majority of cases received by the Special Rapporteur concern threats, 
</p>
<p>aggressions, harassment, murder or other sorts of attacks on the physical and psychological 
</p>
<p>integrity of journalists, students, human rights activists and unionists as retaliation for their 
</p>
<p>exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression. In many cases, these attacks 
</p>
<p>were linked to the repression of peaceful protests conducted to express disagreement with 
</p>
<p>some governmental policy, at the national or local level, or with the actions of large 
</p>
<p>corporations.  While the extent of the repression, its duress and length may substantially vary, 
</p>
<p>allegations received are not confined to countries where the political, social and economic 
</p>
<p>situation is particularly difficult, but also concern violations occurring in transitional or long-
</p>
<p>established democracies. 
</p>
<p>7. Analysis of communications also shows a large number of cases of prosecution or 
</p>
<p>imprisonment of media professionals or ordinary citizens on charges of defamation, libel and 
</p>
<p>slander, despite the decriminalization of these offenses by some countries. Another important 
</p>
<p>trend in many regions has been the adoption of legislation that unduly limits freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression by fostering State interference in editorial independence; by creating subjective 
</p>
<p>licensing procedures that are used to shut down media outlets; by restricting the ability of 
</p>
<p>journalists, particularly foreign correspondents, to perform their work freely; and by 
</p>
<p>imposing severe limitations on the operation, including funding, of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>8. From 1 January to 4 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent 241 
</p>
<p>communications: 114 urgent appeals, 89 of which were signed jointly with other special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate-holders, and 127 allegation letters, 55 of which were co-signed with 
</p>
<p>other mandates. These communications referred to the situation of 596 individuals. The 
</p>
<p>geographical division of the communications was as follows: 31.5 per cent in Asia and the 
</p>
<p>Pacific; 20.7 per cent in Africa; 18.2 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean; 17 per 
</p>
<p>cent in the Middle East and North Africa; and 12.4 per cent in Europe, North America and 
</p>
<p>Central Asia. </p>

 <p>    
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p><b>B.  Press releases1
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur regularly issues press releases to signal his concern about 
</p>
<p>current events. In 2007, he issued five press releases concerning issues of safety of journalists 
</p>
<p>and legislation that restricts the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>10. On 23 January, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concern over the murder of 
</p>
<p>Hrant Dink, a respected Turkish journalist and intellectual who had developed important 
</p>
<p>critical work concerning a sensitive period in the history of Turkey. He expressed his hopes 
</p>
<p>that the investigations would shed light on all aspects of this crime. 
</p>
<p>11. On 12 March, the Special Rapporteur called for the immediate and unconditional 
</p>
<p>release of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo and his aides, who had been arrested in 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan. He argued that this crime underscored the importance of intensifying efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure the safety of journalists, particularly in conflict areas. Mr. Mastrogiacomo was 
</p>
<p>released on 20 March, but an Afghan journalist who was travelling with him, Ajmal 
</p>
<p>Naqshbandi, was brutally executed on 8 April. 
</p>
<p>12. On 27 June, the Special Rapporteur called for the release of British journalist Alan 
</p>
<p>Johnston of BBC, who had been abducted in Gaza City on 12 March. He once again 
</p>
<p>highlighted the importance of ensuring the safety of media professionals as an indispensable 
</p>
<p>conduit for the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>13. On 28 September, the Special Rapporteur, along with several other special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate-holders, strongly condemned the crackdown of public demonstrations in Myanmar, 
</p>
<p>in particular the brutal measures taken by the security services, including the use of deadly 
</p>
<p>force. They also welcomed the decision to hold a special session of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council on the situation in Myanmar. They called for the release of the detained, an 
</p>
<p>investigation of the killings, steps to alleviate the economic hardship of the majority of the 
</p>
<p>population and the introduction of serious reforms and dialogue with the opposition. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>14. On 30 November, the Special Rapporteur, along with the Special Representative of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>independence of judges and lawyers, released a statement expressing concern about the 
</p>
<p>constitutional referendum that would be held in Venezuela. The three independent experts 
</p>
<p>underlined their concern that some provisions submitted to popular vote, particularly 
</p>
<p>concerned states of emergency and the operation of non-governmental organizations, could 
</p>
<p>undermine a set of fundamental rights that should be enjoyed at all times.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Participation in meetings and seminars 
</b></p>
<p>15. From 18 to 22 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 14th annual 
</p>
<p>meeting of special procedures, held in Geneva. The meeting primarily discussed the 
</p>
<p>institution-building process conducted by the Human Rights Council and the new methods of 
</p>
<p>work of mandate-holders, as well as issues such as cooperation with civil society, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions and among special-procedures mandates. 
</p>
<p>16. On 5 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur submitted a statement to the expert 
</p>
<p>meeting organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva to 
</p>
<p>discuss and outline indicators to measure respect for the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression. In the statement he transmitted, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of defining concrete yardsticks to monitor freedom of expression and violations 
</p>
<p>that take place around the world. He underscored the importance of avoiding the risk, when 
</p>
<p>employing these indicators, of creating crude comparisons between countries that are 
</p>
<p>fundamentally different. Rather, he suggests that the indicators should be seen as an attempt 
</p>
<p>to assess a country&#8217;s progress compared to its own historical trajectory, following the 
</p>
<p>approach used by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>17. On 7-8 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur also transmitted a statement to the 
</p>
<p>Expert seminar on diversity in the broadcast media, organized by the non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization (NGO) Article 19 and the Institute of Information Law in Amsterdam. In his 
</p>
<p>statement, the Special Rapporteur made a broad review of issues related to diversity in the 
</p>
<p>media, including licensing, State advertising as well as diversity of outlets and content. At the </p>

 <p>    
same meeting, a joint declaration on promoting diversity in the broadcast media,  signed by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur, along with the Organization for Security and Development (OSCE) 
</p>
<p>Representative on Freedom of the Media, the Organization of American States (OAS) Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights (ACHPR) Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, was drafted. (The joint 
</p>
<p>declaration appears as an annex to this report.) 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>18. From 22 to 28 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur carried out an official visit to 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan, at the Government&#8217;s invitation, where he met a broad range of social and political 
</p>
<p>actors to evaluate the current status of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur underlined his impression that the country was endeavouring to establish 
</p>
<p>and consolidate its democratic structures, a message that was conveyed by many of his 
</p>
<p>counterparts. In his preliminary conclusions, he called upon the Government and civil society 
</p>
<p>to take a number of steps to fully implement the right to freedom of expression, including the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of defamation offenses, ensuring the safety of media professionals and, 
</p>
<p>more broadly, guaranteeing the independence of the media.  
</p>
<p>19. From 14 to 18 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur visited Ukraine at the invitation of 
</p>
<p>the Government in order to assess the implementation of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression in the country. In the conclusions of his visit, the Special Rapporteur highlighted 
</p>
<p>the progresses achieved by the country after it gained independence from the Soviet Union. 
</p>
<p>In particular, he underlined the important improvements that have taken place in the country 
</p>
<p>since 2004. He also called upon the Government of Ukraine to further strengthen the 
</p>
<p>independence, professionalism and diversity of the media as well as to tackle the issue of 
</p>
<p>incitement to racial, ethnic and religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>20. From 26 to 30 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur carried out an official visit to 
</p>
<p>Honduras at the invitation of the Government in order to examine issues of relevance to his 
</p>
<p>mandate. In his conclusions on the visit, he pointed to the need for strengthening protection 
</p>
<p>and safety measures for journalists and media professionals as well as the need to combat 
</p>
<p>impunity for the perpetrators of crimes against the media. He also called for a rapid 
</p>
<p>adaptation of national legislation on freedom of expression to international standards, 
</p>
<p>particularly concerning the decriminalization of defamation offenses.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>II. ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Implementing the right of access to information 
</b></p>
<p><b>Censorship, suspension, closing or banning of media outlets 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the widespread resort to censorship, 
</p>
<p>direct or indirect, which remains in many regions of the world. Apart from direct censorship, 
</p>
<p>many Governments have resorted to indirect ways to censor or shut down media outlets that 
</p>
<p>express independent voices. The Special Rapporteur has received a number of 
</p>
<p>communications concerning cases where Governments use overly subjective administrative 
</p>
<p>regulations, particularly licensing and taxation, in order to close or suspend media outlets. 
</p>
<p>Ultimately, the main impact of these policies is to create an uncertain environment for media 
</p>
<p>professionals, thus fostering self-censorship and shunning any meaningful criticism of public 
</p>
<p>policies and authorities.  
</p>
<p>22. Throughout 2007, the Special Rapporteur followed closely and with concern a 
</p>
<p>substantial number of cases in which Governments suspended the operation of media outlets, 
</p>
<p>particularly news channels that broadcast internationally, during large-scale public protests, 
</p>
<p>electoral processes, states of emergency or public disorder. In most cases, these practices 
</p>
<p>were designed to insulate the countries in question from the rest of the world, making 
</p>
<p>invisible the human rights violations committed by State institutions, thus avoiding 
</p>
<p>international criticism and pressure. 
</p>
<p>23. The new media, especially the Internet, have not remained free of censorship and 
</p>
<p>direct repression. In past years, the Special Rapporteur has noted a growing trend of 
</p>
<p>censorship and the banning of websites and Internet contributors, particularly bloggers. Due 
</p>
<p>to the low cost, decentralized nature and great reach of the Internet, it has become an 
</p>
<p>important outlet for the circulation of independent opinions about State authorities and 
</p>
<p>policies. Many Governments therefore have developed an interest in controlling, monitoring 
</p>
<p>and censoring the digital media, in particular the Internet, including by punishing hundreds of 
</p>
<p>so-called cyber-dissidents around the world. In some cases, Internet use in private home </p>

 <p>    
connections has been completely banned, thus allowing for total government oversight over 
</p>
<p>Internet use by its citizens. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur further highlights the facts that, in several cases, these illegal 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression have been accepted and even 
</p>
<p>facilitated by leading Internet corporations, the majority of which are based in democratic 
</p>
<p>countries. Search engines, for example, have accepted many Governments&#8217; imposition for 
</p>
<p>strict controls and censorship, such as blocking &#8220;politically sensitive terms&#8221; of search results 
</p>
<p>presented to individuals. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is deeply worried about many 
</p>
<p>large Internet corporations who have disclosed personal information of their users to allow 
</p>
<p>Governments to identify and convict internet writers. 
</p>
<p><b>Diversity 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of promoting diversity in the 
</p>
<p>media. In particular, he stresses three fundamental dimensions of diversity that should be 
</p>
<p>promoted: (a) diversity of outlets, in particular the establishment of a free environment for the 
</p>
<p>creation and dissemination of outlets; (b) diversity of sources, especially taking advantage of 
</p>
<p>the full benefits of digital platforms, in particular the Internet, to strengthen the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression; and (c) diversity of content, allowing for different 
</p>
<p>communities and vulnerable groups to have access to media outlets and find ways to 
</p>
<p>effectively disseminate their voice. 
</p>
<p>26. One of the central problems relating to the promotion of diversity refers to the 
</p>
<p>licensing of media outlets. State-controlled licensing procedures have, in many countries, 
</p>
<p>become a technical means of curbing media independence, particularly through normal and 
</p>
<p>periodic procedures of renewal of licenses. These procedures have been used systematically 
</p>
<p>by some Governments not as a regular administrative practice, but rather as a policy tool to 
</p>
<p>wield influence over editorial content. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that, in order to 
</p>
<p>guarantee freedom of the press, licensing should always be conducted by an independent 
</p>
<p>authority, free from political interference by government officials. Furthermore, licensing 
</p>
<p>procedures are only justified as a response to problems of scarcity, thus restricted to the 
</p>
<p>broadcast media. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>27. The exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups from the media is a key issue 
</p>
<p>that needs to be addressed by the international community. Minorities, indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>migrant workers, refugees and many other vulnerable communities have faced higher 
</p>
<p>barriers, some of them insurmountable, to be able to fully exercise their right to impart 
</p>
<p>information. For these groups, the media plays the central role of fostering social 
</p>
<p>mobilization, participation in public life and access to information that is relevant for the 
</p>
<p>community. Without a means to disseminate their views and problems, these communities are 
</p>
<p>in effect shut down from public debates, which ultimately hinders their ability to fully enjoy 
</p>
<p>their human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur further stresses that diversity of content &#8211; in the broadcast, 
</p>
<p>digital and printed media &#8211; is a desirable goal that should be encouraged. The strengthening 
</p>
<p>of educational and cultural content and the increase in the space given to minorities and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups to express their views, for example, can greatly increase the quality of the 
</p>
<p>media outlets themselves. However, utmost care must be taken in order to prevent these goals 
</p>
<p>from ultimately threatening the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The promotion of 
</p>
<p>content diversity must not be used under any circumstances as a means to influence, directly 
</p>
<p>or indirectly, the fundamental principle of editorial independence. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that the most adequate means to promote diversity is not direct interference with 
</p>
<p>media outlets, but rather more general measures to set up a free environment where 
</p>
<p>independent media outlets and content producers can emerge and flourish. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>benefits of the Internet, particularly the way it allows even individual users to disseminate 
</p>
<p>content on a global scale, should be duly taken into account and strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b>Internet governance 
</b></p>
<p>29. The issue of Internet governance has been a key focus of the Special Rapporteur in 
</p>
<p>the implementation of his mandate, particularly in the preparation and follow-up of the World 
</p>
<p>Summit on the Information Society, whose final phase was held in Tunis in 2005. Although 
</p>
<p>the Summit itself focused chiefly on technical and business matters, overlooking human 
</p>
<p>rights issues, it served as an opportunity for a number of NGOs to organize parallel events </p>

 <p>    
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>and, ultimately, create networks for the implementation of a human rights-based approach to 
</p>
<p>the information society. 
</p>
<p>30. The Internet, as well as other information and communication technologies, offers an 
</p>
<p>unprecedented possibility to disseminate information, opinion and ideas to people who had 
</p>
<p>traditionally been excluded from other media. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
</p>
<p>Internet also gives rise to important problems, such as child pornography, hate speech and 
</p>
<p>privacy issues, which can only be addressed through a serious discussion focusing on 
</p>
<p>governance. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur has suggested the establishment of an international 
</p>
<p>organization to govern the Internet with a firm human rights approach as a priority for the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the international community. In particular, this organization would 
</p>
<p>develop global norms and principles to guarantee that the Internet can be developed as a 
</p>
<p>democratic medium of expression that is in full compliance with human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>Ultimately, such an organization would develop, in cooperation with national institutions, the 
</p>
<p>private sector and the civil society, common principles, norms and rules that should guide the 
</p>
<p>future evolution and use of the Internet. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Safety and protection of journalists and media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>32. In 2007, concern for the safety and protection of journalists remained one of the key 
</p>
<p>obstacles for the full implementation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. A 
</p>
<p>total of 67 media professionals were kidnapped and 1,511 were physically attacked or 
</p>
<p>threatened throughout the year. Even more worrying, 86 journalists and 20 other media 
</p>
<p>workers were killed, which represents an increase of 244 per cent over the past five years and 
</p>
<p>is the highest figure since 1994.<b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>33. Armed conflicts provide by far the highest threat to the security of media 
</p>
<p>professionals. Over half of the journalists killed last year died in Iraq, the vast majority of 
</p>
<p>whom worked for the local media. A number of reports reached the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>concerning deliberate attempts to target journalists, particularly by members of warring 
</p>
<p> 
<b>2</b> Reporters Without Borders, <i>Press Freedom Round-up 2007</i>; see  
www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=24909, last accessed on 17 January 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>militia. As the clashes between Ethiopian-backed forces and the Islamist militia in Somalia 
</p>
<p>grew, the country also saw a drastic increase in the number of journalists who were killed, 
</p>
<p>totalling eight in 2007. In particular, two popular journalists,  Ali Iman Sharmarke and Bashir 
</p>
<p>Nor Gedi, were reportedly targeted and murdered by hired assassins, which illustrates the 
</p>
<p>atmosphere of fear and pressure surrounding the work of media professionals operating in 
</p>
<p>areas of armed conflict. Journalists were also killed in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of Congo, other areas of ongoing armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>34. The main provisions protecting journalists and other media professionals in situations 
</p>
<p>of armed conflict come from humanitarian law, in particular from special measures contained 
</p>
<p>in article 79 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the 
</p>
<p>protection of victims of international armed conflicts. This article establishes that &#8220;journalists 
</p>
<p>engaged in dangerous professional missions in areas of armed conflict shall be considered as 
</p>
<p>civilians&#8221; and &#8220;shall be protected as such under the Conventions and this Protocol, provided 
</p>
<p>that they take no action adversely affecting their status as civilians&#8221;. The civilian status of 
</p>
<p>journalists transcends any type of contractual arrangement that the journalist may have; equal 
</p>
<p>protection is granted to freelance, independent or to journalists belonging to any media. 
</p>
<p>35. In 2006, the Security Council passed resolution 1738 (2006) whereby it expressed its 
</p>
<p>deep concern &#8220;at the frequency of acts of violence in many parts of the world against 
</p>
<p>journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in armed conflict&#8221;, and condemned 
</p>
<p>intentional attacks against this group. It also underlined the obligation under humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law to grant civilian status to journalists during armed conflicts, as established by the Geneva 
</p>
<p>Conventions.   
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that States have an obligation to ensure the safety 
</p>
<p>and protection of journalists and other media professionals in time of armed conflict. In these 
</p>
<p>situations, journalism has a particularly important function, which is to convey the brutality 
</p>
<p>and havoc created by war. Accurate reports from war zones are a fundamental component in 
</p>
<p>establishing historical truths and allowing post-war reconciliation.   </p>

 <p>    
</p><p>37. Apart from armed conflicts, the Special Rapporteur underscores the need to focus on 
</p>
<p>the protection of journalists during electoral processes and public crises, particularly during 
</p>
<p>states of emergency. Throughout 2007, the Special Rapporteur has received several reports of 
</p>
<p>journalists who were directly targeted in physical attacks, both by government and opposition 
</p>
<p>forces, in political demonstrations taking place during electoral processes. In various cases, 
</p>
<p>harassment by the security forces, including arrests and detention, has been a common 
</p>
<p>practice adopted against journalists who are reporting on human rights violations during these 
</p>
<p>events.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur has recommended the establishment of a relief fund to benefit 
</p>
<p>the relatives of media professionals killed in the line of duty because of their professional 
</p>
<p>activities. Not only would such a fund provide needed reparation to families, but it would 
</p>
<p>also serve to place the safety of journalists as a central human rights issue within the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Legal restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>Defamation  
</b></p>
<p>39. Defamation offenses have been one of the main sources of imprisonment of 
</p>
<p>journalists around the world. Defamation laws were originally designed with a legitimate 
</p>
<p>goal, which was to protect people against false statements of fact that could damage their 
</p>
<p>reputation. In particular, they reflect the legitimate view that the exercise of freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, in particularly by media professionals, should be subject to responsibility, good 
</p>
<p>judgement and professionalism. However, the subjective character of many defamation laws, 
</p>
<p>their overly broad scope and their application within criminal law have turned them into a 
</p>
<p>powerful mechanisms to stifle investigative journalism and silent criticism. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the trend of increasing the scope of 
</p>
<p>defamation laws to include the protection of subjective values, such as a sense of national 
</p>
<p>identity, religions, State symbols, institutions or even representatives such as the Head of 
</p>
<p>State. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the provisions on protection of reputation 
</p>
<p>contained in international human rights law are designed to protect individuals, not abstract 
</p>
<p>values or institutions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>41. International human rights instruments recognize the right to a reputation (e.g. art. 12 
</p>
<p>of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that &#8220;No one shall be subject &#8230; 
</p>
<p>to attacks upon his honour and reputation&#8221;). However, three clear-cut conditions must be 
</p>
<p>respected for any limitation on the right to freedom of expression: (a) restrictions must be 
</p>
<p>established in law; (b) they should pursue an aim recognized as lawful, and (c) they must be 
</p>
<p>proportional to the accomplishment of that aim. A number of problems are often present in 
</p>
<p>the actual implementation of these three conditions. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the large number of cases of journalists 
</p>
<p>who are imprisoned after being convicted on criminal defamation charges. Apart from 
</p>
<p>outright imprisonment and preventive detention, other common measures that have been 
</p>
<p>taken against media professionals include the imposition of heavy fines, often completely 
</p>
<p>inconsistent with a journalist&#8217;s income, the suspension of the journalist&#8217;s professional licence 
</p>
<p>and even the suspension or closing of media outlets. The Special Rapporteur considers these 
</p>
<p>measures as inconsistent with the principle of proportionality and therefore an undue 
</p>
<p>restriction of press freedom. Furthermore, these measures are even more harmful for 
</p>
<p>independent, local or freelance journalists, who are generally unable to afford the expenses of 
</p>
<p>long judicial proceedings, legal counsel and fines. 
</p>
<p>43. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur, along with the OSCE Representative on 
</p>
<p>Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, in a joint 
</p>
<p>declaration issued in December 2002, stated that &#8220;criminal defamation is not a justifiable 
</p>
<p>restriction on freedom of expression; all criminal defamation laws should be abolished and 
</p>
<p>replaced, where necessary, with appropriate civil defamation laws&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes with satisfaction that many countries have recently decided to abolish their criminal 
</p>
<p>defamation laws. He reiterates that, while awaiting the entry of force of this legislation, 
</p>
<p>emergency measures such as amnesty or pardon should be taken to ensure that no media 
</p>
<p>profession or any other citizen is incarcerated on charges of defamation. Furthermore, any 
</p>
<p>fines arising from civil defamation procedures should also respect the principle of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and should never surpass reasonable amounts. 
</p>
<p><b>States of exception and emergency </b></p>

 <p>    
</p><p>44. The imposition of a state of emergency has led on many occasions to actions that are 
</p>
<p>incompatible with the right to freedom of expression and, in particular, to a free media. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is concerned that, immediately after the imposition of a state of 
</p>
<p>emergency, many Governments take aggressive action against freedom of expression in many 
</p>
<p>different forms: by suspending TV news channels, blocking websites and telephone services, 
</p>
<p>attacking detaining and arresting journalists covering protests and appointing government 
</p>
<p>officials to monitor, and in effect censor, the content of newspapers. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>has observed with concern how, in many of these cases, States have introduced laws giving 
</p>
<p>government officials the authority to take unilateral action against media organizations.  
</p>
<p>45. Regulations under states of emergency often allow for arbitrary detentions and arrests, 
</p>
<p>the banning of demonstrations which could lead to &#8220;public disorder&#8221; and the suspension of 
</p>
<p>local assemblies or governments if they block or impede the legal actions of the public 
</p>
<p>authorities. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is usually violated under 
</p>
<p>situations of states of emergency. Journalists and other media practitioners face persecutions 
</p>
<p>and attacks and it is difficult to obtain independent and reliable information, which is 
</p>
<p>essential for society in these situations.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that emergency powers may be legitimate only in 
</p>
<p>cases of extreme national crises which threaten the life of the nation. Those powers are 
</p>
<p>defined and limited by articles 4 and 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant of Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and, therefore, restrictions placed on rights are to be limited in both 
</p>
<p>scope and duration &#8220;to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&#8221; (art. 4). 
</p>
<p>In this context, a state of emergency is by definition a temporary legal response to an 
</p>
<p>exceptional and grave threat to the nation, and must be treated as such. The principle of 
</p>
<p>proportionality must be respected with respect to the duration and geographical and material 
</p>
<p>scope of the state of emergency.   
</p>
<p><b>Countering terrorism</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has paid close attention and strongly 
</p>
<p>condemned the critical threat posed by terrorism in the contemporary world, whilst also 
</p>
<p>noting the negative implications that some policies designed to fight terrorism have had on 
</p>
<p>the full enjoyment of human rights. Counter-terrorism and national security legislation 
</p>
<p>approved in recent years have on many instances exceeded the bounds of what is permissible </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>under international law and resulted in human rights violations. In this context, the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression is particularly vulnerable to legislation that de facto 
</p>
<p>legitimates limitations on the free circulation and expression of ideas and opinions, directly 
</p>
<p>affecting the work of media professionals, human rights defenders, political groups and civil 
</p>
<p>society more broadly. Journalists and media professionals have become common targets of 
</p>
<p>unlawful attempts to restrict freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>48. The restrictions brought about by counter-terrorism legislation on human rights in 
</p>
<p>general, and the right to freedom of opinion and expression in particular, have taken many 
</p>
<p>forms. A number of allegations were brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention in this 
</p>
<p>regard, including instances where Governments have passed laws that restrict individual 
</p>
<p>liberties such as the right to privacy and to due process; arbitrary arrests and detentions 
</p>
<p>conducted by the security apparatus; banning the publication of information that is, without 
</p>
<p>justification, defined as being threatening to national security; forcing the disclosure of 
</p>
<p>journalistic sources; censoring media outlets and journalists on the basis of an alleged 
</p>
<p>proximity to terrorist or rebel groups. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur recalls that restrictions to the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression can only be imposed in rather exceptional circumstances. In this respect, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has referred in his previous reports, to General Comment No. 29 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11) of the Human Rights Committee, which establishes the 
</p>
<p>conditions that must be met for a State to invoke article 4,paragraph 1, of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), dealing with derogations to the rights 
</p>
<p>enumerated thereto. Derogations established under article 4, paragraph 1, of the Covenant are 
</p>
<p>exceptional in nature and can only be invoked when the situation within a State amounts to a 
</p>
<p>public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and when the State party has 
</p>
<p>officially declared a state of emergency. These restrictive measures imposed by the State 
</p>
<p>must, inter alia, be strictly limited in time, provided for in a law, necessary for public safety 
</p>
<p>or public order, serve a legitimate purpose, not impair the essence of the right, and conform 
</p>
<p>to the principle of proportionality. The principles of legitimacy, necessity and proportionality 
</p>
<p>must always be respected.  </p>

 <p>    
</p><p>50. The Special Rapporteur also refers to Security Council resolution 1624 (2005) of 14 
</p>
<p>September 2005, which states that any restrictions to the right of freedom of expression, as 
</p>
<p>reflected in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, must be in accordance 
</p>
<p>with article 19, paragraph 3 (b), of the ICCPR, which states that any restrictions shall be 
</p>
<p>those provided by law and necessary &#8220;for the protection of national security or of public 
</p>
<p>order&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>51. In many of the cases brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, most, if not 
</p>
<p>all of the conditions that are required under article 4, paragraph 1, and 19, paragraph 3,  of the 
</p>
<p>ICCPR to derogate from the right to freedom of opinion or expression, are not being met. He 
</p>
<p>has noted that there are cases in which the feeling of insecurity caused by terrorist attacks 
</p>
<p>provides States with an opportunity to adopt measures in which national security is used as 
</p>
<p>justification to allow for direct attacks against the free media, investigative journalism, 
</p>
<p>political dissidence, and human rights monitoring and reporting.  
</p>
<p>52. The rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of association, regulated under 
</p>
<p>articles 21 and 22 of the ICCPR, are also often violated under counter-terrorism legislation. 
</p>
<p>These rights should be considered essential to any democratic society. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has witnessed how, on certain occasions, peaceful actions or demonstrations have 
</p>
<p>been considered terrorist acts by certain Governments. As such, peaceful demonstrators have 
</p>
<p>been charged with acts of terrorism under counter-terrorism legislation, which gives the State 
</p>
<p>legitimacy to suppress dissent. 
</p>
<p>53. The effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and freedom of association are central elements that mark the difference 
</p>
<p>between democracy and terror. In this regard, in their legitimate fight to eradicate terrorism, 
</p>
<p>democratic States must see that freedom and pluralism, two crucial parts of their very 
</p>
<p>democratic foundations, are preserved at all times. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Freedom of opinion and expression and the realization of other human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>HIV/AIDS</b> 
</p>
<p>54. Although the number of people dying from HIV/AIDS and related illnesses has 
</p>
<p>declined in the last two years, the disease is among the leading causes of death globally, and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>remains the primary cause of death in Africa. According to UNAIDS, there are over 5,700 
</p>
<p>deaths each day in the world due to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has stated in his previous reports that, without a vaccine or a 
</p>
<p>cure, the main hope of reducing the devastating consequences of this disease resides &#8211; in 
</p>
<p>parallel to making available universal affordable treatment in developing countries &#8211; is  the 
</p>
<p>widespread access to information and preventive education for HIV/AIDS. Prevention, 
</p>
<p>treatment, care and support are mutually reinforcing elements that integrate an effective 
</p>
<p>response to HIV/AIDS. Making information and education available are essential to effective 
</p>
<p>efforts to combating this disease, as recognized by UNAIDS. 
</p>
<p>56. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2003/47 of 23 April 2003, 
</p>
<p>recognized the importance of sharing knowledge, experiences and achievements concerning 
</p>
<p>HIV-related issues, and urged States to promote effective programmes for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS, including through education and awareness-raising campaigns. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has welcomed this resolution and has raised in several of his reports the 
</p>
<p>relationship between access to information and HIV/AIDS prevention, calling upon States to 
</p>
<p>facilitate access to information on HIV/AIDS for all their citizens. 
</p>
<p>57. Information and education do not only refer exclusively to issues that are directly 
</p>
<p>related to HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention, but also to all those issues that have a clear 
</p>
<p>impact on the spread of the epidemic, even if these are indirect. The Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>noted that the most successful campaigns seem to be those that are tailored to specific 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups. It is thus important that data collection methods be developed in such a 
</p>
<p>manner as to precisely identify these groups, allowing for information and education 
</p>
<p>campaigns to be targeted to their specific context 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, according to statistics, some 2 million 
</p>
<p>young people aged 15-24 years become infected with HIV every year. In sub-Saharan Africa 
</p>
<p>and South Asia, about 65 per cent of young people living with HIV/AIDS are female. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has observed that in many countries women continue to be discriminated 
</p>
<p>against, and he has emphasized the importance of promoting effective programmes of </p>

 <p>    
information, particularly in rural areas. In this context, the Special Rapporteur calls upon 
</p>
<p>States to allocate resources for programmes that are directed at adolescents and women for 
</p>
<p>the prevention and treatment of this disease.  
</p>
<p>59. In most countries, people living with HIV/AIDS face discrimination. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur places special importance on the promotion of campaigns that combat 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitudes and stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS. In this context, 
</p>
<p>he encourages communities, teachers, journalists, doctors and, in particular, Governments to 
</p>
<p>disseminate information addressing all HIV/AIDS-related issues, its modes of transmission 
</p>
<p>and the means of protection. In particular, information on topics that may be considered as 
</p>
<p>taboo or private &#8211; such as safe sex or drug abuse &#8211; should be explicit and made available in 
</p>
<p>formats adapted and accessible to the society.  
</p>
<p>60. The United Nations, its agencies, funds and programmes have placed the fight against 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS very high on the development agenda. The Special Rapporteur also notes with 
</p>
<p>satisfaction that many donor countries have included HIV/AIDS among their priorities for 
</p>
<p>development assistance. The Special Rapporteur encourages such trends and wishes to 
</p>
<p>emphasize that it is only through a global response that the fight against HIV/AIDS can be 
</p>
<p>addressed. The exchange of good practices between countries and the support to developing 
</p>
<p>countries while implementing information and education programmes is crucial.  
</p>
<p><b>The &#8216;digital divide&#8217; 
</b></p>
<p>61. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has seen an unprecedented 
</p>
<p>expansion of communication and information technologies around the world. However, the 
</p>
<p>promises of the information society still are not being shared among all. A wide gap between 
</p>
<p>the information-rich and the information-poor still remains (the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;) and does not 
</p>
<p>show any encouraging signs of being reduced. It is important to note that the impact of the 
</p>
<p>digital divide is not felt exclusively in developing and least developed countries, but also in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable communities living in the industrialized world. 
</p>
<p>62. Narrowing the digital divide requires more than only technical efforts to extent the 
</p>
<p>new communication and information technologies to marginalized communities, thus 
</p>
<p>connecting them to the information society. Unfortunately, hundreds of millions of people 
</p>
<p>around the world are illiterate, and many more are not proficient in the new technologies. In </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>this regard, educational measures, in particular widespread literacy programmes, need to be 
</p>
<p>promoted as the sole alternative for empowering people and prepare them to become active 
</p>
<p>members of the information society. Besides traditional literacy programmes, new policies 
</p>
<p>and programmes should be promoted in order to foster education for the new media as the 
</p>
<p>most important empowerment tool for the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>63. In recent years, and with increased frequency, particularly due to events that 
</p>
<p>dominated international politics recently, an alleged dichotomy between the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of religion or belief has been purported. In 
</p>
<p>particular, it has been argued that the dogmatic use of freedom of expression as a 
</p>
<p>fundamental human right has undermined people&#8217;s ability to fully enjoy other human rights, 
</p>
<p>in particular freedom of religion. The Special Rapporteur strongly rejects such a view, as it 
</p>
<p>contradicts the clearly established notion and widely accepted principle that human rights are 
</p>
<p>indivisible rather than rival principles. In particular, the ensemble of human rights can only 
</p>
<p>be fully enjoyed in an environment that guarantees freedom and pluralism. 
</p>
<p>64. Practices such as stereotyping and insulting ethnic, national, social or religious groups 
</p>
<p>have serious and damaging consequences for the promotion of dialogue and living together 
</p>
<p>among different communities. To fight intolerance and discrimination and to create a solid 
</p>
<p>basis for the strengthening of democracy, broad-based and long-lasting programmes and 
</p>
<p>actions need to be developed to promote respect for diversity, multiculturalism and human 
</p>
<p>rights education.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also emphasizes that existing international instruments 
</p>
<p>establish a clear limit on freedom of expression. In particular, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8220;any propaganda for war&#8221; and &#8220;any advocacy of 
</p>
<p>national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
</p>
<p>violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. The main problem thus lies in identifying at which point 
</p>
<p>exactly these thresholds are reached. The Special Rapporteur underscores that this decision, 
</p>
<p>which is ultimately a subjective one, should meet a number of requirements. In particular, it </p>

 <p>    
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>should not justify any type of prior censorship, it should be clearly and narrowly defined, it 
</p>
<p>should be the least intrusive means in what concerns limitations to freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>it should be applied by an independent judiciary. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that these 
</p>
<p>limitations are designed to protect individuals rather than belief systems, guaranteeing that 
</p>
<p>every person will have all of his or her human rights protected.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes that a broader interpretation of these limitations, which 
</p>
<p>has been recently suggested in international forums, is not in line with existing international 
</p>
<p>instruments and would ultimately jeopardize the full enjoyment of human rights. Limitations 
</p>
<p>to the right to freedom of opinion and expression have more often than not been used by 
</p>
<p>Governments as a means to restrict criticism and silent dissent. Furthermore, as regional 
</p>
<p>human rights courts have already recognized, the right to freedom of expression is applicable 
</p>
<p>not only to comfortable, inoffensive or politically correct opinions, but also to ideas that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;offend, shock and disturb&#8221;.<b>3</b> The constant confrontation of ideas, even controversial ones, is 
</p>
<p>a stepping stone to vibrant democratic societies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the related rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of association and assembly, are fundamental human rights with far-reaching 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences for the enjoyment of all other rights. When freedom of opinion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression is respected, Governments are held accountable, public policies are designed 
</b></p>
<p><b>more effectively and people&#8217;s voices are heard. Limiting the free circulation of ideals not 
</b></p>
<p><b>diminishes plurality and diversity, but undermines democracy entirely. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to conduct an in-depth assessment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of existing national legislation as well as of judicial practices related to all forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of opinion and expression and to commence, whenever necessary, reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes in order to guarantee conformity with international human rights norms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. The Special Rapporteur also recommends Governments to focus on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and the promotion of media independence as a priority, in order to ensure a 
</b></p>
<p><b>constant advancement in the field of freedom of opinion and expression.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>On censorship 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments adopt legislation that 
</b></p>
<p><b>unambiguously prohibits all forms of censorship in media outlets, both in the traditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>media and the Internet. Defamation, libel and insult charges, particularly when 
</b></p>
<p><b>stemming from public figures and specifically State authorities, do not justify any form 
</b></p>
<p><b>of prior censorship. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Administrative and bureaucratic regulations of media outlets, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>licensing, should be clearly established by law and overseen by independent institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments not to make subjective use of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations as a means to exert undue pressure, suspend or ban media outlets. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to extend the measures to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of opinion and expression to the Internet, in particular to website contributors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and bloggers, who should be granted with the same level of protection as any other type 
</b></p>
<p><b>of media. Internet providers and website registration with national authorities should 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be subject to any specific requirement. The right to privacy of Internet users should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be protected in all circumstances, except cases of child pornography and incitement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial, religious and ethnic hatred. Any legal dispute arising from the use of the Web 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be dealt with in the country where the website has its origin. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On diversity 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to take the appropriate measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>create a free and enabling environment where a plurality of media outlets can exist. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>this regard, adequate measures need to be taken to prevent the phenomenon of media 
</b></p>
<p><b>concentration, in particular the creation of media monopolies that could endanger 
</b></p>
<p><b>pluralism, affect media independence and increase the cost of information. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures should be taken by independent institutions that are protected against 
</b></p>
<p><b>political or other forms of interference, particularly from the Government. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate aim of preventing media concentration should not be used as a justification to 
</b></p>
<p><b>exert undue pressure on outlets that are critical or independent. </b></p>

 <p>    
73. <b>Licensing should only be used when strictly necessary, as a technical tool to 
</b></p>
<p><b>administer the scarcity of the airwaves. Licensing for abundant media, such as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internet and the print media, is not a legitimate policy tool and violates the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of opinion and expression. Licensing should only be administered by an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent body that is insulated from government pressure and should not be used 
</b></p>
<p><b>subjectively to ban or suspend independent media outlets, particularly television and 
</b></p>
<p><b>radio channels. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On Internet governance 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites Governments to consider the possibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing an international organization with a specific mandate to improve 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance of the Internet. The mandate of the organization would be to develop norms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and principles of conduct to guarantee that the Internet will continue to be a democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>medium of expression in full compliance with human rights principles. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur vigorously emphasizes that any new intergovernmental body administering, 
</b></p>
<p><b>partially or totally, Internet governance must ensure freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>and promote it in the light of article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b>On the safety and protection of media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments take the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to increase the safety and protection of journalists and other media workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regardless of their professional and political affiliation. Protection must be ensured at 
</b></p>
<p><b>all times, and particularly during armed conflicts, states of emergency and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>disorder and electoral processes. Governments should also ensure the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>other categories at risk, such as trade unionists, social workers, students and teachers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>writers and artists. Eliminating impunity for the perpetrators of crimes against media 
</b></p>
<p><b>professionals will function as an important deterrent against the repetition of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Governments and State institutions should, as appropriate, envisage the creation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of ad hoc protection schemes, which would allow journalists to continue their activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>with an acceptable level of security, while maintaining their independence. Media 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises should also consider covering the expenses of flexible protection for </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>endangered journalists. Media professionals should not, under any circumstances, be 
</b></p>
<p><b>obliged to bear the economic burden of their physical protection, in addition to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mental stress of being at risk. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call to the Human Rights Council to pay 
</b></p>
<p><b>increased attention to the issue of the safety and protection of journalists, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>in situations of armed conflicts. The Council may wish to consider the opportunity, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>previously suggested, of entrusting the Special Rapporteur with the preparation of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>study on the causes of violence against media professionals, based, inter alia, on 
</b></p>
<p><b>information from and the experiences of Governments, intergovernmental and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations, and including a comprehensive set of conclusions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations and the drafting of guidelines for the protection of journalists and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other media professionals. This study could represent the first step towards a debate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the Human Rights Council, on this crucial issue, following the discussions held 
</b></p>
<p><b>by other bodies, including the Security Council. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On defamation offences 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that Governments   decriminalize 
</b></p>
<p><b>defamation and similar offences, confining them to the domain of civil law. The amount 
</b></p>
<p><b>of fines to be paid as compensation should be reasonable and allow the continuation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>professional activities. The Special Rapporteur also urges Governments to release 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediately and unconditionally all journalists detained because of their media-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities. Prison sentences should be excluded for offences concerning the reputation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>others, such as defamation and libel. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Governments should also refrain from introducing new norms which will pursue 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same goals as defamation laws under a different legal terminology such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>disinformation and dissemination of false information. Under no circumstances should  
</b></p>
<p><b>criticism of the nation, its symbols, the Government, its members and their action be 
</b></p>
<p><b>seen as an offence. Elected officials and authorities should accept the fact that because 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their prominent and public role, they will attract a disproportionate amount of </b></p>

 <p>    
<b>scrutiny from the press. Governments should also make sure that the right to privacy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially in relation to family life and minors, is sufficiently protected without 
</b></p>
<p><b>curtailing the right to access to information, which contributes to transparency and 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic control of public affairs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On freedom of expression and HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur underlines that the level of protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a country has a direct impact on the spread of the AIDS epidemic. In this regard, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to freedom of opinion and expression, in particular the right to receive 
</b></p>
<p><b>information concerning HIV/AIDS, is a central aspect of efforts to tackle the problem.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to rely on preventive education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>information strategies as one of the main defences, alongside care and treatment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>against the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The extensive use of the mass media is 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to ensure the widest coverage of information campaigns. More generally, 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and education should be provided through all available and accessible 
</b></p>
<p><b>means. The Special Rapporteur encourages States to cooperate with the media, NGOs 
</b></p>
<p><b>and community-based organizations in this endeavour. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that general respect for and protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>of freedom of opinion and expression have a direct impact on the effectiveness of 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and information policies, programmes and campaigns for the purpose of 
</b></p>
<p><b>HIV/AIDS prevention. He therefore urges Governments to set a framework for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>better protection of freedom of opinion and expression and for free flow of information 
</b></p>
<p><b>and communications vis-&#224;-vis the general public, as well as specific groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On the &#8216;digital divide&#8217; 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Governments to take measures to increase the 
</b></p>
<p><b>affordability and availability of new communication and information technologies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly the Internet, to poor and vulnerable communities (to bridge the &#8220;digital 
</b></p>
<p><b>divide&#8221;). Furthermore, apart from technical efforts to increase access, computer 
</b></p>
<p><b>literacy programmes should be devised and widely disseminated in order to prepare the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>less favoured segments of the population to take the full benefits of the new 
</b></p>
<p><b>technologies.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>On freedom of expression and freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges media professionals, as well as the public at large, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be conscious of the potential impact that the ideas they express may have in raising 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural and religious sensitivities. The dissemination of intolerant and discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinions ultimately promotes discord and conflict and is not conducive to the promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights. Media corporations and journalists&#8217; associations, in cooperation with 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and international organizations, should organize regular human rights training 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes in order to enhance professional ethics and sensitivity to cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of media professionals.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur further emphasizes that, although limitations to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to freedom of opinion and expression are foreseen in international instruments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent war propaganda and incitement of national, racial or religious hatred, these 
</b></p>
<p><b>limitations were designed in order to protect individuals against direct violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their rights. These limitations are not intended to suppress the expression of critical 
</b></p>
<p><b>views, controversial opinions or politically incorrect statements. Finally, they are not 
</b></p>
<p><b>designed to protect belief systems from external or internal criticism.  </b></p>

<p><i> Having met </i>with representatives of NGOs, academics and other experts in Amsterdam 
</p>
<p>on 7-8 December 2007, under the auspices of ARTICLE 19, the Global Campaign for Free 
</p>
<p>Expression, and assisted by the Institute for Information Law (IViR), University of

<p>2000, 20 November 2001, 10 December 2002, 18 December 2003, 6 December 2004, 21 
</p>
<p>December 2005 and 19 December 2006, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the fundamental importance of diversity in the media to the free flow of 
</p>
<p>information and ideas in society, in terms both of giving voice to and satisfying the 
</p>
<p>information needs and other interests of all, as protected by international guarantees of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Cognizant</i>, in particular, of the importance of diversity to democracy, social cohesion 
</p>
<p>and broad participation in decision-making, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the potential of new technologies both to serve as vehicles for promoting 
</p>
<p>diversity but also to pose new threats to diversity, including as a result of the digital divide, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the complex nature of diversity, which includes diversity of outlet (types 
</p>
<p>of media) and source (ownership of the media), as well as diversity of content (media output), 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the varied contributions that different types of broadcasters &#8211; 
</p>
<p>commercial, public service and community &#8211; as well as broadcasters of different reach &#8211; 
</p>
<p>local, national, regional and international &#8211; make to diversity, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that undue concentration of media ownership, direct or indirect, as well as 
</p>
<p>government control over the media, pose a threat to diversity of the media, as well as other 
</p>
<p>risks, such as concentrating political power in the hands of owners or governing elites, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that independent public service broadcasters will continue to play an 
</p>
<p>important role in promoting diversity in the new digital broadcasting environment, including 
</p>
<p>through their unique role in providing reliable, high-quality and informative programming,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the potential for abuse of regulatory systems for the media to the 
</p>
<p>detriment, among other things, of diversity, particularly where oversight bodies are not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently protected against political or other interference, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the growth of a number of threats to the viability of public service 
</p>
<p>broadcasting in different countries, which undermine its ability to fulfil its potential to 
</p>
<p>contribute to media diversity, as well as the failure of many countries to recognize 
</p>
<p>community broadcasting as a distinct type of broadcasting, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i> Adopt</i>, on 12 December 2007, the following declaration on promoting diversity in the 
</p>
<p>broadcast media: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>General points 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> -Regulation of the media to promote diversity, including governance of public media, is 
</p>
<p>legitimate only if it is undertaken by a body which is protected against political and other 
</p>
<p>forms of unwarranted interference, in accordance with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards; </p>

 <p>    
 
</p>
<p> - Broad public education and other efforts should be undertaken to promote media 
</p>
<p>literacy and to ensure that all members of society can understand and take advantage of 
</p>
<p>new technologies with a view to bridging the digital divide; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Transparency should be a hallmark of public policy efforts in the area of broadcasting; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> - This should apply to regulation, ownership, public subsidy schemes and other policy 
</p>
<p>initiatives;  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Low-cost technologies that are widely accessible should be promoted with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuing broad access to new communications platforms. Technological solutions to 
</p>
<p>traditional problems of access &#8211; including in relation to hearing or visual disabilities &#8211; 
</p>
<p>should be explored and promoted; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Measures should be put in place to ensure that government advertising is not used as a 
</p>
<p>vehicle for political interference in the media; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>On diversity of outlets 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Sufficient &#8216;space&#8217; should be allocated to broadcasting uses on different communications 
</p>
<p>platforms to ensure that, as a whole, the public is able to receive a range of diverse 
</p>
<p>broadcasting services. In terms of terrestrial dissemination, whether analogue or digital, 
</p>
<p>this implies an appropriate allocation of frequencies for broadcasting uses; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Different types of broadcasters &#8211; commercial, public service and community &#8211; should 
</p>
<p>be able to operate on, and have equitable access to, all available distribution platforms. 
</p>
<p>Specific measures to promote diversity may include reservation of adequate frequencies 
</p>
<p>for different types of broadcasters, must-carry rules, a requirement that both distribution 
</p>
<p>and reception technologies are complementary and/or interoperable, including across 
</p>
<p>national frontiers, and non-discriminatory access to support services, such as electronic 
</p>
<p>programme guides; 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> - Consideration of the impact on access to the media, and on different types of broadcasters, 
</p>
<p>should be taken into account in planning for a transition from analogue to digital 
</p>
<p>broadcasting. This requires a clear plan for switchover that promotes, rather than limits, 
</p>
<p>public interest broadcasting. Measures should be taken to ensure that digital transition costs 
</p>
<p>do not limit the ability of community broadcasters to operate. Where appropriate, 
</p>
<p>consideration should be given to reserving part of the spectrum for analogue radio 
</p>
<p>broadcasting for the medium-term. At least part of the spectrum released through the &#8220;digital 
</p>
<p>dividend&#8221; should be reserved for broadcasting uses; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - The least intrusive effective system for the administration of broadcasting to promote 
</p>
<p>diversity should become used, taking into account reductions in the problem of scarcity. 
</p>
<p>Licensing, justified by reference to the airwaves as a limited public resource, is not 
</p>
<p>legitimate for Internet broadcasting; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Special measures are needed to protect and preserve public service broadcasting in the 
</p>
<p>new broadcasting environment. The mandate of public service broadcasters should be 
</p>
<p>clearly set out in law and include, among other things, contributing to diversity, which 
</p>
<p>should go beyond offering different types of programming and include giving voice to, 
</p>
<p>and serving the information needs and interests of, all sectors of society. Innovative 
</p>
<p>funding mechanisms for public service broadcasting should be explored which are 
</p>
<p>sufficient to enable it to deliver its public service mandate, which are guaranteed in 
</p>
<p>advance on a multi-year basis, and which are indexed against inflation; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>- Community broadcasting should be explicitly recognised in law as a distinct form of 
</p>
<p>broadcasting, should benefit from fair and simple licensing procedures, should not have to 
</p>
<p>meet stringent technological or other licence criteria, should benefit from concessionary 
</p>
<p>licence fees and should have access to advertising; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>On diversity of sources 
</b></p>
<p> </p>

 <p>    
</p>
<p> - In recognition of the particular importance of media diversity to democracy, special 
</p>
<p>measures, including anti-monopoly rules, should be put in place to prevent undue 
</p>
<p>concentration of media or cross-media ownership, both horizontal and vertical. Such 
</p>
<p>measures should involve stringent requirements of transparency of media ownership at all 
</p>
<p>levels. They should also involve active monitoring, taking ownership concentration into 
</p>
<p>account in the licensing process, where applicable, prior reporting of major proposed 
</p>
<p>combinations, and powers to prevent such combinations from taking place; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Consideration should be given to providing support, based on equitable, objective 
</p>
<p>criteria applied in a non-discriminatory fashion, to those wishing to establish new media 
</p>
<p>outlets;  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>On diversity of content 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Policy tools could be used, where this is consistent with international guarantees of 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, to promote content diversity among and within media outlets; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - Consideration should be given to providing support, based on equitable, objective 
</p>
<p>criteria applied in a non-discriminatory fashion, for the production of content which 
</p>
<p>makes an important contribution to diversity. This might include measures to promote 
</p>
<p>independent content producers, including by requiring public service broadcasters to 
</p>
<p>purchase a minimum quota of their programming from these producers; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> - An appropriate balance should be struck between protection of copyright and adjacent 
</p>
<p>rights, and promoting the free flow of information and ideas in society, including through 
</p>
<p>measures which result in a strengthening of the public domain.
