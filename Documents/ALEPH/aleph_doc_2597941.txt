1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a 
corporate governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a 
statement is located. The corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the 
recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a 
recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate governance statement must separately identify that 
recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not following the recommendation and 
what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its 
annual report, it must lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. The corporate governance statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the 
purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 
which discloses the extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council 
during a particular reporting period.
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, 
where the entity’s corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not 
applicable and just retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and 
you delete the other options, you can also, if you wish, delete the “OR” at the end of the selection.
