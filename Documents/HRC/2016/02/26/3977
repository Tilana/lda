</p>
<p><b>  Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
procedure 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The States parties to the present Protocol</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the 
United Nations, the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights 
of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that the States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(hereinafter referred to as the Convention) recognize the rights set forth in it to each child 
within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child&#8217;s or his 
or her parent&#8217;s or legal guardian&#8217;s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> the status of the child as a subject of rights and as a human being 
with dignity and with evolving capacities,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that children&#8217;s special and dependent status may create real difficulties 
for them in pursuing remedies for violations of their rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the present Protocol will reinforce and complement national and 
regional mechanisms allowing children to submit complaints for violations of their rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration to 
be respected in pursuing remedies for violations of the rights of the child, and that such 
remedies should take into account the need for child-sensitive procedures at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging</i> States parties to develop appropriate national mechanisms to enable a 
child whose rights have been violated to have access to effective remedies at the domestic 
level,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the important role that national human rights institutions and other 
relevant specialized institutions, mandated to promote and protect the rights of the child, 
can play in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that, in order to reinforce and complement such national mechanisms 
and to further enhance the implementation of the Convention and, where applicable, the 
Optional Protocols thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
and on the involvement of children in armed conflict, it would be appropriate to enable the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out 
the functions provided for in the present Protocol, </p>


<p><i> Have agreed</i> as follows: 
</p>
