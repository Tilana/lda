<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  The Islamic Republic of Iran possesses the basic legislative framework and tools to 
promote respect for human rights. The country is a party to five of the nine legally-binding 
international human rights treaties, and many of the rights guaranteed therein are enshrined 
in the Constitution. International commitments and constitutional provisions 
notwithstanding, however, it is clear that elements of the legal framework, together with 
insufficient adherence to the rule of law, create systemic obstacles to the Government&#8223;s 
ability to adhere to these commitments. As an original member of the United Nations 
system, the Islamic Republic of Iran has an important role to play in the global community 
but this has unfortunately become overshadowed by confrontation and tension. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that meaningful cooperation with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms could help the country to lessen potential for politicization, an issue about 
which the Government has repeatedly expressed its deep concern.  
</p>
<p>2. Despite the statements made by representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
regarding the Government&#8223;s interest in cooperation with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and its standing invitation to thematic special procedures mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council, the Government has not permitted visits since 2005.1 The 
Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that the Government has not addressed his request for a 
country visit issued on 19 September 2011, despite its stated intention to invite two special 
procedures mandate holders in 2012. The Special Rapporteur continues to urge the Iranian 
authorities to give positive consideration to his request, as well as those of the Human Right 
Council and the General Assembly to allow his unfettered access to the country to carry out 
his mandate.2 While the Special Rapporteur was not granted access to the country during 
the period under review, he fulfilled his mandate to the best of his ability on the basis of 
voluminous information collected from a variety of independent and reliable sources. The 
Special Rapporteur reaffirms that he maintained his independence, impartiality and 
objectivity in weighing the information provided to him. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that a number of urgent appeals made by 
various thematic mandate holders, as well as several joint communications transmitted to 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Special Rapporteur together with 
other special procedures mandate holders, also remain unaddressed. The insufficient 
engagement of the Government with the mandate holders was highlighted in a 2010 study, 3 
which concluded that the Islamic Republic of Iran held the highest number of pending visits 
requests of all countries that have issued standing invitations. Data also suggested that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran received the highest number of communications in the period 
2004-2008 (594), and that 25 per cent of the allegations made in the said communications 
had been wholly rejected, 1.3 per cent resulted in steps taken to address concerns, and 
approximately 54 per cent of communications transmitted had received no response.4 The 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The last visit by a special procedures mandate holder dates back to 2005, when the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on adequate housing (July 2005) visited the country. Visits by mandate holders prior to 
2005 included the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (February 2003), the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (November 2004), the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (February 2004) and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women (February 2005).

 </p>


<p>Special Rapporteur notes that the unwillingness to provide access to the country creates a 
void of information and only encourages the international community to imagine the worst, 
thereby intensifying the focus on the Government&#8223;s human rights record.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the statement made by the representatives of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran during consideration by the Third Committee of the General 
Assembly of a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in that country , that the 
Special Rapporteur &#8220;should be given time and opportunity to prepare his reports without 
external pressure or induced prejudices&#8221;.5 To this end, the Special Rapporteur was keen to 
develop a substantive dialogue with the authorities and is pleased to have at least been 
granted meetings with the Permanent Missions of the Islamic Republic of Iran in New York 
and Geneva. 
</p>
<p>5. In accordance with the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders,6 the 
Special Rapporteur has forwarded the present report to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which 
made several observations. It stated that, inter alia, the establishment of a country mandate 
was the result of a &#8220;flawed process&#8221;, that the country had been cooperating with the United 
Nations human rights system, and that the Special Rapporteur was engaged in propaganda 
by participating in forums and gatherings that were contaminated by Western espionage 
agencies, Zionist elements and terrorist groups. It also stated that sources of information, 
such as reports or complaints, lacked credibility, and that no positive reference had been 
made to meetings with officials and representatives of civil society. The Islamic Republic 
of Iran further stated that more substantive comments would be forthcoming once these 
matters were addressed.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that the cooperation of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran with the human rights mechanisms has been found wanting in reports of 
the Secretary-General, General Assembly and Human Right Council resolutions, and also 
in the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee. The Special Rapporteur 
highlights the fact that he declined to participate in any forums or public gatherings, except 
for United Nations press conferences and individual interviews with the media following 
the presentation of his first report. The Special Rapporteur believes that his information is 
credible and corroborated by a number of independent sources. Lastly, the Special 
Rapporteur met with two non-governmental organizations that are supportive of the 
Government and made adequate reference to their concerns (see paragraphs 40 and 43 
below).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7.  Together with his proposed methodology, the Special Rapporteur presented 58 cases 
of human rights violations in his interim report (A/66/374) to the General Assembly on 19 
October 2011. He drew no substantive conclusions, but presented allegations submitted to 
him as a platform for initial dialogue about the human rights situation in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>8.  To date, the Special Rapporteur has not been granted the opportunity to engage with 
Government representatives in any substantive discussion about the cases presented in his 
</p>
<p>  
www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/1208_human_rights_piccone.aspx  
</p>
<p> 5 Statement made by the Senior Adviser to the Head of the Judiciary and the Secretary-General of the 
High Council for Human Rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Javed Larijani, New York, 21 
November 2011.  
</p>
<p> 6 Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, annex. </p>


<p>interim report or to advance elements of his proposed methodology. The Special 
Rapporteur maintains that substantive engagement and access to the country would add real 
value to his work, and would allow the Government to communicate its views on specific 
issues raised in his reports. The Special Rapporteur will continue to make all efforts 
possible to encourage the Government to cooperate with the mandate holder and to allow 
him access to the country.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur undertook two missions for the purposes of the present 
report. From 3 to 7 October 2011, he travelled to Geneva and met with several non-
governmental organizations, including two that were sympathetic to the Government&#8223;s 
views on several subjects. He also interviewed 19 individuals, who submitted allegations of 
human rights violations. From 30 November to 8 December 2011, he travelled to France, 
Germany and Belgium to meet non-governmental organizations, members of the Iranian 
diaspora, diplomats and intergovernmental organizations. He also interviewed 80 people, 
including victims and witnesses of human rights violations. The Special Rapporteur wishes 
to thank the Governments of France, Germany and Belgium for facilitating his visit. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur reviewed dozens of reports submitted by non-governmental 
organizations and other relevant documents obtained during his missions, surveyed audio 
and video submissions, and monitored media reports emanating from inside and outside the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. He also interviewed an additional 42 Iranian citizens who 
reported violations of human rights from 19 October to 20 December 2011. Most of these 
cases were connected to developments in the weeks and months following the 2009 
presidential elections. The accounts given during the interviews corroborated many of the 
allegations presented in the above-mentioned reports. The Special Rapporteur maintains 
that allegations communicated to him meet evidentiary standards that are appropriate to the 
non-judicial character of the reports and conclusions, as stipulated by the code of conduct.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur examined both the national report submitted by the Islamic 
Republic of Iran7 and the relevant report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review8 for the seventh session of the Universal Periodic Review. He examined the State 
party&#8223;s third national report submitted to the Human Rights Committee,9 and various 
reports relating to that review, including the Committee&#8223;s concluding observations and 
recommendations.10 He also examined the report of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran submitted to the General Assembly.11 
Without prejudice to the matters raised in the above-mentioned reports, the Special 
Rapporteur shares the concerns raised by all three United Nations bodies, as well as the 
recommendations made thereby. 
</p>
<p>12. Many of the allegations received contend that the rule of law meant to protect 
human rights is frequently breached, impunity is promoted by a reluctance to hold violators 
accountable, and the space for public scrutiny of policies and actions that have an impact on 
the integrity of governance is severely restricted. Others complained of the inequitable 
application of laws, discriminating against women, religious and ethnic minorities, or 
exempting individuals of influential status from rules meant to restrain the abuse of power. 
Reports to the Special Rapporteur also reflected concerns over legislation that contravenes 
international human rights laws. Therefore, although the Special Rapporteur agrees that the 
Government should consider additional instruments that promote human rights in the

 10 CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3. 
 11 A/66/361. </p>


<p>country, the Government&#8223;s insufficient enforcement of its current obligations is of 
immediate concern. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal issues 
</b></p>
<p>13. Every country places certain limits on freedom of expression, association and 
assembly, but it is essential that these restrictions be not misused by authorities to close the 
space for criticism, or advocacy of policies and actions that have an impact on the public 
interest. Allegations of human rights violations reported to the Special Rapporteur 
demonstrate that a number of vaguely defined security provisions within the Islamic Penal 
Code are applied in ways that contravene international human rights law and unduly limit 
freedom of expression, association and assembly. For example, articles 513 and 514 of the 
Code criminalize &#8220;insults&#8221; to any of the &#8220;Islamic sanctities&#8221; or holy figures in Islam or to 
the first leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Article 498 criminalizes the establishment of 
any group that aims to &#8220;disrupt national security&#8221;, while article 500 forbids &#8220;propaganda 
against the order of the Islamic Republic of Iran or propaganda  on behalf of groups or 
institutions against the order of the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8221;. Article 618 criminalizes 
&#8220;disrupting the order, comfort and calm of the general public or preventing people from 
work&#8221;. Article 610 prohibits &#8220;gathering or colluding against the domestic or international 
security of the nation or committing such acts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur maintains that the vague nature of these provisions 
contravenes international human rights instruments to which the Islamic Republic Iran is a 
State party, and allow for arbitrary application and the abuse of power; for example, the 
laws that prohibit &#8220;insults&#8221; do not specify the behaviour or expressions that constitute an 
insult; consequently, individuals and organizations that criticize policies have been arrested 
and prosecuted for activities that are protected by international law. Articles 498, 500 and 
618-19 impinge upon the right to freedom of association, the right of those associations to 
publicize views that scrutinize the regime, and the right to assemble, or to support such 
assemblies. More than four dozen individuals interviewed by the Special Rapporteur 
asserted that these laws were used to violate their human rights or the rights of other 
dissenters, and that they have been intimidated, arbitrarily arrested, detained and/or 
prosecuted for protected activities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Concerns regarding legislation 
</b></p>
<p>15. A new bill, entitled the &#8220;Parties and Associations Law Reform Plan&#8221;, defines 
membership requirements for all political organizations, stating that &#8220;followers and 
</p>
<p>associates of antagonistic groups that act or have previously acted against the Islamic 
Republic&#8221; are prohibited from membership of political parties. Those deemed ineligible 
would be denied operation licenses and therefore prohibited from forming a political party 
or association. In the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s view, such a bill unduly restricts freedom of 
association and would marginalize a large segment of civil society.  
</p>
<p>16. Another bill, on the establishment and supervision of non-governmental 
organizations, would create a supreme committee to supervise the establishment and work 
of such organizations. The committee would be managed by the Ministry of the Interior and 
members would include, inter alia, representatives from the Ministry of Intelligence and 
security forces, such as the paramilitary Basij. The committee would be mandated to 
distribute registration permits to non-governmental organizations, exercise significant 
power over their boards of directors, and disband organizations. According to the bill, the 
committee&#8223;s approval would also be required for activities by organizations, including 
participation in seminars and conferences and educational sessions abroad, and </p>


<p>collaboration and/or contact with international organizations and agencies of the United 
Nations.  
</p>
<p>17. According to reports submitted to the Special Rapporteur, another bill aimed at the 
review and discipline of Members of Parliament would establish a supervisory committee 
empowered to conclude that any statement, speech or interview conducted by a member  
would violates the Moral Charter of Representatives or undermine national security. The 
bill would also allow for disciplinary action, including the suspension of salary, the 
suspension of parliamentary committee memberships, the imposition of travel restrictions 
and even dismissal from Parliament. The bill contravenes provisions of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as articles 84 and 86 of the Constitution, 
which recognizes the rights of representatives to &#8220;express their views on all internal and 
external matters of the country&#8221;. The bill would further curb the independence and 
effectiveness of Members of Parliament by eliminating legal parliamentary immunities in 
the discharge of their duties, while its punitive provisions mandate an unelected and 
unaccountable body to remove members from office, which circumvents the public&#8223;s right 
to select candidates of their choosing and to be represented by them.  
</p>
<p>18. The family protection bill seeks to amend article 22 a law, the Family Protection 
Act, which allows men to enter up to four marriages with the permission of their wives and 
a ruling from the court, by allowing men to enter into temporary marriages without the 
knowledge or permission of their wives. A man would only be required to register 
additional marriages with the court in the event of (a) pregnancy of his wife; (b) agreement 
of the two sides; (c) conditions of the marriage. The Special Rapporteur contends that this 
legislative development raises additional obstacles to the promotion of gender equality. 
since this bill would seriously curtail women&#8223;s marital rights and ability to determine issues 
that have a significant socio-economic impact on their lives.  
</p>
<p>19. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the omission of stoning as a punishment in 
the newly ratified Islamic Penal Code, but expresses his concern that severe punishments 
may still be issued at a judge&#8223;s discretion in accordance with sharia law or <i>fatwas</i>. 
Moreover, the Penal Code still discriminates against women, girls, ethnic and religious 
minorities, increases the severity of punishments for individuals accused of crimes against 
national security, and still holds juveniles accountable for their crimes unless they can 
demonstrate that they have not fully understood the criminal nature of their actions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Capital punishment 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw attention to the alarming increase in 
executions since 2003 (see table below). In his interim report, the Special Rapporteur 
reported that more than 200 executions had been announced by mid-September 2011; he 
now regrets report that 421 executions have been officially announced, and 249 secret 
executions were reported to the Special Rapporteur as at December 2011.12  
</p>
<p>  
 12 According to the official judiciary news, on 4 January 2012, authorities executed five drug-traffickers 
</p>
<p>in Kirman and Bam prisons. See 
www.kermandadgostari.ir/tabid/57/ctl/Edit/mid/409/Code/922/Default.aspx. </p>

</p>
<p>21. According to a number of sources, 81 per cent of all cases of capital punishment in 
2011 were related to drug trafficking, while 4.3 per cent and 4.1 per cent were related to 
<i>Moharebeh </i>(enmity with God) and rape, respectively.13 The Special Rapporteur continues 
to emphasize that drug offences do not meet the &#8220;serious crime&#8221; standard set by 
international law, and renews his call on the Government to implement a moratorium on the 
death penalty, especially in drug-related cases, to seriously pursue efforts to abolish the 
death penalty for juveniles, and to commute all capital sentences against them. 
</p>
<p>22. A number of individuals have been sentenced to death in recent years by stoning, 
despite announcements of a moratorium on stoning as a form of capital punishment by the 
judiciary.14 In its report on the subject, Amnesty International stated that at least 15 men 
and women are currently facing death by stoning sentences for &#8220;adultery while married&#8221;.15 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur joins the Human Rights Committee in expressing its concern about 
the use of stoning as a method of execution,16 maintains that adultery does not constitute a 
serious crime by international standards; and strongly urges the Government to enforce its 
moratorium on stoning. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that stoning has now 
been omitted from the new Penal Code and hopes all existing cases will be reviewed to 
ensure that such penalties are not carried out.

<p><b> C. Free and fair elections 
</b></p>
<p>23. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights calls for free 
and fair elections. Furthermore, according to the Constitution, &#8220;the affairs of the country 
must be administered on the basis of public opinion expressed by the means of elections, 
including the election of the President, the representatives of the Islamic Consultative 
Assembly and the members of councils&#8221;. A former Member of Parliament (wishing to 
remain anonymous) conveyed to the Special Rapporteur, however, that the scope for free 
and fair elections in his country is severely undermined by the Guardian Council&#8223;s ability to 
</p>
<p>select candidates. He stated that this power is frequently used to prevent individuals 
perceived as reformist from participating in elections, and also silences representatives who 
fear that dissent would invalidate their candidacies. The witness&#8223;s account also described 
widespread fraud during the 2008 parliamentary elections and the 2009 presidential 
election, which the witness asserted was meant to target candidates deemed to represent a 
reformist agenda.  
</p>
<p>24. According to the witness&#8223;s testimony, observers in the cities of Tehran, Shiraz, 
Tabriz and Mashad reported that polls were still open and that uncounted ballots remained 
in their unopened boxes when the Fars news agency announced the election results at 9 
p.m. in the 2008 elections. This raised widespread concerns about fraud and incited a 
number of Members of Parliament to protest with members of the Ministry of the Interior. 
Hours following the protest, at midnight, the Ministry reportedly issued a communiqu&#233; 
stating that no media or news agency was allowed to publish results until the release of its 
official count later that morning. The witness stated that the results released by the Ministry 
at 8 a.m. that day were identical to those published by Fars prior to the vote count. The 
witness added that, despite the fact that candidates had three days to contest the vote, the 
elections were declared valid the Supreme Leader on the day the results were announced, 
and complaints submitted to the Guardian Council by candidates in the ensuing days were 
dismissed.  
</p>
<p>25. The witness also claimed that the Guardian Council also ignored reports of 
irregularities and fraud submitted by the presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi in the days 
following the 2009 election. The witness recalled that the first part of Mr Karroubi&#8223;s report 
</p>
<p>described irregularities prior to election day, including various partisan statements made in 
support of the incumbent President by members of the Guardian Council and the armed 
forces,17 despite legal prohibitions on advocacy for candidates by Government officials. 
The witness  also maintained that the report described a lack of access to polling locations 
by opposition campaign representatives assigned to observe the voting process, and that, 
like in the 2008 parliamentary election, the early announcement of election results prior to 
the closure of polling places by Fars  had raised concerns about fraud.  
</p>
<p>26. The witness  further cited the interruption of telephone text messaging services (the 
main source of communication of campaigns during the election). The exceptional size of 
the winning margin nationwide (even in the hometowns of Mr Karroubi and Mr Mousavi), 
the breaches of rules governing the confirmation of election results, the existence of 3 
million more votes than ballots distributed, and the arrest of three Mousavi campaign 
workers (Behzad Nabavi, Mostafa Tajzadeh and Mohsen Mirdamadi) and three Karroubi 
campaign workers (Abdollah Momeni, Issa Saharkhiz and Ahmad Zeidabadi) together with 
dozens of others on 13 and 14 June, respectively, indicate that the authorities conspired to 
commit electoral fraud and to allay suspicion and protests.  
</p>

</p>
<p>January 2009, at www.fararu.com/vdcgxu9q.ak9y74prra.html. </p>


<p><b> D. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>27.  Article 32 of the Constitution calls for the immediate presentation of charges to 
persons arrested in accordance with its criminal procedures.18 The rules that govern 
criminal procedure also prohibit arbitrary detention and require that families of the detained 
be informed.19 The law guarantees access to and representation by legal counsel,20 and 
prohibits temporary detention for non-violent crimes, unless there is flight risk.21 Moreover, 
article 38 of the Constitution prohibits torture and states that confessions solicited by 
coercive actions &#8220;have no validity whatsoever&#8221;. Furthermore, article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for due process and fair trial guarantees, 
including the right of all persons to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent 
and impartial tribunal established by law. These rights are a mainstay of human rights 
protections and serve as a procedural means to safeguard the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>28. Reports recently conveyed to the Special Rapporteur, however, suggest that, despite 
these legal provisions, violations of due process rights are chronic, reducing the likelihood 
of a fair trial; for example, the majority of persons interviewed for the present report 
maintained that they were not presented with a warrant or reason for arrest during their 
interrogations. Several interviewees reported that they had endured unlawful searches and 
seizures, and had been held for weeks, even months, in solitary confinement without being 
informed of their charges. All interviewees stated that they had been blindfolded during 
transfer and their interrogation, and most were unable to contact family members to inform 
them of their whereabouts and did not have access to legal counsel after their arrest, and 
during their detention or investigations.  
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, a number of interviewees stated that their lawyers only had access to 
them immediately prior to their trial and did not have access to evidence, case files or 
witnesses testifying against them. Some also reported that their lawyers had been prevented 
from presenting an oral defence during trial. In some cases, judges reportedly issued a 
verdict after a trial that lasted only a few minutes. Several stated that they had been 
subjected to coercive treatment that is tantamount to torture, including the excessive use of 
</p>
<p>  
 18 &#8220;No one may be arrested except by order and in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. In 
</p>
<p>the event of arrest, charges with the reasons for accusation must be communicated and explained, 
without delay, to the accused in writing, and a provisional dossier must be forwarded to the competent 
judicial authorities within a maximum of 24 hours so that the preliminaries to the trial may be 
completed as swiftly as possible. Violation of the present article will be liable to punishment in 
accordance with the law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 19 Article 5 of the Law of Respecting Legitimate Freedoms and Citizenship Rights (2004) states that 
&#8220;the principle of ban of arrest and detention of individuals necessitates that when it is compulsory to 
do so, it should be done on the basis of a warrant and in the manner prescribed by law. The case must 
be handed over to relevant judicial authorities within the time prescribed and the family members of 
the arrestee should be informed of the matter.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 20 According to article 35 of the Constitution, &#8220;both parties to a lawsuit have the right in all courts of 
law to select an attorney; if they are unable to do so, arrangements must be made to provide them with 
legal counsel.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 21 Article 132 of the Criminal Code of Procedure states that, &#8220;in order to have access to the accused and 
ensure his prompt presence, and when necessary prevent his flight or hiding or conspiring with 
another, the judge is duty-bound to, after explaining the charges to the accused, issue one of the 
following securing orders: (a) obligating to be present by promising on one&#8223;s honour; (b) obligation to 
be present by deciding an obliging amount effective until the completion of trial and execution of the 
sentence and in case of refusal, changing it to a sponsoring amount; (c) receiving a sponsor or 
sponsoring amount; (d) receiving bail, which may include cash, bank promissory note or movable or 
immovable property; (e) temporary detention with accordance to the conditions prescribed by the 
present law. </p>


<p>solitary confinement, electric shock, severe beatings, threats of rape and threats to detain 
and/or harm friends, associates and family members. People were also allegedly forced to 
make on-camera confessions.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p>30. A compilation of prisoner interviews, public statements and letters submitted to the 
Special Rapporteur about circumstances in nine of the country&#8223;s prisons22 described 
conditions that fall well below the minimum standards proclaimed by the United Nations,23 
such as severe overcrowding, inadequate access to water, insufficient prisoner segregation 
practices, extremely poor quality and unhygienic facilities, hazardous ventilation 
conditions, insufficient access to medical services, paltry nutritional provisions and the 
perpetuation of violence and use of prisoners to facilitate punishment. The Special 
Rapporteur spoke with four detainees who had been arrested and detained at the Kahrizak 
Detention Centre in the days following the 2009 presidential election, and whose 
testimonies corroborated many of the allegations concerning prison conditions made in the 
the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>31. Following the closing of the Kahrizak detention centre in July 2009, a parliamentary 
committee assigned to investigate allegations in January 2010 reportedly established the 
responsibility of the former Prosecutor General of Tehran, Saeed Mortazavi, for abuses at 
Kahrizak, and confirmed the death of three prisoners following beatings at the hands of 
their jailers. On 30 June 2010, the judicial organization of the Iranian Armed Forces 
announced that 11 members of the Kahrizak prison staff and one civilian had been indicted 
for their involvement in the above-mentioned crimes. The indictment submitted to the Head 
of the Military Courts in Tehran charged the defendants with several crimes, including 
&#8220;denying detainees their constitutional rights&#8221; and &#8220;violating their civil rights&#8221;. Of those 
convicted, two were sentenced to death for the deaths of Amir Javadifar, Mohsen 
Rooholamini and Mohammad Kamrani, and nine were suspended from service, given fines 
and made to pay compensation, and sentenced to flogging and imprisonment. One of the 
defendants was acquitted.  
</p>
<p>32. Masood Alizadeh, Hatef Soltani, Taha Zeinali and a witness wishing to remain 
anonymous, who were all detained in Kahrizak detention centre, filed a lawsuit against the 
police for abuse. Three of the interviewees reported being repeatedly threatened and 
violently intimidated by Government officials to withdraw their claims. Mr. Alizadeh 
reported that he was attacked and stabbed by two men on 15 October 2010, losing his 
spleen as a result, and speculated that the incident was connected to his lawsuit. Mr. Soltani 
stated that he was repeatedly offered bribes, and his own family&#8223;s safety was threatened. 
The anonymous witness claimed that he had been severely beaten to force him to withdraw 
his complaint.  
</p>
<p>  
 22  Evin Prison, Gohardasht Prison, Qezelhesar Prison, Mashhad&#8223;s Vakil Abad Prison, Qarchak Prison, 
</p>
<p>Hassan Abad, Khorin Prison, Lakan Prison and Yazd Central Prison. 
 23 For example, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the Economic 
</p>
<p>and Social Council in its resolutions 663 C (XXIV) and 2076 (LXII), and the Body of Principles for 
the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, adopted by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 43/173. </p>


<p>33. In a joint statement, the International Federation for Human Rights and the Iranian 
League for the Defence of Human Rights maintained that the court&#8223;s investigation was not 
comprehensive and was remiss in examining the death of at least two other detainees, 
Ramin Aqazadeh- Qahremani and Abbas Nejati-Kargar, who died as a result of torture soon 
after being released from the detention centre.24 All of the plaintiffs interviewed stated that 
a number of high-ranking officials, whose names were made available to the Special 
Rapporteur, enjoy impunity for their abuse of several detainees and for their complicity in 
the Kahrizak crimes.  
</p>
<p>34. In an open letter to the Special Rapporteur, the &#8220;Mothers of Laleh Park&#8221; requested 
that Special Rapporteur to investigate the deaths of their children &#8211; Neda Agha Soltan, 
Sohrab Arabi, Ashkan Sohrabi, Masoud Hashem Zadeh, Mostafa Karim Beigi, Kianoush 
Asa and Ali Hsan Pour &#8211; during the 2009 elections. To date, the Special Rapporteur has 
only been able to examine one of these cases.  
</p>
<p>35. The disappearance of Sohrab Arabi during the 2009 election protests received 
significant media attention. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are still unclear 
and initial reports suggested that he might have been shot in the streets during peaceful 
protests, and either died later in hospital or while in police custody. After 26 days of 
intensive searching and enquiring with officials, the family discovered that Mr Arabi&#8223;s 
body was being held by the authorities. The judiciary initially refused to share any 
information with the family and insisted that Mr Arabi was alive and would eventually be 
released from prison. The authorities eventually returned his body, which had several bullet 
wounds. Mr Arabi&#8223;s mother and other family members have been constantly harassed and 
threatened following their call for an investigation. Authorities have reportedly raided his 
family&#8223;s home and confiscated photos and other belongings. Family members and close 
</p>
<p>friends have also been prevented from visiting Mr Arabi&#8223;s grave site and are reportedly 
prohibited from marking the anniversary of his death. The Government has reportedly taken 
responsibility for the killing of Mr Arabi. In April 2011, the family reportedly received a 
verbal offer of <i>diyah</i> (blood money), and were subjected to considerable pressure to accept 
the offer and abandon their call for an investigation. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to assist him in obtaining further information regarding this and other 
unsolved cases relating to the post-election protests of 2009. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur shares the concern of the Human Rights Committee that, to 
date, a full, impartial and independent investigation into allegations made during and 
following the presidential elections of 12 June 2009 has still not been conducted. He also 
shares its concern that responsible high-level officials have not been held accountable.25 
Reports containing allegations of egregious human rights violations that took place in the 
days and months following the 2009 presidential elections continue to emerge, 
demonstrating that breaches of the rule of law have not been addressed and that impunity 
continues to prevail.  
</p>
<p>37. One such report described the events surrounding the widely publicized raid of 
Tehran University dormitories aimed at dispersing protestors that gathered on 13 June 
2009.26 A student activist (wishing to remain anonymous) claimed that plain-clothed and 
regular security forces &#8211; who are legally prohibited from entering university campuses &#8211;

<p>raided dormitory buildings using sticks, daggers, chains, metal rods, Molotov cocktails, 
teargas, white phosphorous pellets and electrified batons. Dormitory rooms were 
vandalized and students were beaten. The witness reported being thrown on the ground and 
beaten with electrified and regular batons by the police, and later arrested and transferred 
with a group of 50 other students to Shapur Police Station in central Tehran. The students 
were allegedly deprived of food and water for 24 hours and subjected to beatings. 
</p>
<p>38. Several organizations also requested the Special Rapporteur to investigate the death 
of those killed &#8220;as a result of individual or mass executions inside and outside the prisons&#8221; 
</p>
<p>during the 1980&#8223;s. In this regard, he was presented with a catalogue of some 20,000 cases 
of individuals, including juveniles, affiliated with the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization 
(MKO), who have been allegedly executed, abused or tortured by Government authorities 
since 1980.27 He also received information from the Habilian Association, which claims to 
represent 17,000 victims of violence at the hands of MKO members since 1980.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is not in a position to examine the above-mentioned cases, 
but would like to point out that the Special Representative of the Commission on Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran reviewed the matter 
of mass executions and violence during the 1980&#8223;s in 1989, concluding that the allegations 
of mass murder deserved to be the subject of detailed investigation and information from 
the Government concerned in conformity with international practice.28 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the failure to resolve thousands of cases 
of torture and extrajudicial execution is indelibly etched into the consciousness of the 
Iranian people and should be the subject of a comprehensive examination.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of human rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  </b>Women&#8217;s <b>rights 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Communication Network of 
Women, which claims to represent 1,600 women&#8223;s non-governmental organizations across 
the country. They conveyed their concerns about the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s impartiality and 
expressed their view that gender equality had significantly improved since the 
establishment of the Islamic Republic, noting that the matter required a comprehensive 
study of data for the past 30 years. Like the Human Rights Committee, the Special 
Rapporteur has taken note of the impressive improvements in literacy rates and statistics 
that show a marked increase in female enrolment in educational institutions since 1990. He 
also acknowledges reports that that the Islamic Republic of Iran is on track for reducing the 
maternal mortality ratio by 75 per cent between 1990 and 2015.29  
</p>
<p>42. Other reports that focus on women&#8223;s rights suggest that additional efforts must be 
made to facilitate the socio-economic equality of women in the country; for instance, two 
former female university students explained during an interview that, although the number 
of women enrolling in Iranian academic institutions is high, women continue to be subject 
to discriminatory practices that hinder equal access to all the academic and professional

<p>opportunities that exist in the country. They pointed out that quotas had been put in place to 
limit the number of women that can enrol in medicine, Masters and PhD programmes, thus 
discriminating against women that scored higher than males on entrance exams when 
female enrolment has exceeded the quota. Furthermore, eight universities have reportedly 
implemented gender segregation policies on their campuses, some of which have barred 
women from attending free day classes, forcing them to attend evening classes, which 
charge tuition fees.  
</p>
<p>43. According to Fars, eight children were severely burned (some suffering limb loss) 
on 5 December 2006.30 The Ministry of Education and Development was found guilty of 
negligence in the case of the fire,31 but the legal counsel for the children stated that the final 
ruling from the court allocated twice as much <i>diyah</i> (see paragraph 37 above) to the male 
victims than the female victims. After public outcry about the discriminatory outcome, 
State media reported that girls would be paid an equal amount.32 The Special Rapporteur 
commends the recent decision to overturn a court ruling to pay girls half the <i>diyah</i> allotted 
to boys for burns and injuries sustained in a school fire. He encourages the Government to 
reassess all laws that discriminate against women and girls, especially those that place 
unequal value on their lives and bodily parts. 
</p>
<p>44. In a report submitted to the Human Rights Committee, the Government noted that 
efforts to ensure equal representation in high Government offices, such as for judge, had 
resulted in 614 female judges being approved.33 The Special Rapporteur also wishes, 
however, to highlight other reports according to which women do not hold positions as 
presiding judges in courts of law and that they are deprived of the right to hold various 
offices of the State. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to make an effort to 
improve female representation in decision-making positions of the judicial system and in 
other Government offices where they are underrepresented.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Labour unions 
</b></p>
<p>45. Despite the ban on independent unions, some workers have reportedly formed small 
independent unions for the purpose of advocating for workers&#8223; rights; these include bakers 
in Kordestan, sugar workers in Khuzestan, bus drivers and metal workers in Tehran, and 
teachers nationwide.34 Many of these workers and their representatives have allegedly been 
harassed, intimidated and arrested for their activities. For example, authorities reportedly 
arrested more than 200 people in Laleh Park after forcibly dispersing a peaceful rally for 
International Labour Day in May 2009. All are believed to have been released by 
September 2009.35 
</p>
<p>46. On 24 October 2011, the International Transport Workers&#8223; Federation expressed its 
concern for the former treasurer of a bus drivers&#8223; union, Davood Razavi, who was 
summoned and appeared before the sixth branch of the Evin prison prosecutors office on 24 
October 2011. The summons related to a 2006 case involving his organization&#8223;s accounts 
and its newsletter. Reportedly, Mr Razavi has been notified that the charges have been 
dropped. The bus union treasurer, Reza Shahab Zakaria, was charged with &#8220;acting against

The deputy head of the union, Ebrahim Madadi, who was also arrested and sentenced to 
three and half year on charges of &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, was released on 1 
</p>
<p>December 2011.36 
</p>
<p>47. According to Amnesty International, the President of the Haft Tapeh Trade Union, 
Reza Rakhshan, was detained for six months and released on $150,000 bail on 19 January 
2010.37 The President of the Union of Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, 
Mansour Osanloo, who was serving a five-year sentence on charges of &#8220;acts against 
national security&#8221; and &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; was temporarily released on 2 June 
2011.38 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his disappointment at the recent 
conviction of Sohrab Razzaghi, former Allameh Tabatabaee faculty member, human rights 
advocate and Head of the Volunteer Actors Institute. Mr Razzaghi was tried in absentia and 
sentenced in January 2012 to 20 years in prison and a fine of $760,705 on charges of 
&#8220;forming a group with the intent to overthrow the regime and act against national security&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;keeping top-secret information in order to make the same available to foreigners&#8221;, 
&#8220;collusion with the intent to overthrow and act against national security&#8221;, and &#8220;receiving 
</p>
<p>funds from international organizations&#8221;. Mr Razzaghi&#8223;s attorney, Abdolfattah Soltani, is 
currently in prison on security-related charges.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned for the safety of human rights defender 
Kouhyar Goudarzi, who was arrested on 31 July 2011 and has been held incommunicado in 
Evin Prison ever since. It has been reported that neither his family nor his legal counsel has 
had access to Mr Goudarzi. Several reports maintain that his mother, Parvin Mokhtareh, 
was arrested and tried on 6 September 2011 on charges relating to her advocacy for her son. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to disclose the location of Mr Goudarzi, to 
allow him access to his family and a legal counsel, and to immediately release him as well 
as his mother. 
</p>
<p>50. Elham Ahsani, a university student and active member of Mourning Mothers, was 
arrested together with her brother Nadar Ahsani by security forces on 8 February 2010 at 
her home in Tehran, then taken to section 209 at Evin Prison. She was blindfolded, 
subjected to threats against her family and was threatened with rape and execution 
throughout her detention period. The charges brought against her included &#8220;propaganda 
against the system&#8221;, &#8220;acts against national security&#8221;, &#8220;membership of an illegal group&#8221;, 
participation in clashes during <i>Ashoura</i> 2009 and dissemination of information outside the 
country. She was denied family visits and had no access to a lawyer. She spent 40 days in 
detention before being released on bail. Her case file remains open, and a judgement has yet 
to be issued. She has since fled the country. Mr Ahsani was given two years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>51. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight reports about Ayatollah Seyyed 
Hossein Kazemyani Boroujerdi, who remains in prison for his political opinions. Recent

<p>reports allege that Mr Boroujerdi&#8223;s health has continued to deteriorate and that he has 
insufficient access to medical treatment. In November 2011, his cellmate reportedly made 
an attempt on his life, an attack allegedly orchestrated by authorities; reports maintain that 
Mr Boroujerdi remains in danger. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for urgent 
adequate medical access for Mr Boroujerdi and for his immediate release. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Journalists 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Islamic Republic of Iran has detained more journalists that any other country in 
the world, with 42 journalists currently imprisoned.39 According to reports received by the 
Special Rapporteur, at least 150 journalists have fled the country since the presidential 
election of 2009 owing to fear of repression and persecution. In a letter to the Special 
Rapporteur, Reporters without Borders stated that approximately 50 publications had been 
suspended since the election, and that most press trials are conducted in private, despite the 
fact that the Constitution stipulates that press trials must be judged by a jury.40 It was also 
reported that journalists are frequently barred from appearing at their trials and are often 
informed of their sentences in prison.  
</p>
<p>53. In an interview, two recently detained journalists (who wish to remain anonymous) 
reported increasing censorship in the country. One stated that &#8220;authorities used to tell us 
before what not to write, and now they are telling us what to write as well&#8221;. The reporters 
claimed that the Ministry of Cultural Guidance and/or the National Security Council often 
directly censored newspapers by telling them what issues to cover through memos or 
telephone calls. One interviewee stated that newspaper editors were called and threatened to 
refrain from writing about reformist politicians, and that the Office of the Supreme Leader 
had instructed the press to refrain from reporting on allegations of widespread corruption in 
the country. They reported that press offices were raided and searched, and equipment was 
often confiscated. Reporters are frequently banned from journalism in the absence of court 
rulings, which forces journalists to practice self-censorship.  
</p>
<p>54. Mohammad Reza Yazdanpanah, a journalist who works for reformist newspapers 
and websites, was arrested on 7 July 2009 for his support for and role in post-presidential 
election protests. He was held incommunicado, and spent 18 days in solitary confinement 
and interrogated for giving interviews to foreign media outlets, establishing relations with 
the diplomatic community, and participating in the post-election unrest. Throughout his 
detention, Mr Yazdanpanah was threatened with rape and subjected to treatment amounting 
to torture, and to certain humiliating practices. He was forced to stand for 48 hours without 
food and water. He was released after posting bail equivalent to $200,000. Two weeks after 
his release, Mr Yazdanpanah was summoned by the Ministry of Intelligence, where he was 
allegedly forced to make a confession. 
</p>
<p>55. Another journalist (also wishing to remain anonymous), reported having been 
arrested during the post-election protests in 2009 and taken to Ward 209 in Evin Prison. 
The journalist described detention in solitary confinement and interrogations by individuals 
that possessed recordings of the journalist&#8223;s conversations and e-mail correspondence. The 
witness reported being blindfolded and threatened with rape and solitary confinement 
during interrogations in order to other force confession and cooperation. The witness was

political offences are determined by law in accordance with Islamic criteria.&#8221; </p>


<p>released on $100,000 bail after a month. The witness was summoned after two months and 
was formally charged with propaganda against the system. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Students 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is disturbed by reports of violations of students&#8223; rights to 
freedom of expression, association and assembly (see annex, section B). He is also 
concerned by reports of students being deprived of their right to education on the basis of 
their political and student activities critical of Government or university policies. Ali 
Nezeri, a student activist, described the use of university disciplinary committees to punish 
students for their political activities on and off campus. He claimed that disciplinary 
procedure was often breached and that the fate of students was decided by external bodies. 
Mr Nezeri reported that he was summoned twice by the committee at his university; once 
for his activities with the Islamic Student Association, and once for protesting against the 
university&#8223;s lack of safety standards after two students died in university dorms from 
</p>
<p>carbon monoxide poisoning.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur received a number of reports regarding the arrest of Rozhin 
Mohammadi, a medical student at Manila Medical School of the Philippines, on 14 
November 2011 at Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran. According to sources (wishing to 
remain anonymous), Ms Mohammadi was visiting family when arrested. She was 
reportedly released the following day after posting bail. Following her release, security 
forces raided her father&#8223;s home and confiscated her personal belongings. She was rearrested 
</p>
<p>on 23 November 2011 and taken to Evin Prison. It is feared that Ms Mohammadi might be 
subjected to solitary confinement and other forms of abuse and torture. There has been no 
news about her since her arrest, and her family and defence counsel have been denied 
visiting rights. 
</p>
<p>58. In a letter to the Special Rapporteur, the Human Rights Commission of Daftar 
Tahkim Vahdat stressed the important contribution that student organizations and their 
members make to improving academic life and to defending student and human rights. The 
peaceful efforts of students &#8211; including the hosting of lectures and the publication of 
articles &#8211; are often met with punitive university or Government measures. Citing statistics 
on the treatment of student activists based on information gathered from news sources, the 
Commission maintains that, since March 2009, there have been 436 arrests, 254 convictions 
and 364 cases of deprivation of education. Moreover, 144 students have been summoned by 
the judiciary, and 13 student publications have been forcibly closed. The Commission also 
gave the names of 32 student activists currently in prison for their activities.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Unrecognized religious communities  
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur continues to be alarmed by communications that 
demonstrate the systemic and systematic persecution of members of unrecognized religious 
communities, particularly the Baha&#8223;i community, in violation of international conventions. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the Government&#8223;s tolerance of an intensive defamation campaign meant to incite 
discrimination and hate against Baha&#8223;is violates its obligations as set out in article 5 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
According to one report, 440 instances of slanderous speech against Baha&#8223;is were published </p>


<p>or broadcasted in the past two years. One such article, posted by the Rasa news agency on 8 
March 2011,41 accused the Baha&#8223;i community of attempting to subvert Islam.42  
</p>
<p>60. Baha&#8223;is continue to be arbitrarily arrested and detained for their beliefs, in violation 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In a report submitted to the 
Special Rapporteur, it was alleged that 474 Baha&#8223;is had been arrested since August 2004. 
Of that number, 97 were currently imprisoned (see annex, table IV); 199 had been released 
on bail and were awaiting trial; 26 had been released without bail; 96 had been tried and 
sentenced, and free pending appeal or summons to begin serving their sentences; 34 had 
been tried and sentenced and had completed their prison terms and/or paid a fine; 14 
sentences had been overturned on appeal; and 5 Baha&#8223;is had served their prison sentences 
and begun their terms of internal exile. An additional 35 arrests were reportedly made 
between August and November 2011.  
</p>
<p>61. Baha&#8223;is are subjected to severe socio-economic pressure, in violation of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; in some cases, they have 
been deprived of property, employment and education. In recent months, for example, 10 
shops and a well owned by Baha&#8223;is in two cities in Semnan Province were sealed by the 
</p>
<p>authorities. Moreover, copies of several unsettling Government documents dating back to 
1991 prescribe deprivation of education, the establishment of an office to counteract Baha&#8223;i 
publications, the denial of &#8220;positions of influence&#8221; to them and the trades prohibited for 
them. One Baha&#8223;i student reported in an interview that 800 Baha&#8223;is were denied university 
admission the year that his application was denied. In addition, several Baha&#8223;is recently 
arrested were affiliated with the Baha&#8223;i Institute for Higher Education, which is a university 
designed to educate Iranian Baha&#8223;is that are excluded from education.43  
</p>
<p><b> G. Ethnic minorities  
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive reports about human rights violations 
affecting ethnic minorities, in law and in practice. As at 31 October 2011, 15 Kurdish 
activists were reportedly on death row on charges including &#8220;acting against national 
security&#8221;, &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; and espionage. Minorities also continue to be subjected to 
intense socio-economic discrimination and pressures, including land and property 
confiscation, denial of employment and restrictions on social, cultural and linguistic rights, 
in violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>63. Farzad Kamangar, a Kurdish teacher, was executed together with three other Kurds 
on 9 May 2010, at Evin Prison. Close family members reported that Mr Kamangar was 
denied a fair trial and that his execution was carried out in secret. Mr Kamangar was 
arrested by the Ministry of Intelligence in 2006 and sentenced to death on charges of 
<i>Moharebeh</i> (see paragraph 22) and for alleged membership of and activities with the 
Kurdistan Workers&#8223; Party. In an interview, it was reported that Mr Kamangar was initially 
held incommunicado and subjected to various forms of torture, including threats of rape 
and against the safety of family members. Mr Kamangar was reportedly sentenced to death 
</p>
<p>  
 41  Baha&#8223;i International Community, Inciting Hatred: Iran&#8217;s media campaign to demonise Baha&#8217;is, 
</p>
<p>October 2011. Available from http://bic.org/resources/documents/inciting-hatred-book. 
 42  www.rasanews.ir/Nsite/FullStory/?Id=99956. 
 43  In a statement reported by the State news agency ISNA on 4 June 2011 
</p>
<p>(www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1780417), the Ministry of Science and Technology 
declared the activities of the Baha&#8223;i Institute for Higher Education illegal and that all diplomas and 
degrees issued by it had no legal validity. </p>


<p>in early 2008, after a trial that reportedly lasted seven minutes. He was denied access to his 
lawyer and family members. Despite numerous requests by family members, authorities 
have refused to return his body or help locate his grave. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the systematic killings of <i>kulbars</i> 
(back carriers) and <i>kasebkaran</i> (tradesmen), Kurds residing in border areas. The <i>kulbaran</i>, 
who ferry cargo across the border on their backs or smuggle commodities such as tea, 
tobacco and fuel to earn a living, are particularly affected. Iranian law regards the activities 
of the <i>kulbari</i> as a crime that is punishable by several months of detention or a fine equal to 
the value of the seized commodities. The Special Rapporteur received reports, however, 
that Iranian border guards indiscriminately shoot at these individuals, thereby killing and 
wounding dozens of <i>kulbari</i> annually, as well as their horses.  
</p>
<p>65. Members of the Baloch, a Sunni religious community and ethnic minority, are 
reportedly subject to multifaceted discrimination, harassment, mistreatment, arbitrary arrest 
and even executions. According to reports received by the Special Rapporteur, areas with a 
Baloch majority are underdeveloped and frequently face the problems raised by limited 
access to housing, education, health care and employment. Their freedoms of expression 
and religion are also curtailed. Concerns were also expressed about the low level of Baloch 
participation in public life, given that they are underrepresented in high-ranking 
Government positions. Furthermore, the application of the Gozinesh criterion, a procedure 
that requires prospective State officials and employees to demonstrate their allegiance to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and the State religion of Shia Islam, has further alienated the 
Baloch and severely limited their employment opportunities and political participation. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur learned that 57 people arrested during the protests to save 
Lake Urmieh from drying out in 2011 were recently sentenced to a total of 26 years 
imprisonment and 1,390 lashes. A total of 112 people were tried, of whom 55 were 
acquitted and 57 were given prison sentences, lashings or both. Those convicted reportedly 
included five women and nine people under the age of 18. The Special Rapporteur received 
reports that many of those arrested and convicted were subjected to inhuman treatment 
during their interrogations. Other reports described the arrest and detention of 65 ethnic 
Arabs in Khuzestan Province since late 2011, allegedly in response to their calls for a 
boycott of upcoming parliamentary elections and anti-Government slogans.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Treatment of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur shares the concern of the Human Rights Committee that 
members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community face harassment, 
persecution and cruel punishment and are denied their basic human rights, including their 
right to life.44 The current Penal Code criminalizes same-sex relations between consenting 
individuals, while article 109 of the Islamic Penal Code states that &#8220;both parties to gay sex 
are equally criminally liable and could face severe punishment, including the death 
penalty&#8221;. In September 2011, three men were reportedly executed under the country&#8223;s 
sodomy laws.45 Iranian officials often qualify homosexuality as a disease, and insist on 
applying stringent punishment for acts perceived as homosexual in nature. For example, in 
2011, two prominent Iranian soccer players were indefinitely suspended and fined for 
committing an &#8220;immoral act&#8221; on the field by appearing to intimately touch each other 
during goal-scoring celebrations. 
</p>
<p>  
 44 CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para. 10. 
 45  Reported by ISNA (http://khouzestan.isna.ir/Default.aspx?NSID=5&amp;SSLID=46&amp;NID=16917). </p>


<p>68. Human rights defenders who advocate for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender community are often subject to Government intimidation and prosecution. Dr. 
Houtan Kian, a lawyer who has defended individuals accused of sodomy and adultery, was 
officially indicted on 11 charges, including defamation of the Iranian judiciary, espionage, 
disclosing secret and classified information (relating to information on the murder of 
political prisoners by the Government through undetectable medical methods), fraud and 
falsifying identities.46 He has reportedly been severely tortured, including sustaining close 
to 60 cigarette burns on his body, especially around his genitals and on his legs. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur has catalogued allegations that produce a striking 
pattern of violations of fundamental human rights guaranteed under international 
</b></p>
<p><b>law. He restates his call for the Government to respect its international obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and underscores the pre-eminence of international human rights law, as it relates to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need to develop domestic laws that are compatible with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights laws and national standards. This includes the guarantees stipulated in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Consequently, he urges the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to reconsider the Parties and Associations Law Reform Plan, the bill on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the establishment and supervision of non-governmental organizations, the bill aimed 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the review and discipline of Members of Parliament, and the family protection bill, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as security laws, to ensure that they do not contravene international standards.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to explicitly define actions that 
constitute crimes against national security, and encourages the Government to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that peaceful activities that are considered to be protected by freedom of expression, 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and assembly are not criminalized. He reiterates his call for the immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and calls upon the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to protect the space for public criticism or advocacy.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Special Rapporteur joins the Human Rights Committee in its call for an 
extensive, impartial and independent investigation into the violence in the weeks and 
</b></p>
<p><b>months that followed the presidential election of 2009. Similarly, he calls for further 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations into the numerous allegations of custodial violence and deaths at 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kahrizak prison and other places of detention in order to implicate individuals that 
</b></p>
<p><b>have not yet faced prosecution.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to prohibit the death penalty 
</b>for cases that do not meet the standard of &#8220;serious crime&#8221; as defined by international 
</p>
<p><b>law, and recommends that authorities commute capital sentences for individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>whose crimes do not meet that standard. He also calls upon the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>seriously consider a moratorium on the death penalty for all crimes until such time as 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective enforcement of due process rights may be meaningfully demonstrated, and 
</b></p>
<p>  
 46  Dr. Kian&#8223;s situation was discussed in an interview with his former lawyer, Taghi Mahmoudi 
</p>
<p>(www.hra-news.org/2/00/9648-1.html), who claimed that Dr. Kian had been tried in three different 
counts: the 15th branch of the Tehran Revolutionary Court, in which he was acquitted of a charge of 
blasphemy; the 104th Branch of the Criminal Court in Tabriz, where he was acquitted of  forgery; and 
the First Branch of the Revolutionary Court in Tabriz, which found him guilty of national security 
charges. </p>


<p><b>urges the Government to allow for legal representation of accused persons at all stages 
</b></p>
<p><b>of investigations.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government prohibit the 
execution of juveniles, as prescribed by international law, and that authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider commuting all capital sentences for juveniles currently facing a death 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentence. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the omission of the stoning penalty 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the new Penal Code, but encourages the Government to take steps to explicitly 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrict the use of this punishment, and calls on the Government to commute existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentences for execution by stoning.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur continues to stress the critical need for greater 
transparency and closer engagement with the Human Rights Council and United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations human rights mechanisms in strengthening human rights safeguards for all in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the State accepted 
</b></p>
<p><b>123 recommendations made during its universal periodic review, and recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that a voluntary mid-term review could provide a more transparent way to 
</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrate their implementation. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to engage fully with special procedures mandate holders and to facilitate 
</b></p>
<p><b>their access to the country, in compliance with the standing invitation issued in 2002. 
</b></p>
<p><b>He also urges the Government to collaborate in the fulfilment of his mandate and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond positively to his requests for a country visit.

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Additional reports of human rights violations in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Kahrizak Detention Center Cases  
</b></p>
<p>1. Masood Alizadeh, Hatef Soltani, Taha Zeinali, and a witness who wishes to remain 
anonymous were separately interviewed from 31 October - 3 November 2011. They all 
testified that they were arrested on 9 July 2009 at different locations by plainclothes forces 
during a city-wide protest. They reported that they were beaten severely, and transferred 
with approximately 250 people to the Prevention Police Headquarters in Enghelab Square. 
All four interviewees stated that the investigative Judge, whose name was made available to 
the Special Rapporteur, came to the police headquarters on 10 July 2009, where he 
distributed a list of charges against the protestors and beat a number of prisoners.  
</p>
<p>2. They reported that they were transferred to Kahrizak Prison and placed in a 70 sq. 
meter cell with no ventilation and one toilet with about 124-146 other prisoners, some of 
whom were incarcerated for violent crimes, such as murder and rape. These prisoners were 
said to dole out punishments to the protestors. It was also said to be so crowded in the cell 
that individuals had to take turns sleeping while others stood. Authorities reportedly 
pumped gas exhaust fumes into the cell when they wanted the prisoners to be quiet.   
</p>
<p>3. The interviewees stated that detainees were taken outside barefoot the next day, 
directed to form a circle, and told to walk around the searing asphalt yard while squatting. 
They asserted that everyone suffered burns to their feet and those unable to perform this 
task suffered from burns to the hands and knees as a result of crawling on the asphalt. 
Those that were unable to follow this order were reportedly beaten with PVC pipes. The 
unnamed witness corroborated the abuse and torture of Masood Alizadeh on the second 
night of their detention. Both men testified that a prisoner was ordered to pick protestors to 
be hung from the ceiling in order to &#8221;teach others a lesson and to make them cooperate.&#8221; 
Mr. Alizadeh was randomly chosen, hung from the ceiling by his feet, and beaten. Mr. 
Alizadeh passed out from the 20 minutes beating. After being unhooked, Mr. Alizadeh 
stated that he immediately endured another beating from a prisoner on orders from the 
authorities, and sustained multiple head wounds as a result. His wounds went untreated 
until after he was transferred from Kahrizak Prison.  
</p>
<p>4. By the third day all the wounds sustained during beatings were infected, and most of 
the detainees reportedly had eye infections. The heat in the cell was described to be 
&#8220;intense&#8221;, and the witnesses stated that people were passing out as a result, including a 
</p>
<p>prisoner named Amir Javadifar who reportedly had broken bones when he arrived in his 
cell. The interviewees said the detainees pounded pound on the door and until a guard 
agreed to let them out for a 15 minute fresh air break.  Several individuals were sent to the 
prison yard to seek medical treatment for their infections and broken bones at that time. 
However, their request for painkillers and treatment for their injuries were reportedly 
ignored. Amir Javadifar was allegedly told to stop pretending to be sick by the physician on 
duty. All four witnesses reported that Mohsen Rooholamini, and Mohammad Kamrani were 
also refused medical treatment. All three men reportedly died from their injuries.  
</p>
<p>5. The detainees were prepared to be transferred from Kahrizak to Evin Prison on the 
fifth day. The Head of the Detention Center reportedly beat the prisoners for &#8220;not getting 
dressed fast enough&#8221;. The witnesses stated that Amir Javadifar died during this transfer to 
Evin Prison as a result of negligence. They stated that detainees complained to the </p>


<p>authorities about his breathing and that his condition appeared serious, however, no medical 
treatment was provided until CPR was performed by another detainee when Mr. Javadifar 
stopped breathing.  The prisoners were transferred to Evin Prison that evening and allowed 
to contact their families after a week.  
</p>

Association, was sentenced to 6 years in prison and 74 lashes by Branch 26 of the Tehran 
Revolutionary Court, on charges of &#8220;acting against national security,&#8221; and &#8220;disruption in 
public order&#8221;. Faridi reported that he was arrested on the evening of 14 June 2009, after a

</p>
<p>charged with &#8220;acting against national security&#8221; and &#8220;participating in an illegal gathering&#8221;. 
The victim was reported to have made false confessions to having connections to foreign 
governments as a result of his treatment. S/he was later released on $150,000 bail in August

<p>16 Karim ( Rebin ) Rahmani, human rights defender, was arrested in Kermanshah on 
November 19, 2006, and charged with &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;. He reported that 
he was working on research, which consisted of interviewing addicts and traffickers, and he 
speculated that he was arrested, because his work concluded that government officials were 
involved in drug trafficking. Mr. Rahmani reported that he was severely beaten for several 
hours and detained in the &quot;Meydan-e Naft&quot; detention center for 20 days. He was accused of 
preparing a report for foreign media, and the international community implicating officials 
with engaging in drug trafficking. Mr. Rahmani was denied the right to choose his own 
lawyer, and the right to post bail.  He reported that he was psychologically tortured with 
threats to his family, which promoted him to attempt suicide.  He was sentenced to two year 
in prison.  
</p>
<p>17. Behzad Kordestani, a Kurdish poet has been arrested twelve times in the past 10 
years. He reported in an interview that he has never been presented with an arrest warrant. 
His last arrest took place in August 2010. Mr. Kordestani stated that after 8 hours of 
interrogation, he was informed of his &#8220;unfounded&#8221; charges of (1) &#8220;cooperation with 
</p>
<p>political parties and group lets (opposition/armed groups)&#8221; (2) propagating falsehoods, (3) 
</p>
<p>acting against national security, and (4) espionage.&#8221; He stated that he was held for 79 days 
and left in solitary confinement for 12 of those days, with no human contact. He stated that 
he was flogged on the soles of his feet, forced to remove his clothing, beaten with an 
electric baton, and electrocuted to the point of unconsciousness during interrogations.  He 
further reported that his interrogator &#8220;told me that if I did not cooperate &#8222;I would kill you 
</p>
<p>like I killed Ebrahim Lotfollahi&#8223;,&#8221; (a Kurdistan University student who allegedly died under 
torture. 
</p>
<p>18. The verdict releasing Saeed Mughanli, Azerbaijani, poet and journalist from a 6 
month sentence was announced on 19 October 2011. The verdict cleared him of the charge 
of cooperation with the United States when attending a journalism training course in 
Azerbaijan. Additional charges of acquiring illegal funds by attending the journalism 
course and &#8220;propagating against the regime&#8221; were brought against him. He was sentenced 
</p>
<p>to 6 months imprisonment. </p>
