<p>A/HRC/8/L.12 
page 2 
 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the report 7/3 of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in 
Myanmar while being concerned that he was not granted a visit to the country since assuming 
office,  
</p>
<p> <i>Being deeply concerned</i> that the urgent calls contained in the above-mentioned resolutions, 
as well as of other United Nations bodies, including the Security Council presidential statements 
of 11 October and 2 May, concerning the human rights situation in Myanmar have not been met 
and further emphasising that, without significant progress towards meeting these calls of the 
international community, the human rights situation in Myanmar will continue to deteriorate, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the non-cooperation of the Myanmar authorities with the Council and 
its Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> its condolences to those who suffered loss as a result of Cyclone Nargis, and 
welcoming the efforts of international, regional and national organizations to bring relief to the 
survivors of this natural disaster and noting the commitment made by the authorities of 
Myanmar, on 25 May, to grant unfettered access to relief workers to the affected areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing also</i> its deep concern over the decision of the Government of Myanmar to 
ignore the calls of the Council to make the country&#8217;s political processes transparent, inclusive, 
free and fair, and to proceed with the constitutional referendum in an atmosphere of intimidation 
and in disregard with international standards of free and fair elections at a time of dire 
humanitarian need,  
</p>
<p> <i>Being concerned</i> about violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in 
the Kayin State and Bago Division resulting from the ongoing military offensive against ethnic 
Karen civilians, 
</p>
<p> <i>Being most concerned</i> by the decision, once again, to extend the house arrest of the 
General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, on 
27 May 2008, and by reports that there are as many as 2,000 other political prisoners, many held 
without charge and in unknown locations, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/L.12 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Being concerned</i> that no efforts have been made to investigate and prosecute the 
perpetrators of the violent crackdown on peaceful mass demonstrations of last September and of 
the ensuing human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, detentions, torture and 
ill-treatment, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of the people of Myanmar;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Myanmar to desist from further politically 
motivated arrests and to release all political prisoners without delay and without conditions; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government to fully implement the commitments it has made to the 
Secretary-General on granting immediate, full and unhindered access by relief workers to all 
persons in need throughout the country, to cooperate fully with all humanitarian organizations, in 
particular in the Irrawaddy Delta, to refrain from sending people back to areas where they cannot 
have access to emergency relief and to ensure that return is voluntary and occurs in safety and 
with dignity; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Myanmar to end all forms of discrimination and 
protect civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and, in particular, to comply with its 
human rights obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns</i> the recruitment of child soldiers into both the Government armed forces, 
contrary to its international obligations, and non-State armed groups and calls for an absolute and 
immediate stop of this appalling activity;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls for</i> a full investigation by an impartial and independent body into all reports of 
human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and 
ill-treatment, forced labour and forced displacement and for bringing those responsible to justice 
in order to end impunity for violations of human rights; </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/L.12 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Deplores</i> that the constitutional referendum was held in an atmosphere of 
intimidation and in disregard for international standards of free and fair elections, and calls on 
the Government of Myanmar to engage in a real process of dialogue and national reconciliation 
with the genuine participation of representatives of all political parties and ethnic groups who 
have been excluded from the political process;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Expresses</i> its strong support for the good-offices mission and commitment of the 
Secretary-General, and with regard to enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and 
ill-treatment, encourages the Government of Myanmar to take early steps to admit his Special 
Representative on Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, to facilitate a genuine and inclusive political 
process, and calls on the Government of Myanmar to ensure full cooperation with the 
Secretary-General, his representative and the Special Rapporteur in that regard; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Myanmar to receive, as soon as possible, the 
Special Rapporteur and to cooperate fully with him to implement the recommendations 
contained in his reports (A/HRC/6/14, A/HRC/8/12, A/HRC/7/18 and A/HRC/7/24) as well as 
Council resolutions S-5/1, 6/33 and 7/31;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to report to the next session of the Council on the 
fulfilment of his mandate, and in particular, on the implementation of its relevant resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this matter.
