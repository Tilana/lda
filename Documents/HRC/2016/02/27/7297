<p>1. In its resolution 9/8, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>report annually to the Council on measures taken to implement resolution 9/8 and on 
</p>
<p>obstacles to its implementation, including recommendations for further improving the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of, harmonizing and reforming the treaty body system. The present report is 
</p>
<p>submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 68/268, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>present to the Assembly, on a biennial basis, a comprehensive report on the status of the 
</p>
<p>treaty body system and the progress achieved by the treaty bodies in achieving greater 
</p>
<p>efficiency and effectiveness in their work, including the number of reports submitted and 
</p>
<p>reviewed by the committees, the visits undertaken and the individual communications 
</p>
<p>received and reviewed, where applicable, the state of the backlog, capacity-building efforts 
</p>
<p>and results achieved, as well as the situation in terms of ratifications, increased reporting 
</p>
<p>and the allocation of meeting time and proposals on measures, including on the basis of 
</p>
<p>information and observations from Member States, to enhance the engagement of all State 
</p>
<p>parties in the dialogue with the treaty bodies. The first report of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>prepared pursuant to resolution 68/268 will be submitted to the Assembly in 2016. 
</p>
