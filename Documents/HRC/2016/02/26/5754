Security Council on 11 October 2007 and 2 May 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in 
Myanmar (A/HRC/10/19), urging the implementation of the recommendations contained therein, 
and welcoming further the agreement by the Government of Myanmar to the visits of the 
Special Rapporteur from 3 to 7 August 2008 and from 14 to 19 February 2009, while 
encouraging the continuation of regular visits and extension of full cooperation of Myanmar

other United Nations bodies concerning the human rights situation in Myanmar have not been 
met and further emphasizing the need for significant progress towards meeting these calls of the 
international community, 
</p>
<p> <i>Being deeply concerned</i> that no effort has been made to investigate and prosecute the

torture and ill-treatment, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> that the country&#8217;s political processes are not transparent, 
inclusive, free or fair, and that the drafting process of the Constitution was neither inclusive nor 
transparent and the constitutional referendum was not free and fair, 
</p>
<p> <i>Being particularly concerned</i> by the continued arbitrary house arrest of the General 
Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and by reports that, 
despite the recent release of 29 political prisoners, 2,100 others still remain imprisoned, held 
without charge, incommunicado or in solitary confinement and hard labour camp conditions and 
denied adequate medical treatment, </p>

<p> 4. C<i>alls for</i> a full, transparent, effective, impartial and independent investigation into all
