Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements.” Statements
included in this report that are not historical facts, that address activities, events or developments
that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including things such as statements
regarding our future financial position, expectations with respect to our liquidity, capital resources
and ability to continue as a going concern, plans for growth of the business, future capital
expenditures, references to future goals or intentions or other such references are forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology, including “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” or similar
words. These statements are made by us based on our experience and our perception of
historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other
considerations we believe are reasonable as and when made. Whether actual results and
developments in the future will conform to our expectations is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, actual outcomes and results
could materially differ from what is expressed, implied or forecast in these statements.
Any differences could be caused by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to
maintain adequate cash flow and to obtain financing necessary to fund our capital expenditures,
meet working capital needs and maintain and grow our operations; our future levels of
indebtedness and compliance with debt covenants; sustained depressed levels of or decline in
coal prices, which depend upon several factors such as the supply of domestic and foreign coal,
the demand for domestic and foreign coal, governmental regulations, price and availability of
alternative fuels for electricity generation and prevailing economic conditions; our ability to
comply with the qualifying income requirement necessary to maintain our status as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes; declines in demand for electricity and coal; current and
future environmental laws and regulations, which could materially increase operating costs or
limit our ability to produce and sell coal; extensive government regulation of mine operations,
especially with respect to mine safety and health, which imposes significant actual and potential
costs; difficulties in obtaining and/or renewing permits necessary for operations; a variety of
operating risks, such as unfavorable geologic conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural
disasters, mining and processing equipment unavailability, failures and unexpected maintenance
problems and accidents, including fire and explosions from methane; poor mining conditions
resulting from the effects of prior mining; the availability and costs of key supplies and
commodities such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives; fluctuations in transportation costs or
disruptions in transportation services, which could increase competition or impair our ability to
supply coal; a shortage of skilled labor, increased labor costs or work stoppages; our ability to
secure or acquire new or replacement high-quality coal reserves that are economically
recoverable; material inaccuracies in our estimates of coal reserves and non-reserve coal
deposits; existing and future laws and regulations regulating the emission of sulfur dioxide and
other compounds, which could affect coal consumers and reduce demand for coal; federal and
state laws restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases; our ability to acquire or failure to
maintain, obtain or renew surety bonds used to secure obligations to reclaim mined property; our
dependence on a few customers and our ability to find and retain customers under favorable
supply contracts; changes in consumption patterns by utilities away from the use of coal, such as
changes resulting from low natural gas prices; changes in governmental regulation of the electric
utility industry; our ability to successfully diversify our operations into other non-coal natural
resources; disruption in supplies of coal produced by contractors operating our mines; defects in
title in properties that we own or losses of any of our leasehold interests; our ability to retain and
attract senior management and other key personnel; material inaccuracy of assumptions
underlying reclamation and mine closure obligations; and weakness in global economic
conditions. Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our projected results are
described in (1) Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, (2) our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, (3) our reports and registration
statements filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and (4) other
announcements we make from time to time. In addition, we may be subject to unforeseen risks
that may have a materially adverse effect on us. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that
the actual events and results will not be materially different from the anticipated results described
in the forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and, other than as required by
law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

RHINO RESOURCE PARTNERS LP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND FOR THE THREE AND SIX
MONTHS ENDED
JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation— The accompanying unaudited
interim financial statements include the accounts of Rhino Resource Partners LP and its
subsidiaries (the “Partnership”). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information—The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information. The condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of
June 30, 2016, condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include all
adjustments that the Partnership considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The condensed
consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2015 was derived from audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”). The Partnership filed its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), which included all information and notes necessary for such presentation.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the year or any future period. These unaudited interim financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in the Partnership’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.
Organization—Rhino Resource Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed on April
19, 2010 to acquire Rhino Energy LLC (the “Predecessor” or the “Operating Company”). The
Operating Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries produce and market coal from surface
and underground mines in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and Utah. The majority of sales are
made to domestic utilities and other coal-related organizations in the United States. In addition to
operating coal properties, the Operating Company manages and leases coal properties and
collects royalties from such management and leasing activities.
On January 21, 2016, a definitive agreement (“Definitive Agreement”) was completed between
Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (“Royal”) and Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford Capital”) whereby
Royal acquired 6,769,112 issued and outstanding common units of the Partnership from Wexford
Capital for $3.5 million. The Definitive Agreement also included the committed acquisition by
Royal within sixty days from the date of the Definitive Agreement of all of the issued and
outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership (the
“General Partner”), as well as 9,455,252 issued and outstanding subordinated units of the
Partnership from Wexford Capital for $1.0 million.
7
On March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of Rhino GP LLC as well as the 9,455,252 issued and outstanding
subordinated units from Wexford Capital. Royal obtained control of, and a majority limited partner
interest, in the Partnership with the completion of this transaction.
On March 21, 2016, the Partnership and Royal entered into a securities purchase agreement (the
“Securities Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Partnership issued 60,000,000 common
units in the Partnership to Royal in a private placement at $0.15 per common unit for an
aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million. Royal paid the Partnership $2.0 million in cash and
delivered a promissory note payable to the Partnership in the amount of $7.0 million. The
promissory note is payable in three installments: (i) $3.0 million on July 31, 2016; (ii) $2.0 million
on or before September 30, 2016 and (iii) $2.0 million on or before December 31, 2016. In the
event the disinterested members of the board of directors of the General Partner determine that
the Partnership does not need the capital that would be provided by either or both installments
set forth in (ii) and (iii) above, in each case, the Partnership has the option to rescind Royal’s
purchase of 13,333,333 common units and the applicable installment will not be payable (each, a
“Rescission Right”). If the Partnership fails to exercise a Rescission Right, in each case, the
Partnership has the option to repurchase 13,333,333 common units at $0.30 per common unit
from Royal (each, a “Repurchase Option”). The Repurchase Options terminate on December 31,
2017. Royal’s obligation to pay any installment of the promissory note is subject to certain
conditions, including that the Operating Company has entered into an agreement to extend the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, to a date no sooner than December 31,
2017. In the event such conditions are not satisfied as of the date each installment is due, Royal
has the right to cancel the remaining unpaid balance of the promissory note in exchange for the
surrender of such number of common units equal to the principal balance of the promissory note
divided by $0.15. On May 13, 2016, Royal paid the Partnership the $3.0 million promissory note
installment that was due July 31, 2016. The payment was made in relation to the fifth amendment
of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement completed on May 13, 2016. See Note 9 for
more information on the fifth amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
On April 18, 2016, the Partnership completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on its common units and
subordinated units. Pursuant to the reverse split, common unitholders received one common unit
for every 10 common units owned on April 18, 2016 and subordinated unitholders received one
subordinated unit for every 10 subordinated units owned on April 18, 2016. Any fractional units
resulting from the reverse unit split were rounded to the nearest whole unit. The reverse unit split
was intended to increase the market price per unit of Rhino’s common units in order to comply
with the New York Stock Exchange’s (“NYSE”) continued listing standards.
8
As previously reported, on December 17, 2015, the Partnership was notified by the NYSE that
the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist its common units from the NYSE
as a result of the Partnership’s failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in
Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market
capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15 million. The NYSE also
suspended the trading of the Partnership’s common units at the close of trading on December 17,
2015. On January 4, 2016, the Partnership filed an appeal with the NYSE to review the
suspension and delisting determination of its common units. The NYSE held a hearing regarding
the Partnership’s appeal on April 20, 2016 and affirmed its prior decision to delist the
Partnership’s common units. On April 27, 2016, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of
removal from listing and registration on Form 25 to delist the Partnership’s common units and
terminate the registration of the Partnership’s common units under Section 12(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The delisting became effective on May 9, 2016. The Partnership’s
common units continued to trade on the OTCQB Marketplace under the ticker symbol “RHNOD”
until May 16, 2016, at which time the OTCQB ticker symbol reverted to “RHNO.”
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL
Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Investments in other entities are accounted for using
the consolidation, equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership, the
Partnership’s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of
the investee and whether the Partnership is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity. Equity investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically
to recognize the Partnership’s proportionate share of the investees’ net income or losses after the
date of investment. Any losses from the Partnership’s equity method investments are absorbed
by the Partnership based upon its proportionate ownership percentage. If losses are incurred that
exceed the Partnership’s investment in the equity method entity, then the Partnership must
continue to record its proportionate share of losses in excess of its investment. Investments are
written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than
temporary has occurred.
In May 2008, the Operating Company entered into a joint venture, Rhino Eastern LLC (“Rhino
Eastern”), with an affiliate of Patriot Coal Corporation (“Patriot”) to acquire the Eagle mining
complex located in Central Appalachia. The Partnership accounted for the investment in the joint
venture and its results of operations under the equity method. In January 2015, the Partnership
completed a Membership Transfer Agreement (the “Transfer Agreement”) with an affiliate of
Patriot that terminated the Rhino Eastern joint venture. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement,
Patriot sold and assigned its 49% membership interest in the Rhino Eastern joint venture to the
Partnership and, in consideration of this transfer, Patriot received certain fixed assets, leased
equipment and coal reserves associated with the mining area previously operated by the Rhino
Eastern joint venture. Patriot also assumed substantially all of the active workforce related to the
Eagle mining area that was previously employed by the Rhino Eastern joint venture. The
Partnership retained approximately 34 million tons of coal reserves that are not related to the
Eagle mining area as well as a prepaid advanced royalty balance. As part of the closing of the
Transfer Agreement, the Partnership and Patriot agreed to a dissolution payment based upon a
final working capital adjustment calculation as defined in the Transfer Agreement. Refer to Note
17 for information on the financial statement impact of the Rhino Eastern dissolution completed in
January 2015.

In December 2012, the Partnership made an initial investment of approximately $2.0 million in a
new joint venture, Muskie Proppant LLC (“Muskie”), with affiliates of Wexford Capital. Muskie
was formed to provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica Shale region and other
oil and natural gas basins in the United States. The Partnership accounted for the investment in
the joint venture and results of operations under the equity method. In November 2014, the
Partnership contributed its interest in Muskie to Mammoth Energy Partners LP (“Mammoth”),
which is discussed below.
In November 2014, the Partnership contributed its investment interest in Muskie to Mammoth in
return for a limited partner interest in Mammoth. Mammoth was formed to own various companies
that provide services to companies, which engage in the exploration and development of North
American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Mammoth’s companies provide
services that include completion and production services, contract land and directional drilling
services and remote accommodation services. The non-cash transaction was a contribution of
the Partnership’s investment interest in the Muskie entity for an investment interest in Mammoth.
Thus, the Partnership determined that the non-cash exchange of the Partnership’s ownership
interest in Muskie did not result in any gain or loss. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership has recorded its investment in Mammoth of $1.9 million as a long-term asset, which
the Partnership records as a cost method investment based upon its ownership percentage. The
Partnership has included its investment in Mammoth and its prior investment in Muskie in its
Other category for segment reporting purposes.
In September 2014, the Partnership made an initial investment of $5.0 million in a new joint
venture, Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC (“Sturgeon”), with affiliates of Wexford Capital and Gulfport
Energy (“Gulfport”), a publicly traded company. Sturgeon subsequently acquired 100% of the
outstanding equity interests of certain limited liability companies located in Wisconsin that
provide frac sand for oil and natural gas drillers in the United States. The Partnership accounts
for the investment in the joint venture and results of operations under the equity method. The
Partnership recorded its proportionate share of the operating (loss) for Sturgeon for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 of approximately ($26,000) and ($0.1) million, respectively. The
Partnership recorded its proportionate share of the operating income for Sturgeon for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015 of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The Partnership has included the operating activities of Sturgeon in its Other category for
segment reporting purposes.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue
and establishes a common revenue standard for U.S. financial reporting purposes. The guidance
in ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer
goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those
contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease
contracts). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific
accounting guidance. Additionally, ASU 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in
ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition—Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In
addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of
nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (for example, assets within the
scope of ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of
ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on
recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in ASU 2014-09. In July
2015, the FASB approved to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Accordingly,
ASU 2014-09 will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The Partnership is evaluating the requirements
of this new accounting guidance.
10
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, “Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual
Items”. ASC 225-20, Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity
separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. ASU 2015-01
eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in ASU 2015-01 are effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A
reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the
amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early
adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year
of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities.
The adoption of ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the
Partnership’s financial statements.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation”. ASU 2015-02 affects
reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal
entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model.
Specifically, the amendments of ASU 2015-02: a) modify the evaluation of whether limited
partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest
entities, b) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited
partnership, c) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs,
particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships and d) provide a
scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities
that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to
those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim
period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this Update using a modified
retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively.
The adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the
Partnership’s financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)-
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Prior to
ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs have been presented in the balance sheet as a deferred
charge, or asset. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not
affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, ASU 2015-03 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2015-03 is permitted for financial
statements that have not been previously issued. In addition, ASU 2015-03 requires entities to
apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual
period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new
guidance. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on
the Partnership’s financial statements.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Utica Shale Oil and Natural Gas Assets
Beginning in 2011, the Partnership and an affiliate of Wexford Capital participated with Gulfport
to acquire interests in a portfolio of oil and natural gas leases in the Utica Shale, which consisted
of a 5% interest in a total of approximately 152,300 gross acres, or approximately 7,615 net
acres. In March 2014, the Partnership completed a purchase and sale agreement with Gulfport to
sell the Partnership’s oil and natural gas properties in the Utica Shale region. In addition, in
January 2014, the Partnership received approximately $8.4 million of net proceeds from the sale
by Blackhawk Midstream LLC (“Blackhawk”) of its equity interest in two entities, Ohio Gathering
Company, LLC and Ohio Condensate Company, LLC, to Summit Midstream Partners, LLC. As
part of the joint operating agreement for the Utica Shale investment discussed above, the
Partnership had the right to approximately 5% of the proceeds of the sale by Blackhawk. In
February 2015, the Partnership received approximately $0.7 million in additional proceeds from
the sale by Blackhawk that had been held in escrow. For the six months ended June 30, 2015,
the Partnership recorded the $0.7 million in Income from discontinued operations in the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The
gain from the Blackhawk transaction is included in the (Gain) on sale/disposal of assets—net line
in the operating activities section of the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows. The proceeds from the Blackhawk transaction are included in the
Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment line in the investing activities section of
the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Partnership’s Elk Horn coal leasing company is located in eastern Kentucky and provides
the Partnership with coal royalty revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn and leased to
third party operators. The ongoing weakness in the central Appalachia steam coal markets has
adversely affected the price and demand for steam coal produced by operators that mine coal on
the Elk Horn properties. Thus, Elk Horn’s royalty revenues have also declined as the operators
produce less coal and prices for steam are depressed. During the second quarter of 2016, the
Partnership received an inquiry from a third party interested in purchasing Elk Horn. Based upon
the price offered by the third party and the continued deterioration of the central Appalachia
steam coal markets that has adversely affected Elk Horn’s financial results, the Partnership
decided to evaluate the Elk Horn assets for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016. The
Partnership’s impairment analysis determined that a potential impairment existed since the
carrying amount of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group exceeded the cash flows that would be
generated from the purchase price offered from the third party. Based on a market approach used
to estimate the fair value of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group, the Partnership recorded total
asset impairment charges of approximately $118.7 million related to Coal properties for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, which is recorded on the Loss on asset impairments line of
the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
6. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
ASC Topic 350 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible
assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but instead tested for
impairment at least annually.

Debt issuance costs were included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of
December 31, 2015 since the Partnership classified its credit facility balance as a current liability
prior to the fifth amendment to the credit facility completed in May 2016 and discussed further
below (see Note 4 for Prepaid expenses and other current assets). Debt issuance costs were
$13.1 million and $11.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs were $10.5 million and $9.4 million as of June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
In April 2015, the Partnership entered into a third amendment of its amended and restated senior
secured credit facility that reduced the borrowing commitment to $100 million. As part of
executing the third amendment to the amended and restated senior secured credit facility, the
Operating Company paid a fee of approximately $2.1 million to the lenders in April 2015, which
was recorded as an addition to Debt issuance costs. The Partnership wrote-off approximately
$0.2 million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the third amendment reduced
the borrowing commitment under the amended and restated senior secured credit facility.
In March 2016, the Partnership entered into a fourth amendment of its amended and restated
senior secured credit facility that reduced the borrowing commitment to $80 million. As part of
executing the fourth amendment to the amended and restated senior secured credit facility, the
Operating Company paid a fee of approximately $0.4 million to the lenders in March 2016, which
was recorded as an addition to Debt issuance costs. The Partnership wrote-off approximately
$0.2 million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the fourth amendment
reduced the borrowing commitment under the amended and restated senior secured credit
facility.
In May 2016, the Partnership entered into a fifth amendment of its amended and restated senior
secured credit facility that reduced the borrowing commitment to $75 million. As part of executing
the fifth amendment to the amended and restated senior secured credit facility, the Operating
Company paid a fee of approximately $1.2 million to the lenders in May 2016, which was
recorded as an addition to Debt issuance costs. The Partnership wrote-off approximately $0.1
million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the fifth amendment reduced the
borrowing commitment under the amended and restated senior secured credit facility. See Note 9
for further information on the amendments to the amended and restated senior secured credit
facility.

The non-current receivable balance of $23.9 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
consisted of the amount due from the Partnership’s workers’ compensation insurance providers
for potential claims against the Partnership that are the primary responsibility of the Partnership,
which are covered under the Partnership’s insurance policies. The $23.9 million is also included
in the Partnership’s accrued workers’ compensation benefits liability balance, which is included
in the non-current liabilities section of the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of financial position. The Partnership presents this amount on a gross asset and
liability basis since a right of setoff does not exist per the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 210,
Balance Sheet. This presentation has no impact on the Partnership’s results of operations or
cash flows.
8. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015

Partnership. The amount accrued for litigation claims is also due from the Partnership’s
insurance providers and is included in Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
accounts on the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial
position. The Partnership presents this amount on a gross asset and liability basis, as a right of
setoff does not exist per the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 210, Balance Sheet. This

Senior Secured Credit Facility with PNC Bank, N.A.—On July 29, 2011, the Operating
Company and the Partnership, as a guarantor, executed an amended and restated senior
secured credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a group of lenders,
which are parties thereto. The maximum availability under the amended and restated credit
facility was $300.0 million, with a one-time option to increase the availability by an amount not to
exceed $50.0 million. Of the $300.0 million, $75.0 million was available for letters of credit. As
described below, in April 2015, March 2016 and May 2016, the amended and restated credit
facility was amended and the borrowing commitment under the facility was reduced to $75
million, with the amount available for letters of credit reduced to $30 million. Borrowings under
the facility bear interest, which per the March 2016 amendment described further below, is based
upon the current PRIME rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. As part of the agreement, the
Operating Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the borrowing
availability. Borrowings on the amended and restated senior secured credit facility are
collateralized by all of the unsecured assets of the Partnership. The amended and restated
senior secured credit facility requires the Partnership to maintain certain minimum financial ratios
and contains certain restrictive provisions, including among others, restrictions on making loans,
investments and advances, incurring additional indebtedness, guaranteeing indebtedness,
creating liens and selling or assigning stock. The Partnership was in compliance with all
covenants contained in the amended and restated senior secured credit facility as of and for the
twelve-month period ended June 30, 2016. Per the May 2016 amendment described further
below, the amended and restated senior secured credit facility is set to expire on July 31, 2017,
with the possibility to extend the facility to December 31, 2017 if certain conditions are met as
described below.
In April 2015, the Partnership entered into a third amendment of its amended and restated senior
secured credit facility. The third amendment reduced the borrowing commitment under the credit
facility to a maximum of $100 million and reduced the amount available for letters of credit to $50
million. The third amendment also provides that the disposition of any assets by the Partnership
consisting of net cash proceeds up to an aggregate $35 million shall reduce the total commitment
under the facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis by up to a total of $10 million, and any dispositions of
assets in excess of $35 million in the aggregate shall reduce the commitment under the facility on
a dollar-for-dollar basis. The third amendment limits the Partnership’s quarterly distributions to a
maximum of $0.035 per unit unless (i) the pro forma leverage ratio of the Partnership,
immediately prior to and after giving effect to such distribution, is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0
and (ii) the amount of borrowings available under the credit facility, immediately prior to and after
giving effect to such distribution, is at least $20 million. In addition, the third amendment removed
the interest coverage ratio covenant and replaced it with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio,
which consists of the ratio of consolidated EBITDA minus maintenance capital expenditures to
fixed charges. Fixed charges are defined in the third amendment to include the sum of cash
interest expense, scheduled principal installments on indebtedness (as adjusted for
prepayments), dividends and distributions. Commencing with the quarter ended September 30,
2015, the fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing four quarters must be a minimum of 1.1 to
1.0. The third amendment also limits any investments made by the Partnership, including
investments in hydrocarbons, to $10 million provided that the leverage ratio is less than or equal
to 3.0 to 1.0 and the borrowers’ available liquidity is at least $20 million. The third amendment
does not permit the Partnership to issue any new equity of the Partnership unless the proceeds of
such equity issuance are used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the facility. Issuances
of equity under the Partnership’s long-term incentive plan are excluded from this requirement.
The third amendment limits the amount of the Partnership’s capital expenditures to $20.0 million
for fiscal year 2015 and limited capital expenditures to $27.5 million for each fiscal year after
2015. However, to the extent that capital expenditures for any fiscal year are less than indicated
above, the Partnership may increase the following year’s capital expenditures by the lesser of
such unused amount or $5.0 million. As part of executing the third amendment to the amended
and restated senior secured credit facility, the Operating Company paid a fee of approximately
$2.1 million to the lenders in April 2015, which was recorded in Debt issuance costs in Other
non-current assets on the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
financial position. In addition, the Partnership recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $0.2
million to write-off a portion of its unamortized debt issuance costs since the third amendment
reduced the borrowing commitment under the amended and restated senior secured credit
facility, which was recorded in Interest expense on the Partnership’s unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
17
In March 2016, the Partnership entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) of its
amended and restated senior secured credit facility. The Fourth Amendment amended the
definition of change of control in the amended and restated credit agreement to permit Royal to
purchase the membership interests of the General Partner and set the expiration of the facility to
July 29, 2016. The Fourth Amendment reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility to
a maximum of $80 million and reduced the amount available for letters of credit to $30 million.
The Fourth Amendment eliminated the option to borrow funds utilizing the LIBOR rate plus an
applicable margin and established the borrowing rate for all borrowings under the facility to be
based upon the current PRIME rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The Fourth Amendment
eliminated the capability to make Swing Loans under the facility and eliminated the ability of the
Partnership to pay distributions to its common or subordinated unitholders. The Fourth
Amendment altered the maximum leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of the most recent
month, on a trailing twelve-month basis, to 6.75 to 1.00. The leverage ratio shall be reduced by
0.50 to 1.00 for every $10 million of net cash proceeds, in the aggregate, received by the
Partnership after the date of the Fourth Amendment from a liquidity event; provided, however, that
in no event shall the maximum permitted leverage ratio be reduced below 3.00 to 1.00. A liquidity
event is defined in the Fourth Amendment as the issuance of any equity by the Partnership on or
after the Fourth Amendment effective date (other than the Royal equity contribution discussed
above), or the disposition of any assets by the Partnership. The Fourth Amendment requires the
Partnership to maintain minimum liquidity of $5 million and minimum EBITDA (as defined in the
credit agreement), calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve month
basis, of $8 million. The Fourth Amendment limits the amount of the Partnership’s capital
expenditures to $15 million, calculated as of end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-
month basis. The Fourth Amendment requires the Partnership to provide monthly financial
statements and a weekly rolling thirteen-week cash flow forecast to the administrative agent.
On May 13, 2016, the Partnership entered into a fifth amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) of its
amended and restated senior secured credit facility that extends the term of the senior secured
credit facility to July 31, 2017. Per the Fifth Amendment, the credit facility will be automatically
extended to December 31, 2017 if revolving credit commitments are reduced to $55 million or
less on or before July 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment immediately reduces the revolving credit
commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $75 million and maintains the amount
available for letters of credit at $30 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the revolving
credit commitments over time on a dollar-for-dollar basis in amounts equal to each of the
following: (i) the face amount of any letter of credit that expires or whose face amount is reduced
by any such dollar amount, (ii) the net proceeds received from any asset sales, (iii) the Royal
scheduled capital contributions (as outlined below), (iv) the net proceeds from the issuance of
any equity by the Partnership up to $20.0 million (other than equity issued in exchange for any
Royal contribution as outlined in the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Royal scheduled
capital contributions to the Partnership as outlined below), and (v) the proceeds from the
incurrence of any subordinated debt. The first $11 million of proceeds received from any equity
issued by the Partnership described in clause (iv) above shall also satisfy the Royal scheduled
capital contributions as outlined below. The Fifth Amendment requires Royal to contribute $2
million each quarter beginning September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2017 and $1 million
on December 1, 2017, for a total of $11 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the
revolving credit commitments as follows:

The Fifth Amendment requires that on or before March 31, 2017, the Partnership shall have
solicited bids for the potential sale of certain non-core assets, satisfactory to the administrative
agent, and provided the administrative agent, and any other lender upon its request, with a
description of the solicitation process, interested parties and any potential bids. The Fifth
Amendment limits any payments by the Partnership to the General Partner to: (i) the usual and
customary payroll and benefits of the Partnership’s management team so long as the
Partnership’s management team remains employees of the General Partner, (2) the usual and
customary board fees of the General Partner, and (3) the usual and customary general and
administrative costs and expenses of the General Partner incurred in connection with the
operation of its business in an amount not to exceed $0.3 million per fiscal year. The Fifth
Amendment limits asset sales to a maximum of $5 million unless the Partnership receives
consent from the lenders. The Fifth Amendment alters the maximum leverage ratio, calculated as
of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis, as follows:

proceeds received by the Partnership from: (i) the issuance of equity by the Partnership
(excluding any Royal capital contributions) and/or (ii) the proceeds received from the sale of
assets, provided that the leverage ratio shall not be reduced below 3.50 to 1.00. The Fifth
Amendment removes the $5.0 million minimum liquidity requirement and requires the
Partnership to have any deposit, securities or investment accounts with a member of the lending
group.
At June 30, 2016, the Operating Company had borrowings outstanding (excluding letters of
credit) of $37.8 million at a variable interest rate of PRIME plus 3.50% (7.00% at June 30, 2016).
In addition, the Operating Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $27.8
million at a fixed interest rate of 5.00% at June 30, 2016. Based upon a maximum borrowing
capacity of 7.25 times a trailing twelve-month EBITDA calculation (as defined in the credit
agreement), the Operating Company had available borrowing capacity of approximately $6.7
million at June 30, 2016.

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
In conjunction with the acquisition of the coal operations of American Electric Power on April 16,
2004, the Operating Company acquired a postretirement benefit plan that provided healthcare to
eligible employees at its Hopedale operations. The Partnership has no other postretirement
plans.
On December 10, 2015, the Partnership notified the employees at its Hopedale operations that
healthcare benefits from the postretirement benefit plan would cease on January 31, 2016. The
negative plan amendment that arose on December 10, 2015 resulted in an approximate $6.5
million prior service cost benefit. The Partnership amortized the prior service cost benefit over the
remaining term of the benefits provided through January 31, 2016. For the six months ended
June 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized a benefit of approximately $3.9 million from the plan
amendment in the Cost of operations line of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income.

the amortization of actuarial gain included in the table above, are included in Cost of operations
in the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income.
401(k) Plans—The Operating Company and certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution
savings plans for all employees. Under one defined contribution savings plan, the Operating
Company matches voluntary contributions of participants up to a maximum contribution based
upon a percentage of a participant’s salary with an additional matching contribution possible at
the Operating Company’s discretion. The expense under these plans for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is included in Cost of operations and Selling, general
and administrative expense in the Partnership’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income and was as follows:

12. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
In October 2010, the General Partner established the Rhino Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”
or “LTIP”). The Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Partnership by providing to
employees, consultants and directors of the General Partner, the Partnership or affiliates of either
incentive compensation awards to encourage superior performance. The LTIP provides for
grants of restricted units, unit options, unit appreciation rights, phantom units, unit awards, and
other unit-based awards.
As of June 30, 2016, the General Partner had granted phantom units to certain employees and
restricted units and unit awards to its directors. These grants consisted of annual restricted unit
awards to directors and phantom unit awards with tandem distribution equivalent rights (“DERs”)
granted in the first quarters from 2012 through 2015 to certain employees in connection with the
prior year’s performance. The DERs consist of rights to accrue quarterly cash distributions in an
amount equal to the cash distribution the Partnership makes to unitholders during the vesting
period. These awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and any accrued
distributions will be forfeited if the related awards fail to vest according to the relevant service
based vesting conditions.
22
The Partnership accounts for its unit-based awards as liabilities with applicable mark-to-market
adjustments at each reporting period because the Compensation Committee of the board of
directors of the General Partner has historically elected to pay some of the awards in cash in lieu
of issuing common units.
As discussed in Note 1, on March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued
and outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP LLC as well as 9,455,252 issued and
outstanding subordinated units from Wexford Capital. Royal obtained control of, and a majority
limited partner interest, in the Partnership with the completion of this transaction, which
constituted a change in control of the Partnership. The language in the Partnership’s phantom
unit and restricted unit grant agreements states that all outstanding, unvested units will become
immediately vested upon a change in control. The Partnership recognized approximately
$10,000 of expense from the vesting of these units as a result of the change in control.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the General Partner granted fully vested common
units to its board of directors as well as certain members of management. The Partnership
recognized approximately $0.6 million of expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 in
relation to the common units granted.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Coal Sales Contracts and Contingencies—As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had
commitments under sales contracts to deliver annually scheduled base quantities of coal as
follows:

Some of the contracts have sales price adjustment provisions, subject to certain limitations and
adjustments, based on a variety of factors and indices.
Leases—The Partnership leases various mining, transportation and other equipment under
operating leases. The Partnership also leases coal reserves under agreements that call for
royalties to be paid as the coal is mined. Lease and royalty expense for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are included in Cost of operations in the Partnership’s unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and was as
follows:

Joint Ventures—The Partnership may contribute additional capital to the Timber Wolf joint
venture that was formed in the first quarter of 2012. The Partnership did not make any capital
contributions to the Timber Wolf joint venture during the six months ended June 30, 2016 or
2015.
The Partnership may contribute additional capital to the Sturgeon joint venture that was formed in
the third quarter of 2014. The Partnership made an initial capital contribution of $5.0 million
during the third quarter ended September 30, 2014 based upon its proportionate ownership
interest. The Partnership did not make any capital contributions to the Sturgeon joint venture
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
14. EARNINGS PER UNIT (“EPU”)
On April 18, 2016, the Partnership completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on its common units and
subordinated units. The following tables present a reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted EPU calculations for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, which include the retrospective application of the 1-for-10 reverse unit split:

Diluted EPU gives effect to all dilutive potential common units outstanding during the period
using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPU excludes all dilutive potential units calculated
under the treasury stock method if their effect is anti-dilutive. Since the Partnership incurred total
net losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, all potential dilutive units
were excluded from the diluted EPU calculation for these periods because when an entity incurs
a net loss in a period, potential dilutive units shall not be included in the computation of diluted
EPU since their effect will always be anti-dilutive.

16. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are
considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the immediate short-
term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Partnership’s amended and
restated senior secured credit facility was based upon a Level 2 measurement utilizing a market
approach, which incorporated market-based interest rate information with credit risks similar to
the Partnership. The fair value of the Partnership’s amended and restated senior secured credit
facility approximates the carrying value at June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had a nonrecurring fair value measurement related to its Elk
Horn asset impairment as described in Note 5. The nonrecurring fair value measurement for the
Elk Horn asset impairment described in Note 5 as of June 30, 2016 was a Level 2 measurement.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership had nonrecurring fair value
measurements related to its asset impairment actions. The nonrecurring fair value measurements
for the asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were Level 3 measurements.
17. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION
The unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 excludes approximately $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of property
additions, which are recorded in accounts payable.
28
In January 2015, the Partnership dissolved the Rhino Eastern joint venture with Patriot. As part of
the dissolution, the Partnership retained coal reserves, a prepaid advanced royalty balance and
other assets and liabilities. In addition, the Partnership and Patriot agreed to a dissolution
payment as part of the dissolution based upon a final working capital adjustment calculation,
which is a liability of the Partnership. The Partnership recorded the dissolution of the joint venture
by removing the investment in the Rhino Eastern unconsolidated subsidiary and recording the
specific assets and liabilities retained in the dissolution. The dissolution of the Rhino Eastern
joint venture completed in January 2015 had no impact on the Partnership’s unconsolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June
30, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 excludes the removal of the investment in the unconsolidated subsidiary
and the recognition of the retained assets and liabilities, which are detailed in the table below.

18. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Partnership produces and markets coal from surface and underground mines in Kentucky,
West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. The Partnership sells primarily to electric utilities in the United
States. The Partnership also leases coal reserves to third parties in exchange for royalty
revenues. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership had four reportable
segments: Central Appalachia (comprised of both surface and underground mines located in
Eastern Kentucky and Southern West Virginia, along with the Elk Horn coal leasing operations),
Northern Appalachia (comprised of both surface and underground mines located in Ohio), Rhino
Western (comprised of an underground mine in Utah) and Illinois Basin (comprised of an
underground mine in western Kentucky).
The Partnership’s Other category is comprised of the Partnership’s ancillary businesses and its
remaining oil and natural gas activities. The Partnership has not provided disclosure of total
expenditures by segment for long-lived assets, as the Partnership does not maintain discrete
financial information concerning segment expenditures for long lived-assets, and accordingly
such information is not provided to the Partnership’s chief operating decision maker. The
information provided in the following tables represents the primary measures used to assess
segment performance by the Partnership’s chief operating decision maker.

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On July 7, 2016, the Partnership executed an agreement with the third party that held the
approximately $2.8 million of other notes payable, as detailed in Note 9, to settle the debt for $1.1
million of cash consideration. The Partnership paid the $1.1 million in July 2016 and will
recognize an approximate $1.7 million gain from the extinguishment of this debt.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership continued the suspension of the cash
distribution for its common units, which was initially suspended for the quarter ended June 30,
2015. No distribution will be paid for common or subordinated units for the quarter ended June
30, 2016. The Partnership’s common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution
level is below the minimum level of $0.445 per unit, as outlined in the Partnership’s limited
partnership agreement. The Partnership initially lowered its quarterly common unit distribution
below the minimum level of $0.445 per unit with the quarter ended September 30, 2014. Thus,
the Partnership’s distributions for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2014 through the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 were below the minimum level and the current amount of
accumulated arrearages as of June 30, 2016 related to the common unit distribution was
approximately $114.2 million.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “our,” “us” or
similar terms refer to Rhino Resource Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to our
“general partner” refer to Rhino GP LLC, the general partner of Rhino Resource Partners LP. The
following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations should be read
in conjunction with the historical audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” included in such Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, this discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from statements we make. Please read the
section “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements”. In addition, factors that could
cause actual results to differ include those risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A.
“Risk Factors” also included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 and in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Overview
We are a diversified energy limited partnership formed in Delaware that is focused on coal and
energy related assets and activities, including energy infrastructure investments. We produce,
process and sell high quality coal of various steam and metallurgical grades. We market our
steam coal primarily to electric utility companies as fuel for their steam powered generators.
Customers for our metallurgical coal are primarily steel and coke producers who use our coal to
produce coke, which is used as a raw material in the steel manufacturing process. In addition to
operating coal properties, we manage and lease coal properties and collect royalties from those
management and leasing activities. In addition, we have expanded our business to include
infrastructure support services, as well as other joint venture investments to provide for the
transportation of hydrocarbons and drilling support services in the Utica Shale region. We have
also invested in joint ventures that provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica
Shale region and other oil and natural gas basins in the United States.
We have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia,
Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31,
2015, we controlled an estimated 363.6 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves,
consisting of an estimated 310.1 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 53.5 million tons of
metallurgical coal. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we controlled an estimated 436.8
million tons of non-reserve coal deposits.
We operate underground and surface mines located in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Utah.
The number of mines that we operate may vary from time to time depending on a number of
factors, including the demand for and price of coal, depletion of economically recoverable
reserves and availability of experienced labor.
31
Our principal business strategy is to safely, efficiently and profitably produce, sell and lease both
steam and metallurgical coal from our diverse asset base in order to resume, and, over time,
increase our quarterly cash distributions. In addition, we intend to continue to expand and
potentially diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of
long-term, cash generating natural resource assets. We believe that such assets will allow us to
grow our cash available for distribution and enhance stability of our cash flow.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we generated revenues of approximately
$42.8 million and $83.2 million, respectively, and we generated net losses of approximately
$121.9 million and $123.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we
produced and sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal, of which approximately 96% were sold
pursuant to supply contracts. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we produced and sold
approximately 1.6 million tons of coal, of which approximately 95% were sold pursuant to supply
contracts.
Current Liquidity and Outlook
As of June 30, 2016, our available liquidity was $6.7 million, which consisted of the amount
available under our amended and restated credit agreement dated July 29, 2011 (as amended
and restated, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). On May 13, 2016, we entered into
a fifth amendment of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”),
which extends the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to July 31, 2017 (see “—
Liquidity and Capital Resources—Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” for further details of
the Fifth Amendment).
Prior to our entry into the Fifth Amendment, we were unable to demonstrate that we had sufficient
liquidity to operate our business over the subsequent twelve months and thus, substantial doubt
was raised about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, our independent
registered public accounting firm included an emphasis paragraph with respect to our ability to
continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in our
auditors’ report may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we
do business, including our customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to raise
additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed and conduct normal operations. As a
result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially
adversely affected.
Given the continued weak demand and low prices for met and steam coal, we may not be able to
continue to give the required representations or meet all of the covenants and restrictions
included in our credit agreement. If we violate any of the covenants or restrictions in our
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the maximum leverage ratio and minimum
EBITDA requirements, some or all of our indebtedness may become immediately due and
payable, and our lenders’ commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. If we are
unable to give a required representation or we violate a covenant or restriction, then we will need
a waiver from our lenders in order to continue to borrow under our Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. Although we believe our lenders loans are well secured under the terms of our
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, there is no assurance that the lenders would agree to
any such waiver. Failure to obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
could cause us to further curtail our operations and reduce our spending and to alter our
business plan. We may also be required to consider other options, such as selling additional
assets or merger opportunities, and depending on the urgency of our liquidity constraints, we
may be required to pursue such an option at an inopportune time. If we are not able to fund our
liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, we may not be able to continue as a going
concern. For more information about our liquidity and our credit facility, please read “—Liquidity
and Capital Resources.”
32
We continue to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on our common
and subordinated units and cost and productivity improvements to enhance and preserve our
liquidity so that we can fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures and
meet our financial commitments and debt service obligations.
Recent Developments
Asset Impairment
Our Elk Horn coal leasing company is located in eastern Kentucky and provides us with coal
royalty revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn and leased to third party operators. The
ongoing weakness in the central Appalachia steam coal markets has adversely affected the price
and demand for steam coal produced by operators that mine coal on the Elk Horn properties.
Thus, Elk Horn’s royalty revenues have also declined as the operators produce less coal and
prices for steam are depressed. During the second quarter of 2016, we received an inquiry from a
third party interested in purchasing Elk Horn. Based upon the price offered by the third party and
the continued deterioration of the central Appalachia steam coal markets that has adversely
affected Elk Horn’s financial results, we decided to evaluate the Elk Horn assets for potential
impairment as of June 30, 2016. Our impairment analysis determined that a potential impairment
existed since the carrying amount of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group exceeded the cash
flows that would be generated from the purchase price offered from the third party. Based on a
market approach used to estimate the fair value of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group, we
recorded total asset impairment charges of approximately $118.7 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016.
Sale of our General Partner by Wexford Capital LP
On January 21, 2016, a definitive agreement was completed between Royal Energy Resources,
Inc. (“Royal”) and Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”) where Royal acquired 6,769,112 of our issued
and outstanding common units from Wexford. The definitive agreement also included the
committed acquisition by Royal within 60 days from the date of the definitive agreement, or March
21, 2016, of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP LLC, our
general partner, as well as 9,455,252 of our issued and outstanding subordinated units from
Wexford. Royal is a publicly traded company listed on the OTC market (OTCQB: ROYE) and is
focused on the acquisition of coal, natural gas and renewable energy assets that are profitable at
current distressed prices.
33
On March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of our general partner as well as the 9,455,252 issued and outstanding
subordinated units from Wexford. Royal obtained control of, and a majority limited partner
interest, in us with the completion of this transaction. Immediately subsequent to the
consummation of the transaction, the following members of the board of directors of our general
partner tendered their resignations effective immediately: Mark Zand, Philip Braunstein, Ken
Rubin, Arthur Amron, Douglas Lambert and Mark Plaumann. As the owner of our general partner,
Royal has the right to appoint the members of the board of directors of our general partner and so
appointed the following individuals as new directors to fill the vacancies resulting from the
resignations: William Tuorto, Ronald Phillips, Michael Thompson, Ian Ganzer, Douglas Holsted,
Brian Hughs and David Hanig.
Private Placement of Common Units to Royal
On March 21, 2016, we and Royal entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities
Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we issued 60,000,000 of our common units to Royal in
a private placement at $0.15 per common unit for an aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million.
Royal paid us $2.0 million in cash and delivered a promissory note payable to us in the amount
of $7.0 million. The promissory note is payable in three installments: (i) $3.0 million on July 31,
2016; (ii) $2.0 million on or before September 30, 2016 and (iii) $2.0 million on or before
December 31, 2016. In the event the disinterested members of the board of directors of our
general partner determine that we do not need the capital that would be provided by either or
both installments set forth in (ii) and (iii) above, in each case, we have the option to rescind
Royal’s purchase of 13,333,333 common units and the applicable installment will not be payable
(each, a “Rescission Right”). If we fail to exercise a Rescission Right, in each case, we have the
option to repurchase 13,333,333 of our common units at $0.30 per common unit from Royal
(each, a “Repurchase Option”). The Repurchase Options terminate on December 31, 2017.
Royal’s obligation to pay any installment of the promissory note is subject to certain conditions,
including that we have entered into an agreement to extend the amended and restated credit
agreement to a date no sooner than December 31, 2017. In the event such conditions are not
satisfied as of the date each installment is due, Royal has the right to cancel the remaining
unpaid balance of the promissory note in exchange for the surrender of such number of common
units equal to the principal balance of the promissory note divided by $0.15. On May 13, 2016,
Royal paid us the $3.0 million promissory note installment that was due July 31, 2016. The
payment was made in relation to the fifth amendment of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement completed on May 13, 2016, which is discussed further below.
Fourth and Fifth Amendments to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On March 17, 2016, our operating company, as borrower, and we and certain of our subsidiaries,
as guarantors, entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) of our Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of change of control
in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to permit Royal to purchase the membership
interests of our general partner.
34
On May 13, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, which extended the term to July 31, 2017 (see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” for further details of the Fourth and Fifth
Amendments).
Suspension and Delisting of Common Units from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
As previously disclosed, on December 17, 2015, the NYSE notified us that that the NYSE had
determined to commence proceedings to delist our common units from the NYSE as a result of
our failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive
30 trading-day period of at least $15 million for our common units. The NYSE also suspended
the trading of our common units at the close of trading on December 17, 2015.
On January 4, 2016, we filed an appeal with the NYSE to review the suspension and delisting
determination of our common units. The NYSE held a hearing regarding our appeal on April 20,
2016 and affirmed its prior decision to delist our common units.
On April 27, 2016, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of removal from listing and
registration on Form 25 to delist our common units and terminate the registration of our common
units under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The delisting became effective
on May 9, 2016. The Partnership’s common units continued to trade on the OTCQB Marketplace
under the ticker symbol “RHNOD” until May 16, 2016, at which time the OTCQB ticker symbol
reverted to “RHNO.”
We are exploring the possibility of listing our common units on the NASDAQ Stock Market
(“NASDAQ”), pending our capability to meet the NASDAQ initial listing standards.
Reverse Unit Split
On April 18, 2016, we completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on our common units and subordinated
units. Pursuant to the reverse split, common unitholders received one common unit for every 10
common units owned on April 18, 2016 and subordinated unitholders received one subordinated
unit for every 10 subordinated units owned on April 18, 2016. Any fractional units resulting from
the reverse unit split were rounded to the nearest whole unit. The reverse unit split was intended
to increase the market price per unit of our common units in order to comply with the NYSE’s
continued listing standards.
Distribution Suspension
Beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and continuing through the current quarter
ended June 30, 2016, we have suspended the cash distribution for our common units. For the
quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, we announced cash distributions
of $0.05 per common unit, or $0.20 per unit on an annualized basis, and for the quarter ended
March 31, 2015, we announced cash distributions of $0.02 per common unit, or $0.08 per unit on
an annualized basis. Each of these quarters’ distribution levels were lower than the historical
quarters’ distribution amounts of $0.445 per common unit, or $1.78 per unit on an annualized
basis. The distribution suspension and prior reductions were the result of prolonged weakness in
the coal markets, which has continued to adversely affect our cash flow.
35
Our common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution level is below the
minimum level of $0.445 per unit, as outlined in our limited partnership agreement. Since our
distributions for the quarters ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014 and March 31,
2015 were below the minimum level and we suspended the distribution for the quarters ended
June 30, 2015 through June 30, 2016, we have accumulated arrearages at June 30, 2016 related
to the common unit distribution of approximately $114.2 million.
Cana Woodford
We had an oil and natural gas investment of approximately 1,900 net mineral acres in the Cana
Woodford region of western Oklahoma. During the second quarter of 2015, we received
unsolicited offers from third parties to purchase this oil and natural gas investment. We evaluated
these offers in contemplation of a potential sale of these mineral rights. Due to the receipt of
these offers and our potential sale of these mineral rights, we evaluated the appropriate held for
sale accounting criteria to determine if the Cana Woodford mineral rights should be classified as
held for sale as of June 30, 2015. Based on this evaluation, we determined these mineral rights
met the held for sale criteria at June 30, 2015 and, accordingly, these mineral rights were written
down to their estimated fair value. Due to the determination that the mineral rights met the held for
sale criteria, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2.2 million for the Cana
Woodford mineral rights during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Factors That Impact Our Business
Our results of operations in the near term could be impacted by a number of factors, including (1)
our ability to fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures, (2) the availability
of transportation for coal shipments, (3) poor mining conditions resulting from geological
conditions or the effects of prior mining, (4) equipment problems at mining locations, (5) adverse
weather conditions and natural disasters or (6) the availability and costs of key supplies and
commodities such as steel, diesel fuel and explosives.
On a long-term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by, among other factors, (1) our
ability to fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures, (2) changes in
governmental regulation, (3) the availability and prices of competing electricity-generation fuels,
(4) the world-wide demand for steel, which utilizes metallurgical coal and can affect the demand
and prices of metallurgical coal that we produce, (5) our ability to secure or acquire high-quality
coal reserves and (6) our ability to find buyers for coal under favorable supply contracts.
36
We have historically sold a majority of our coal through supply contracts and anticipate that we
will continue to do so. As of June 30, 2016, we had commitments under sales contracts to deliver
annually scheduled base quantities of coal as follows:

Results of Operations
Segment Information
As of June 30, 2016, we have four reportable business segments: Central Appalachia, Northern
Appalachia, Rhino Western and Illinois Basin. Additionally, we have an Other category that
includes our ancillary businesses and our remaining oil and natural gas activities. Our Central
Appalachia segment consists of two mining complexes: Tug River and Rob Fork, which, as of
June 30, 2016, together included one underground mine, three surface mines and three
preparation plants and loadout facilities in eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia. We
resumed mining operations at a majority of our Central Appalachia operations during the three
months ended March 31, 2016, but certain Central Appalachia mining operations have remained
idle as we seek acceptable coal sales contracts that will allow mining to resume at these specific
operations. Additionally, our Central Appalachia segment includes our Elk Horn coal leasing
operations. Our Northern Appalachia segment consists of the Hopedale mining complex, the
Sands Hill mining complex, and the Leesville field. The Hopedale mining complex, located in
northern Ohio, included one underground mine and one preparation plant and loadout facility as
of June 30, 2016. Our Sands Hill mining complex, located in southern Ohio, included two surface
mines, a preparation plant and a river terminal as of June 30, 2016. Our Rhino Western segment
includes our underground mine in the Western Bituminous region at our Castle Valley mining
complex in Utah. Our Illinois Basin segment includes one underground mine, preparation plant
and river loadout facility at our Pennyrile mining complex located in western Kentucky, as well as
our Taylorville field reserves located in central Illinois.
Evaluating Our Results of Operations
Our management uses a variety of financial measurements to analyze our performance,
including (1) Adjusted EBITDA, (2) coal revenues per ton and (3) cost of operations per ton.
Adjusted EBITDA. The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to, and
analysis of, our segments’ Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income
before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization,
while also excluding certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is used by
management primarily as a measure of our segments’ operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA
should not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from
operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in
accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA identically, our
calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Please read
“—Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income by Segment” for reconciliations of Adjusted
EBITDA to net income by segment for each of the periods indicated.
Coal Revenues Per Ton. Coal revenues per ton represents coal revenues divided by tons of
coal sold. Coal revenues per ton is a key indicator of our effectiveness in obtaining favorable
prices for our product.
Cost of Operations Per Ton. Cost of operations per ton sold represents the cost of operations
(exclusive of depreciation, depletion and amortization) divided by tons of coal sold. Management
uses this measurement as a key indicator of the efficiency of operations.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Summary. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our total revenues decreased to $42.8
million from $56.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, which is a 24.7% decrease.
We sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which
is a 18.5% decrease compared to the tons of coal sold for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease in revenue and tons sold was primarily the result of continued weak demand and
low prices in the met and steam coal markets, particularly in Central Appalachia, partially offset
by increased sales from our Pennyrile operation in the Illinois Basin. We believe the weak
demand in the steam coal markets was primarily driven by a continued over-supply of low-priced
natural gas, which electric utilities utilize as a source of electricity generation in lieu of steam
coal. We believe the weak demand in the met coal markets was primarily driven by a decrease in
worldwide steel production due to ongoing global economic weakness, particularly in China.
Net loss from continuing operations increased for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. We generated a net loss from continuing
operations of approximately $121.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $8.1 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing
operations was impacted by an asset impairment charge of $118.7 million related to our Elk Horn
coal leasing company discussed earlier. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, our total net
loss from continuing operations was impacted by an asset impairment charge of $2.2 million
related to our Cana Woodford mineral rights discussed earlier.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $4.5 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 from $4.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period primarily due to the lower net loss
generated year-to-year, once the impact of the asset impairments discussed above are removed
from the net losses generated.

We sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which
was a 18.5% decrease compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in
tons sold year-to-year was primarily due to lower sales from our Central Appalachia segment due
to weak demand for met and steam coal from this region. Tons of coal sold in our Central
Appalachia segment decreased by approximately 62.2% to approximately 0.1 million tons for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily
due to a decrease in steam coal tons sold in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
2015 due to ongoing weak market demand for coal from this region. For our Northern Appalachia
segment, tons of coal sold decreased by approximately 36.2% for the three months ended June
30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 as we experienced a decrease in
tons sold from our Hopedale complex due to weak demand for coal from this region. Coal sales
from our Rhino Western segment decreased by approximately 19.8% for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to decreased customer demand from
our Castle Valley operation. For our Illinois Basin segment, tons of coal sold increased by
approximately 48.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended June 30, 2015 as we increased production and sales year-to-year from our Pennyrile mine
in western Kentucky to meet our contracted sales commitments.

Our coal revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $9.4
million, or 19.3%, to approximately $39.1 million from approximately $48.5 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in coal revenues was primarily due to fewer steam
coal tons sold in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from our Pennyrile mine
in the Illinois Basin. Coal revenues per ton was $49.01 for the three months ended June 30,
2016, a decrease of $0.50, or 1.0%, from $49.51 per ton for the three months ended June 30,
2015. This decrease in coal revenues per ton was primarily the result of lower prices for steam
coal sold in Central Appalachia, as well as a larger mix of lower priced tons sold from Pennyrile.
For our Central Appalachia segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $8.1 million, or
59.4%, to approximately $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
approximately $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold and a decrease in the price for steam coal tons sold,
which reflects the weak coal market conditions for coal from this region. Coal revenues per ton for
our Central Appalachia segment increased by $4.38, or 7.5%, to $63.03 per ton for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $58.65 for the three months ended June 30, 2015,
primarily due to a higher mix of higher priced met coal tons sold as steam coal tons decreased
year-to-year due to ongoing weak demand for steam coal from this region.
For our Northern Appalachia segment, coal revenues were approximately $9.2 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $5.1 million, or 35.7%, from
approximately $14.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in tons sold from our Hopedale complex in Northern Appalachia due
weak demand for coal from the Northern Appalachia region during the three months ended June
30, 2016. Coal revenues per ton for our Northern Appalachia segment was primarily flat at
$57.21 per ton for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $56.77 per ton for the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
For our Rhino Western segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $1.8 million, or
17.4%, to approximately $8.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
approximately $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a
decrease in tons sold due to decreased customer demands at our Castle Valley operation. Coal
revenues per ton for our Rhino Western segment were $38.70 for the three months ended June
30, 2016, an increase of $1.11, or 3.0%, from $37.59 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
The increase in coal revenues per ton was due to an increase in the contracted sales prices for
steam coal sales from our Castle Valley mine for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the same period in 2015.
For our Illinois Basin segment, coal revenues of approximately $16.0 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 increased by approximately $5.6 million, or 54.5%, compared to $10.4
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was due to increased sales from
our Pennyrile mine in western Kentucky to fulfill our customer contracts. Coal revenues per ton
for our Illinois Basin segment was $47.98 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase
of $1.91, or 4.1%, from $46.07 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in coal
revenues per ton was due to higher contracted prices for tons sold.
42
Other revenues for our Other category decreased to approximately $0.1 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $0.3 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decreased business
activity in our ancillary businesses and oil and natural gas investments.

Cost of Operations. Total cost of operations was $33.9 million for the three months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to $47.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our cost of
operations per ton was $42.43 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $5.90, or
12.2%, from the three months ended June 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased primarily
due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia as we reduced production in
these regions in response to weak market demand, partially offset by increased costs from higher
production at our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. The decrease in the cost of operations on a
per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from our Central Appalachia segment as we
produced coal from lower cost operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the same period in 2015.
Our cost of operations for the Central Appalachia segment decreased by $9.8 million, or 76.6%,
to $3.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $12.8 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased year-to-year since we decreased
production during the three months ended June 30, 2016 in response to weak market conditions.
Our cost of operations per ton of $33.95 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was a
reduction of 38.2% compared to $54.95 per ton for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as we
produced coal from lower cost operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
In our Northern Appalachia segment, our cost of operations decreased by $3.9 million, or 32.9%,
to $7.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $11.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of operations was due to reduced production in this
region in response to weak market demand. Our cost of operations per ton was $48.66 for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $2.40, or 5.2%, compared to $46.26 for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. Cost of operations per ton increased slightly primarily due to
fixed operating costs being allocated to lower production and sales tons for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior period.
Our cost of operations for the Rhino Western segment decreased by $2.8 million, or 30.7%, to
$6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to decreased tons produced and sold from our
Castle Valley operation due to weak customer demand. Our cost of operations per ton was
$29.54 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $4.62, or 13.5%, compared to
$34.16 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Cost of operations per ton decreased for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower
maintenance and other costs incurred at our Castle Valley operation.
45
Cost of operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $13.8 million while cost of operations per
ton was $41.38 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, both of which related to our Pennyrile
mining complex in western Kentucky. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, cost of
operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $10.9 million and cost of operations per ton was
$48.74. The increase in cost of operations was primarily the result of increased production year-
to-year at the Pennyrile complex, while cost of operations per ton decreased as we continued to
optimize the cost structure at this mining complex.
Cost of operations in our Other category was relatively flat at $2.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Freight and Handling. Total freight and handling cost was relatively flat at $0.5 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Total depreciation, depletion and amortization
(“DD&A”) expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $5.9 million as compared to
$8.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our depreciation cost decreased to $5.0 million
compared to $7.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease primarily
resulted from lower depreciation costs in our Central Appalachia segment in the current quarter
compared to the prior year as we disposed of excess equipment in this region.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our depletion cost decreased to $0.5 million
compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease resulted from
fewer coal tons produced from our higher depletion rate properties in our Central Appalachia
segment in the current quarter compared to the prior year.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our amortization cost was relatively flat at $0.4 million
compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $4.0 million as compared to $4.9 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower
corporate overhead expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior
period.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $1.7
million as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to higher interest rates on our senior secured credit facility along with the write-off of
approximately $0.1 million of our unamortized debt issuance costs during the three months
ended June 30, 2016. This write-off was due to an amendment of our credit facility during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 that reduced the borrowing capacity from $80 million to $75
million. See the discussion on our credit agreement in “Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” section that follows for more information on this
amendment.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016, total net loss from continuing operations was a loss
of approximately $121.9 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of
approximately $8.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. For the three months
ended June 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing operations was impacted by an asset
impairment charge of $118.7 million related to our Elk Horn coal leasing company discussed
earlier.
For our Central Appalachia segment, net loss from continuing operations was approximately
$122.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a $118.4 million larger net loss as
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, which was primarily related to the $118.7
million asset impairment charge for Elk Horn discussed earlier. Net income from continuing
operations in our Northern Appalachia segment increased by $0.3 million to $1.8 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
This increase was primarily due to reducing costs at our Northern Appalachia operations. Net
income/loss from continuing operations in our Rhino Western segment was at a break-even level
for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of
$1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily
the result of lower costs at our Castle Valley operation during the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the prior year. For our Illinois Basin segment, we generated a net loss from
continuing operations of $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which was an
improvement of $2.0 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease
in net loss was primarily the result of increased coal sales at our Pennyrile mining complex as
well as lower costs per ton as we continued to optimize the operations at this mining facility. For
the Other category, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $0.8 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net loss from continuing operations of $1.9 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss year to year was primarily
due to the $2.2 million asset impairment charges incurred for the three months ended June 30,
2015 related to our Cana Woodford oil and gas properties.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $4.5
million, an increase of $0.4 million from the three months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period primarily due to the lower net loss
generated year-to-year discussed above, once the impact of the asset impairments discussed
above are removed from the net losses generated. Please read “—Reconciliations of Adjusted
EBITDA” for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to net income on a

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Summary. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our total revenues decreased to $83.2
million from $112.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, which is a 26.4% decrease.
We sold approximately 1.6 million tons of coal for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which is
a 14.2% decrease compared to the tons of coal sold for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in revenue and tons sold was primarily the result of continued weak demand and low
prices in the met and steam coal markets, particularly in Central Appalachia, partially offset by
increased sales from our Pennyrile operation in the Illinois Basin. We believe the weak demand
in the steam and met coal markets for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due to the same
factors discussed earlier.
Net loss from continuing operations increased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to the six months ended June 30, 2015. We generated a net loss from continuing operations of
approximately $123.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss
from continuing operations of approximately $12.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing operations was
impacted by an asset impairment charge of $118.7 million related to our Elk Horn coal leasing
company discussed earlier, but was also benefited from a prior service cost benefit of
approximately $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our
Hopedale operation. Net loss from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015
was impacted by the $2.2 million asset impairment charge incurred for our Cana Woodford oil
and gas properties discussed above.
48
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $11.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $9.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from
continuing operations increased period to period primarily due to the $3.9 million prior service
cost benefit discussed above.
Including the loss from discontinued operations of approximately $0.7 million, our total net loss
and Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $12.0 million and $10.3
million, respectively. We did not incur a gain or loss from discontinued operations for the six
months ended June 30, 2016.

We sold approximately 1.6 million tons of coal for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which
was a 14.2% decrease compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in tons
sold year-to-year was primarily due to lower sales from our Central Appalachia segment due to
weak demand for met and steam coal from this region. Tons of coal sold in our Central
Appalachia segment decreased by approximately 60% to approximately 0.2 million tons for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due
to a decrease in steam coal tons sold in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015
due to ongoing weak market demand for coal from this region. For our Northern Appalachia
segment, tons of coal sold decreased by approximately 43.7% for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 as we experienced a decrease in tons
sold from our Hopedale complex due to customers delaying their contracted shipments. Coal
sales from our Rhino Western segment decreased by approximately 6.1% for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to decreased customer demand
from our Castle Valley operation. For our Illinois Basin segment, tons of coal sold increased by
approximately 70.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015 as we increased production and sales year-to-year from our Pennyrile mine in
western Kentucky to meet our contracted sales commitments.

Our coal revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $18.2
million, or 19.4%, to approximately $75.8 million from approximately $94.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in coal revenues was primarily due to fewer steam
coal tons sold in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from our Pennyrile mine
in the Illinois Basin. Coal revenues per ton was $47.72 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of $3.05, or 6.0%, from $50.77 per ton for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This
decrease in coal revenues per ton was primarily the result of lower prices for steam coal sold in
Central Appalachia, as well as a larger mix of lower priced tons sold from Pennyrile.
For our Central Appalachia segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $17.7 million,
or 61.4%, to approximately $11.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from
approximately $28.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to fewer steam coal tons sold and a decrease in the price for steam coal tons sold, which
reflects the weak coal market conditions for coal from this region. Coal revenues per ton for our
Central Appalachia segment decreased by $2.16, or 3.5%, to $59.29 per ton for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $61.45 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily
due to lower prices from weak demand for steam coal sold.
For our Northern Appalachia segment, coal revenues were approximately $15.9 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $13.2 million, or 45.4%, from
approximately $29.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to a decrease in tons sold from our Hopedale complex in Northern Appalachia due to
customers delaying their contracted shipments during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Coal
revenues per ton for our Northern Appalachia segment decreased by $1.73, or 3.0%, to $55.95
per ton for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $57.68 per ton for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the larger mix of lower priced tons
being sold from our Sands Hill complex compared to higher priced tons sold from our Hopedale
complex.
For our Rhino Western segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $0.6 million, or
3.3%, to approximately $17.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from approximately
$18.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in tons sold
due to decreased customer demands at our Castle Valley operation. Coal revenues per ton for
our Rhino Western segment were $38.37 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of
$1.10, or 2.9%, from $37.27 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in coal
revenues per ton was due to an increase in the contracted sales prices for steam coal sales from
our Castle Valley mine for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015.
For our Illinois Basin segment, coal revenues of approximately $30.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 increased by approximately $13.3 million, or 75.8%, compared to $17.5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was due to increased sales from
our Pennyrile mine in western Kentucky to fulfill our customer contracts. Coal revenues per ton
for our Illinois Basin segment were $47.49 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase
of $1.44, or 3.1%, from $46.05 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in coal
revenues per ton was due to higher contracted prices for tons sold.

Other revenues for our Other category decreased to approximately $0.2 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $1.3 million for the six months ended June
30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decreased business activity in our
ancillary businesses and oil and natural gas investments.

Cost of Operations. Total cost of operations was $63.3 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to $93.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our cost of
operations per ton was $39.86 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $10.61, or
21.0%, from the six months ended June 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased primarily
due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia as we reduced production in
these regions in response to weak market demand, partially offset by increased costs from higher
production at our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. The decrease in the cost of operations on a
per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin as we
increased and optimized production during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015, as well as the $3.9 million benefit in Northern Appalachia during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from the prior service cost benefit resulting from the cancellation of
the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation.
Our cost of operations for the Central Appalachia segment decreased by $19.7 million, or 76.6%,
to $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $25.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased year-to-year since we decreased
production during the six months ended June 30, 2016 in response to weak market conditions.
Our cost of operations per ton of $31.84 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was a reduction
of 41.7% compared to $54.58 per ton for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as we produced
coal from lower cost operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
In our Northern Appalachia segment, our cost of operations decreased by $14.0 million, or
56.7%, to $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $24.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $37.70 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $11.35, or 23.1%, compared to $49.05 for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of operations and cost of operations per ton was
primarily due to the $3.9 million prior service cost benefit during the six months ended June 30,
2016 resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation.
Our cost of operations for the Rhino Western segment decreased by $2.4 million, or 13.9%, to
$14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $16.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $31.13 for the six months ended June 30,
2016, a decrease of $2.82, or 8.3%, compared to $33.95 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Total cost of operations and cost of operations per ton decreased for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower maintenance and other costs from
our Castle Valley operation.
54
Cost of operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $26.5 million while cost of operations per
ton was $40.79 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, both of which related to our Pennyrile
mining complex in western Kentucky. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, cost of operations
in our Illinois Basin segment was $20.8 million and cost of operations per ton was $54.65. The
increase in cost of operations was primarily the result of increased production year-to-year at the
Pennyrile complex, while cost of operations per ton decreased as we continued to optimize the
cost structure at this mining complex.
Cost of operations in our Other category was relatively flat at $5.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Freight and Handling. Total freight and handling cost was relatively flat at $1.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Total depreciation, depletion and amortization
(“DD&A”) expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $12.2 million as compared to
$17.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our depreciation cost decreased to $10.3 million
compared to $15.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease primarily
resulted from lower depreciation costs in our Central Appalachia segment in the current quarter
compared to the prior year as we disposed of excess equipment in this region.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our depletion cost decreased to $1.1 million compared
to $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease resulted from fewer coal
tons produced from our higher depletion rate properties in our Central Appalachia segment in the
current quarter compared to the prior year.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our amortization cost was relatively flat at $0.8 million
compared to $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $8.0 million as compared to $9.3 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower corporate
overhead expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior period.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $3.3
million as compared to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was
primarily due to higher interest rates on our senior secured credit facility along with the write-off of
approximately $0.3 million of our unamortized debt issuance costs during the six months ended
June 30, 2016. This write-off was due to the fourth and fifth amendments of our credit facility
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 that reduced the borrowing capacity from $100
million to $75 million. See the discussion on our credit agreement in “Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” section that follows for more information
on these amendments.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, total net loss from continuing operations was a loss of
approximately $123.2 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of approximately
$12.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016,
our total net loss from continuing operations was impacted by an asset impairment charge of
$118.7 million related to our Elk Horn coal leasing company discussed earlier, but was also
benefited from a prior service cost benefit of approximately $3.9 million resulting from the
cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Including our income
from discontinued operations of approximately $0.7 million, our total net loss for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 was approximately $12.0 million.
For our Central Appalachia segment, net loss from continuing operations was approximately
$125.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a $121.8 million larger net loss as
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, which was primarily related to the $118.7
million asset impairment charge for Elk Horn discussed earlier. Net income from continuing
operations in our Northern Appalachia segment increased by $3.1 million to $5.8 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily due the prior service cost benefit of approximately $3.9 million resulting
from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Net loss from
continuing operations in our Rhino Western segment was a loss of $0.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $2.5 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily the result of lower costs
at our Castle Valley operation during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior
year. For our Illinois Basin segment, we generated a net loss from continuing operations of $1.5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which was an improvement of $5.7 million
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily the
result of increased coal sales at our Pennyrile mining complex as well as lower costs per ton as
we continued to optimize the operations at this mining facility. For the Other category, we had a
net loss from continuing operations of $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.6 million for the six months ended June
30, 2015. This decrease in results year to year was primarily due to the $2.2 million asset
impairment charge incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2015 for our Cana Woodford
oil and gas properties discussed earlier.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $11.1
million, an increase of $1.5 million from the six months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA
from continuing operations increased period to period due to the prior service cost benefit of
approximately $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our
Hopedale operation. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $10.3
million once the results from discontinued operations were included. Please read “—

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a provision for doubtful
accounts of approximately $0.1 million related to Elk Horn lessee customers in Central
Appalachia. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded provisions for
doubtful accounts of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to Elk
Horn lessee customers in Central Appalachia. We believe that the isolation and presentation
of this specific item to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it enhances investors’
understanding of how we assess the performance of our business. We believe the adjustment
of this item provides investors with additional information that they can utilize in evaluating our
performance. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this item provides investors with
enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating results.

EBITDA is calculated based on actual amounts and not the rounded amounts presented in
this table.
** Totals may not foot due to rounding.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an asset impairment loss of
approximately $118.7 million for our Elk Horn coal leasing company that was discussed
earlier. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded an asset impairment
loss of approximately $2.2 million for our Cana Woodford mineral rights since we classified
this asset as held for sale as of June 30, 2015. We believe that the isolation and presentation
of this specific item to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it enhances investors’
understanding of how we assess the performance of our business. We believe the adjustment
of this item provides investors with additional information that they can utilize in evaluating our
performance. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this item provides investors with
enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash on hand and availability under our Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, our available liquidity was $6.7 million,
which was comprised of our availability under our credit agreement.
Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for purchasing,
upgrading and maintaining equipment used in developing and mining our reserves, as well as
complying with applicable environmental and mine safety laws and regulations. Our principal
liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including
acquisitions from time to time, and service our debt. Historically, our sources of liquidity included
cash generated by our operations, borrowings under our credit agreement and issuances of
equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets on economic terms in the future will be
affected by general economic conditions, the domestic and global financial markets, our
operational and financial performance, the value and performance of our equity securities,
prevailing commodity prices and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control. Failure to
obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause us to significantly
reduce our spending and to alter our short- or long-term business plan. We may also be required
to consider other options, such as selling assets or merger opportunities, and depending on the
urgency of our liquidity constraints, we may be required to pursue such an option at an
inopportune time.
Prior to our entry into the Fifth Amendment, we were unable to demonstrate that we had sufficient
liquidity to operate our business over the subsequent twelve months and thus, substantial doubt
was raised about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, our independent
registered public accounting firm included an emphasis paragraph with respect to our ability to
continue as a going concern in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in our
auditors’ report may have an adverse impact on our relationship with third parties with whom we
do business, including our customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to raise
additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed and conduct normal operations. As a
result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially
adversely affected.
On March 17, 2016, our Operating Company, as borrower, and we and certain of our
subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) of our
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of
change of control in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to permit Royal to purchase
the membership interests of the General.
60
On May 13, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, which extended the term to July 31, 2017 (see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement” for further details of the Fourth and Fifth
Amendments).
In order to borrow under our senior secured credit facility, we must make certain representations
and warranties to our lenders at the time of each borrowing. If we are unable to make these
representations and warranties, we would be unable to borrow under our senior secured credit
facility, absent a waiver. Furthermore, if we violate any of the covenants or restrictions in our
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the maximum leverage ratio and minimum
EBITDA requirement, some or all of our indebtedness may become immediately due and
payable, and our lenders’ commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. Given the
continued weak demand and low prices for met and steam coal, we may not be able to continue
to give the required representations or meet all of the covenants and restrictions included in our
senior secured credit facility. If we are unable to give a required representation or we violate a
covenant or restriction, then we will need a waiver from our lenders in order to continue to borrow
under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Although we believe our lenders loans are
well secured under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, there is no
assurance that the lenders would agree to any such waiver.
We continue to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on our common
and subordinated units and cost and productivity improvements, to enhance and preserve our
liquidity so that we can fund our ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures and
meet our financial commitments and debt service obligations. For the quarter ended June 30,
2016, we continued the suspension of the cash distribution for our common units, which was
initially suspended beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2015. For the quarters ended
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, we announced cash distributions of $0.05 per
common unit, or $0.20 per unit on an annualized basis, and for the quarter ended March 31,
2015, we announced cash distributions of $0.02 per common unit, or $0.08 per unit on an
annualized basis. Each of these quarters’ distribution levels were lower than the previous
quarters’ distribution amounts of $0.445 per common unit, or $1.78 per unit on an annualized
basis. We have not paid any distribution on our subordinated units for any quarter after the
quarter ended March 31, 2012. The distribution suspension and prior reductions were the result
of prolonged weakness in the coal markets, which has continued to adversely affect our cash
flow.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $11.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the
result of ongoing weak coal market conditions discussed above for the six months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to 2015.
61
Net cash used for investing activities was $4.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to cash used for investing activities of $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. Net cash used for investing activities is primarily related to our capital expenditures
necessary for maintaining our mining operations.
Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million,
which was primarily attributable to net repayments on our revolving credit facility this period with
the proceeds from limited partner contributions. Net cash used in financing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 was $5.2 million, which was primarily attributable to fees paid for
the third amendment of our credit facility, as well as distributions paid to unitholders.
Capital Expenditures
Our mining operations require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations
and to meet environmental and safety regulations. Maintenance capital expenditures are those
capital expenditures required to maintain our long term operating capacity. Examples of
maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures associated with the replacement of
equipment and coal reserves, whether through the expansion of an existing mine or the
acquisition or development of new reserves to the extent such expenditures are made to maintain
our long term operating capacity. Expansion capital expenditures are those capital expenditures
that we expect will increase our operating capacity over the long term. Examples of expansion
capital expenditures include the acquisition of reserves, equipment for a new mine or the
expansion of an existing mine to the extent such expenditures are expected to expand our long-
term operating capacity.
Actual maintenance capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were
approximately $0.6 million. These amounts were primarily used to rebuild, repair or replace older
mining equipment. Expansion capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were
approximately $3.8 million, which were primarily related to the payments for the final
development of our new Riveredge mine on our Pennyrile property in western Kentucky.
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On July 29, 2011, we executed the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The maximum
availability under the amended and restated credit facility was $300.0 million, with a one-time
option to increase the availability by an amount not to exceed $50.0 million. Of the $300.0 million,
$75.0 million was available for letters of credit. In April 2015, the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement was amended and the borrowing commitment under the facility was reduced to
$100.0 million and the amount available for letters of credit was reduced to $50.0 million. As
described below, in March 2016 and May 2016, the borrowing commitment under the facility was
further reduced to $80.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively, and the amount available for
letters of credit was reduced to $30.0 million.
Loans under the senior secured credit facility currently bear interest at a base rate equaling the
prime rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
also contains letter of credit fees equal to an applicable margin of 5.00% multiplied by the
aggregate amount available to be drawn on the letters of credit, and a 0.15% fronting fee payable
to the administrative agent. In addition, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the
senior secured credit facility at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings on the line of credit are
collateralized by all of our unsecured assets.
62
Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain minimum financial
ratios and contains certain restrictive provisions, including among others, restrictions on making
loans, investments and advances, incurring additional indebtedness, guaranteeing
indebtedness, creating liens, and selling or assigning stock. As of and for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2016, we are in compliance with respect to all covenants contained in the credit
agreement.
On March 17, 2016, we entered into the Fourth Amendment of our Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of change of control in the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement to permit Royal to purchase the membership interests of our
general partner. The Fourth Amendment reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility
to a maximum of $80 million and reduced the amount available for letters of credit to $30 million.
The Fourth Amendment eliminated the option to borrow funds utilizing the LIBOR rate plus an
applicable margin and established the borrowing rate for all borrowings under the facility to be
based upon the current PRIME rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The Fourth Amendment
eliminated the capability to make Swing Loans under the facility and eliminated our ability to pay
distributions to our common or subordinated unitholders. The Fourth Amendment altered the
maximum leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-
month basis, to 6.75 to 1.00. The leverage ratio shall be reduced by 0.50 to 1.00 for every $10
million of net cash proceeds, in the aggregate, received by us after the date of the Fourth
Amendment from a liquidity event; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum
permitted leverage ratio be reduced below 3.00 to 1.00. A liquidity event is defined in the Fourth
Amendment as the issuance of any equity by us on or after the Fourth Amendment effective date
(other than the Royal equity contribution discussed above), or the disposition of any assets by us.
The Fourth Amendment required us to maintain minimum liquidity of $5 million and minimum
EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), calculated as of the end of the most recent month,
on a trailing twelve month basis, of $8 million. The Fourth Amendment limited the amount of our
capital expenditures to $15 million, calculated as of end of the most recent month, on a trailing
twelve-month basis. The Fourth Amendment required us to provide monthly financial statements
and a weekly rolling thirteen-week cash flow forecast to the Administrative Agent.
On May 13, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amendment of our Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement that extended the term to July 31, 2017. Per the Fifth Amendment, the credit facility
will be automatically extended to December 31, 2017 if revolving credit commitments are
reduced to $55 million or less on or before July 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment immediately
reduced the revolving credit commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $75 million
and maintained the amount available for letters of credit at $30 million. The Fifth Amendment
further reduced the revolving credit commitments over time on a dollar-for-dollar basis in amounts
equal to each of the following: (i) the face amount of any letter of credit that expires or whose face
amount is reduced by any such dollar amount, (ii) the net proceeds received from any asset
sales, (iii) the Royal scheduled capital contributions (as outline below), (iv) the net proceeds from
the issuance of any equity by us up to $20.0 million (other than equity issued in exchange for any
Royal contribution as outlined in the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Royal scheduled
capital contributions to us as outlined below), and (v) the proceeds from the incurrence of any
subordinated debt. The first $11 million of proceeds received from any equity issued by us
described in clause (iv) above shall also satisfy the Royal scheduled capital contributions as
outlined below. The Fifth Amendment requires Royal to contribute $2 million each quarter
beginning September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2017 and $1 million on December 1,
2017, for a total of $11 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the revolving credit
commitments as follows:

The Fifth Amendment requires that on or before March 31, 2017, we shall have solicited bids for
the potential sale of certain non-core assets, satisfactory to the administrative agent, and
provided the administrative agent, and any other lender upon its request, with a description of the
solicitation process, interested parties and any potential bids. The Fifth Amendment limits any
payments by us to our general partner to: (i) the usual and customary payroll and benefits of the
our management team so long as our management team remains employees of our general
partner, (2) the usual and customary board fees of our general partner, and (3) the usual and
customary general and administrative costs and expenses of our general partner incurred in
connection with the operation of its business in an amount not to exceed $0.3 million per fiscal
year. The Fifth Amendment limits asset sales to a maximum of $5 million unless we receive
consent from the lenders. The Fifth Amendment alters the maximum leverage ratio, calculated as
of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis, as follows:

For the month ending July 31, 2017, through the month ending November 30, 2017
For the month ending December 31, 2017
The leverage ratios above shall be reduced by 0.50 to 1.00 for every $10 million of aggregate
proceeds received by us from: (i) the issuance of our equity (excluding any Royal capital
contributions) and/or (ii) the proceeds received from the sale of assets, provided that the leverage
ratio shall not be reduced below 3.50 to 1.00. The Fifth Amendment removes the $5.0 million
minimum liquidity requirement and requires us to have any deposit, securities or investment
accounts with a member of the lending group.
65
At June 30, 2016, the Operating Company had borrowings outstanding (excluding letters of
credit) of $37.8 million at a variable interest rate of PRIME plus 3.50% (7.00% at June 30, 2016).
In addition, the Operating Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $27.8
million at a fixed interest rate of 5.00% at June 30, 2016. Based upon a maximum borrowing
capacity of 7.25 times a trailing twelve-month EBITDA calculation (as defined in the credit
agreement), the Operating Company had available borrowing capacity of approximately $6.7
million at June 30, 2016. During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, we had average
borrowings outstanding of approximately $42.6 million under our credit agreement.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements.
These arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk,
such as bank letters of credit and surety bonds. No liabilities related to these arrangements are
reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, and we do not expect any material adverse effects
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Federal and state laws require us to secure certain long-term obligations related to mine closure
and reclamation costs. We typically secure these obligations by using surety bonds, an off-
balance sheet instrument. The use of surety bonds is less expensive for us than the alternative of
posting a 100% cash bond or a bank letter of credit, either of which would require a greater use of
our amended and restated credit agreement. We then use bank letters of credit to secure our
surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with a
committed bonding facility pursuant to which we are required to provide bank letters of credit in
an amount of up to 25% of the aggregate bond liability. To the extent that surety bonds become
unavailable, we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit, cash
deposits or other suitable forms of collateral.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $27.8 million in letters of credit outstanding, of which $22.4 million
served as collateral for surety bonds.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases
its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from the estimates
used and judgments made.
66
The accounting policies and estimates that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements are fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes in these policies
and estimates as of June 30, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Part-I— Item 1. Note 2 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein
by reference. There are no known future impacts or material changes or trends of new accounting
guidance beyond the disclosures provided in Note 2.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.
Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 at the
reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
PART II—Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
We may, from time to time, be involved in various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our
operations in the normal course of business. While many of these matters involve inherent
uncertainty, we do not believe that we are a party to any legal proceedings or claims that will
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risks
under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results. There has been no material change in our risk factors from those described in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These risks are not the only risks
that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
