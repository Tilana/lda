</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the pledge made by all States under the Charter of the United Nations to 
</p>
<p>promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, in which the Assembly emphasized the responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>all States, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to respect human rights and </p>

 <p>fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind, and acknowledged the importance 
</p>
<p>of respect and understanding for religious and cultural diversity throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the valuable contribution of all religions to modern civilization and the 
</p>
<p>contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make towards improved awareness and 
</p>
<p>understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted 
</p>
<p>by the General Assembly on 8 September 2000, to take measures to eliminate the increasing acts 
</p>
<p>of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all 
</p>
<p>societies, and looking forward to its effective implementation at all levels,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>in this regard the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, welcoming the progress 
</p>
<p>achieved in implementing them, and emphasizing that they constitute a solid foundation for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of all scourges and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>all international and regional initiatives to promote cross-cultural and interfaith 
</p>
<p>harmony, including the Alliance of Civilizations and the International Dialogue on Interfaith 
</p>
<p>Cooperation for Peace and Harmony, and their valuable efforts in the promotion of a culture of 
</p>
<p>peace and dialogue at all levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the reports of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance submitted to the Council at its fourth, 
</p>
<p>sixth and ninth sessions (A/HRC/4/19, A/HRC/6/6 and A/HRC/9/12), in which the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur highlighted the serious nature of the defamation of all religions and the need to 
</p>
<p>complement legal strategies, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of violence 
</p>
<p>against followers of certain faiths occurring in many parts of the world, in addition to the 
</p>
<p>negative projection of certain religions in the media and the introduction and enforcement of 
</p>
<p>laws and administrative measures that specifically discriminate against and target persons with </p>

 <p>certain ethnic and religious  backgrounds, particularly Muslim minorities following the events 
</p>
<p>of 11 September 2001, and that threaten to impede their full enjoyment of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that defamation of religions is a serious affront to human dignity leading to a 
</p>
<p>restriction on the freedom of religion of their adherents and incitement to religious hatred and 
</p>
<p>violence,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern </i>that defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in 
</p>
<p>general could lead to social disharmony and violations of human rights, and alarmed at the 
</p>
<p>inaction of some States to combat this burgeoning trend and the resulting discriminatory 
</p>
<p>practices against adherents of certain religions and, in this context, stressing the need to 
</p>
<p>effectively combat defamation of all religions and incitement to religious hatred in general and 
</p>
<p>against Islam and Muslims in particular, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, as well as 
</p>
<p>dialogue among and within civilizations, are essential for global peace and understanding, while 
</p>
<p>manifestations of cultural and ethnic prejudice, religious intolerance and xenophobia generate 
</p>
<p>hatred and violence among peoples and nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance, which involves 
</p>
<p>acceptance by the public of and its respect for diversity, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the various regional and national initiatives to combat religious and racial 
</p>
<p>intolerance against specific groups and communities and emphasizing, in this context, the need 
</p>
<p>to adopt a comprehensive and non-discriminatory approach to ensure respect for all races and 
</p>
<p>religions, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolution 7/19 of 27 March 2008 and General Assembly resolution 63/171 
</p>
<p>of 18 December 2008, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Takes note </i>of the study of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on the compilation of existing legislation and jurisprudence concerning defamation of and 
</p>
<p>contempt for religions (A/HRC/9/25) and the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary </p>

 <p>forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/9/12) 
</p>
<p>presented to the Council at its ninth session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the negative stereotyping and defamation of religions and 
</p>
<p>manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still evident in 
</p>
<p>the world, which have led to intolerance against the followers of these religions;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Strongly deplores </i>all acts of psychological and physical violence and assaults, and 
</p>
<p>incitement thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or belief, and such acts directed 
</p>
<p>against their businesses, properties, cultural centres and places of worship, as well as targeting of 
</p>
<p>holy sites, religious symbols and venerated personalities of all religions;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the continued serious instances of deliberate stereotyping 
</p>
<p>of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media, as well as programmes and agendas 
</p>
<p>pursued by extremist organizations and groups aimed at creating and perpetuating stereotypes 
</p>
<p>about certain religions, in particular when condoned by Governments;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes with deep concern </i>the intensification of the overall campaign of defamation of 
</p>
<p>religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, including the ethnic and religious 
</p>
<p>profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions 
</p>
<p>and incitement to religious hatred in general have become aggravating factors that contribute to 
</p>
<p>the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of members of target groups, as well as to their 
</p>
<p>economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>in this respect that Islam is frequently and wrongly 
</p>
<p>associated with human rights violations and terrorism and, in this regard, regrets the laws or 
</p>
<p>administrative measures specifically designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby 
</p>
<p>stigmatizing them and legitimizing the discrimination they experience; 
</p>
<p>8.  <i>Reaffirms</i> the commitment of all States to the implementation, in an integrated 
</p>
<p>manner, of the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy, adopted without a vote by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006 and reaffirmed by the Assembly 
</p>
<p>in its resolution 62/272 of 5 September 2008, and in which it clearly reaffirms, inter alia, that </p>

 <p>terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or 
</p>
<p>group, as well as the need to reinforce the commitment of the international community to 
</p>
<p>promote, among other things, a culture of peace and respect for all religions, beliefs, and cultures 
</p>
<p>and to prevent the defamation of religions; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Deplores </i>the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, including the 
</p>
<p>Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or related intolerance and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against any religion, as well as the targeting of religious symbols and venerated 
</p>
<p>persons;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, including 
</p>
<p>articles 19 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 19 and 20 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, everyone has the right to hold opinions 
</p>
<p>without interference and the right to freedom of expression, the exercise of which carries with it 
</p>
<p>special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations only as provided 
</p>
<p>for by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, protection of 
</p>
<p>national security or of public order, public health or morals and general welfare;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulated that the prohibition of the 
</p>
<p>dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to religious hatred;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities 
</p>
<p>and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, and urges all States to apply and, where required, reinforce existing laws when such 
</p>
<p>xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions occur, in order to deny impunity for 
</p>
<p>those who commit such acts; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges </i>all States to provide, within their respective legal and constitutional systems, 
</p>
<p>adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting 
</p>
<p>from defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, and to take all 
</p>
<p>possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and beliefs; </p>

 <p> 14. <i>Underscores </i>the need to combat defamation of religions and incitement to religious 
</p>
<p>hatred in general by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels through education and awareness-building; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to make the utmost effort, in accordance with their national 
</p>
<p>legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law, to ensure 
</p>
<p>that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and protected, and to take 
</p>
<p>additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration or destruction;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Calls for</i> strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue for the 
</p>
<p>promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human rights and 
</p>
<p>diversity of religions and beliefs, and urges States, non-governmental organizations, religious 
</p>
<p>leaders as well as the print and electronic media to support and foster such a dialogue;  
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Expresses its appreciation </i>to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for holding 
</p>
<p>a seminar on freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
</p>
<p>to discrimination, hostility or violence, in October 2008, and requests her to continue to build on 
</p>
<p>this initiative, with a view to contributing concretely to the prevention and elimination of all such 
</p>
<p>forms of incitement and the consequences of negative stereotyping of religions or beliefs, and 
</p>
<p>their adherents, on the human rights of those individuals and their communities;  
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to report on all manifestations of defamation 
</p>
<p>of religions, and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia, on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>all rights by their followers, to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>twelfth session on the implementation of the present resolution, including on the possible 
</p>
<p>correlation between defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred 
</p>
<p>in many parts of the world.
