<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/3, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to collect information from 
States Members of the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders on best practices in 
the application of traditional values while promoting and protecting human rights and 
upholding human dignity, and to submit a summary thereon to the Council. The present 
report is submitted to the twenty-fourth session of the Council in accordance with its 
calendar of thematic resolutions. 
</p>
<p>2. On 26 December 2012, OHCHR sent a request for information to all permanent 
missions to the United Nations Office in Geneva and other relevant stakeholders. As at 27 
May 2013, it had received responses from Groups of States, States Members of the United 
Nations (European Union; Belarus; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Brunei Darussalam; 
Guatemala; Honduras; Indonesia; Iraq; Jordan; Mauritius; Pakistan; Oman; Qatar; Serbia; 
Spain; Sri Lanka; Syrian Arab Republic); national human rights institutions (Colombia;

</p>
<p><b> II. Contributions received 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Groups of States and States Members of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>3. The European Union stated that it was not in a position to provide examples of best 
practices. It stressed the need for caution, pointing to the possible danger of introducing the 
concept of traditional values in the human rights realm as there was no clear-cut, 
universally agreed definition. Whereas human rights were formalized in international law 
through consensus and agreed upon as universal and inalienable, traditional values were 
inherently subjective and specific to time and place. Thus, although traditions might 
sometimes be in line with human rights, the two notions were not necessarily analogous and </p>


<p>traditional values could also have a negative impact on the implementation of human rights, 
especially those concerning violence against women, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
age and disability. The European Union highlighted that the vagueness of the relationship 
to human rights and the subjectivity of the notion of traditional values could undermine 
human rights and their universality and justify human rights violations. It emphasized that 
where traditional values conflicted with and undermined human rights, States had a positive 
obligation to eradicate these harmful traditions, values and practices. 
</p>
<p>4. Belarus stated that the traditions of religious tolerance and the right to freedom of 
conscience in society, for instance as granted by article 31 of its Constitution, the Law of 
the Republic of Belarus on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations and the 
equality of religions before the law through the interfaith dialogue, provided interfaith 
peace and understanding. The legal framework allowed for cooperation between Church 
and State. With regard to the ethno-religious dialogue, the State policy had to be in 
accordance with the Constitution and the Law on national minorities in the Republic of 
Belarus. All ethnic and cultural associations received financial, legal, organizational and 
methodological support from the State on an equal basis. 
</p>
<p>5. Educational training and education were carried out in accordance with the Code of 
Education, the concept of continuous education of children and youth and education 
programmes. Education at all levels was based on universal and humanistic values like 
dignity, freedom and responsibility, as well as cultural and spiritual traditions. The 
Academy of Postgraduate Education offered systematic training on the promotion of 
traditional values, respect for human rights and freedoms, protection of rights of the child, 
and strengthening the role of families, communities and educational institutions in the 
assertion of traditional values. Programmes to improve the education skills of managers and 
specialists covered traditional values and human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. Bosnia and Herzegovina focused on the strengthening of tolerance and efforts to 
combat discrimination against national minorities, such as Roma, as a means of human 
rights protection and implementation. In that context, reference was made to a decrease in 
ethnically motivated criminal acts. Discrimination was prohibited by the Constitution and 
criminalized under criminal codes. In 2009, the Anti-discrimination Law was adopted in 
accordance with which all public authorities had to review, amend and enact laws, policies 
and practices.  
</p>
<p>7.  Brunei Darussalam stated that, taking into account the diverse traditional values of 
humankind globally, some terminology used in Human Rights Council resolution 21/3 
required more specific definitions. It was necessary to place emphasis on the importance of 
human rights without distinctions of any kind.  
</p>
<p>8. Guatemala, as a multi-ethnic State where different sociocultural groups such as 
Maya, Gar&#237;funa and Xinca existed, held the view that culture and traditions could not be 
invoked as a pretext to justify violations of minority rights which were recognized in 
national and international instruments. In the fight against racism and discrimination, for 
instance, the Agreement on Identity of Indigenous Peoples (Acuerdo sobre Identidad de los 
Pueblos Ind&#237;genas) and the establishment of the Office of the Advocate for Indigenous 
Women (Defensor&#237;a de la Mujer Ind&#237;gena) were referred to. The use and development of 
customs, traditions, languages and traditional clothing were protected and promoted. Local 
governments and administration elected through universal suffrage and integration policies 
aimed at children, adolescents and women ensured participation and democratic processes, 
taking into account, the multi-ethnic and cultural structures in the State.  
</p>
<p>9. Honduras pointed out that traditional values and customs were the origin of human 
rights. Traditional values could not justify any practice that was contrary to the dignity of </p>


<p>the person. States needed to safeguard traditional values which protected equality and 
dignity and must respect and protect the human rights of all. 
</p>
<p>10. The people of Honduras had their own traditions, customs, religions and beliefs, 
which had to be preserved to achieve the full realization of the cultural rights of all 
inhabitants. Therefore, the State adopted legislative, administrative and other measures in 
line with international human rights standards and national efforts to achieve greater 
enjoyment of rights within the framework of the public policy and national human rights 
action plan (Primera Pol&#237;tica P&#250;blica y el Plan Nacional de Acci&#243;n en Derechos Humanos), 
such as focusing on intercultural dialogue, gender equity and ethnic diversity.  
</p>
<p>11. Traditional values could be threatened, for instance, by technology and foreign 
cultures. Measures to use traditional values for the promotion of human rights included, 
amongst others, the creation of consciousness, the participation of community and religious 
leaders in raising awareness of human rights values, and their involvement in the 
development of human rights curricula and education.  
</p>
<p>12. Indonesia had a rich cultural and ethnic diversity that was devoted to humanity. 
Human rights values were embedded in all cultures and existed in different forms, such as 
proverbs, idioms, customs and traditions. They were deep-rooted in the daily lives of 
societies and promoted the upholding of human rights. In an effort to prevent the use of 
traditional values to justify discriminatory practices, the Government implemented 
preventive measures such as the integration of positive traditional values at all levels of 
education, in the form of human rights curricula (formal, informal and religious education).<b> 
</b>The traditional values included &#8220;Kitorang samua basaudara&#8221;, &#8211; &#8220;we are all family&#8221; &#8211; 
reflecting equality, non-discrimination and equal treatment; &#8220;Sitouw Timouw Tomoutow&#8221; &#8211; 
&#8220;to live for the sake of others&#8221;, i.e. caring and sharing; &#8220;Sipakataum Sipakalebbi&#8221; &#8211; to 
acknowledge, value and respect others; &#8220;Siri&#8221; &#8211; respect and self-esteem; &#8220;Ngewongke&#8221; &#8211; to 
respect and understand each other; &#8220;Ngaha Aina Ngoho&#8221; &#8211; to think of others&#8217; needs; 
&#8220;Rohoe Rahayu&#8221; &#8211; to support each other and &#8220;Udiep Sari Mati Syahid&#8221; &#8211; to tolerate and 
understand each other.  
</p>
<p>13. Iraq recalled that human rights were standards for acknowledging the human dignity 
of all people. Human rights also controlled and regulated social interaction within a 
community and the relationship with their government, and both national and international 
liabilities and responsibilities of the latter. Iraq referred to the universality of human rights, 
their non-violability and respect for the rights of others. It also mentioned its programmes 
for promoting and protecting human rights through the development of a culture of human 
rights. Those efforts restored security, stability and the enhancement of human rights.  
</p>
<p>14. Jordan described the actions it undertook in the field of human rights with respect to 
traditional values. For instance, the Constitution laid down rights, duties and State 
responsibilities with regard to equality, dignity and freedom as reflections of values derived 
from Arabic and Islamic culture based on the State religion. The constitutional provisions 
included civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights. A 2011 
Constitutional amendment considered the importance of the family as a cornerstone of the 
community.  
</p>
<p>15. Legislation in Jordan reaffirmed the important role of educational institutions in 
promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms. One of the most important national 
foundations was that the people of Jordan were an integrated unit and not subject to or 
agents of racial intolerance. The press and publications law also provided a framework for 
the right of the community to maintain its traditions and customs.  
</p>
<p>16. Mauritius stated that several traditional values which had been universalized through 
international human rights instruments were taught, in particular, through the various 
religions practised therein. It listed traditional values including respect and love for truth, </p>


<p>life, family, parents, education, wisdom, nature, compassion, honesty, peace, cooperation 
and solidarity which were laid down in documents like the Koran, the Bible and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These values have also been incorporated in key 
documents produced by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, for example the 
National Curriculum Framework and the Education and Human Resources Strategy Plan 
2008&#8211;2020. 
</p>
<p>17. Pakistan described its culture as a synthesis of the teachings of Islam, the works of 
Sufi poets and the rule of law. The contribution of Sufi poets promoted the themes of love, 
peace and humanity as their works enshrined the values of human rights and dignity. The 
teachings of Islam were the Magna Carta of human rights in Pakistan as the principles of 
human rights were enunciated by the Holy Prophet and incorporated in the Constitution of 
Pakistan in articles 8&#8211;28. 
</p>
<p>18. The family was an integral part of Pakistani culture. Protecting the rights of 
vulnerable segments of society like older persons, disabled persons, children, women and 
the unemployed were also priorities. Regarding traditional practices supporting the 
protection and promotion of human rights, Pakistan pointed to the tradition of resolving 
local disputes through village panchyat which have been institutionalized in the local 
government system through Anjuman-e-Muslahit, which consisted of local elders and 
elected representatives. Village and neighbourhood councils had been established to 
develop and improve water-supply sources and sanitation, and addressed poverty, consumer 
protection and community involvement in the maintenance of public facilities. 
</p>
<p>19. Oman stated that Islam was founded on justice and ethics to achieve mutual respect, 
including within the context of distortion, hatred, intolerance and violence. Several human 
rights such as the right to life, the right to education and the right to work could be found in 
Islam. 
</p>
<p>20. The Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs worked towards the promotion 
of a culture of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms based on the laws and 
regulations currently in force and the Statute of the State promulgated by Royal Decree No. 
101/69 of 6 November 1969. Articles 10, 12, 28 and 35 highlighted mutual respect and 
benefit, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, as well as justice, equality, 
freedom to perform religious rites and legal protection of foreigners, their property and 
traditions. 
</p>
<p>21. Qatar referred to its work, in cooperation with the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center 
(FANAR), to promote and protect human rights through traditional values, for example 
with the publication of the book <i>Islam and human rights</i>. The book affirmed the principle 
of promoting dialogue and cultural communication to correct misconceptions about Islam 
and promote international peace and security as well as convergence between different 
cultures. 
</p>
<p>22. Serbia referred to its many national minorities and ethnic communities and its 
tradition of fostering a spirit of tolerance and intercultural dialogue between them. Its 
Constitution exemplified a best practice through encouraging respect for diversity and 
measures in education, culture and public information to foster understanding, appreciation 
and respect for differences arising from the specificities of ethnic, cultural, linguistic or 
religious identity. 
</p>
<p>23. Spain recognized that each country had its own traditional values, which might be 
distinct. However, it stressed that those values could not contradict or negate universal 
human rights which were inseparable from the human condition and totally independent of 
the region or State in which individuals resided. Although traditional values could have a 
positive impact on, develop aspects of and correspond with human rights, they did not 
operate on the same legal plane.  </p>


<p>24. Certain human rights are jus cogens as expressed by international consensus and 
reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on 
Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Traditional values 
should be acknowledged, but understood within the universal framework of human rights 
which cannot be circumvented. Differentiating human rights from traditional values, Spain 
stated that the latter applied at the community level, and the task of giving continuity to 
traditional values should fall upon such institutions as the family or the community. States 
had the obligation to respect and promote human rights and eliminate all obstacles to their 
effective and adequate promotion, which might, if necessary, include denial of traditional 
values that oppose human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. In Sri Lanka, several indigenous medical systems based on cultural expressions of 
traditional values and knowledge were practised by the local medical community across all 
ethnic groups. The rights of that community were protected and the traditional values they 
held well respected. 
</p>
<p>26. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that traditions and customs therein were based on 
the principles of and respect for human rights such as the right to life, justice, liberty, 
equality, education and dignity. By way of best practices, the contribution referred to 
respect towards and care of older persons and neighbours. Poor people and orphans were 
financially supported. Children were given good care and kindness. During the crisis, the 
country experienced solidarity among Syrian families, based on traditions and customs. 
Displaced families from all regions were received and hosted in the homes of relatives and 
neighbours.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p>27. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office of Colombia was of the view that the notion of traditional 
values and human rights was, amongst others, linked to cultural values, traditional customs, 
universal values and normative values and was therefore a complex issue. There was no 
agreed definition of the term &#8220;traditional values of humankind&#8221; which was somewhat 
</p>
<p>vague, subjective and unclear. Traditional values had both positive and negative effects. 
The latter could include forced marriages, domestic violence and rape, and female genital 
mutilation. Traditional values could be invoked to justify the status quo and undermine the 
rights of the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. However, traditional values 
were not static and their validity could be discovered by each generation.  
</p>
<p>28. The National Human Rights Institution of Georgia pointed out that Georgia had 
adopted a law on eradicating violence in the family, protecting and assisting victims of 
violence. However, traditional attitudes deeply rooted in the cultural context of stereotyped 
roles for women were of concern. These contributed to physical and psychological forms of 
coercion impairing the equal participation of women in family life. Many cases were not 
reported so as to uphold family honour and due to fear of segregation in the family and 
community. 
</p>
<p>29. Reference was made to the crucial role of human rights education in the promotion 
and protection of women&#8217;s rights. To that end, educational activities had been launched, 
involving different stakeholders like the Social Service Agency, the Council on Ethnic and 
Religious Minorities and religious communities. They included gender-sensitive training, 
the concept of &#8220;participatory action&#8221; and an action plan with activities to raise awareness on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and eradicate domestic violence. These programmes have led to a reduction 
of stereotyped attitudes toward women. 
</p>
<p>30. According to the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, by 
considering proposals in the drafting process, draft laws could be influenced and altered. </p>


<p>Article 55 of the Constitution of Ukraine enshrined the right of a person &#8220;to appeal for the 
</p>
<p>protection of his rights and freedoms to the relevant international judicial institutions or to 
the relevant bodies of international organizations of which Ukraine is a member or 
participant&#8221;. Ukraine has recognized the competence of the Human Rights Committee to 
review individual complaints of its citizens on violations of their rights.  
</p>
<p>31. The National Centre for Human Rights of Uzbekistan asserted that the protection of 
human rights should include development and strengthening of religious tolerance, respect 
and non-discrimination in relation to nationality and support and assistance to vulnerable 
groups, such as children, women and disabled, ill and older persons. The tradition of 
oriental hospitality, honesty and charity were supported by religious organizations. The 
Centre supported respect for the languages, customs and culture of different nationalities 
through 140 national cultural centres and special projects such as the Projects Foundation of 
Culture and Art of Uzbekistan &#8220;Asrlar sadosi&#8221;, and &#8220;Bazar-Art&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> C. United Nations agencies  
</b></p>
<p>32. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
East (UNRWA) stated that traditional values could be practically applied in the promotion 
and protection of human rights, particularly through human rights education. As the main 
provider of primary education in its five fields of operations, with 691 elementary and 
preparatory schools providing free basic education for nearly half a million Palestine 
refugee children, UNRWA made significant efforts to defining an approach to human rights 
education that addressed and incorporated traditional values. 
</p>
<p>33. The UNRWA Policy on Education for Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and 
Tolerance recognized the importance of a child&#8217;s cultural identity, language and values, and 
the national values of the country in which the child is living or from which he or she 
originates in accordance with article 29, paragraph 1 (c), of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. Through reference to that Convention, it was possible to demonstrate how human 
rights education and education on traditional values and related issues were 
complementary, and not mutually exclusive. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Academic institutions  
</b></p>
<p>34. The Instituto de Ciencias para el Matrimonio y la Familia, Universidad Cat&#243;lica 
Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, Peru, highlighted that situations such as higher rates of 
addictions, lack of respect for authority or neglect of elders visibly denied human dignity 
and respect and limited social development. That was rooted in the distortion of the concept 
of family, which was the foundation and reflection of society and which helped individuals 
to understand values and principles. Families founded on marriage played an important role 
for joint protection and integration as well as care for the disabled and the elderly. For that 
reason and to make beneficial progress, public policies with a family perspective should be 
applied, especially within the realm of human rights.  
</p>
<p>35. The institution of the family, and marriage between men and women and related 
rights have been protected in international instruments, including article 16 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, article 1 of the Convention on Consent to Marriage, 
Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration on Marriage, Article 23 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. At the regional level, Article VI of the American Declaration of the Rights and 
Duties of Man, Article 17 of the American Convention on Human Rights and Article 15 of </p>


<p>the San Salvador Protocol highlighted the role of the family as the natural and fundamental 
element of society in the development of the values of solidarity, respect and responsibility 
and in which, in particular, mothers and children, should be protected. 
</p>
<p>36. The Observatoire de la diversit&#233; et des droits culturels, Universit&#233; de Fribourg, Switzerland, in a joint contribution with the Centre interdisciplinaire sur les droits culturels 
de l&#8217;Universit&#233; de Nouakchott, Mauritania, addressed two traditions and traditional 
strategies of conflict resolution between individuals or ethnic groups, namely Dendiraagal 
and Molaare, where traditional values and old as well as new religious traditions enabled 
effective implementation of human rights in Mauritania. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Civil society organizations   
</b></p>
<p>37. Acci&#243;n Solidaria, Argentina, asserted that human life begins with conception. That 
idea constituted a traditional value in Argentina and many other countries, with the 
implication that rights of human embryos should be respected. The same position should 
also apply to embryos resulting from extracorporeal fertilization. Citing, amongst others, 
the National Academy of Medicine in Argentina, it pointed out several medical and 
scientific arguments to support the view that abortion was inacceptable.  
</p>
<p>38. Referring to conformity with natural law as well as the Roman <i>ius gentium</i>, Alliance 
Defending Freedom, United States, stated that rights and freedoms based on traditional 
values in the form of natural law could not be withdrawn without a violation, and 
conviction for such human rights violations was possible even in the absence of positive 
law. Natural law could not be bound to one culture at one particular place in time and found 
evidence in other traditions, such as the notion of &#8220;Tao&#8221; in classical Confucianism.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. This natural-law-based universality could be seen in the emphasis the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights placed on the family and its importance as a natural and 
fundamental unit of society. The institution of marriage was important, as it was based on 
the natural complementary nature of man and woman. Parents had the right to educate their 
children without interference by the State.  
</p>
<p>40. The Alliance of Romania&#8217;s Families, Romania, promoted the fundamental interests 
of the community, such as pro-family practices, pro-life policies and freedom of religion, 
conscience and expression. It emphasized the promotion of article 16, paragraph 3, of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, i.e. through supporting the role of family, fostering 
dialogue, mutual respect and an equal opportunity for input in the definition and 
determination of social norms in the global society, as a best practice to support human 
rights and freedoms through traditional values. The Alliance noted that both rights and 
obligations should be emphasized, in preference to highlighting only rights and freedoms. 
This was especially important in educating the younger generation.  
</p>
<p>41. Amnesty International asserted that an understanding of the complexity of the 
concept of &#8220;tradition&#8221; was essential to promote a better appreciation of the contribution of 
</p>
<p>traditional values in relation to human rights protection. Best practices should recognize 
that tradition and traditional values were contested and evolving, and that traditions that 
were not in line with human rights standards could be found in any culture, community or 
country. 
</p>
<p>42. Amnesty International noted that the Human Rights Council had appointed a Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, and best practices identified by that expert were 
highly relevant. The previous Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights had asserted </p>


<p>that &#8220;cultural rights are pivotal to the recognition and respect of human dignity&#8221; but not all 
cultural practices can be considered as protected in international human rights law, and 
cultural rights may be subject to limitations in certain circumstances1 as authorities may 
misuse their power to define the community&#8217;s traditional values in order to maintain the 
</p>
<p>status quo. The contribution noted that cultural norms, their outcomes, acceptance and 
legitimacy must be questioned in this context. 
</p>
<p>43. Arc International drew attention to its concerns about traditional values which could 
perpetuate widespread practices, traditions and patriarchal attitudes involving violence or 
coercion against women, such as family violence and abuse, forced marriage, dowry deaths, 
acid attacks and female circumcision as stated in general recommendation No. 19 (1992) on 
violence against women of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
had suggested guidelines to address the issue of culture and violence against women, 
including addressing factors that underlay and reinforced harmful cultural paradigms that 
subordinated women and recognizing that the protection of rights needed the transformation 
of cultural norms and attitudes. 
</p>
<p>44. Asociaci&#243;n de Familias Numerosas, Guatemala, was of the view that traditional 
values were common to all mankind and should be protected as part of human rights. 
Reference was made to the fundamental role of the family founded on the union between 
man and woman; traditional values for peaceful coexistence, and the importance of 
safeguarding the right to life. History had shown that the progress or decline of cultures was 
due primarily to the survival of traditional values. The defence of all human life, and the 
family as the source of traditional values and the foundation of society, was the first and 
most fundamental human right, and States must work to strengthen the family as society 
would not exist without the family. Traditional values were not negotiable and were 
important to the promotion of human rights, the protection of marriage and the defence of 
life from conception to natural death. 
</p>
<p>45. Association Points-C&#339;ur stated that respect for human dignity must always be 
considered as the highest goal and, while traditional values could and should contribute as 
in the following examples, they should never be invoked as ends in themselves but for the 
ends of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>46. Exemplifying dignity and solidarity, reference was made to a village called La 
Fazenda do Natal in Brazil where volunteers lived, for example, with mothers living in 
extreme poverty, street children or people with physical and mental disabilities. Those 
mothers were offered a possibility to live away from poverty, drugs and violence and 
enhance their ability to make decisions and take action to improve their lives. 
Responsibility was strengthened as people were not assisted, but fully participated in the 
life of La Fazenda<i>.</i> Solidarity was also highlighted through the project &#8220;Economy of the 
Communion&#8221; launched by the Catholic Focolare movement to eradicate poverty worldwide. 
Participants in the project &#8211; small and medium-sized enterprises &#8211; agreed to reinvest in the 
business to ensure its sustainability and employment opportunities, in community projects 
by and for people experiencing poverty, and in training projects to guide economic 
behaviour towards a solidarity economy. 
</p>
<p>47. With respect to the right to life and human dignity commencing at conception, the 
Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, United States, stated that prohibitions on 
abortion at all stages of gestation should be encouraged. The key role of the family, 
composed of a mother and a father, was found in the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Statement made to the fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council.  </p>


<p>Rights and the International Covenants on human rights. Given that the natural family in 
fact played a pivotal role in education and transmitting the core values that underpinned the 
human rights project and established stability and prosperity, in order to progressively 
implement all human rights, the natural family and children should be protected through 
family laws.  
</p>
<p>48. The Christian Family Movement, Panama, citing examples, stressed the importance 
and the fundamental values of the right to life and family and the protection thereof. Those 
values were common to every country. States in the United Nations system had their own 
values, and tolerance within that system signified that no supervision was needed, since 
freedom was achieved when human beings lived according to well-grounded values.  
</p>
<p>49.  Catholics for Choice, United States, to shape and advance sexual and reproductive 
ethics based on justice, reflected a commitment to women&#8217;s well-being, and affirmed the 
capacity of women and men to make moral decisions. For many Catholics, the teachings of 
the Church served as moral and spiritual guides. Owing to their ancient roots, these could 
be considered as traditional values of humankind. Policymakers must not only respect 
freedom of religion and religious pluralism, but also ensure that religion was not used to 
discriminate. As opposing views were common in issues of sexuality and reproductive 
health, for example with regard to the use of contraceptives and the discord between certain 
traditional beliefs and the recognition of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
persons (LGBT), Catholic teachings instructed not to allow religion to be used to 
discriminate.  
</p>
<p>50. Concerned Women for America, United States, emphasized the role of marriage, 
family and civil society in preserving human rights. Unwarranted changes in family 
structures, which were profoundly reshaping our postmodern society especially in Europe, 
were threatening the human rights and dignity of citizens. Cohabitation, which was 
increasingly displacing marriage and not promoting healthy, stable and lasting 
relationships, was an example. Promiscuity, infidelity and diminishing trust between 
couples, further incentivized by divorce law and same-sex marriage, endangered the 
foundation of traditional family values. The consequences of the decline in marriage and 
breakdown of the family had not only negatively affected generations of individuals on a 
personal level but also undermined social institutions, shaken the stability of nations and 
basic human dignity and rights.  
</p>
<p>51. The Contemporary Foundation, Argentina, stated that human dignity and human 
rights must be entirely protected as they were indivisible. Traditional values shared by all 
humankind went beyond traditions and customs and were rooted in the essence of all 
human beings. While practices and customs were valued differently in different traditions, 
human values would always be compatible with human rights as both emanated from the 
same source. Values which went against human dignity were not part of those human 
values. 
</p>
<p>52. Fundaci&#243;n Amando La Vida, Colombia, asserted the importance of the right to life, 
liberty and security of the person, which were fundamental to the exercise of other human 
rights. State laws, public policies, development plans and the adoption of measures which 
respect the right to life and to a family as universal values were important for the protection 
of human rights. The foundation considered motherhood not only to be a unique 
opportunity for women but also indispensable for a sustainable society. Pregnant women 
and unborn children must be protected. </p>
<p>53. Fundaci&#243;n S&#237; a la Vida, El Salvador,<b> </b>asserted that the right to life and family, 
consisting of a father, a mother and children, were universal values that promoted and 
facilitated the understanding and implementation of human rights. The right to life, 
protected by article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, started from the </p>


<p>moment of conception, even in cases of unexpected pregnancies. It was recommended that 
States should initiate policies that promoted respect for the right to life of every individual 
from conception to natural death and start campaigns to promote awareness to protect 
human life at every stage. Sexual and reproductive rights should thus not be defined as 
including the right to abortion. States should invest in providing better health care and 
prenatal health care to women. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. Fundaci&#243;n Tekota, Mexico, underlined the essential value of people and family and 
referred to its work to promote a culture of peace, and the values of life and family, 
fundamental elements of society.  
</p>
<p>55. Global Helping to Advance Women and Children stated that the Human Rights 
Council Advisory Committee should make more effort to identify traditional values which 
were common to all cultures and civilizations, and stressed their role in developing and 
promoting human rights. It drew attention to two universal traditional values that had not 
been sufficiently raised in the preliminary study &#8211; the family as the natural and fundamental 
group unit of society, and the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education to be 
given to their children. 
</p>
<p>56. The Advisory Committee should highlight the positive linkages between protecting 
the family, protecting parental rights and the dignity, welfare and rights of children. It 
should identify appropriate positive measures to help States strengthen the role of the 
family in promoting respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>57. Human Life International, Guatemala, found that traditional values were common to 
all mankind and were necessary to effectively protect universal human rights. It was 
necessary to protect the family and the right to life from the moment of conception until 
natural death as these were the most fundamental and universal human rights. The family, 
the foundation of society and traditional values provided the basis for peaceful coexistence, 
true integration and social cohesion. 
</p>
<p>58. Human Life International and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children 
stated that the Human Rights Council resolution calling for the present report engendered 
controversy stemming from semantic and philosophical issues. The resolution suggested a 
strategy which was pragmatic and applicable to a broad spectrum of beliefs, provided a 
useful methodology for recognition of universal rights to diminish conflict and partisanship.  
</p>
<p>59. It was proposed that values were the understanding and the promotion of what was 
good or inherently good rather than specific customs and practices which may become 
codified or appear as traditions. While values are universal to humankind, those which 
might violate human rights were not acceptable to humankind as a whole. Traditional 
values were therefore to be defined as &#8220;good things&#8221; enduring in the nature of people and 
independent of political or social structures. That clarified the assertion that traditional 
values underpinned human rights. 
</p>
<p>60. Human Rights Watch, United Kingdom, criticized the concept of the universality of 
human rights and values imposed upon the rest of the world by particular States or 
coalitions of States, especially in the context of the invasion of Iraq and the alleged global 
war on terror. It appreciated the notion of &#8220;traditional values of humankind&#8221; as that 
connected human rights to the broader context of humanitarianism reflecting the values of 
goodness, empathy, respect, care, mutual support, tolerance and trust. Those values were 
the entry point for a human rights discourse to evolve but without the immediate reliance 
upon a concept of rights and obligations to protect and reliance upon economic indicators 
or real coercion. Reference was made to the role of civil society in all communities or 
States which sought to endorse and live by the fundamental values of humankind. </p>


<p>61. Instituto Uruguayo de Formaci&#243;n Familiar, Uruguay,<b> </b>pointed out that human dignity 
was promoted through strengthening universal values which provided the stability for a 
family of free citizens. It recommended the protection of the fundamental right to decent 
work which allowed the formation and maintenance of a stable family as well as to insist on 
achieving well-being of individuals and society through prosperity of the conjugal and 
family community.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. The International Service for Human Rights was guided by the existing United 
Nations understanding that the traditional values of humankind were those enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that the latter represented a concerted effort to 
identify values common to all humankind. Focusing on the promotion of the universal 
values of humankind through human rights education, the universal values contained in the 
Declaration and the principles of non-discrimination, equality and universality should guide 
the framework in which particular attention is paid to marginalized and minority groups. 
Those groups should be empowered to overcome negative traditional power structures, 
practices, and values. 
</p>
<p>63. KELIN, Kenya, stated that, although women in Kenya had statutory rights to own 
property, those rights were rarely upheld due to a patriarchal system, and resulted in 
economic dependence of women on men or disinheritance. That also had effects on 
women&#8217;s ability to negotiate the terms of sex, fidelity and condom use and, thus, HIV-
prevention mechanisms and the highest attainable standard of health in general. In this 
context the KELIN Cultural Structures Project and the Constitution of Kenya 2010, 
especially article 44 (3), upholding the rights of women to own and inherit property and not 
to be discriminated against on grounds of cultural practices, were pertinent.  
</p>
<p>64. Association Relwend&#233; pour le D&#233;veloppement, Burkina Faso,<b> </b>pointed to several 
projects aimed at safeguarding the rights of women, children and disabled persons. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. Natural Justice, South Africa, &#8211; working against harmful traditional values and 
practices that were inconsistent with human rights by ensuring the representation of women 
and youth in all meetings and at all stages &#8211; described how community protocols, a 
participatory tool for empowering indigenous peoples and local communities, promoted 
human rights and fundamental freedoms through the enhancement of traditional values. 
</p>
<p>66. The Khwe community was vulnerable, having lost most of its knowledge of 
sustainable use and management of the natural resources within Bwabwata National Park 
and owing to lack of intergenerational transfer of traditional knowledge. Community 
protocols played a key role with particular regard to affirming the dignity of the 
community, and upholding and enhancing traditional community values like healing, 
respect and sustainable use of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>67. Nazra for Feminist Studies, Egypt, pointed to the history of the use of traditional 
values to undermine the rights of women human rights defenders in Egypt, as the violations 
were based largely on traditional, patriarchal values regarding what it meant to be a 
respectable woman. The contribution provided examples of traditional and religious values 
creating a particularly precarious situation for women in several instances. Reference was 
made to violations against women&#8217;s rights defenders and the use of traditional, religious 
values as a pretext to justify grave violations including sexual harassment. 
</p>
<p>68. The Peoples&#8217; Welfare and Development Society, India, stated that all traditional 
values, also enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other instruments, 
were based on respect and care of parents, women and help for the poor and deprived and 
were not related to any particular religion. Variations in traditional values and customs 
could occur due to change in perceptions over time. The Society underlined the positive 
contribution of traditional values such as faith, cooperation, simplicity and mutual respect 
on happiness, development, the environment, respect towards older persons, children and </p>


<p>women and the fight against human rights violations. Education from an early age played a 
key role in nurturing those positive contributions.  
</p>
<p>69. The Regional and National Human Rights Defender Programme held  the view that 
dignity, justice, equality and non-discrimination were common to humanity, that States had 
the primary responsibility to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms by 
respecting, protecting, and fulfilling them, and that human rights could not be limited or 
violated invoking &#8220;traditional values&#8221;. Although some traditions complied with human 
rights standards, it was noted that neither customary international law nor the core 
international human rights treaties permitted or envisaged limitations on human rights on 
the basis of traditional values. 
</p>
<p>70. Best practices in the promotion of rights and freedoms required encouraging, 
understanding and accepting the principles of universality and indivisibility of human 
rights, non-discrimination in the enjoyment of rights, and fairness and equality in efforts to 
ensure and implement those rights. The protection of human rights defenders, including 
women defenders, should be at the centre of all debates on human rights and their 
promotion.  
</p>
<p>71. The Russian LGBT Network, Russian Federation, noted that the traditional values 
discussion in the Russian Federation sought to impose an ideological monopoly. Liberal 
approaches and beliefs were regarded by conservatives as opposing traditional values, 
justifying severe restrictions of rights and freedoms, especially for the LGBT community. 
In that context, traditional values were synonymous with biblical values such as family 
values and served as a platform to bring together Orthodox Christian conservatives, 
Protestant fundamentalists and conservative Catholics. 
</p>
<p>72. Enumerating several practices based on traditional values, the Russian LGBT 
Network referred to the introduction of religious education in public schools through  the 
subject named &#8220;Basics of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics&#8221; in 1991; the division of 
religions into the traditional religions of the Russian Federation &#8211; Christianity: Orthodox 
Christianity, Catholicism, Lutheranism; Islam; Judaism; and Buddhism and &#8220;sects&#8221; or 
&#8220;totalitarian sects&#8221;, i.e. all religious associations not fitting into the concept of traditional 
</p>
<p>religions; efforts to obstruct liberal priests and opinions within the Moscow Patriarchate; 
the introduction of a military chaplain system; and the ban on sex education in Russian 
schools.  
</p>
<p>73. Rwanda Culture, Rwanda, stated that cultural values such as fairness, tolerance and 
generosity, which were defined as religious, moral and cultural benchmarks, had for long 
been regarded as the pillars of the country&#8217;s development, regulating the conduct and 
behaviour of every member of the community. The organization highlighted strategies 
implemented by the Government, including laws, infrastructure and policies for the 
promotion and protection of culture, language and art. 
</p>
<p>74. As best practices, it referred to the legal promotion and protection of traditions and 
culture guaranteed by articles 50 and 51 of the Constitution of Rwanda. The State also had 
a duty to ensure the conservation of cultural heritage and national memorials and sites of 
genocide against the Tutsi. Law No. 01/2010 of 29 January 2010 on the mission, 
organization and functioning of the Rwandan Language and Culture Academy, provided for 
the Academy&#8217;s responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the language, Kinyarwanda, 
and the culture.  
</p>
<p>75. Sexual Rights Initiative, Canada, asserted that some traditional values led to 
stigmatization, discrimination and violence against people on the basis of their racial or 
ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, disability status, age, sex, gender identity or sexual 
orientation. Many practices and norms that discriminated against women and other groups 
were justified by reference to tradition and were legally punished with lighter sentences, for </p>


<p>example domestic violence, honour killings, dowry-related violence and homophobic 
discrimination and violence. Many countries did not specifically designate marital rape as a 
crime and only some included dowry-related violence in their law. Following the good 
example already set by some countries, the Sexual Rights Initiative proposed capacity-
building and that States should enact and implement laws, policies and programmes that 
prevented and penalized harmful traditional practices. It suggested media campaigns as a 
means of raising awareness and educating communities about the harmful effect of 
traditional values and practices and the benefits of promoting the rights of those affected by 
such practices. Proposed practices also included increased support for national and 
community-based monitoring mechanisms and the exchange of good practices. 
</p>
<p>76. Referring to &#8220;traditional values&#8221; as a basis for promoting human rights could 
jeopardize progress in ensuring the enjoyment of rights by all. Values reflected in traditions 
may or may not promote and protect the globally shared values adopted by States through 
human rights conventions.  
</p>
<p>77. The Good Shepherd, Plurinational State of Bolivia,<b> </b>pointed to good practices in the 
work of the &#8220;Women Stand Up&#8221; Foundation in the country. The office in La Paz reported 
the issue of human trafficking and the success of supporting several adolescent victims of 
trafficking. The measures comprised, amongst others, the provision of shelter and 
protection. An economic justice project in Oruro offered training workshops contributing to 
the empowerment of women, socioeconomic autonomy and security and gender equality.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>78. Vida y Familia Chihuahua A.C<i>.</i>, Mexico stated that traditional values common to all 
humankind such as the role of the family, community and education had a positive role in 
the protection and promotion of rights and freedoms. Traditional, moral values were thus 
inseparable from human rights based on dignity and inherent values of the human being. 
</p>
<p>79. Marriage should be understood as the union between man and woman. For its 
crucial role in addressing issues such as violence, underdevelopment or unemployment, it 
was noted that the recognition of family law which also encompassed the protection of 
marriage and family life was of fundamental importance for education on and the 
promotion of dignity and human rights in the whole legal system. The family should not 
only be protected by the State but also by society, necessitating a strong commitment from 
each individual. 
</p>
<p>80. Voto Cat&#243;lico Colombia, stated that in Colombia traditional values were the product 
of Catholic culture, and implied the promotion of human dignity, family and freedom of 
conscience. The application of human rights which did not result from traditional values 
would be an imposition of values alien to the system, forced on a society by foreign 
powers, for instance through treaties, conventions and constitutions. 
</p>
<p>81. Voz P&#250;blica A.C., Mexico, stressed the importance of respect for fundamental 
human rights shared by all human beings, from conception until death without exceptions 
such as individual autonomy. Regarding best practices, this contribution underlined the 
need to protect and promote the institution of the natural family between man and woman 
as a universal right in all countries and to oppose social reinventions of the concept.  
</p>
<p>82. Women for Development, Russian Federation<b>, </b>stated that the republic of Chechnya 
was an example of a traditional patriarchal society where the customary, unwritten law 
(<i>Adat</i>), was practised alongside the Russian Constitution and Sharia law was influential in 
many issues. Archaic traditions had led to increasing censorship and other violations of 
women&#8217;s rights. In conflict situations, women did not participate in discussions and were 
</p>
<p>not involved in decision-making. In cases of divorce, women could not keep their children, 
in contradiction with the Russian Constitution and Islamic law. The lack of rights was also 
portrayed in inheritance and property laws.  </p>


<p><b> III. Analysis and conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Several respondents found that some traditional values were closely related to 
human dignity and human rights, provided the basis and background of universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, and supported their promotion and protection. Examples were provided as 
</b></p>
<p><b>best practices in the application of traditional values while promoting and protecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and upholding human dignity by both States and other stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Some respondents were of the view that traditional values could be invoked to 
justify the status quo and undermine the rights of the most marginalized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged groups. They noted that traditional values were at times misused to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justify human rights violations especially with regard to freedom of belief</b>, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. It was underlined by many that 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional values could never be used to justify violations of universal human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>or as a basis for discrimination in any form. 
</b></p>
