regime was accompanied by Croatia&#8217;s declaration of independence from the Socialist

one third of the Croatian territory. On 15 January 1992, Croatia&#8217;s independence was

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
undertook an official visit to the Republic of Croatia from 5 to 13 July 2010. The main 
purpose of the mission was to examine the realization of the right to adequate housing in 
the country, including the relevant institutional, policy and legal frameworks, in particular 
in relation to post-conflict housing reconstruction and restitution, privatization of socially 
owned housing during the transition from a State-run to a market economy, and the rights 
of vulnerable groups, including refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), minorities, 
low-income, and young people. In the course of her mission, the Special Rapporteur 
identified a number of additional issues affecting the right to adequate housing that will be 
developed in the present report. 
</p>
<p>2. In addition to Zagreb, the Special Rapporteur visited Knin, Kistanje, Zadar, Plitvice 
region, Osijek and Vukovar as well as numerous villages in those regions. During her visit, 
the Special Rapporteur met with high ranking officials and representatives of national and 
local government, international agencies as well as non-governmental organizations. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with former and current refugees, internally displaced people, 
settlers, returnees, minority groups and other people living in Croatia.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her warm gratitude to the Government of Croatia 
for the invitation, the constructive dialogue and openness, its support and provision of 
relevant information throughout and after the visit and its commitment to progressing in the 
implementation of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General overview  
</b></p>
<p>4. The current housing situation in Croatia is strongly shaped by a complex 
combination of two factors: the effects of the armed conflict on housing and the transition 
from a State-run to a market-oriented approach to housing. In addition, the economic 
recession in the country has posed additional challenges to the already difficult housing 
situation.  
</p>

</p>
<p>Lika, Kordun and the Knin region, and the creation of the so-called &#8220;Republic of Serbian 
Krajina&#8221; (hereinafter Krajina) in Croatia, led to over 220,000 ethnic Croat refugees fleeing 
these Serb-controlled territories to other areas of the country. After &#8220;Operation Storm&#8221; in 
1995, the Croatian Army regained control of most of these territories leading to the 
displacement of some 300,000 ethnic Serbs, primarily to the then Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and also to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to eastern Slavonia where Serbs 
remained in control until the Erdut Agreement of 1995 set out the peaceful reintegration of 
this territory into Croatia.2 During this period, numerous ethnic Croats escaping from the 
war in Bosnia and Herzegovina arrived in Croatia and settled in the areas where Croatia had 
retaken control. They were mostly accommodated in the properties abandoned by the ethnic 
Serbs who had been forced to flee the region upon the defeat of the Krajina. At the end of 
the war, approximately 250,000 people were displaced within Croatia, 32,000 of whom 
were ethnic Serbs.<footnote name="3">IDMC, Croatia: Housing rights and employment still preventing durable solutions, p.1. </footnote>   
</p>
<p>8. The destruction of housing stock and infrastructure as a result of the war and the 
number of displaced persons and refugees caused significant difficulties in the access to 
adequate housing in Croatia. Since then, the Government of Croatia has made immense 
efforts to reconstruct damaged houses, restitute occupied private property, attract ethnic 
Croats who fled hostilities from other parts of former Yugoslavia to depopulated areas, and 
more recently to prepare the ground for the return of Croat refugees from abroad. Despite 
the achievements, the housing situation of numerous families affected by the war still 
remains unresolved and precarious.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition to the war, the transition from a socialist regime to a capitalist one posed 
additional challenges to the access to adequate housing in Croatia. During the socialist 
regime, public housing was a priority and most of the housing sector was organized under 
the system of socially owned housing. In the early 1990s, deregulation, privatization, and 
strengthening of free market relations were the characteristics of Croatian housing policy. 
Croatia embarked itself on the privatization of socially owned property in 1991. The 
holders of occupancy rights of socially owned apartments were allowed to purchase their 
apartments and the remaining occupancy rights were transformed into lease agreements. 
However, the complex legal framework stemming from the transition process entailed the 
loss of rights for many categories of former &#8220;occupancy tenancy&#8221; right-holders, which 
seriously affected their security of tenure and living conditions for years to come.  
</p>
<p>10. The impact of the armed conflict and the transition to a market economy on the 
housing situation in Croatia became all the more complex as a result of the cumbersome 
and inconsistent legal framework adopted in response to these changes, as well as the 
administrative inefficiencies and the sometimes discretionary application of the new 
regulations. 
</p>
<p>11. Although it was one of the most developed Yugoslav republics prior to 1991, 
Croatia&#8217;s economy suffered during the war and did not regain steady growth until 2000. 
Between 2000 and 2007, the economy enjoyed moderate growth and relative stability.  
However, Croatia still suffers from high unemployment and uneven regional development. 
More recently, the impact of the global financial crisis has been felt across all segments of 
Croatia&#8217;s economy and has deeply affected the housing sector. The economic situation and 
uneven regional development have resulted in further challenges to Croatia&#8217;s complex 
housing situation.

<p><b> III. Security of tenure for holders of occupancy tenancy rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Occupancy tenancy rights in a historical perspective  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Occupancy tenancy rights during the socialist regime 
</b></p>
<p>12. Prior to 1991, occupants of socially owned dwellings had very strongly protected 
tenancy rights (better known as occupancy tenancy rights or OTR), including the right to 
live in their dwelling indefinitely and to transfer this right to direct family members. The 
system of occupancy tenancy rights emerged alongside the former Yugoslavia transition 
into a socialist self-managed economic system and presupposed the collective ownership 
and use of housing stock by the whole society. Socially-owned property was the product of 
either housing that became State-owned following the nationalization of private property 
after the Second World War, or properties that were State-built and owned. The 
Constitution of the former Yugoslavia had defined tenancy rights as family, social and 
property-related rights. The rights acquired by an OTR holder would guarantee the 
permanent use of residential property in order to satisfy personal and family housing needs. 
In 1971 and 1973, the Supreme Court of Croatia indeed ruled that acquired privileges, such 
as tenancy rights, had  equal status in law as property rights.<footnote name="4">7. The process of repossession lasted over a decade due to administrative obstruction 
and the fact that the relevant laws gave precedence to the rights of temporary occupants 
(mainly ethnic Croats) over those of the original owners (mainly ethnic Serbs). The process 
is now almost complete: out of the 19,280 private homes occupied during the war, 19,258 
were repossessed by returnees and IDPs to this day. The remaining 22 cases are still 
pending before Croatian courts.26  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>13. Tenancy rights were not acquired as a result of a universal social benefit but were 
based on personal financial contributions into a common housing fund by those who were 
granted tenancy rights. Obligatory housing-fund contributions were deducted from monthly 
salaries. People were not allowed to purchase or sell a socially owned apartment, but they 
acquired the right to occupy socially owned apartments in perpetuity through their 
contributions to the housing funds. Tenancy rights were also inheritable in perpetuity by 
members of the family of a deceased tenancy holder. Although OTR holders could not sell 
their apartments, they could exchange them for others.5 
</p>
<p>14. The rights and duties of OTR holders were generally regulated by the Law on 
Housing Relations, the last version of which was adopted in 1985. This law remained in 
force after Croatia gained independence and established the general conditions for the 
acquisition, use and termination of occupancy rights over apartments. Alongside a number 
of other grounds for the termination of occupancy rights, the Law stipulated in articles 95 to 
99 that if the OTR holder and family members ceased to use the apartment for a period 
longer than six months without a valid reason, the occupancy right would be terminated. In 
this case, the competent disposal right-holders, i.e. socially owned enterprises, other non-
economic institutions or municipalities, had to initiate a lawsuit in order to revoke the 
occupancy right. The initial intent of this provision was the intervention of the State in 
cases of unjustified non-use of an apartment by an occupancy right holder. Although this 
provision was not meant as a tool for the cancellation of occupancy rights during the war 
period, it was later primarily used as such.  
</p>
<p><b>  Occupancy tenancy rights in the context of privatization and war 
</b></p>
<p>15. After 1991, the situation for OTR holders dramatically changed. A process of 
transformation of occupancy tenancy rights into ownership rights began that year as part of 
the widespread privatization and liberalization of the housing sector. In this context, most 
tenants were allowed to convert their tenancy rights into full ownership of their flats.

</p>
<p>16. Upon the adoption of the 1992 Law on the Sale of Apartments with Tenancy Rights 
(<i>Official Gazette</i> 43/1992), tenancy right holders were given the right to buy socially owned 
apartments at favourable rates as a form of recognition for the contributions made during 
the previous regime into housing funds. However, persons without Croatian citizenship, 
such as many who were not ethnic Croats, did not benefit from this law. Together with 
them, several other categories of OTR holders were prevented from purchasing their flats, 
including persons who lost their OTR after abandoning their flats during the war, occupants 
of former federal army apartments, and occupants of nominally owned privatized 
apartments, as explained in detail in the following section. 
</p>
<p>17. The concept of occupancy tenancy rights was abolished in 1996 and those who had 
not been able to convert their tenancy rights into full ownership either lost all rights in 
relation to their flats or were converted into &#8220;protected renters&#8221; with fewer rights and 
safeguards than those enjoyed in the previous regime.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Deprivation of occupancy tenancy rights during the war  
</b></p>
<p>18. After 1991, the expulsion of Croats from the region of the Krajina resulted in a first 
mass arrival of displaced persons in Croatia. Upon the collapse of the Krajina in mid-1995, 
the majority of ethnic Serbs left this area for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the 
parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina under control of Bosnian Serbs. At the same time, 
numerous Croats, mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina, arrived in the areas where Croatia 
retook control. 
</p>
<p>19. After the mass flight of the Serbian civilian population, an urgent issue for the 
Government of Croatia was to administer the enormous quantity of abandoned residential 
property and temporarily allocate these to displaced persons in need of housing. This was 
officially declared as one of the Government&#8217;s main objectives, and a series of different 
laws were adopted in the war and post war-period to achieve this purpose. However, in 
practice such legitimate policies threatened the existing occupancy and ownership rights of 
ethnic Serbs. 
</p>
<p>20. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) estimates that 
approximately 100,000 individuals, mostly ethnic Serb refugees and displaced persons 
fleeing urban areas in Croatia, lost their tenancy rights between 1991 and 1995.<footnote name="6">9. Some return areas still lag behind in basic infrastructure services. Infrastructure such 
as electrical networks, water supply systems and road maintenance has proven insufficient 
in some of the villages with minority returnees. In recent years, the Government has shown 
political will to improve the electrical infrastructure in Serb villages, and progress has been 
made in a number of them. However, this progress needs to be sustained and more work 
needs to be done to improve water supply systems and road conditions.<footnote name="4">6. In 2001, the Government of Croatia officially announced its commitment to 
accelerate and conclude the process of repossession of all occupied property.25 This 
commitment was to be implemented through an Action Plan, which was set to implement a 
number of concrete measures to settle this complex issue. The Government of Croatia also 
proclaimed its commitment to provide individual measures for temporary occupants of 
private property.  
</footnote>3 
</footnote> Most OTR 
holders, who had left their place of residence during the war, lost the tenancy rights on the 
grounds of prolonged absence during the war. The Government estimates that 
approximately 20,000 people lost their occupancy rights due to war-related absence alone. 
In most cases, court proceedings were based on the provisions for cancellation of rights of 
articles 95 to 99 of the previously mentioned Law on Housing Relations. Although the law 
stipulates the termination of rights after six months of absence when there is not a valid 
reason, the fact that occupants have abandoned their homes under duress (e.g. risk of death 
and injury, threats against personal safety and forced evictions by military officials) was not 
taken into account in court proceedings. Indeed, the Supreme Court&#8217;s jurisprudence held 
that war events as such did not justify the non-use of a housing unit. In most cases, OTR 
holders were not present when their rights were terminated.  
</p>
<p>21. Another form in which OTR holders, mostly ethnic Serbs7, lost their homes during 
the war relates to the illegal occupation of housing units by settlers. In addition to the Law 
</p>
<p>  
 6 European Council on Refugees and Exiles, Serb Refugees: Forgotten by Croatia, 2010. 
 7 The Government estimates that ethnic Serbs represent 65 per cent of former tenancy rights holders 
</p>
<p>whose tenancy rights were terminated and who are currently beneficiaries of the housing programme  
designed especially for them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>on Housing Relations, in 1991 Croatia adopted the Law on Temporary Use of Apartments 
which specified that apartments abandoned by occupancy right holders fell under the 
temporary administration of the Republic of Croatia, in order to provide accommodation to 
the growing number of displaced persons coming to Croatia.8 Apartments were granted for 
temporary use for a period of one year or more. This law aimed at the temporary 
administration of abandoned apartments, with a view to returning the property to the 
legitimate holder once the emergency was over. The transfer of the occupancy right to the 
temporary user was explicitly precluded and the temporary user had to return the apartment 
to the legitimate titleholder upon expiry of the period for temporary use.9  
</p>
<p>22. Further deterioration of occupancy rights occurred with the enactment of the Law on 
Lease of Flats in Liberated Territories in 1995.10 This law allowed for a large-scale 
permanent revocation of occupancy rights in the territory of the &#8220;Krajina&#8221; upon the date it 
fell under the control of Croatia. Pursuant to this law, occupancy rights ceased to exist if the 
occupancy right holder had not used the apartment for more than 90 days after the law had 
come into force.11 This short deadline made it virtually impossible for Serb occupancy right 
holders -- who had fled the region immediately after the defeat of the &#8220;Krajina&#8221; and could 
not return until many years later -- to maintain their titles. Furthermore, in contrast to the 
termination of occupancy right pursuant to the Law on Housing Relations, which required a 
respective court decision after a judicial proceeding, the Law on Lease of Flats in Liberated 
Territories introduced the termination of the occupancy right ex lege, i.e. without any 
further administrative or judicial decision. 
</p>
<p>23. A further layer of dispossession of tenancy rights was created in 1996 when the Law 
on Areas of Special State Concern (<i>Official Gazette</i>, No. 44/1996) was adopted establishing 
a specific regime for conflict-affected areas. Under this law, in conjunction with the Act on 
Temporary Takeover and Administration of Certain Properties and related ordinances, the 
Government took temporary administration of abandoned property and assumed 
responsibility for the protection of such property. The Law on Areas of Special State 
Concern provided for the temporary allocation of abandoned apartments in these areas to 
Croat refugees coming from other parts of the former Yugoslavia. In this case, after 10  
years of possession, settlers were allowed to become owners of the occupied housing unit.  
</p>
<p>24. The dispossession of occupancy rights of refugees, IDPs and returnees has been, 
together with the destruction of houses, one of the main housing challenges of post-war 
Croatia. From 2000 onwards, the Government has adopted a number of measures to 
respond to this need, with uneven success. A housing care programme was implemented to 
provide housing options to disposed OTR holders affected by the war. Although the 
programme has been rather successful, numerous applications remain unresolved. On the 
other hand, the repossession of illegally occupied property took several years to unravel, is 
almost completed now. A major outstanding issue is the reintegration, through restitution or 
compensation for lost property, of refugees still living in neighbouring countries. A more 
detailed analysis of these measures and their impact on the access to housing of refugees, 
returnees and IDPs is included below.

</p>
<p><b> C. Occupants of military dwellings 
</b></p>
<p>25. In addition to the difficulties endured by OTR holders who abandoned their houses 
during the war, the armed conflict necessarily included the loss of rights of occupants to  
military apartments. Upon adoption of the Law on Amendments to the Law on Sale of the 
Apartments on Which Tenancy Right Exist, in 1995 (<i>Official Gazette</i> No. 58/95), 
provisions were made for the sale of flats which had become State-owned under decrees 
relating to the repossession of apartments and other properties belonging to the army of the 
former Yugoslavia. Amongst other categories, the purchase of apartments was not allowed 
to those participating in hostilities against the Republic of Croatia. Evictions of tenants of 
apartments belonging to the Yugoslav National Army became frequent as a consequence of 
the application of article 94 of the Law on Housing Relations, which authorized the eviction 
of anyone who had moved into an apartment lacking valid legal grounds. The apartments 
were then often allocated to members of the Croatian Army who, under the Law on 
Temporary use of Apartments (<i>Official Gazette</i> No. 66/91), were subsequently allowed to 
purchase the property. Article 94 was later revoked by a decision of the Constitutional 
Court of 20 November 1996.12 
</p>
<p><b> D. Occupants of nominally owned and confiscated property 
</b></p>
<p>26. As part of the privatization of the housing sector initiative in 1991, occupancy right 
holders were given the possibility to transform their occupancy rights into full ownership 
by purchasing their flats on very favourable terms. However, occupants of nominally 
owned privatized apartments (flats with nominal owners) were denied the right to purchase 
their homes at favourable rates, although their tenancy rights had not been abrogated. 
Occupancy rights were abolished in 1996 and OTR holders who could not purchase their 
apartments, had their properties transformed into protected leases, or lost their OTRs. 
</p>
<p>27. In 1996, the Croatian Parliament adopted the Law on Lease of Apartments (<i>Official 
Gazette </i>No. 91/96), which deprived occupants of nominally-owned privatized apartments 
of their right to occupy such apartments in perpetuity. Nominal owners who wanted to re-
occupy their apartments were allowed to do so, but were obliged to provide alternative 
accommodation to the occupant. The Law on Lease of Apartments in practice abolished 
tenancy rights to apartments in nominally private ownership. With the abrogation of these 
rights, the relationship between the nominal owner and the occupant became one between a 
lessor and a protected lessee, degrading former OTR holders to the status of a protected 
tenant with fewer rights and protections. Since 1998, nominal owners have no longer been 
required to provide suitable alternative accommodation, further weakening security of 
tenure of protected lessees.  
</p>
<p>28. As already indicated, occupants of nominally owned privatized apartments could not 
purchase their flats on favourable conditions, thus being effectively discriminated against. 
In addition, their right to resolve their household problems by exchanging their flats with 
other OTR holders in practice could not be realized. Accordingly, they were forced to 
remain in the same apartment regardless of the family situation, such as children growing 
up and needing a new home to live, or couples needing a bigger apartment when enlarging 
their family. Moreover, it has been brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention that to 
allow a new member of the family to live in the leased apartment, occupants are required to

<p>seek permission from the nominal owner. Unlike other OTR holders, protected tenants are 
also not allowed to perform any business activity in their flats or to own a vacant house 
anywhere in the territory of Croatia. 
</p>
<p>29. The Law on Lease of Apartments further affects the security of tenure of tenants 
since the nominal owner has the right to demand the eviction of a tenant. A protected tenant 
pays a State-controlled rent prescribed by law. However, rents for occupants of nominally 
owned apartments increased 60 per cent in 2005. Former tenants are now threatened with 
evictions, which are taking place with increasing regularity.13 
</p>
<p>30. Another complex situation is that of occupants of confiscated apartments. According 
to article 22 of the Law on Denationalization, private apartments that had been nationalized 
in the former Yugoslavia may not be returned to the original owners if OTR holders are 
living in them, however, the original owners were entitled to compensation. During the 
privatization process, occupants of nationalized apartments were given the possibility to 
purchase the property under the same favourable conditions offered to occupants of social 
or state-owned apartments. A different situation was that of occupants of confiscated 
apartments. Since confiscation, which mostly took place during the Second World War, 
was the result of individual decisions and not of a law formalizing the transfer of property, 
occupants of confiscated flats were not allowed to purchase their flats. While during the 
socialist regime no differences were made with regards to the origin of the apartment to be 
allocated to each tenant and all occupants had equal rights to their flats, those differences 
played a significant role in the rights afforded to each category of occupant during the 
privatization process, and impacted on the access to housing of each group.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Land registration 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the socialist regime, land titling was not a common practice in many areas. 
Official land records were not commonly available and people were not used to inscribing 
ownership to their land. After the war, a new set of regulations were adopted and a new 
organization of land tenure was set up whereby titling of land became vital.  As occupants 
could not show any titles for their land, they could not prove ownership or apply to the 
programmes for housing reconstruction, property restitution and housing care adopted by 
the Government after the war. This created a new level of difficulty in people&#8217;s access to 
housing.  
</p>
<p>32. A further conflict emerged as a direct consequence of the war whereby ethnic Croats 
took over the land of absent local Serbs, either with the authorization of local authorities (as 
for example the Commission for Temporary Takeover and Administration of Abandoned 
Properties in Benkovac Municipality) or without permission. Based on the national Law on 
Takeover of Specified Property of 1995, the authorizations to use the land were issued to 
Croat settlers and refugees for a period of eight years, in the same way in which abandoned 
Serb houses were allocated to temporary occupants.14 
</p>
<p>33. After the war, administrative procedures were not facilitated by the Government to 
help returnees take possession of their agricultural land. Most returnees had to initiate long 
and expensive court procedures in order to establish possession of their land. In Zadar, a 
solution was found to solve the issue of illegally occupied land, most of which has now

illegally occupied land in the Dalmatian hinterland.15 
</p>
<p>34. While repossession of agricultural land for registered owners is on the way, the 
problem of bona fide land owners who had not registered their land in the period prior to 
the conflict remains unresolved. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to housing of vulnerable groups and minorities in 
Croatia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The situation of refugees, internally displaced persons and returnees 
</b></p>
<p>35. Croatia faces a challenge in providing adequate and sustainable housing for the 
refugees and IDPs living within its borders. The total number of refugees living in Croatia 
is estimated to be 1,087, of which 809 are from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 255 are from 
Serbia/Kosovo.16 Meanwhile, the number of IDPs living in Croatia is estimated to be 2,246; 
among these about two thirds are ethnic Serbs residing in the Croatian Danube Region.17 
Over the past three years, the number of displaced people has remained fairly steady 
indicating that the remaining IDPs have been unable to find durable solutions.18 
</p>
<p><b>  Barriers to return and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>36. Returnees and IDPs face several barriers to return including the poor economic 
climate, and the slow (and initially discriminatory) implementation of legislation in areas 
such as property repossession, housing care, reconstruction and access to citizenship. This 
is exacerbated by the lack of access to utilities and services, the deficient integration of 
minority returnees, the complexity of the legal framework, and the discriminatory 
employment practices against minority returnees due to weak enforcement of Constitutional 
Laws protecting minorities at the local level.19  
</p>
<p>37. Access to adequate housing has been one of the major obstacles to the return of the 
refugees and displaced persons. Those most affected were former OTR holders of former 
socially owned apartments who have lost their occupancy rights and have applied to the 
housing care programme; owners of private property allocated for temporary use to 
displaced Croats and to Croat settlers; and owners of war damaged residential houses, who 
applied for State reconstruction assistance.20  
</p>
<p><b>  Reconstruction and reparation of war-damaged houses 
</b></p>
<p>38. The 1991-1995 armed conflict had a profound impact on the housing situation in 
Croatia. The war had a devastating impact on 49 out of the 102 former municipalities (48 
per cent) and an estimated 195,000 housing units were destroyed during the war.

<p>39. In the second half of the 1990s, Croatian housing policy was aimed at remedying the 
housing damage caused by the war through the renovation of housing and finding 
accommodation for war victims. However, the combined effect of these regulations had 
been widely regarded, both nationally and internationally, as being discriminatory against 
the ethnic Serbian minority. Initially, ethnic Croats benefited primarily from the 
reconstruction of houses, and only in 2003, once the reconstruction of houses belonging to 
ethnic Croats had been largely completed, did Croatian Serbs become the main 
beneficiaries of assistance. Amendments to the Reconstruction Act in 2000 removed much 
of the discriminatory character, and provided a more standard practice for processing 
reconstruction requests through the provision of clearer procedural rules. Reparation for 
damage or compensation in lieu of reconstruction were also provided to claimants.  
</p>
<p>40. By 2010, the Government has reconstructed 147,259 of the 195,000 housing units 
destroyed during the war.21 Some 95 per cent of the reconstruction work has been funded 
by the State. According to data provided by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), two thirds of the 147,259 houses rebuilt to this day 
belong to ethnic Croats. However, since 2002, about 80 per cent of the reconstruction 
beneficiaries have been ethnic Serb applicants. Despite the progress made since then, 
particularly in the last two years, and the accelerated speed of addressing the reconstruction 
complaints resulting from first-instance rejections, some concerns have been raised over the 
high number of negative decisions on reconstruction passed on weak legal grounds.22 
UNHCR states that 6,<footnote name="70">. A similar situation was witnessed by the Special Rapporteur with regard to Croat 
settlers in war-affected areas. Ethnic Croats who arrived to Croatia escaping from the war 
in neighbouring countries, received support from the Government to find accommodation 
in Croatia, as well as a residency permit or Croatian citizenship. Most settlers have been 
offered housing units, plots or building material to establish their residence in areas of 
special State concern. Although the quality of the housing units in which settlers reside is 
usually good, their living situation has also become unsustainable due to the lack of 
economic activity and sources of income in these economically depressed areas. Most 
families are dependent solely on social assistance provided by the Government, as 
unemployment is high, land is inaccessible and often unfertile, and businesses cannot be 
conducted in their places of residence due to legal restrictions as protected lessees. In 
addition, most residences are located in areas far from essential services such as health-care 
facilities and schools. 
</footnote>0 claims for reconstruction of damaged and destroyed housing are 
still pending in the appeal instance to be adjudicated, and that more than 2,<footnote name="42">. The return and settlement in areas of special State concern was facilitated through 
different housing models such as renting of a State-owned residential property; renting a 
State-owned damaged house and awarding construction material; donation of a State-
owned plot of land and construction materials to build a house; donation of material for 
reparation or reconstruction of a damaged family owned house or on a family-owned plot; 
donation of State-owned plot and materials to build an apartment in a building; and 
</footnote>3 positive 
decisions are awaiting implementation.23 Although the Government had a goal of 
completing the renovations by 2009, the reconstruction of homes has slowed down. Most of 
these cases were expected to be resolved during 2010, subject to the availability of funds. 
</p>
<p><b>  Housing care programmes  
</b></p>
<p>41. Faced with international pressure to solve the housing problems of returnees and 
IDPs, in 2000 the Government of Croatia adopted a set of measures to provide housing to 
former OTR holders wishing to return. In particular, two Housing Care Programmes were 
implemented. Regulated by the 2000/2002 Law on Areas of Special State Concern, the first 
programme was addressed to beneficiaries, including former OTR holders in war-affected 
areas, denoted as &#8220;areas of special State concern&#8221;. The second programme was adopted in 
2003 to respond to housing problems of former OTR holders outside areas of special State 
concern and provides State-owned housing units to those who want to return and settle 
permanently in Croatia through the payment of a monthly lease or an agreement to re-
purchase their flats. A new Law on Areas of Special State Concern was adopted in 2008 
encouraging the return of the population who lived in war-affected areas as well as the 
settlement of Croatian citizens of professions that can contribute to economic and social 
development of these areas.

</p>
<p>donation of a State-owned residence. To apply for one of these housing models, applicants 
should not own another residential property or have donated, sold or exchanged a housing 
unit after October 1991, or have been convicted for crimes against humanity or criminal 
acts during the war. 
</p>
<p>43. Concerning regions outside of the areas of special State concern, the application 
deadline for applicants to the Housing Care Programme closed in 2005. In order to ensure 
the effectiveness of this programme, the Government extended the deadline several times 
(the initial deadline was 31 December 2004) and an information campaign on the return 
possibilities was organized, but these measures were not sufficient and many Serb returnees 
could not benefit from this programme. Similarly, in the regions outside of areas of special 
State concern, the option to purchase the apartment in which families reside was not 
available at the time the mission took place. On 2 September 2010, the Government 
adopted a decision on the buy-off option of State-owned flats. This decision recognizes the 
purchasing option for former OTR holders and Housing Care Programme residents, 
including discounts according to the years of displacement. The Special Rapporteur 
considers this as an overall positive development on the issue provided that the 
implementation procedures are simplified and that no deadline to the application for flat 
purchasing are imposed to OTRs.  
</p>
<p>44. According to UNHCR, by June 2010 the total number of applications for the 
Housing Care Programme was 13,817, within and outside areas of special concern, of 
which 7,<footnote name="45">. At the end of the war, 19,280 properties were illegally occupied. For many years, 
those properties remained in the possession of the illegal occupiers and the original owners 
could not return to their place of residence. The Croatian restitution programme for 
abandoned private property started very slowly in the immediate post war period, but 
gained momentum in the new millennium. 
</footnote>6 have been positively resolved; 3,323 are pending in first-instance procedures, 
and 3,038 have been rejected.24 Sixty-three (63) per cent of the applications for the Housing 
Care Programmes have been filed by Croatian Serbs. Of the total number of applications 
that received positive decisions, 62 per cent were issued to Croatian Serb refugees, while of 
the total number of pending applications, 61 per cent were filed by Croatian Serbs and 69 
per cent of final negative decisions concerned ethnic Serbs.

<p><b>  Regional efforts to promote the re-integration of remaining refugees 
</b></p>
<p>48. Currently there are more than 70,000 refugees from Croatia in neighbouring 
countries, more than 60,000 of them in Serbia.27 Due to the unresolved housing situation, 
the lack of economic activity and employment, the obstacles to integration and the number 
of years gone by since their departure, return is no longer a realistic alternative for many of 
them. This outstanding issue represents a major challenge not only for Croatia but also for 
the rest of the countries in the region.  
</p>
<p>49. Concerning the housing situation of refugees, an Agreement on Succession Issues 
was signed by the five successor States of the former Yugoslavia in April 2001. Annex G to  
the agreement stresses that dwelling rights shall be applied equally to all persons who were 
citizens of the former Yugoslavia. The agreement also provides for the recognition, 
protection and restoration of the rights to immovable property located in successor States, 
as well as for compensation where the State was unable to realize such rights. Furthermore, 
it establishes that purported transfers of rights concluded under duress during the war were 
void.  
</p>
<p>50. Subsequently, the Regional Ministerial Declaration was signed in Sarajevo on 31 
January 2005 providing a framework for &#8220;just and durable solutions to the refugee and IDP 
situation&#8221;. The signatories committed to solving the remaining displacement by the end of 
2006, to facilitate returns or local integration of refugees and IDPs in their countries 
without discrimination and in accordance with the individual decisions of those concerned, 
and to provide assistance and support to refugees and IDPs in cooperation with UNHCR, 
the European Union and OSCE. Despite these efforts, there are still 116,<footnote name="6">8. In fertile areas, agriculture has provided alternative means of subsistence. However, 
access to land has proven difficult for those families who lost possession of their lands, due 
to absence during the war or the lack of titling records. In these circumstances, return has 
become an almost impossible task. In the face of rampant unemployment in these regions, 
most returnees are entirely dependant on social assistance provided by the Government.

</p>
<p><b> B. The situation of Roma people 
</b></p>
<p>51. A particular issue of concern in Croatia today is the housing situation of Roma 
people. According to the 2001 census, there are 9,500 Roma persons in Croatia, although 
official estimates place them at 30,000 and 40,000 persons, which make them the second-
largest minority in the country.29 Roma people in Croatia face different forms of 
discrimination and often do not enjoy the full range of fundamental rights due to their lack 
of clear legal status such as citizenship or legal residence.30 Some Roma families have been 
residing in the country for decades without receiving legal recognition. In addition, during 
the war, Roma families from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo came to Croatia without 
any documents facing similar problems concerning their legal status. The lack of 
documentation presupposes numerous difficulties in their access to housing and basic 
infrastructure and services. 
</p>
<p>52. Roma families in Croatia live mainly in urban areas, often in informal settlements 
without ownership titles or permits for building their houses.31 Many Roma settlements are 
not recognized by the municipal authorities, as houses built on socially owned land are 
considered to be illegal. Without formal legal protection, the informal settlements of Roma 
are excluded from essential social services and infrastructure, and are an easy target for

</p>
<p>criminal attacks.32 Due to the lack of property titling, Roma have also been often excluded 
from the programmes for reconstruction and repossession of their pre-war homes.  
</p>
<p>53. Roma families usually endure hardship with respect to their housing situation. Their 
settlements are often poorly developed and have insufficient access to basic infrastructure 
such as roads, sewerage systems or septic tanks, sanitation and running water. Although 
electricity is more commonly provided, its lack has also been reported in numerous 
settlements. Most dwellings do not meet the minimum building standards and are often 
overpopulated. Families in Roma settlements live in houses and apartments but also in 
shacks, abandoned cabins, barracks and board huts. The standard space in Roma 
households is very low. With an average 10 to 35 square metres of space and 6 persons per 
house, Roma usually live in substandard accommodation, and are also usually affected by 
the lack of access to public subsidies and loans that would allow them to improve their 
housing conditions.33 
</p>
<p>54. Roma settlements are often marginalized in the spatial distribution of the 
communities in which they live, as a result of discrimination and imposed ghettoization. 
Moreover, most Roma settlements are placed at long distances from schools, health-care 
centres, employment opportunities and sources of livelihood. This isolation entails 
substantial distress to their daily lives, a further deterioration of their living conditions and a 
clear obstacle to their enjoyment of most economic, social and cultural rights. While there 
have been efforts to include Roma representatives in consultation, decision-making and 
monitoring processes, solutions to the housing situation of Roma do not usually include the 
participation of affected families to incorporate their needs and opinions and have tended to 
marginalize the communities even more.34  
</p>
<p>55. In October 2003, the Government of Croatia adopted the &#8220;National Programme for 
Roma&#8221; aiming at eradicating discrimination against Roma, improving their living 
conditions, and achieving their full integration into society. The programme provides for 
the possibility of recognition of informal settlements on State-owned land through sale, 
cession without payments, and permission to use. In settlements where no legalization of 
buildings is possible, alternative housing solutions are considered and, where possible, 
adopted in accordance with the National Programme for the Roma and the Action Plan of 
Inclusion, Decade 2005-2015. Concerns have been raised about the insufficient 
implementation of this programme and its lack of prioritization in the national budget.35  
even if the funds allocated from the State budget have significantly increased since 2005. In 
May 2005, the Government of Croatia adopted a 10-year Action Plan for Roma Inclusion, 
under the overall administration of the Croatian Office for National Minorities. Amongst 
other objectives, the action plan aims at ensuring equal access to housing for Roma.36 
Concerning its implementation, the Government reported that as part of the framework 
provided by the Action Plan, 12 counties have developed spatial plans for areas inhabited

Parag settlement in Medimurje, the largest in Croatia, the process of legalization of houses 
and connection to infrastructure is in its final stages.37   
</p>
<p>56. In Roma settlements, the Special Rapporteur has witnessed some of the worst living 
conditions in the country. Despite the adoption of national programmes addressed to Roma 
people, it remains to be seen to what extent they can help improve the housing conditions of 
this community as a whole. While some improvements have been shown in certain formal 
Roma settlements, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the degrading 
housing and living conditions witnessed in settlements which receive no recognition or 
support from the Government and where families are living in unhealthy and degrading 
conditions, without electricity, running water, roads or sewerage systems. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The situation of young people, homeless persons and low-income 
families 
</b></p>
<p>57. Young people&#8217;s access to adequate housing is closely related to problems of 
unemployment. In Croatia, young people have difficulty in acquiring economic 
independence from their parents and accessing financial resources to provide themselves 
accommodation. Many of those who have good employment and are economically 
independent, do not have enough resources to purchase a home. Although measures were 
adopted by local and State governments to subsidize housing and provide tax benefit for 
young people to purchase their first home, only a small number of young people can 
actually afford to buy a home.38 
</p>
<p>58. As in many other transitional countries, a new form of homelessness has emerged as 
a result of privatization, deregulation, market insecurity and higher unemployment rates. 
The transition is from a situation of stability in employment and residence, to current trends 
where many people now live in insecure housing situations and could or have ended up 
living in shelters for homeless people or on the streets. According to information provided 
by UNDP, there are five homeless shelters in Croatia, two in Zagreb, two in Split and one 
in Osijek. In addition, homeless persons are accommodated in churches and monasteries, 
social welfare institutions and medical facilities. While the existing capacity is not 
problematic for accommodating the homeless population, reports indicate that the quality 
and the hygiene of the shelters are inadequate.39 
</p>
<p>59. Families in vulnerable economic situations are affected by the &#8220;commoditization&#8221; of 
the housing sector, the lack of available social housing and more recently by the 
consequences of the economic crisis. Moreover, while social welfare mechanisms offer 
monthly financial support to cover some of the basic needs of low-income families; on 
many occasions the excessive costs of utilities account for most of the family&#8217;s monthly 
payments. Families are thus faced with the choice of not satisfying their basic needs or not 
paying their utilities expenses, which in turn leads them into a vicious circle of debt.

</p>
<p><b> V. Affordability and social housing 
</b></p>
<p>60. As part of a comprehensive housing reforms in the 1990s, part of which has already 
been described, housing contributions for employed people were cancelled alongside the 
role of employers in providing for the housing needs of employees. The State, which used 
to have a vital responsibility in assisting the population in meeting its housing needs, 
withdrew from the housing sector through deregulation, liberalization and privatization. 
Alongside denationalization and the sale of State-owned apartments to their occupants, the 
State also adopted a policy of selling the public rental housing stock. This measure entailed 
a reduction in the availability of social housing for vulnerable groups and their reduced 
share in the overall housing stock. Moreover, the new market-oriented paradigm put into 
question any plans for constructing any sort of publicly owned housing.40  
</p>
<p>61. The combination of these changes in the housing sector entailed a substantial change 
in the housing tenure structure, with 82 per cent of private ownership and social housing 
representing only a 2.9 per cent of the housing stock.41 
</p>
<p>62. The privatization of housing, the increased investment in private construction and 
the insufficient investments in social housing drastically affected the capacity of low-
income and vulnerable households to access an apartment. More recently, the economic 
crisis affected affordability in most social sectors and represented a further impediment in 
people&#8217;s capacity to access a home.  
</p>
<p>63. Besides the programmes of housing provision and reconstruction for persons 
affected by the war, most current housing programmes are intended for middle class 
families and are aimed for the most part at supporting households purchasing their first 
house. In 2001, the Government implemented a State-subsidized housing construction 
programme to help families buy their first housing. The programme entails the construction 
of residential buildings to be sold on better conditions than in the real-estate market.42 The 
Government reports that 4,863 apartments were built as part of the social housing 
construction programme since 2000 across Croatia. Subsequently in 2003, a tax benefit of 5 
percent and tax incentives for families purchasing their first house were also introduced.  
</p>
<p>64. With respect to social rental housing, no programme seems to exist at the national 
level. Instead, local authorities have responsibilities over this issue to which they dedicate a 
marginal part of their local social programmes. Moreover, after the economic and financial 
crisis of 2008, which affected the sale of apartments in the real-state market, the prospects 
for public investment in social housing seem grimmer. A trend that the Government has 
recently started to explore is that of public-private partnership in the development of 
housing. However, the results of this approach have been limited to date, given the excess 
in the supply of apartments. 
</p>
<p>65. The construction boom combined with the economic crises and lack of affordability 
entailed an excess in the supply of apartments not matched by the demand in the real-estate 
market. According to the Croatian Chamber of Commerce, at the end of 1999 there were 
2,315 unsold apartments in Croatia. This situation encouraged the Government to adopt the 
Act on Stimulating the Sale of Apartments in March 2010 (<i>Official Gazette</i> No. 38/2010).

<p><b> VI. Access to employment, sources of livelihood and basic 
infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>66. In connection to the reconstruction and reparation of houses of IDPs and refugees, a 
problem has emerged whereby some of the rebuilt and allocated apartments remain empty 
as the families who benefited from reconstruction and housing care programmes decide not 
to return to the area were the residence is located. This is due to the lack of economic 
activity and sources of income in former war-affected areas, and the difficulties for 
reintegrating into the local community, sometimes still marked by ethnic tensions.  
</p>
<p>67. Indeed, uneven regional development has been a continuous obstacle to the return of 
refugees and IDPs who had fled war devastated areas, and had come back many years later 
to find themselves in an economically depressed region with very limited opportunities to 
earn a living. War-affected areas have the highest number of returnees lagging behind in the 
country. As a result of the war and the transition, most State-owned industries and 
enterprises were dismantled, particularly in Croatia&#8217;s hinterland. The economic activity in 
most of these areas dramatically decreased, affecting employment and sources of 
livelihood. In most cases, public employment is the sole source of income. However, it is 
alleged that at the local level, ethnic Serbs are often excluded from public employment, 
which reduces even more their possibilities to find employment.

</p>
<p><b> VII. Participation, right to information and accountability  
</b></p>
<p>72. Cumbersome and complex administrative procedures and regulations have resulted 
in slow, non-transparent and unaccountable processes for adjudication and decisions 
concerning access to housing. On the one hand, numerous regulations and programmes 
concerning the possession of housing and land have been adopted since the beginning of 
the transition and the war, which overlap and obstruct their effective use. On the other 
hand, the implementation of these regulations and programmes has been unclear, arbitrary 
and discriminatory. The lack of transparency and accountability and the overlapping 
bureaucratic channels have made it difficult to predict the likely outcome of applications 
and obstructed people&#8217;s right to information and to an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>73. The right to information is further hampered by the lack of available and reliable 
official data and statistics concerning the housing situation in Croatia. Throughout her 
mission, the Special Rapporteur has found numerous obstacles to getting access to clear and 
reliable official data and statistics concerning the main factors affecting the right to 
adequate housing in Croatia. 
</p>
<p>74. The level of consultation and participation of the affected population in the 
processes aimed at addressing their housing problems and needs it has been insufficient, 
particularly as far as dispossessed OTR holders, minority groups, returnees, IDPs, refugees 
and settlers are concerned. This has affected the overall implementation of the adopted 
regulations and programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts of the Government of Croatia 
to respond to the housing challenges brought about by the armed conflict of 1991-
1995, as well as the quantity and quality of the housing stock built and reconstructed 
in the country under different programmes. Nonetheless, she points out several 
drawbacks in the measures adopted by the Government in the context of the 
transition and post-conflict recovery. The process is still to be completed.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>While significant achievements have been made in the reconstruction and 
restitution of houses after the armed conflict, numerous cases remain unresolved 
either because there was a negative decision or because the decision is still pending. 
During her mission, the Special Rapporteur encountered on numerous occasions 
problems created by cumbersome and complex administrative procedures and 
regulations, which have resulted in a slow, non-transparent and un-accountable 
processes. The superposition of laws, regulations and bylaws as well as the imposition 
of unfeasible requirements (especially taking into account the difficulties of accessing 
documents in post conflict situation and the existence of outdated land registries in 
many regions) opened the ground for the adoption of discretionary decisions and 
different solutions for those with equal housing rights in the socialist and pre-war 
period. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>One of the most striking examples concerns the right of former occupancy 
tenancy rights holders to stay in their apartments and buy them at rates similar to  
others. While a great number of occupancy tenant rights (OTR) holders were able to 
buy them under favourable conditions, those OTR holders residing in privately owned 
houses or in military dwellings, were prevented from doing the same.</b>44<b> In addition, 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>more than one third of the applications for the different programmes offered over 
time had been rejected, leading to 793 appeals out of which 103 are still pending. 
Numerous persons were not able to submit their documented application within the 
tight deadlines, especially outside the areas of special State concern. For this reason, 
the process is not completed yet.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>To close this chapter of Croatia&#8217;s past and to be able to open a new era of 
adequate housing for all, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the 
Government of Croatia accelerate the implementation of the Housing Care 
Programmes for former OTR holders; further expedite the process of issuing first-
instance and appeal decisions on reconstruction applications; and consider reopening 
the processes of application for programmes which provide durable housing solutions, 
to all applicants who missed the 2005 deadline.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 2 September 2010 Decision on the buy-
off option for State-owned flats, which recognizes the purchasing option in the regions 
outside of areas of special State concern, for former OTR holders and Housing Care 
Programme residents. In this context, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to simplify the implementation procedures of this decision and not to put any deadline 
to the application for flat purchasing. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to define and unify 
tenure arrangements applicable to those with similar housing rights from the outset, 
including the possibility to purchase under favourable conditions the houses in which 
they reside. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made in the repossession of 
illegally occupied properties, and expects the few remaining open cases to be resolved 
in the near future. In cases in which damaged houses at the time of the repossession 
were in worse conditions than indicated in early assessments, the relevant central or 
local authorities should authorize the repair of the excess damage.  Were returnees to 
make repairs to their homes themselves, financial compensation should be provided 
where appropriate proof of expenditures is available. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The process of repossession of agricultural land needs to be completed, 
including the situation of bona-fide owners who never registered their land in official 
records. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take measures to resolve 
the remaining cases of illegal occupation of agricultural land that had been 
temporarily abandoned by its original owners during the war.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The improvement of social and economic life in areas of return is vital for the 
effective integration of returnees. Return will continue to be slow and the isolation of 
returnees will persist until measures are adopted to respond to the socio-economic 
challenges experienced by returnees in their place of residence. The Special 
Rapporteur urges national and local authorities to work together to improve the 
efforts undertaken to provide such areas with basic infrastructure, including 
electricity, water supply networks and road conditions. Central authorities must 
ensure sufficient political and financial support for the reconstruction of basic services 
and infrastructure networks. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government further develop 
its strategy to respond to the housing needs of former OTR holder returnees living in

<p>  
option to purchase, with applied discounts, to former OTR holders who had apartments, but under 
lease or rental agreements. The decree does not apply to categories mentioned in the paragraph 76. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>the areas of special State concern. Measures need to be adopted to provide sources of 
income and promote the effective integration of minority returnees to local 
communities. In this context, the Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to 
accelerate the implementation of its June 2010 Revised Action Plan for the 
Implementation of the Housing Care Programme within and outside the areas of 
Special State Concerns for the Refugees-Former Tenancy Right Holders wishing to 
return to Croatia  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In order to improve the living conditions of minority returnees, strategies to 
improve their employment and representation in public institutions should also be 
adopted by the Government. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the 
Government carry out investigations and maintain statistics on discrimination in the 
access to employment in these institutions. The Government should also collect 
information on the number of refugees who have lost their occupancy tenancy rights; 
those who wish or do not wish to return; those who benefitted from housing assistance 
or still in need of it and the number of available former OTR houses. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Since the 1990s, some 70,000 Croatian citizens have been refugees residing in 
neighbouring countries, and amongst them, more than 60,000 are in Serbia. While it 
appears that the majority of the remaining refugees do not intend to return, the full 
integration of refugees whether in the country of asylum or in the country of origin is 
essential to resolve this outstanding issue. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to continue the concerted efforts undertaken with other Governments in 
the region to remove all obstacles impeding definitive and just solution of the refugee 
issue. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Legal and practical mechanisms should be adopted to enable the sustainable 
return of refugees to the country of origin or settling in the place of destination, 
particularly through the provision of permanent housing for those living in poor 
housing conditions, in temporary accommodation or in collective centres. In addition 
to the ongoing housing assistance programmes, the Government should establish a 
comprehensive settlement mechanism with respective authorities in the region for a 
fair and just solution for former OTR holders who will not return or cannot benefit 
from the housing programmes.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur exhorts international agencies, including financial 
institutions, to be partners in these efforts. Coherence amongst the policies and actions 
of these agencies and institutions is necessary to make it possible for the Croatian 
Government to significantly contribute to the provision of adequate durable housing 
solutions, especially in a context were the Government is indebted and requested to 
pay back the loans used for its reconstruction, as well as to cut back on public 
expenditures.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>To face the present and upcoming housing challenges, the Government of 
Croatia must adopt comprehensive housing policies, to be implemented without 
discrimination and addressed particularly to vulnerable groups, including Roma 
communities. Adequate housing cannot be treated as a sectoral issue without 
considering the overall conditions of economic development, access to employment 
and sources of livelihood and essential social infrastructure.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Recovery in areas affected by the conflict, especially those in poor regions of the 
country, also require a holistic strategy, including economic and social policies as well 
as a significant investment in a culture of non-discrimination, peace and tolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>While most of the efforts adopted by the Government of Croatia in recent years 
sought to solve the problems of the past, Croatia also needs to face the challenges of its 
present and of its future. After the transition to a privatized housing sector, the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impact of the economic situation and of unemployment on the housing 
conditions of vulnerable groups (including Roma communities, homeless people, low-
income families and young people) has become more evident. Since the private 
housing market cannot offer an adequate housing solution for the entire population, 
the housing situation of vulnerable and marginalized groups will require particular 
attention and the adoption of durable and permanent public housing policies, which 
currently do not exist at the national level.
