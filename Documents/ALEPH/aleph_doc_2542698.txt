REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors
Dynadapt System, Inc.
Wheat Ridge, CO
We have  reviewed the  accompanying  balance sheet of Dynadapt  System,  Inc. (A
Development  Stage  Company)  as of July 31,  2005  and  2004,  and the  related
statements of operations for the three-month period ended July 31, 2005 and 2004
and for the period April 30, 1998  (inception)  to July 31, 2005, and cash flows
for the three-months  ended July 31, 2005 and 2004 and the period April 30, 1998
(inception)  to July  31,2005  to  include in the  accompanying  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  Form  10-QSB for the period  ended  July 31,  2005.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted  our review in  accordance  with  standards  of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) . A review of  interim  financial
information consists principally of applying analytical  procedures to financial
data and making  inquiries of persons  responsible  for financial and accounting
matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance
with standards of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight Board, the objective
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material  modifications that should
be made to the  accompanying  financial  statements for them to be in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We have  previously  audited,  in accordance with auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United  States,  the balance  sheet of April 30,  2005,  and the
related  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for the
year then ended (not presented herein). In our report dated October 11, 2005, we
expressed an unqualified opinion of those financial statements.  In our opinion,
the information set forth in the accompanying  balance sheet as of July 31, 2005
is fairly stated in all material  respects in relation to the balance sheet from
which it has been derived.
The accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared  assuming the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, conditions exist which
raised  substantial  doubt  about the  Company's  ability to continue as a going
concern unless it is able to generate  sufficient cash flows to meet obligations
and sustain its  operations.  Management's  plans in regard to these matters are
also  described  in  Note  2.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                          (A Development Stage Company)
                          Note to Financial Statements
                                  July 31, 2005
                                   (Unaudited)
Note 1 - Presentation of Interim Information:
In the opinion of the management of Dynadapt System,  Inc. (A Development  Stage
Company),  the accompanying  unadudited  financial statements include all normal
adjustments  considered necessary to present fairly the financial position as of
July 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of operations for the three-months  ended
July 31, 2005 and 2004 and April 30, 1998 (inception) to July 31, 2005, and cash
flows for the  three-months  ended  July 31,  2005 and 2004 and  April 30,  1998
(inception) to July 31, 2005. Interim results are not necessarily  indicative of
results for a full year.
The  financial  statements  and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-QSB,
and do not  contain  certain  information  included  in  the  Company's  audited
financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005.
Note 2 - Going Concern:
The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The  Company is in the  development  stage and has not earned any  revenue  from
operations.  The  Company's  ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its  ability  to develop  additional  sources of capital or locate a merger
candidate  and  ultimately,  achieve  profitable  operations.  The  accompanying
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the
outcome of these uncertainties.  Management is seeking new capital to revitalize
the Company.

Cautionary and Forward Looking Statements
In  addition  to  statements  of  historical  fact,  this Form  10-QSB  contains

There is no assurance that the Company will be profitable, the Company
may not be able to successfully develop, manage or market its products and
services, the Company may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives
and technology personnel, the Company's products and services may become
obsolete, government regulation may hinder the Company's business, additional
dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of
more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of warrants and stock
options, and other risks inherent in the Company's businesses.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof.
Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents the
Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  FOR THE QUARTER  ENDED JULY 31, 2005 COMPARED TO SAME
QUARTER IN 2004.
The  Company  had no  revenues  in the period in 2005 or 2004.  The Company
incurred no operations  expenses in the quarter in 2005 or in 2004.  The Company
had no loss in 2005 or in 2004 in the  quarter.  The loss per  share was none in
2005 and in 2004.
The trend of losses can be expected to continue for the foreseeable  future
as the Company attempts to commerce some business.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
The Company had no  cash as of July 31, 2005,  which is insufficient  for
any operations of significance.  Its current liabilities  exceeded its assets by
$20,875.  The  Company  will  need to raise  capital  through  loans or  private
placements  in order to carry  out any  operational  plan.  The  Company  has no
sources of such capital at this time.
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING
The Company does not have capital  sufficient  to meet the  Company's  cash
needs,   including  the  costs  of  compliance  with  the  continuing  reporting
requirements  of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. The Company will have to
seek  loans or equity  placements  to cover  such cash  needs.  In the event the
Company is able to complete a business  combination during this period,  lack of
its  existing  capital  may  be a  sufficient  impediment  to  prevent  it  from
accomplishing  the  goal of  completing  a  business  combination.  There  is no
assurance,  however,  that without funds it will ultimately  allow registrant to
carry out its business
<PAGE>
The  Company  will  need to raise  additional  funds  to  conduct  any  business
activities in the next twelve months.
No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management
or  other  stockholders.  Accordingly,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  any
additional  funds  will be  available  to the  Company  to allow it to cover its
expenses as they may be incurred.
Irrespective   of  whether  the  Company's  cash  assets  prove  to  be
inadequate to meet the Company's  operational  needs,  the Company might seek to
compensate providers of services by issuances of stock in lieu of cash.
"GOING CONCERN" QUALIFICATION
The Company's auditor has issued a "going concern" qualification as part of
his opinion in the Audit Report. There is substantial doubt about the ability of
the  Company to  continue as a "going  concern."  The  Company has no  business,
limited capital,  debt in excess of $20,875,  all of which is current, no cash,
nominal other assets, and no capital commitments. The effects of such conditions
could easily be to cause the Company's bankruptcy.
Management  hopes to develop its business  plan and will need,  at which to
seek and obtain funding, via loans or private placements of stock for operations
debt and to provide working capital.
Trends:  The company expects that the trend of no income and ongoing losses will
continue in the future until a business combination has been made which may
afford revenues and potential cash flows.  No assurance can be made that any
such combination will ever occur.

ITEM 3.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
a.       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  designed to ensure that  information
required to be  disclosed in the reports  filed or submitted  under the Exchange
Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported,  within the time period
specified  in the SEC's  rules and forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures
include,  without  limitation,  controls and procedures  designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act
is accumulated  and  communicated  to management,  including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  as appropriate,  to allow timely decisions
regarding  required  disclosure.  As of July 31, 2005 covered by this report,
the  Company  carried  out an  evaluation,  under the  supervision  and with the
participation  of  the  Company's  management,  including  the  Company's  Chief
Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer,  of the  effectiveness  of the
design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures.  Based
upon and as of the date of that  evaluation,  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and
Chief Financial  Officer  concluded that the Company's  disclosure  controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information  required to be disclosed in
the reports the Company  files and submits  under the  Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as and when required.
b.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the Company evaluation of these controls as of the
end of the period covered by this report that could have significantly affected
those controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation referred to in the
previous paragraph, including any correction action with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weakness.
