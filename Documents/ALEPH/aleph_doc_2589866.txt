TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST
NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the
financial position of Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) as of June 30, 2016 and the results
of its operations for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and its cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The financial statements and footnotes included herein should be read in
conjunction with the Trust’s annual financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014
and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2015 included in the
Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Beginning with
(1)
the second quarter of 2015, the Trust updated the format of the revenue section in the
Statements of Income and Total Comprehensive Income to provide more detail regarding
revenue sources.
(2)
We evaluate events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are,
or are available to be, issued to determine if a material event requires our amending the
financial statements or disclosing the event. We evaluated subsequent events through August
4, 2016, the date we issued these financial statements.
(3)
No value has been assigned to the land held by the Trust other than parcels which have been
acquired through foreclosure and a limited number of parcels which have been acquired
because they were offered for sale and were contiguous to parcels already owned by the
Trust. Consequently, no allowance for depletion is computed, and no charge to income is
made, with respect thereto, and no cost is deducted from the proceeds of the land sales in
computing gain or loss thereon.
(4)
The Sub-shares and the Certificates of Proprietary Interest are freely interchangeable in the
ratio of one Certificate of Proprietary Interest for 3,000 Sub-shares or 3,000 Sub-shares for one
Certificate of Proprietary Interest.
(5)
The Trust’s effective Federal income tax rate is less than the 35% statutory rate because
taxable income is reduced by statutory percentage depletion allowed on mineral royalty
income.
(6)
The results of operations for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
(7)
The Trust invests cash in excess of daily requirements primarily in bank deposit and savings
accounts and certificates of deposit with maturities of ninety days or less. Such investments
are deemed to be highly liquid debt instruments and classified as cash equivalents for
purposes of the statements of cash flows.
Supplemental cash flow information for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 is summarized as follows:
Income taxes paid $8,425,307  $12,386,479
2015
2016
4
(8)
ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes standards for the way public business enterprises
are to report information about operating segments. In accordance with ASC 280, the Trust
utilizes the management approach as a basis for identifying reportable segments. The
management approach is based on the way that management organizes the segments within
the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Trust’s
management views its operations as one segment and believes the only significant activity is
managing the land which was conveyed to the Trust in 1888 and any other land thereafter
acquired. The Trust’s management makes decisions about resource allocation and
performance assessment based on the same financial information presented in these financial
statements. Managing the land includes sales and leases of such land, and the retention of oil
and gas royalties.
(9)
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with
Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”). This ASU introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model
in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures
sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative
disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments,
and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period. The Trust is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have
on our financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-
02”). This ASU requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet, the assets and liabilities
arising from leases with terms of more than twelve months. This ASU also requires both
qualitative and quantitative disclosures sufficient to enable investors and other users of the
financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
these leases. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
(10)
including interim periods within that reporting period. The Trust is currently evaluating the
new guidance to determine the impact it will have on our financial statements.
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with (i) the factors
discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, (ii) the factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors,”
if any, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (iii) the Financial Statements, including
the Notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report.
Period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and
therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the Trust’s future performance.
Words or phrases such as “does not believe” and “believes”, or similar expressions,
when used in this Form 10-Q or other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Quarter
Ended June 30, 2015
Earnings per Sub-share certificate were $1.26 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to
$.90 for the second quarter of 2015. Total operating and investing revenues were
$16,196,110 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $11,795,134 for the second
quarter of 2015, an increase of 37.3%. This increase in revenue and earnings was due
primarily to increases in easements and sundry income and, to a lesser extent, oil and gas
royalty revenue.
5
Oil and gas royalty revenue was $6,866,702 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to
$5,699,594 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 20.5%. Oil royalty revenue was
$5,503,313 for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 28.6% from the second quarter of
2015 when oil royalty revenue was $4,279,109. Crude oil production subject to the Trust’s
royalty interest increased 68.2% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second
quarter of 2015. This increase in production was partially offset by a 23.5% decrease in the
average price per royalty barrel of crude oil during the second quarter of 2016 compared
to the second quarter of 2015. Gas royalty revenue was $1,363,389 for the second quarter
of 2016, a decrease of 4.0% from the second quarter of 2015 when gas royalty revenue was
$1,420,485. This decrease in gas royalty revenue resulted from a price decrease of 27.7%
in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, which was partially
offset by a volume increase of 32.6%.
No land sales occurred in the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2015, the
Trust sold approximately 320 acres for a total of $160,000, or approximately $500 per acre.
Easements and sundry income was $9,198,970 for the second quarter of 2016, an increase
of 58.5% compared to the second quarter of 2015 when easements and sundry income
was $5,802,945. This increase resulted primarily from increases in pipeline easement
income, sundry income and, to a lesser extent, seismic permit income. The Trust is
currently moving toward the use of term easements (in lieu of perpetual) which will require
us to gradually recognize the income for easements over the life of the agreement, in lieu
of recognizing it all at the beginning of the term of the easement. This was the primary
reason for the 123.9% increase in unearned revenue. This category of income is
unpredictable and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
Other income, including interest on investments, was $130,438 for the second quarter of
2016 compared to $132,595 for the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 1.6%. Grazing
lease income was $122,234 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $109,068 for the
second quarter of 2015, an increase of 12.1%. This increase is primarily attributable to a
delay in getting a lease renewed in the second quarter of 2015 due to a land sale. Interest
on notes receivable for the second quarter of 2016 was $2,360, a decrease of 85.5%
compared to the second quarter of 2015 when interest on notes receivable was $16,268.
This decrease is primarily due to principal prepayments received on notes due to the
Trust. As of June 30, 2016, notes receivable for land sales were $111,781 compared to
$850,672 at June 30, 2015, a decrease of 86.9%. Interest income earned from investments
was $5,844 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $7,259 for the second quarter of
2015, a decrease of 19.5%. Interest on investments is affected by such variables as cash
on hand for investment and the rate of interest on short-term investments.
Taxes, other than income taxes, were $394,217 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to
$342,302 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 15.2%. This increase is primarily
attributable to an increase in oil production taxes which resulted from the increase in oil
royalty revenue discussed above.
General and administrative expenses were $698,423 for the second quarter of 2016
compared to $503,799 for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 38.6%. This increase
was primarily due to an ongoing project to enhance the information systems of the Trust
and, to a lesser extent, increases in non-recurring legal fees and employment expenses.
Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six
Months Ended June 30, 2015
Earnings per Sub-share certificate were $2.16 for the first six months of 2016, compared to
$3.58 for the first six months of 2015. Total operating and investing revenues were
$28,094,213 for the first six months of 2016 compared to $46,534,487 for the first six
months of 2015, a decrease of 39.6%. This decrease in revenue and earnings was due
primarily to decreases in land sales, which were partially offset by an increase in
easements and sundry income and gas royalty revenue.
6
Oil and gas royalty revenue was $12,477,453 for the first six months of 2016, compared to
$12,224,859 for the first six months of 2015, an increase of 2.1%. Oil royalty revenue was
$9,445,507 for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 0.7% from the first six months of
2015 when oil royalty revenue was $9,512,694. Crude oil production subject to the Trust’s
royalty interest increased 51.1% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six
months of 2015. This increase in production was offset by a 34.3% decrease in the average
price per royalty barrel of crude oil during the first six months of 2016 compared to the first
six months of 2015. Gas royalty revenue was $3,031,946 for the first six months of 2016, an
increase of 11.8% from the first six months of 2015 when gas royalty revenue was
$2,712,165. This increase in gas royalty revenue resulted from a volume increase of 43.7%
in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, which was partially
offset by a price decrease of 22.4%.
During the first six months of 2016, the Trust sold approximately 8.56 acres of land for a
total of $86,000, or approximately $10,047 per acre. In the first six months of 2015, the Trust
sold approximately 20,632 acres for a total of $20,428,000, or approximately $990 per acre.
Easements and sundry income was $15,269,943 for the first six months of 2016, an
increase of 12.2% compared to the first six months of 2015 when easements and sundry
income was $13,605,939. This increase resulted primarily from increases in sundry
income, sundry lease rental income, and seismic permit income. The Trust is currently
moving toward the use of term easements (in lieu of perpetual) which will require us to
gradually recognize the income for easements over the life of the agreement, in lieu of
recognizing it all at the beginning of the term of the easement. This was the primary reason
for the 123.9% increase in unearned revenue. This category of income is unpredictable
and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
Other income, including interest on investments, was $260,817 for the first six months of
2016 compared to $275,689 for the first six months of 2015, a decrease of 5.4%. Grazing
lease income was $244,309 for the first six months of 2016, compared to $229,042 for the
first six months of 2015, an increase of 6.7%. This increase is primarily attributable to a
delay in getting a lease renewed in the second quarter of 2015 due to a land sale. Interest
on notes receivable for the first six months of 2016 was $4,723, a decrease of 85.6%
compared to the first six months of 2015 when interest on notes receivable was $32,695.
This decrease is primarily due to principal prepayments received on notes due to the
Trust. As of June 30, 2016, notes receivable for land sales were $111,781 compared to
$850,672 at June 30, 2015, a decrease of 86.9%. Interest income earned from investments
was $11,785 for the first six months of 2016, compared to $13,952 for the first six months of
2015, a decrease of 15.5%. Interest on investments is affected by such variables as cash
on hand for investment and the rate of interest on short-term investments.
Taxes, other than income taxes, were $740,801 for the first six months of 2016 compared
to $718,580 for the first six months of 2015, an increase of 3.1%. This increase is primarily
attributable to an increase in gas production taxes which resulted from the increase in gas
royalty revenue discussed above.
General and administrative expenses were $1,447,528 for the first six months of 2016
compared to $1,111,263 for the first six months of 2015, an increase of 30.3%. This
increase was primarily due to an ongoing project to enhance the information systems of
the Trust and, to a lesser extent, an increase in non-recurring legal fees and employment
expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Trust’s principal sources of liquidity are revenues from oil and gas royalties,
easements and sundry income, and land sales. In the past, those sources have generated
more than adequate amounts of cash to meet the Trust’s needs and, in the opinion of
management, should continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes in the information related to market risk of the Trust
since December 31, 2015.

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures
Pursuant to Rule 13a-15, management of the Trust under the supervision and with the
participation of David M. Peterson, the Trust’s Chief Executive Officer, and Robert J.
Packer, the Trust’s Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the Trust’s fiscal quarter covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that
evaluation, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Packer concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the
Trust required to be included in the Trust’s periodic SEC filings.
There have been no changes in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting during
the Trust’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.
