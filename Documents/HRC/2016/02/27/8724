</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This is the first thematic report submitted to the Human Rights Council by Rashida 
Manjoo, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, since 
her appointment in June 2009. In addition to providing an overview of the main activities 
carried out by the Special Rapporteur, the report focuses on the topic of reparations to 
women who have been subjected to violence in contexts of both peace and post-conflict. 
 Most human rights and humanitarian law treaties provide for a right to a remedy. In 
the context of gross and systematic violations of human rights, the Basic Principles and 
Guidelines on the Right to Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of 
International Human Rights Law and serious violations of International Humanitarian Law, 
adopted by the General Assembly in 2005, start with the premise that &#8220;the State is 
responsible for ensuring that victims of human rights violations enjoy an individual right to 
reparation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Both the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women place upon the 
State the duty to prevent, investigate, punish and provide compensation for all acts of 
violence wherever they occur. Article 4 of the Declaration states that women who are 
subjected to violence should be informed about and provided with access to the 
mechanisms of justice and to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have 
suffered, as provided by national legislation. The obligation to provide adequate reparations 
involves ensuring the rights of women to access both criminal and civil remedies and the 
establishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation services for survivors of 
violence. The notion of reparation may also include elements of restorative justice and the 
need to address the pre-existing inequalities, injustices, prejudices and biases or other 
societal perceptions and practices that enabled violations to occur, including discrimination

</p>
<p> However, as pointed out by the previous Special Rapporteur, when it comes to the 
implementation of the due diligence obligation to reparation, &#8220;very little information is 
available regarding State obligations to provide adequate reparations for acts of violence 
against women &#8230; this aspect of due diligence remains grossly underdeveloped&#8221;.1

Section II.B analyses procedural and substantive considerations emerging in reparations 
initiatives responding to violence in conflict, post-conflict and authoritarian settings. 
Section II.C examines reparations to women and girls in contexts of &#8220;peace&#8221; or 
consolidated democracies, by looking first at discriminatory practices against certain 
groups of women, and second by highlighting recent landmark cases in the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the first thematic report submitted to the Human Rights Council, pursuant to 
Human Rights Council decision 1/102 and resolution 7/24, by the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, since her 
appointment in June 2009. Chapter I summarizes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities since 
her appointment until 20 March 2010. Chapter II discusses the topic of reparations to 
women that have been subjected to violence in contexts of both peace and post-conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur requested invitations to visit 
Somalia, the United States of America and Zimbabwe. Earlier requests for country visits 
had also been made to the Governments of Jordan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Kyrgyzstan from 9 to 16 November 2009 (the 
mission report is contained in A/HRC/14/22/Add.2) and El Salvador from 17 to 19 March 
2010 (A/HRC/14/22/Add.3). The Special Rapporteur would like to thank these 
Governments for having responded positively to her visit requests and urges those 
Governments that have not yet done so to provide a favourable response.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur sent 37 communications 
regarding human rights violations and received 17 responses from the concerned 
Governments (contained in A/HRC/14/22/Add.1). 
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur issued press statements, either individually or jointly with 
other mandate holders, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of 
Violence against Women on 25 November 2009, prior to the international United Nations 
Climate Change Conference on 4 December 2009 and on International Women&#8217;s Day on 8 
March 2010.  
</p>
<p><b> C. General Assembly and Commission on the Status of Women 
</b></p>
<p>6. In her oral statement to the Third Committee of the General Assembly, on 23 
October 2009, the Special Rapporteur outlined the thematic priorities for the next years &#8212; 
namely, reparations, prevention strategies, and multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms 
of discrimination &#8212; and expressed interest in strengthening cooperation with other 
international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>7. On 3 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur delivered an oral statement to the 
Commission on the Status of Women in which she presented the recent activities carried 
out by the mandate, and called for a new vision of women&#8217;s rights informed by the lessons 
learnt from the 15-year review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Joint report on the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>8. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/33, the Special Rapporteur 
contributed to the second joint report of seven United Nations experts on the situation in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council at 
its thirteenth session (A/HRC/13/63). The Special Rapporteur noted that limited progress 
has been made in implementing the recommendations of the previous joint report with 
regard to the protection of women&#8217;s human rights and the promotion of gender equality, 
and that violence against women remains rampant throughout the country, particularly in 
the East, where brutal sexual violence continues to be used as a weapon of war by all 
parties to the conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur actively engaged with civil society organizations through 
her participation in regional consultations. In November 2009, an Asia-Pacific regional 
consultation was held in Thailand and, in January 2010, the Special Rapporteur took part in 
the third African regional consultation in Zambia, which was followed by a national 
consultation. In March 2010, she attended the first Central American and Caribbean 
regional consultation, which took place in El Salvador. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur participated in several conferences and workshops at the 
invitation of civil society actors, including the KwaZulu Natal Network on Violence against 
Women, the African Network of Constitutional Lawyers, Masimanyane Women&#8217;s Support 
Centre, the International Center for Transitional Justice, Women Against Violence Europe, 
Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and the Global Campaign to Stop 
Killing and Stoning Women. She also participated in a number of conferences in Italy, 
hosted by Giuristi democratici, and took part in the international conference on violence 
against women, an important initiative of the Italian Presidency of the Group of 8. She also 
gave several speeches on violence against women at different universities in South Africa 
and the United States. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur also participated in the special event &#8220;Engaging 
philanthropy to promote gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment&#8221; of the Economic and 
Social Council in February 2010.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Reparations for women subjected to violence  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conceptual challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>12. The notion of a right to reparation is located within the framework of the law of 
remedies and includes two aspects: procedural and substantive. Procedurally, remedies are 
the processes by which arguable claims of wrongdoing are heard and decided by competent 
bodies, whether judicial or administrative. Substantively, remedies consist of the outcomes 
of the proceedings and, more broadly, the measures of redress granted to victims. The law 
of remedies can serve both individual and societal goals, the underlying purposes of which 
include corrective justice, deterrence, retribution and restorative justice. It is the element of </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>corrective justice focusing on fairness to the victim and redress measures aimed at 
&#8220;repairing&#8221; the wrongdoing that victims experience which will be the focus of this report.  
</p>
<p>13. Although a coherent theory and practice for remedies for victims of human rights 
violations does not yet exist under international law, the right of individuals to reparation 
for the violation of their human rights has been increasingly recognized. Affirmed initially 
as a principle of inter-State responsibility,2 since the Second World War a shift of focus can 
be observed to national arenas and away from international disputes. The legal basis for a 
right to a remedy and, linked to it, a right to reparation has since become firmly enshrined 
in the corpus of international human rights and humanitarian instruments.3  
</p>
<p>14. The content of the obligation to provide reparations to the individual whose rights 
have been violated remains, however, far from clear. When referring to the remedies 
ensuing after a violation of a right, all human rights treaties use rather vague language.4 
International human rights bodies that have jurisdiction to hear complaints often limit 
themselves to finding facts and issuing declaratory judgements or, at best, recommending 
that compensation of an unspecified amount be awarded to the claimants. More recently, 
however, in their observations to periodical country reports, the different human rights 
bodies have started to insist on the States&#8217; obligation to provide compensation and 
rehabilitation measures. Also, compensatory damages for both pecuniary and non-
pecuniary injury and other non-pecuniary remedies are frequently afforded by regional 
human rights courts.  
</p>
<p>15. A significant contribution to the normative framework on the obligation to provide 
reparations has emanated from the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (hereinafter, the Basic 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 See, generally, the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which includes references to reparations, in 
</p>
<p>particular restitution, and the conclusions of the wars of 1830 and 1870 and of the First World War. 
Reparations in the context of inter-State disputes are described in the draft articles of the International 
Law Commission on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See, among international instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 8), the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 2, para. 3), the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (art. 6), the Convention against Torture and 
other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (art. 14) and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (art. 39). Among regional human rights instruments, see the European Convention 
on Human Rights (art. 41) and the American Convention on Human Rights (art. 10). In international 
humanitarian law and international criminal law, see, in particular, the Hague Convention with 
Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land (art. 3), the Protocol Additional to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (art. 
91) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (arts. 68 and 75). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 For instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers in its article 8 to the right to &#8220;an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy&#8221;. The European Convention on Human Rights refers in its article 41 to the right to 
&#8220;just satisfaction&#8221; and only &#8220;if necessary&#8221;. Instruments making explicit reference to a right to 
compensation, reparation or satisfaction include the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention 
against Torture. The growing importance attached to reparations is best expressed by the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which calls upon States parties to take all appropriate 
measures to promote the physical, cognitive and psychological recovery, rehabilitation and social 
reintegration of persons with disabilities in an environment that fosters the health, welfare, self-
respect, dignity and autonomy of the person and takes into account gender- and age-specific needs. 
The American Convention on Human Rights comes closest to the recognition of enforceable 
individual reparations by enjoining the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to rule that remedies 
and fair compensation be paid to the injured party. </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Principles and Guidelines) adopted in 2005.5 They present themselves as grounded in the 
recognition of a right to remedy for victims of violations of international human rights law, 
as found in numerous international instruments of human rights and humanitarian law. The 
right to remedy is said to encompass victims&#8217; equal and effective access to justice and 
adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered. The Basic Principles and 
Guidelines emphasize that they do not entail new international or domestic legal 
obligations, but rather identify mechanisms, modalities, procedures and methods for 
existing legal obligations.   
</p>
<p>16. The Basic Principles and Guidelines define the contours of State responsibility for 
providing reparation to victims for acts or omissions which can be attributed to the State. 
States are responsible for their failures to meet their international obligations even when 
substantive breaches originate in the conduct of private persons, as States have to exercise 
due diligence to eliminate, reduce and mitigate the incidence of private discrimination.6 In 
cases where a person or other entity is found liable for reparation to a victim, such party 
should provide reparation. The State should endeavour to establish national programmes for 
reparation and other assistance to victims in the event that the parties liable for the harm are 
unable or unwilling to meet their obligations. The State shall enforce domestic judgements 
for reparations against individuals or entities liable for the harm suffered and endeavour to 
enforce valid foreign legal judgements for reparations.  
</p><p>17. The Basic Guidelines and Principles affirm that the modality of reparation must be 
proportional to the gravity of the violation and can include the following forms: restitution, 
as those measures to restore the victim to his/her original situation before the violation, 
including restoration of liberty, enjoyment of human rights, identity, family life and 
citizenship, return to one&#8217;s place of residence, restoration of employment and return of 
property; compensation for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and 
proportional to the gravity of the violation including physical or mental harm, lost 
opportunities including employment, education and social benefits, and material and moral 
damages; measures of rehabilitation, including medical and psychological care as well as 
legal and social services; measures of satisfaction including, among others, the verification 
of the facts and full and public disclosure of the truth, the search for the whereabouts of the 
disappeared, public apologies, judicial and administrative sanctions against persons liable 
for the violations, commemorations and tributes to the victims; and guarantees of non-
repetition, including measures which contribute to prevention such as ensuring effective 
civilian control of military and security forces, protecting human rights defenders, 
providing human rights education and reviewing and reforming laws contributing to or 
allowing gross violations of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>18. The quantitative and qualitative differences between individual and gross and 
systematic violations might affect the scope and nature of remedies that can and should be 
afforded. For one thing, the idea of full reparation is virtually impossible in contexts of

 See E/CN.4/2006/61. See also general recommendation No. 19 of the Committee on the Elimination

<p>of Discrimination against Women, recalling that the Convention calls on States parties to take all 
appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or 
enterprise, and that under general international law and specific human rights covenants, States may 
also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights 
or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing compensation. See also that

<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>gross and systematic violations characterized by large numbers of victims and perpetrators, 
weak Governments, fragile economies, scarce governmental resources and huge 
reconstruction and development challenges. In such contexts, remedies may have to be 
adjusted to achieve goals other than that of compensating each individual victim in 
proportion to harm, including prioritizing the recognition of victims and promoting 
interpersonal trust and trust in the institutions of the new State order.  
</p>
<p>19. It is important to draw a distinction between reparation measures and other 
rehabilitation measures. Sometimes, especially when the emphasis is placed on 
rehabilitation services as measures of redress, the line that divides reparation measures for 
gross violations from social assistance, humanitarian intervention measures and general 
development-oriented policies gets blurred.  
</p>
<p>20. Reparation measures express the obligation of the State to provide redress to victims 
when, by action or omission, it has infringed against their rights. Social policy and 
development measures are measures addressed at the entire population to ensure that each 
and every person can meaningfully enjoy all rights recognized by the State. They are 
inspired by notions of redistributive justice and should primarily target those sectors of the 
population which have traditionally been discriminated against and structurally 
disadvantaged, including women. Humanitarian intervention measures are measures of 
temporal assistance to victims of natural and human-made disasters, aimed at ensuring their 
subsistence, alleviating their suffering and protecting their dignity and basic rights during 
the crisis. They rest on basic notions of solidarity and the obligation of the State to protect 
rights but, unlike reparations, they are not remedial measures that express State 
responsibility for the violation of rights.  
</p>
<p>21. At the level of State practice, national Governments dealing with a legacy of 
systemic violations have been increasingly prone to supplementing the transitional justice 
mechanisms they put in place with the adoption of reparation initiatives and comprehensive 
reparation programmes for victims of human rights violations. Such programmes try to 
simplify a complex reality by selecting, among the violations that took place during the 
conflict or the repressive period, those that are considered most serious and distributing a 
set of benefits among victims and family members. Although they vary significantly, these 
programmes rarely reproduce the five categories of reparations set forth in the Basic 
Principles and Guidelines. Instead, they are mainly organized around the distinction 
between material and symbolic measures and modalities of distribution, including 
individual and collective distribution. Reparation programmes are also being used in 
consolidated democracies to try to provide redress for specific and systematic practices 
perpetrated and/or condoned by the State targeting certain groups of the population.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Bringing women into the reparations debate 
</b></p>
<p>22. Women are of course addressed in all the human rights and humanitarian law 
treaties that contemplate a right to a remedy. Unfortunately, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is not particularly explicit 
regarding women&#8217;s right to remedies, reparation or compensation. Article 2 (c) provides 
only that States parties undertake to ensure the effective protection of women against any 
act of discrimination through competent national tribunals and other public institutions. 
This contrasts with article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination which refers to the obligation of States to assure &#8220;adequate 
reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered as a result of such [racial] 
discrimination&#8221; and article 14 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which requires that States ensure that the victim of 
an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate 
compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.  </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>23. The obligation to provide reparations to women subjected to violence is much more 
clearly spelled out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which 
places upon the State the duty to develop penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in 
domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected 
to violence. The Declaration states that women who are subjected to violence should be 
provided with access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national 
legislation, to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, and that 
States should inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms 
(art. 4 (d)). In the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and 
Eradication of Violence against Women, it is envisaged that States must undertake to 
establish fair and effective legal procedures for women who have been subjected to 
violence and the necessary legal and administrative mechanisms to ensure that women 
subjected to violence have effective access to restitution, reparations or other just and 
effective remedies (art. 7 (f) and (g)). The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa expressly states that women who are 
subjected to violence through violations of their rights to life, integrity and security of 
person should have access to reparations including rehabilitation (art. 4) and obliges the 
State to create mechanisms to increase the participation of women in planning, formulation 
and implementation of post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation (art. 10). However, as 
pointed out by the previous Special Rapporteur, &#8220;very little information is available 
regarding State obligations to provide adequate reparations for acts of violence against 
women &#8230; this aspect of due diligence remains grossly underdeveloped&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>24. The little attention devoted to reparations, both at a substantive and procedural level, 
for women who suffer violence contrasts with the fact that women are often the target of 
both sex-specific and other forms of violence, not only in times of conflict but also in 
ordinary times. Women often bear the brunt of the consequences of violence that targets 
them, their partners and dependants. Given the disparate and differentiated impact that 
violence has on women and on different groups of women, there is a need for specific 
measures of redress in order to meet their specific needs and priorities. Since violence 
perpetrated against individual women generally feeds into patterns of pre-existing and often 
cross-cutting structural subordination and systemic marginalization, measures of redress 
need to link individual reparation and structural transformation. Additionally, women who 
experience violence have traditionally encountered obstacles to accessing the institutions 
that award reparations. 
</p>
<p>25. There are signs that the traditional neglect of women in the reparations domain, best 
exemplified by the largely unsuccessful movement for reparations for the so-called 
&#8220;comfort women&#8221;, is ending. The international legal response to violence against women 
over the past 15 years and the explicit recognition of violence against women as a human 
rights concern within the United Nations serve as indicators. Furthermore, the inroads of 
feminism in international criminal law, crystallizing in the inclusion of some forms of 
gender violence as war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, were accompanied by relevant discussions about how other 
transitional justice mechanisms, and not just criminal courts, could be rendered more 
inclusive to women. 
</p>
<p>26. More recently, there has been increasing progress in State practice in making sure 
that the mandates of truth and reconciliation commissions include the investigation of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
  See E/CN.4/2006/61, para. 55. Previously, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women had 
</p>
<p>already referred to the need for legal remedies for victims in the context of the permanent 
International Criminal Court, and to national mechanisms to provide redress for victims 
(E/CN.4/1998/54). </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>gender violence. To mainstream gender in their way of operating, they are holding thematic 
hearings devoted to female victims and ensuring that women&#8217;s experiences of the conflict 
are made visible in their reports and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Moreover, the notion of gender-sensitive reparations has finally moved beyond the 
transitional justice discussions at State level and for the first time made an inroad into the 
international human rights jurisprudence. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has 
recently affirmed the need to craft gender-sensitive reparations in its groundbreaking 
decision against Mexico.8 
</p>
<p>28. Academic reflection and civil society activism have certainly contributed to placing 
the question of gender-sensitive reparations on the national and international agenda. In the 
last few years, the first monographic volumes addressing reparations for women have been 
seen.9 Furthermore, feminist transnational movements working on fighting impunity against 
gender violence in armed conflict are now leading the debate on women and reparations. 
The Nairobi Declaration on Women&#8217;s and Girls&#8217; Right to a Remedy and Reparation 
adopted in 2007 by women&#8217;s rights advocates and activists and survivors of sexual violence 
in situations of conflict is the best expression of this transnational growing concern to 
provide women and girls with adequate reparations.10 Mobilization concerning reparations 
at the national level by victims&#8217; groups, human rights groups and women&#8217;s associations has 
also increased.  
</p>
<p>29. The importance of women&#8217;s participation in reparations discussions and processes 
cannot be overestimated. Without the participation of women and girls from different 
contexts, initiatives are more likely to reflect men&#8217;s experience of violence and their 
concerns, priorities and needs regarding redress. Additionally, without such participation, 
an opportunity is missed for victims to gain a sense of agency that may in itself be an 
important form of rehabilitation, especially when victims come to perceive themselves as 
actors of social change. Finally, such participation is important for women and society in 
general to draw the links between past and present forms of violence and seize the 
opportunity provided by reparations discussions to press for more structural reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Engendering reparations: the conceptual framework 
</b></p>
<p>30. As traditionally conceived, the remedy of reparation for the violation of a certain 
right required investigating certain facts to determine whether the violation had taken place; 
determining the harm ensuing from the violation; identifying responsibility for the 
violation; and determining measures of redress aimed at returning the victims to where they 
were before the violation took place. 
</p>
<p>31. With this scheme in mind and thinking about women as potential beneficiaries of 
reparations, the first hurdle relates to the fact that much of the violence that women and

<p>which they are subjected in the post-conflict scenario. Even in non-conflict scenarios, acts 
of violence against women are part of a larger system of gender hierarchy that can only be 
fully grasped when seen in the broader structural context. Therefore, adequate reparations 
for women cannot simply be about returning them to where they were before the individual 
instance of violence, but instead should strive to have a transformative potential. Reparations should aspire, to the extent possible, to subvert, instead of reinforce, pre-
existing structural inequality that may be at the root causes of the violence the women 
experience before, during and after the conflict. 
</p>
<p>32. Women-centred processes of reparations require participation of women in the 
process of shaping, implementing, monitoring and evaluating reparations programmes; 
design of a reparations procedure that renders it accessible to all women and girls; 
investigation of facts to determine whether certain violations of rights have taken place and 
making sure that those violations that target women and girls have been duly included; 
determination of harms, including those which are gender-specific or have a differential 
impact on women and girls; identification of responsibility for the violation, including by 
omission, and by those perpetrators that target women and girls; and determination of 
measures of redress aimed at returning the victim to where she was before the violation 
took place, except for when those measures may in themselves be discriminatory or fail to 
address the structural roots underlying the violence. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reparations for women subjected to violence in countries coming out of 
widespread conflict or authoritarian repression 
</b></p>
<p>33. Women and girls are victimized under authoritarian regimes and during violent 
conflict in multiple ways. They suffer from operations randomly or strategically targeting 
and terrorizing the civilian population, but also from summary and extrajudicial executions, 
imprisonment, torture, rape and sexual mutilations for fighting in resistance movements, 
engaging in the search for and defence of their loved ones or for coming from communities 
suspected of collaboration. Women and children represent the majority of the forcefully 
displaced in internal and international armed conflicts. Women can suffer the consequences 
of violent actions that target &#8220;their&#8221; men (husbands, sons, brothers, etc.), for example, when 
they become the sole breadwinners and protectors of their families. Some forms of violence 
that women are subject to are similar to those suffered by men; others are more specific to 
women and girls, subjecting them to systematic patterns of sexual or reproductive violence 
or to different forms of domestic enslavement. In some settings, certain crimes tend to be 
perpetrated mostly by State forces while others are used mostly by non-State armed groups 
or self-defence groups as tools to recruit and instrumentalize women. More importantly, 
even when women are subjected to the same violations as men, their pre-existing socio-
economic and legal status and the cultural meanings surrounding the construction of the 
male and the female in patriarchal societies may cause different ensuing harms for men and 
women.  
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Procedural considerations: reaching women 
</b></p>
<p>34. Women&#8217;s access to meaningful reparations may depend more on the procedural 
hurdles they may encounter than on the content of reparation measures. National and 
international judicial institutions constitute the standard arena for remedial claims in 
societies dealing with both past and present violations. Such judicial institutions are 
normally motivated by the goal of providing victims with compensation in proportion to 
harm and are important because they can also catalyse the willingness of otherwise reticent 
Governments to establish massive reparations programmes.   </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>35. Judicial arenas for obtaining reparations are, however, riddled with difficulties. 
Procedural obstacles that victims of sexual violence have traditionally encountered in the 
judicial arena can amount to an experience of re-victimization, exposing women not only to 
psychological harm but also to reprisal, stigma and communal and family ostracism. 
Crucial here are both the evidentiary standards relied upon and the degree of confidentiality 
upheld during the reparations process.  
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, a judicial approach does not endorse forms of reparations that have the 
potential to challenge pre-existing gender hierarchies, including those that result in women 
holding less property than men, having lesser educational opportunities and, hence, less 
income-generating potential. While criminal and tort procedures may seek to apportion 
individual responsibility for moral and material harm and grant reparations to victims, they 
do not provide the proper framework for rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition, 
which may have the greatest transformative potential. Nevertheless, judicial institutions 
remain important arenas. 
</p>
<p>37. Therefore, in the context of mass violations, reparations are better located in 
administrative reparations schemes than by case-by-case judicial adjudications that seek 
compensation in proportion to harm. Administrative reparations programmes can obviate 
some of the difficulties and costs associated with litigation, including high expenses, the 
need to gather evidence which may sometimes be unavailable, the pain associated with 
cross-examination and the lack of trust in the judicial system. This may be particularly 
relevant for women in general and for victims of sexual violence in particular.  
</p>
<p>38. The administrative arena also enables a proactive approach to reaching victims and 
may provide a satisfactory platform for focusing on information about victims including 
their number, socio-economic profile, age, gender breakdown, family structures, the 
violations they have suffered or an account of the effects of the violations on their lives. 
This information is all relevant to understanding the structural component of the violations, 
the share of State responsibility by either action or omission and the gender-specific impact 
of the violence on women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; lives.  
</p>
<p>39. Another advantage of reparations programmes crafted through legislative or 
administrative schemes is that victims, victims&#8217; groups and civil society in general can be 
involved in the process in more proactive ways than judicial proceedings allow for. This not 
only facilitates access to the information needed for the proper design of a programme, but 
has in and of itself a reparative effect, by conveying a sense of agency. While this is true for 
all victims in general, it may be even more so for women, given that they ordinarily face 
more difficulties reaching the public sphere and interacting with the State.  
</p>
<p>40. The question of timing is also important in determining women&#8217;s access to 
reparations, especially for crimes of a sexual nature. Since the preconditions for reporting 
and testifying on sexual abuse are not always present in the aftermath of conflict or 
repression &#8212; especially in poverty-ridden scenarios where women&#8217;s health conditions are 
extremely poor &#8212; reparations programmes should not sacrifice adequate accessibility to the 
otherwise legitimately felt urgency of society to move forward. Narrow applications 
deadlines or a closed-list system may not allow different victims to come forward and claim 
reparations when they feel physically and psychologically prepared to do so.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Substantive considerations: understanding harm to women 
</b></p>
<p>41. Reparations programmes allow for the simplification, in a consistent manner, of a 
complex reality of mass and gross violations of human rights by relying more or less 
explicitly on a set of common elements, including: the definition of &#8220;victims&#8221; or the 
selection of the list of violations or crimes for which there will be reparations; the definition 
of &#8220;beneficiaries&#8221; as the group of persons who are eligible for the benefits to be distributed; </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>and the definition of benefits of both material and symbolic, individual and collective 
nature.   
</p>
<p><i> (a) Gender violence and the definition of victims 
</i>42. According to the Basic Principles and Guidelines, &#8220;victims are persons who 
individually or collectively suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional 
suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts 
or omissions that constitute gross violations of international human rights law, or serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. Where appropriate, and in accordance with 
domestic law, the term &#8216;victim&#8217; also includes the immediate family or dependants of the 
direct victim and persons who have suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in distress 
or to prevent victimization &#8230; A person shall be considered a victim regardless of whether 
the perpetrator of the violation is identified, apprehended, prosecuted, or convicted and 
regardless of the familial relationship between the perpetrator and the victim&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>43. In contexts of mass atrocity and multiple gross violations, the real challenge of 
reparations programmes is how to select the rights whose violation will trigger access to 
benefits and how to confine the circle of those who will qualify as beneficiaries. No 
programme to date has articulated the reasons to consider some violations worse than 
others, thus very rarely rendering reparations benefits to predominantly marginalized 
groups. The fairly limited but also traditionally conceived catalogue of violations of civil 
and political rights on which reparations programmes in the past have concentrated covers 
mostly those violations which are taken as paradigmatic expressions of political violence. 
Not surprisingly, these are the violations that in many scenarios target men 
disproportionately. Women have thus been excluded from reparations programmes, despite 
the terrible impact of violence on women, leaving them in a precarious position, with the 
responsibility for children and other dependants, without income-generating skills and 
subjected to stigma and poverty.   
</p><p>44. The current explicit inclusion of sexual violence in many reparations programmes is 
a victory against a tradition that minimizes its importance as collateral, private or non-
political damage. Nevertheless, the forms of sexual violence that are included are often 
limited in range and other forms of victimization with a disparate gender impact are also 
not included. Often excluded have been forms of reproductive violence (including forced 
abortions, sterilization or impregnations), domestic enslavement, forced &#8220;marital&#8221; unions, 
forced displacement, abduction and forced recruitment. Gross violations of social, 
economic and cultural rights have also been excluded, even when they result in the loss of 
health, life and death of culture, or when such violations are specifically related to 
systematic forms of discrimination, including based on sex, ethnicity or sexual orientation. 
Forced domestic labour, often taking the form of forced conscription or forced marriages, 
has also traditionally been left out. This tendency to include a narrow range of forms of 
sexual violence in such programmes runs the risk of sexualizing women, if it is not 
accompanied by a serious effort to encompass a broader notion of harm. 
</p>
<p>45. The inclusion of gross violations against women in the list of wrongdoings that will 
trigger reparations has to be underpinned by the notion that the same violations may entail 
different harms for men and women, but also for women and girls from cultural minorities. 
For instance, harms emanating from sexual violence &#8212; including the contraction of AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases, undesired pregnancies, complications due to often 
unsafe abortions, unwanted children, loss of reproductive capacity, fistulas and vaginal 
injuries, and multiple psychological disorders &#8212; are always compounded with social

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and ostracism by the family and/or community, subsequent emotional 
distress, loss of status and the possibility to marry or have a male protector, and access 
communal resources. None of the reparations programmes in the post-conflict or post-
authoritarian scenario has explicitly referred to forms of reproductive violence (such as 
forced impregnation, forced abortion or forced sterilization) as separate categories. Explicit 
recognition and visibility of various forms of violence and the ensuing harm is required for 
responsive reparation programmes.   
</p>
<p>46. Under many authoritarian regimes, and more so in situations of large-scale civil 
strife, violence is often perpetrated with the complicity of non-State actors, including 
foreign States, members of guerrillas, self-defence groups, corporations and ordinary 
citizens. Whereas some reparations programmes are embracing these forms of violence, the 
record of such programmes overall is still quite patchy.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Gender violence and the identification of beneficiaries 
</i>47. The definition of &#8220;victim&#8221; endorsed by the Basic Principles and Guidelines assumes 
that, although the violation of a right is a precondition for the right to reparation, the 
relationship between the right and the violation, for purposes of reparation, is mediated by 
the notion of harm. As a result, the potential rights holders include not only victims, but 
also others, such as close family members and dependants, who are affected or harmed as a 
consequence of the violation. This notion of victim that links rights and harms allows for 
the reflection that every gross violation generates a &#8220;community of harm&#8221; which impacts 
others to be reflected. Bringing the notion of harm to the fore can also allow victims to be 
prioritized according to the severity of the harm endured. Both expanding beneficiaries and 
prioritizing victims and beneficiaries according to harm can have important consequences 
for women. 
</p>
<p>48. There is a broader question regarding the concept of family that is embraced in 
reparations programmes. In this regard, polygamous unions, de facto unions, same-sex 
unions and more extensive culturally contingent support mechanisms, should be adequately 
represented to reflect the real web of dependencies and the harms entailed by their 
disruption.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Gender violence and reparation measures  
</i>49. Official apologies, pensions, educational opportunities, access to health and 
psychological rehabilitation services, individual payments and measures of collective 
reparations, including specific infrastructure reconstruction measures, are some ways in 
which reparations programmes attempt to help victims move forward. While some 
programmes may prioritize individual and material compensation through individual 
payments, others may place a greater emphasis on access to services and rehabilitation of 
both individuals and affected communities. Various programmes may rely more or less on 
symbolic and/or collective forms of reparations. Political priorities, but also the number of 
victims, the resources available and the existence of competing needs of the overall 
population will inevitably shape reparation policies. The following paragraphs will address 
various modalities of reparations.  
</p>
<p><i>  Restitution and compensation 
</i></p>
<p>50. Since women and girls who are subjected to gender violence, including sexual 
violence and forced unions, are often re-victimized in their families and communities, 
restitution of identity, family life and citizenship for them may require measures that target 
their wider communities &#8211; including attempts to subvert cultural understandings around the 
value of women&#8217;s purity and sexuality. Although some of the intangible assets that are 
often taken from victims of sexual violence, such as virginity or social standing, cannot be 
returned, all the tangible assets of which victims of sexual violence are commonly stripped </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>should be borne in mind. Communal and family ostracism, abandonment by spouses and 
partners and becoming unmarriageable or sick are all too commonly synonyms of material 
destitution, and the costs of ongoing medical treatment, pregnancy, abortions, and raising 
children resulting from rape, are all too real to deny. To date, no reparations programme has 
succeeded in fully reflecting the economic impact of raising children born of rape.  
</p>
<p>51. Restitution also covers restoration of employment. While several reparations 
programmes address the problem of civil servants who were deprived of their position 
because of their political views, no programme to date has adequately reflected on the fact 
that some dictatorships enacted legislation enforcing patriarchy, including rules that 
requested that women give up their employment at marriage.  
</p>
<p>52. Restitution measures may also encompass the recovery of lost property and place of 
residence. However, a broader problem related to gender and restitution of land and 
property lies in the fact that women are often discriminated against in ownership of land 
and property titles.  
</p>
<p>53. Often, when restitution of the infringed rights or lost good is not possible, 
reparations will try to compensate victims. Besides avoiding outright discrimination, 
reparations programmes that provide economic compensation to women should consider 
the formal and informal obstacles that different groups of women face in accessing and 
keeping money. These include difficulties in having a bank account and formal and 
informal pressure, including security threats, reprisal or ostracism by the family and the 
community. 
</p>
<p>54. Providing some form of material reparation to help victims rebuild their lives is of 
great importance, as the disruption of normalcy by large-scale violence or repression has 
especially deleterious effects on women&#8217;s material well-being. The reconstruction 
challenge entails special economic hardships for them, including providing for those 
survivors in need of care. In many societies, under either national or customary law, 
discrimination against women in the inheritance system increases significantly the 
difficulty for wives and daughters of victims receiving reparations. The discussion around 
women-centred economic compensation should also look into types of material benefits 
that, in certain settings, may help women pursue what they perceive to be autonomy-
enhancing life-projects, and may therefore be more transformative.  
</p>
<p><i>  Rehabilitation and reintegration 
</i></p>
<p>55. Because reparations are often discussed in situations of scarce resources, placing the 
emphasis on rehabilitation services rather than compensation payments may seem a 
tempting alternative, as it combines development and reparations concerns. In the aftermath 
of violence, women often think of material assistance in terms of rehabilitation and 
reintegration, thus prioritizing their basic needs and those of their family members. The 
kinds of basic goods and services that women ask for are typically those that they are 
disparately deprived of ordinarily and that they need most in situations where their family 
responsibilities increase. This poses an interesting dilemma, as it creates a risk of blurring 
the conceptual distinction between reparations benefits and social rights, services and 
development measures to which the general population is entitled. At the same time, 
however, in many real-case scenarios, the dire poverty and destitution of victims implies 
that those basic services are what victims will inevitably prioritize, especially when they 
have no good reason &#8212; judging by their experience &#8212; to expect that they will be able to 
access them on any other grounds.  
</p>
<p>56. Rehabilitation measures need to be tailored to respond to women&#8217;s specific needs. 
This may require an effort to overcome gender biases that might be entrenched in the 
existing national service system. One way to overcome such biases is to be as explicit and </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-13109 
</p>
<p>specific as possible in terms of the services to be provided. For instance, instead of 
recommending that victims of sexual violence have free or privileged access to medical and 
psychological assistance, reparations programmes should spell out which treatment victims 
of sexual violence need most. Rendering rehabilitation and reintegration meaningful to 
women to ensure that they can recover a sense of normalcy or functional life is both a 
gendered and a context-sensitive enterprise, as the notion of &#8220;psychosocial&#8221; rehabilitation 
suggests.  
</p>
<p>57. Reintegration and rehabilitation may also require adopting women-friendly forms of 
distribution of services and creating opportunities that were previously denied to victims, 
often on the grounds of sex, including through meaningful employment, education, skill 
training, access to land titles and initiatives such as microcredit to motivate economic 
entrepreneurship. Because the experience of conflict or political repression leads many 
women to become publicly and politically active for the first time in their lives, 
encouraging this agency, including by promoting women&#8217;s associations or political parties, 
could also be a way of rehabilitating women in a way that does not return them exclusively 
to their homes and family lives.  
</p>
<p><i>  Symbolic recognition 
</i></p>
<p>58. Symbolic reparation measures are designed as measures offering satisfaction that, by 
giving victims due recognition, can also facilitate a process of moral and social 
rehabilitation on an individual and collective level. Official apologies, commemorative 
events, renaming of streets and public facilities, establishing remembrance days, building 
monuments, museums and memorials may all help victims feel duly recognized.  
</p>
<p>59. Who apologizes, what for, where and how can all be relevant considerations in 
assessing whether women will get adequate symbolic redress. Given women&#8217;s 
predisposition to focus on the pain of their loved ones, it would be interesting to devise 
ways to duly recognize the individual dimension of such suffering and resilience. Personal 
letters of apology can be the best way of recognizing women when accompanied by public 
gestures of recognition. However, it is important not to forget that women and girls who 
carry the stigma of their victimization, such as victims of sexual violence, might have much 
to lose from public recognition of their victimization if they are named.  
</p>
<p>60. An increasing number of countries have adopted a variety of traditional/religious or 
community-based approaches for symbolic reparation and community reconciliation. They 
typically include community-level ceremonies and processes that &#8220;reconcile&#8221; or &#8220;cleanse&#8221; 
the perpetrator and victim and endeavour to restore collective harmony and rebuild broken 
relationships. These proceedings also often include some form of redress that the 
perpetrator agrees to give to the victim. However, there is a need to guard against 
assumptions about the inherent value of such procedures as, despite often being more 
accessible, they carry the risk of recreating the structures of control and prejudice that 
women, girls and other exploited groups are struggling to eliminate. 
</p>
<p>61. In addition to public apologies, public gestures of recognition often consist of 
measures to mark the conflict, the violence or the notion of reconstruction that accompanies 
a reparations and a reconstruction project. Such measures can be the shaping or reshaping 
of public space, building of monuments and museums, the changing of street names and 
other public spaces, etc. Little reflection has been given to exploring whether women are 
duly recognized through such measures or whether they might prefer different forms of 
representation and commemoration than those traditionally favoured by men.  </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Guarantees of non-repetition 
</i>62. Guarantees of non-repetition offer the greatest potential for transforming gender 
relations. In promising to ensure non-recurrence, such guarantees trigger a discussion about 
the underlying structural causes of the violence and their gendered manifestations and a 
discussion about the broader institutional or legal reforms that might be called for to ensure 
non-repetition. A gender-sensitive reparations programme should seize this opportunity to 
advance, as part of the venture of constructing a new and more inclusive democratic order, 
a society that overcomes the systemic subordination of women.  
</p>
<p>63. In the aftermath of violent conflict, when &#8220;normalcy&#8221; is restored, women are subject 
to new and sometimes higher levels of violence from men whom they know in the family 
and the community. Internalization of violent mechanisms of conflict resolution, 
accumulated and unresolved feelings of male impotence and frustration, male anxiety 
around the empowerment of women who have become politically visible during the conflict 
or simply the increased vulnerability of women may be some of the reasons that make 
women the targets of rising levels of violence after official peace or democracy has been 
declared. Reparations programmes that take place at one given point in time and inevitably 
look to the past have inherent limitations to address future violations. However, the type of 
guarantees of non-repetition can ground practical obligations on the part of the State to take 
into account the foreseeable short- and medium-term legacies of its violent past for women 
and, more specifically, adopt measures to avoid the exploitation of new forms of 
vulnerability.  
</p>
<p>64. Guarantees of non-repetition, if duly implemented, have the potential to detect the 
enabling conditions and long-term legacies of gender violence, and can therefore be a 
suitable platform for broader structural reforms for all women, not just victims, and hence 
for the construction of a more inclusive and gender-just political order. Furthermore, 
guarantees of non-repetition can help victims in the rehabilitation process, especially when 
they are involved and consulted in the process of formulating those guarantees.  
</p>
<p><i>  Women and collective reparations  
</i></p>
<p>65. Recently, the notion that reparations benefits can be distributed to collectivities has 
garnered interest and support. Both the Basic Principles and Guidelines and the updated set 
of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat 
impunity12 endorse the idea of collective reparations. However, the term &#8220;collective 
reparations&#8221; is ambiguous; &#8220;collective&#8221; is both used to qualify the &#8220;reparations&#8221;, i.e., the 
types of goods distributed or the mode of distributing them, and the &#8220;subject&#8221; who receives 
them, namely, collectivities, including ethnic or racial groups who might have been 
particularly targeted. Despite an increased interest in exploring collective forms of 
reparation, virtually no discussion is taking place on how this interest may intersect with 
interest in doing justice to women through reparations programmes.  
</p><p>66. A form of collective harm that deserves particular attention is group-based harm as a 
result of group-based affiliation. Collective measures of redress may be thought of as 
particularly apposite to address the legacy of violence on the identity or status of groups 
such as indigenous peoples. Women or children, however, are rarely thought of in 
collective terms, even though gender-specific and age-specific forms of violence happen to 
women and children precisely because they are women and children. Women and girls 
should not be rendered invisible under the notion of the collective and should be consulted 
at all stages of discussions.

</p>
<p><b> C. Reparations for women subjected to systemic violations in other 
contexts 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Looking to the past 
</b></p>
<p>67. In consolidated democracies, Governments are increasingly called upon to examine 
certain discriminatory practices perpetrated and/or condoned by the State which target 
certain groups of the population and to study the need for relevant reparations.  
</p>
<p>68. One example relates to forced sterilization programmes and the emergence of 
judicial awards of compensation. Many such sterilization policies were instituted in 
countries around the world, usually as part of eugenics programmes to prevent the 
reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of &#8220;defective genetic 
or social traits&#8221;. Women were sterilized without informed consent: several died from post-
surgery complications, while others faced health problems, psychological complications, 
unemployment and family isolation. More recently in certain countries, abusive practices in 
the implementation of sexual and reproductive health programmes as part of population 
control policies have led to systemic violations.  
</p>
<p>69. Despite a number of courts having ruled that such practices were a violation of both 
physical integrity and privacy of the women, judicial arenas for contesting forced 
sterilization and receiving compensation are fraught with difficulties. Women confronted 
with the traditional structural and administrative limitations in accessing justice, especially 
if they are poor or belong to minority or excluded groups, need to overcome specific 
obstacles when making claims to redress historical injustices. Often, financial 
compensation has been denied by ordinary courts because of such legal barriers as the 
statute of limitations. Furthermore, the focus has mostly been restricted to insufficient 
monetary compensation.  
</p>
<p>70. Another instance of discriminatory practices, resulting in historical injustices, is that 
of assimilation policies instituted in countries, which led to many aboriginal or indigenous 
children being taken away from their families, communities and cultures and placed in 
foster care or residential schools. There have been some initiatives to provide compensation 
to survivors, including monetary compensation, truth-telling, therapeutic services and acts 
of commemoration and reconciliation. However, gender differences have generally not 
been taken into account and, as a consequence, there has not been special recognition of or 
compensation for girls for consequences of sexual abuse, such as pregnancy resulting from 
rape or forced abortion. 
</p>
<p>71. The single most organized and well-documented movement for reparations for 
women is that for the so-called &#8220;comfort women&#8221;. Since the late 1980s, survivors have 
come forward to bear witness and mobilize international public opinion, asking for an 
official apology and reparation. Survivors have rejected financial aid gestures as inadequate 
and reiterated their desire for a formal apology and individual compensation through public 
funds rather than a welfare- or benevolence-type of assistance based on socio-economic 
needs. As victims of sexual crimes, they do not want to receive economic compensation 
without an official apology and official recognition of State responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Looking to the present 
</b></p>
<p>72. Women are subjected to grave forms of violence today, including in all democratic 
societies at the hands of both State and non-State actors: the large numbers of victims of 
sexual and domestic violence and exploitation in virtually every country demonstrate that 
this is still the case. States should reflect upon effective ways to compensate victims for 
harms suffered, including tort law, insurance, trust funds for victims and public 
compensation schemes.  </p>


<p>GE.10-13109 <b>19

<p>73. In many settings, for a tort claim to be initiated, financial means and a defendant 
who has money to pay for the damage are necessary. Other obstacles that women encounter 
when trying to obtain damages against perpetrators through courts include: statutes of 
limitations; inter-spousal and intrafamilial tort immunity rules; overly strict or inadequate 
rules and interpretations of the causality link in the assessment of harms; and inadequate 
evidence standards and procedures for quantifying damages which may have a negative 
disparate impact on women (such as limiting compensation to economic loss, setting caps 
on non-economic loss or measuring loss solely or primarily based on the loss of future 
earning capacity measured through statistical evaluation). Insurance schemes may not be 
effective either because basic coverage is usually restricted to compensatory damages &#8212; 
which often do not cover intentional torts or exempt claims against spouses &#8212; or because 
claims have to be brought during the term of the policy.  
</p>
<p>74. In Europe, States that have ratified the European Convention on the Compensation 
of Victims of Violent Crimes are obliged to provide compensation for victims and their 
dependants when such compensation cannot be fully obtained by other means and when the 
offender cannot be prosecuted or punished. The Convention does not include a specific 
gendered perspective of the crimes considered and only covers material damages and not 
non-economic loss. Since loss of earnings for women tends to be lower, leaving out non-
economic loss might affect women more negatively than men.  
</p>
<p>75. Some States, in their legislation and jurisprudence, and some regional human rights 
courts have started to recognize State responsibility for providing reparation to victims in 
cases of lack of due diligence, while other States have begun to endorse the categories of 
reparations of international human rights law. Others are compelling public officials to do 
more systematic research on the effects of violence against women and the efficiency of the 
measures to prevent and repair them.  
</p>
<p>76. At the international level, a groundbreaking development is introduced in the Statute 
of the International Criminal Court, in which it is provided that the Court may award 
reparations other than restitution to victims, namely, restitution, compensation and 
rehabilitation. In addition, the Rome Statute provides for the establishment of a trust fund 
for the benefit of victims of crimes and their families, within the jurisdiction of the Court. 
The Trust Fund provides for the possibility for victims and their families to receive 
assistance separate and prior to a conviction from the Court, through the use of resources 
raised through voluntary contributions. Since the Court has not awarded any reparations as 
yet, it is too early to assess the degree to which it has protected women&#8217;s right to 
reparations.

<p><i> (a) The Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</i>77. In November 2009 the Inter-American Court ruled in what will undoubtedly become 
a landmark case in the field of reparations for women: <i>Cotton Field v. Mexico</i>.13 This case 
concerns the abduction, killing and sexual violence of two minors and a young woman by 
non-State actors in 2003, and the subsequent failure of the State to diligently investigate, 
prosecute and punish the perpetrators and to treat the relatives of the deceased in a dignified 
way. The Court found that the State of Mexico violated the rights to life, freedom, personal 
integrity, access to justice and legal remedies and the right not to be discriminated against 
on the grounds of sex under the American Convention. It also considered that Mexico had 
infringed its obligations by failing to apply due diligence to prevent, investigate and impose 
penalties for violence against women or its duty to provide adequate responses in the legal 
system to punish and eradicate violence against women, thereby infringing the Inter-

<p>American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against 
Women. This decision is seminal in that it is the first time that the Court has embraced the 
concept of gender-sensitive reparations with a transformative aspiration. The State of 
Mexico has been mandated to provide a variety of reparation measures to the victims, 
including monetary compensation, symbolic redress, and a wide set of future looking 
guarantees of non-repetition. Family members and closely affiliated persons of the 
deceased who can be considered as having been harmed and hence deserving of reparations 
(who in this case included all those who had self-identified as injured parties including the 
mothers, sisters-in-laws and nieces of the deceased) received reparations. 
</p><p>78. The Court&#8217;s sensitivity in capturing the systemic nature of the problem of violence 
against women is also reflected in its reparations approach. It recognized for the first time 
that in a situation of structural discrimination reparations should aim at transforming such 
situation, thus aspiring not only to restitution but also to correction. The Court spelled out 
the criteria to be applied for the assessment of reparations, which include the following: (i) 
reparations should have a direct connection with the violations found by the Court; (ii) they 
should repair in a proportional manner pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages; (iii) they 
cannot be a source of enrichment or impoverishment; (iv) restitution is an aim but without 
breaching the principle of non-discrimination; (v) reparations should be &#8220;oriented to 
identify and eliminate the structural factors of discrimination&#8221;; (vi) they should take into 
account a gender perspective; and (vii) take into account all the measures alleged by the 
State to have been taken to repair the harm. Rather than remaining open-ended and with a 
view to ensuring the implementation of the decision, Mexico was ordered to report to the 
Court on the implementation of these guarantees of non-repetition for a period of three 
years on an annual basis. The Court also distinguished between the concepts of reparations, 
humanitarian assistance and social services by addressing and rejecting the claim of 
Mexico, which attempted to deduct from the reparations granted any monetary and housing 
assistance already provided to the family members. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) The European Court of Human Rights  
</i>79. The European Court&#8217;s case law has proven increasingly sensitive to the seriousness 
of violence against women, the importance of due diligence standards when it comes to 
framing State responsibility and the challenges surrounding evidence. The reparations 
framework traditionally embraced by the Court is rather narrow and has not allowed full 
recognition of the moral and material harm that women subjected to violence experience. 
No measures of satisfaction, symbolic recognition, rehabilitation or guarantees of non-
repetition have been granted and the treatment of pecuniary damages has been very narrow, 
as it requires high standards of proof and fails to include future expenses, even in cases 
where they are foreseeable. This approach does not reflect an understanding of either the 
true material harm following a violation, or its sex-specific dimension.  
</p>
<p>80. In the 2009 case of <i>Opuz v. Turkey</i>,14 the Court found Turkey in violation of its due 
diligence obligations to protect women from domestic violence and &#8212; for the first time &#8212; 
held that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination under the European Convention. 
The case was brought by Ms. Opuz who, along with her mother, suffered years of brutal 
violence at the hands of her husband. Despite their complaints, the police and prosecuting 
authorities did not adequately protect the women and, ultimately, Ms. Opuz&#8217;s mother was 
killed by the former husband. The Court found that there had been a violation of right to 
life with respect to the applicant&#8217;s mother, a violation of the prohibition of torture and of 
inhuman and degrading treatment on account of the authorities&#8217; failure to protect the

<p>applicant against her ex-husband&#8217;s violent and abusive behaviour and a violation of the 
prohibition of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>81. In <i>Opuz v. Turkey</i>, the Court awarded the applicant non-pecuniary damages for the 
anguish and distress suffered on account of the killing of her mother and the authorities&#8217; 
failure to undertake sufficient measures to prevent the domestic violence perpetrated by her 
husband and to give him deterrent punishment. It also awarded costs and expenses for the 
proceedings before the court, less the amount received by way of legal aid from the Council 
of Europe. The weaknesses in relation to reparations include: the Court&#8217;s dismissal of the 
claim of pecuniary damages which was based on the deprivation of economic support from 
her mother; the failure to treat the applicant as her mother&#8217;s successor; the failure to 
compensate the applicant for material harm ensuing from the violation of her right not to be 
subject to inhuman or degrading treatment by her husband; and the non-recognition of other 
forms of reparation and the lack of guarantees of non-repetition and forward-looking 
recommendations. By not linking the reforms required to avoid the broad problem of 
impunity with the concept of reparation, the Court missed the opportunity to suggest a 
broader agenda to deal with the structural problem of domestic violence. Because the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee of Ministers plays a crucial role guaranteeing the 
implementation of the judgments and, as such, is the body mandated to address structural 
problems (such as impunity or lack of effective investigations) in member States of the 
Council of Europe, it too can play an essential role in ensuring adequate reparations.

<p><b> D. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> This report shows how the legal bases for a right to a remedy have been 
increasingly recognized in the corpus of international human rights and humanitarian 
instruments. Although among victims of violence, women have been especially 
neglected, the report examines significant substantive and procedural trends to 
reverse this, both in the discussion and in the practice of reparations, at national and 
international levels.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Reparation measures should not concentrate on the fairly limited and 
traditionally conceived catalogue of violations of civil and political rights, but instead 
should include the worst forms of crimes or violations targeting women and girls. It 
must additionally be acknowledged that the same violations may entail different 
harms for men and women, but also for women and girls and women from specific 
groups, and that violations may be perpetrated with the complicity of non-State 
actors. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The limits of ordinary and extraordinary judicial proceedings to achieve the 
full and comprehensive realization of women&#8217;s right to reparations are also examined 
in the report. Against this backdrop, it is argued that gender-responsive 
administrative reparations schemes can obviate some of the difficulties and costs 
associated with litigation. The administrative arena also enables a more proactive 
approach to the involvement of a larger group of people, including victims, at all levels 
&#8212; from conceptualization of reparation schemes, to reaching victims, to 
understanding the structural component of the violations &#8212; including the share of 
State responsibility by either action or omission, and the gender-specific impact of the 
violence on women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; lives.</b>  
</p>
<p>85.<b> Reparations for women cannot be just about returning them to the situation in 
which they were found before the individual instance of violence, but instead should 
strive to have a transformative potential. This implies that reparations should aspire, 
to the extent possible, to subvert instead of reinforce pre-existing patterns of cross-
cutting structural subordination, gender hierarchies, systemic marginalization and </b></p>

<p><b>structural inequalities that may be at the root cause of the violence that women 
experience before, during and after the conflict. Complex schemes of reparations, 
such as those that provide a variety of types of benefits, can better address the needs 
of female beneficiaries in terms of transformative potential, both on a practical 
material level and in terms of their self-confidence and esteem. Measures of symbolic 
recognition can also be crucial. They can simultaneously address both the recognition 
of victims and the dismantling of patriarchal understandings that give meaning to the 
violations.
