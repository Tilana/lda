<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolution 
</p>
<p>68/156, in which the Assembly encouraged contributions to the Special Fund established by 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and requested the Secretary-General to report to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on the operations of the Special Fund. It complements the report of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General on the activities of the Special Fund, submitted to the Assembly at its 
</p>
<p>sixty-ninth session (A/69/289). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Special Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Fund was established pursuant to article 26 of the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>help to finance the implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee on 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</p>
<p>following a visit to a State party to the Optional Protocol, and to finance education 
</p>
<p>programmes of national preventive mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Fund receives voluntary earmarked contributions from Governments, 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other private or public entities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Management of the Special Fund  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Fund is administered by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with the Financial Regulations 
</p>
<p>and Rules of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Eligibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>5. Applications may be submitted by State institutions of States parties to the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol visited by the Subcommittee and that have agreed to the publication of the 
</p>
<p>Subcommittee report, and the national preventive mechanisms of the said States parties. 
</p>
<p>Applications may also be submitted by national human rights institutions compliant with 
</p>
<p>the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights (Paris Principles) and by non-governmental organizations if the proposed 
</p>
<p>projects are to be implemented in cooperation with eligible States parties and/or national 
</p>
<p>preventive mechanisms. Only applications relating to recommendations contained in visit 
</p>
<p>reports of the Subcommittee that have been published in accordance with article 16, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 2, of the Optional Protocol, and hence are no longer confidential, may be 
</p>
<p>considered. </p>


<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Fund 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. 2014 project cycle  
</b></p>
<p>6. The third call for applications to the Special Fund, for grants for projects to be 
</p>
<p>implemented in 2014, closed on 20 November 2013. For the call, specific thematic 
</p>
<p>priorities by State were identified by the Subcommittee at its nineteenth session, held in 
</p>
<p>Geneva from 18 to 22 February 2013.  
</p>
<p>7. In accordance with the guidelines for applications, the secretariat of the Special 
</p>
<p>Fund conducted an extensive evaluation of the 24 project proposals received by the 
</p>
<p>deadline in the light of the thematic priorities identified, taking into consideration the 
</p>
<p>outcome of informal consultations held with members of the Subcommittee. After review, 
</p>
<p>seven grants were awarded to projects aimed at implementing recommendations made by 
</p>
<p>the Subcommittee in six eligible States &#8212; Benin, Brazil, Honduras, Maldives, Mexico and 
</p>
<p>Paraguay &#8212; for a total of $198,108 (see annex). 
</p>
<p>8. Since its first call for applications for projects to be implemented in 2012, the Fund 
</p>
<p>has enabled a variety of technical cooperation projects worldwide, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>establishing or consolidating national prevention mechanisms on torture, training judiciary 
</p>
<p>and law enforcement personnel, and developing manuals and dissemination material on the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons in detention. Through its projects, the Fund has engaged with several 
</p>
<p>national entities, including ministries of the interior and justice, ombudsman institutions 
</p>
<p>and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Call for applications 2015  
</b></p>
<p>9. The call for applications for 2015 closed on 17 October 2014. For the call, the 
</p>
<p>Subcommittee, at its twenty-third session, held in Geneva from 2 to 6 June 2014, identified 
</p>
<p>specific thematic priorities by State. Projects addressing any other specific recommendation 
</p>
<p>in the visit reports detailing a pressing and compelling need may also be considered.  
</p>
<p>10. Applicants could request grants of up to $35,000 for project activities to be 
</p>
<p>implemented between 1 January and 31 December 2015.  
</p>
<p>11. A total of 34 applications were received concerning 10 of the 12 eligible States 
</p>
<p>(Argentina, Benin, Brazil, Germany, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Paraguay, Senegal 
</p>
<p>and Sweden). The evaluation process was under way at the time of reporting. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Special Fund 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Fund is the only functional fund established by an international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaty. Since its creation in 2012, and despite its limited income in voluntary 
</p>
<p>contributions, the Fund has supported a total of 21 projects in six States across three 
</p>
<p>regions, including the training of more than 1,000 people in torture prevention techniques 
</p>
<p>and methodology.  
</p>
<p>13. Fund activities should be commensurate with the growth of the activities of the 
</p>
<p>Subcommittee, which have resulted in an expanding number of States eligible for the Fund. 
</p>
<p>The minimum required on an annual basis to guarantee a functioning fund able to support 
</p>
<p>an average of 20 projects per year, with a reasonable level of funding per project (for </p>


<p>example, $35,000) would be around $1.4 million. The Fund, however, struggles to secure a 
</p>
<p>sustainable donor base. For activities to be implemented in 2015, the Fund has secured, in 
</p>
<p>2014, a total of only $228,878 (see table below). Consequently, the Fund will only be able 
</p>
<p>to fund seven or eight projects of $35,000 each to be implemented in 2015. More 
</p>
<p>worryingly, based on current trends, it is estimated that the Fund reserves accumulated over 
</p>
<p>the past three years will be entirely depleted by the end of 2015.

<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is 
</b></p>
<p><b>the only functional fund established by an international human rights treaty. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>increasingly affirming itself as a model for engagement between the United Nations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>State parties, national preventive mechanisms and civil society in the prevention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture. 
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>The minimum amount required on an annual basis to guarantee a functioning 
</b></p>
<p><b>Fund able to support an average of 20 projects per year, with a reasonable level of 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding per project (for example, $35,000), is approximately $1.4 million.
